# QFGN: A Quantum Approach to High-Fidelity Implicit Neural Representations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.19053
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19053
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Primary result:** Hybrid classical-quantum model achieving up to 5.6% PSNR and 1.5% SSIM improvement over SIREN in medical image representation.

## Executive Summary
QFGN introduces a hybrid classical-quantum model designed to overcome spectral bias in implicit neural representations, particularly for medical imaging tasks like image reconstruction and super-resolution. The model combines a classical Fourier-Gaussian Feature Scaling (FGFS) layer that penalizes low-frequency amplitudes with a quantum circuit that efficiently processes the enriched frequency spectrum. By addressing the tendency of classical neural networks to prioritize low-frequency details at the expense of high-frequency information, QFGN achieves superior fidelity in image representation while using fewer parameters than state-of-the-art classical models. The work demonstrates both theoretical advantages and practical performance gains, though hardware limitations remain a significant constraint.

## Method Summary
QFGN is a hybrid classical-quantum model that processes coordinate inputs through a two-stage pipeline. First, a classical FGFS layer projects inputs onto a Fourier basis and applies Gaussian scaling to balance the frequency spectrum by penalizing low-frequency amplitudes. This enriched input is then processed by an 8-qubit quantum circuit using a data re-uploading scheme with 16 encoding gates and 256 trainable parameters, which inherently possesses a Fourier series structure. The model outputs expectation values that are linearly mapped to signal intensities. Trained with MSE loss using Adam optimizer for 600 epochs, QFGN achieves high-fidelity image representations while maintaining parameter efficiency compared to classical alternatives.

## Key Results
- QFGN outperforms SIREN by up to 5.6% in PSNR and 1.5% in SSIM on medical image representation tasks.
- The model achieves superior performance with fewer parameters (585 vs 701 for SIREN), demonstrating quantum advantage in parameter efficiency.
- QFGN shows improved performance in image super-resolution tasks compared to classical baselines.
- The model maintains comparable accuracy to classical models even when implemented on noisy quantum hardware.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spectral Bias Mitigation
The FGFS layer addresses spectral bias by explicitly penalizing low-frequency amplitudes through Gaussian scaling. The classical preprocessor projects inputs onto a Fourier basis and applies a Gaussian multiplier that attenuates large-amplitude low-frequency components, balancing the frequency spectrum available to the quantum circuit. This ensures the quantum layer receives enriched frequency information rather than being dominated by smooth, low-frequency patterns.

### Mechanism 2: Quantum Circuit as Native Fourier Processor
The quantum circuit functions as an efficient function approximator because its mathematical structure is inherently a Fourier series through the data re-uploading scheme. By interleaving encoding gates and trainable blocks, the resulting expectation value resolves into a trigonometric sum, allowing the quantum circuit to fit complex signals more efficiently than classical MLPs that must approximate Fourier behavior.

### Mechanism 3: Nested Frequency Composition
The hybrid system bypasses quantum circuit limitations through classical pre-enrichment. The classical FGFS layer expands the frequency spectrum before quantum processing, allowing the quantum circuit to combine these frequencies into higher-order terms rather than generating base frequencies. This targets the frequency redundancy inherent in quantum circuits where different eigenvalue sums can produce identical frequencies.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Spectral Bias**
- **Why needed here:** This is the core failure mode QFGN is designed to fix. Without understanding that standard MLPs prefer smooth (low-frequency) solutions over sharp details, the motivation for the complex FGFS layer is lost.
- **Quick check question:** Why does a standard ReLU-based MLP often produce blurry reconstructions of medical images?

**Concept: Data Re-uploading**
- **Why needed here:** This is the structural backbone of the quantum circuit used. It explains how the model creates a "deep" Fourier series without requiring a physically deep (and error-prone) quantum hardware stack.
- **Quick check question:** How does the QFGN quantum circuit process input $x$ to create a Fourier series output?

**Concept: Hilbert Space & Eigenvalues**
- **Why needed here:** The paper anchors its "quantum advantage" in the ability of quantum states to span high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Understanding the link between encoding Hamiltonian eigenvalues and the resulting frequency spectrum is vital for tuning the model.
- **Quick check question:** In the context of this paper, what determines the specific frequencies available in the quantum model's output?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input $(x,y)$ -> FGFS layer (Fourier basis projection + Gaussian scaling + BatchNorm) -> 8-qubit quantum circuit (16 encoding gates + 256 trainable gates) -> Linear postprocessor -> Output intensity

**Critical path:** The Gaussian Scaling parameter $\gamma$ and the interface between classical feature scaling and quantum encoding gates are most critical for performance.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Gaussian parameter $\gamma$: Too high kills signal; too low fails to fix spectral bias
- Circuit Density: Dense circuits (256 trainable gates) provide accuracy in simulation but cause errors on older hardware and require specific error mitigation
- Classical vs. Quantum Split: Heavy frequency generation shifted to classical layer to save quantum resources

**Failure signatures:**
- Hardware Drift: On noisy devices, outputs fluctuate around zero (PSNR drops to 14dB)
- Error Mitigation Mismatch: Applying Dynamical Decoupling actually increased error (by 40%) because the dense circuit had no idle qubits to protect

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Spectral Ablation:** Run the model with Gaussian factor set to 1 (disabled). Compare high-frequency error maps against full QFGN to validate spectral bias claim.
2. **Parameter Efficiency Bench:** Compare QFGN (585 params) vs. SIREN (701 params) on high-frequency synthetic image (checkerboard) to stress-test quantum advantage.
3. **Noise Resilience Test:** Run inference on simulated noise models matching IBM-Kingston vs. IBM-Sherbrooke to correlate error rates with specific hardware metrics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can error mitigation strategies be systematically optimized for QFGN when standard techniques like dynamical decoupling were observed to increase error?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors note that mitigation techniques are "not always effective," specifically citing a 40.91% increase in MSE when using DD on dense circuits.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper tests various combinations but finds inconsistent results, suggesting the interaction between circuit density and suppression pulses is poorly understood in this context.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A rigorous study identifying specific circuit depth or gate density thresholds where DD transitions from beneficial to detrimental.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does QFGN retain its parameter efficiency and accuracy advantages when scaling to 3D volumetric medical data?
- **Basis in paper:** The experiments are limited to 2D images (32×32 and 64×64), despite the introduction emphasizing 3D modeling and memory-efficient volumetric scans as key applications for INRs.
- **Why unresolved:** While theory suggests exponential frequency growth with dimensionality, the impact of the "curse of dimensionality" on the hybrid model's trainability and noise resilience remains untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmark results on 3D datasets (e.g., MRIs) demonstrating that QFGN maintains superior PSNR/SSIM over classical baselines without requiring exponential parameter increases.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** To what extent is the reported performance gain attributable to the quantum circuit versus the classical Fourier-Gaussian feature scaling layer?
- **Basis in paper:** The model introduces a novel classical FGFS layer to penalize low frequencies before the quantum stage, but does not provide an ablation comparing the hybrid model against a classical FGFS+MLP baseline.
- **Why unresolved:** Without isolating the variable, it is unclear if the quantum circuit provides a functional advantage over a purely classical architecture equipped with the same FGFS preprocessing.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study showing the performance of the FGFS layer coupled with a standard MLP compared to the full hybrid QFGN.

## Limitations
- Quantum advantage claims are based on simulation results; real-device performance degrades significantly due to hardware noise.
- Key architectural details like the exact "Super-Parallel ansatz" gate arrangement and Fourier basis dimensions are underspecified, limiting exact reproduction.
- The Gaussian scaling mechanism depends on a fragile parameter balance that can suppress critical signal information if misconfigured.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** FGFS layer effectively mitigates spectral bias in simulation; Fourier-series structure of data re-uploading circuits is mathematically established.
- **Medium confidence:** QFGN outperforms classical SIREN in simulation with fewer parameters; quantum circuits can represent high-dimensional frequency spectra efficiently in principle.
- **Low confidence:** Quantum advantage is demonstrable on current NISQ hardware; nested Fourier composition mechanism provides consistent real-world gains.

## Next Checks
1. **Spectral Ablation:** Disable Gaussian scaling (set $\epsilon=1$) and compare high-frequency reconstruction error against full QFGN on synthetic high-frequency image to directly test spectral bias mitigation claim.
2. **Parameter Efficiency Stress Test:** Compare QFGN (585 params) vs. SIREN (701 params) on high-frequency synthetic data to validate quantum advantage in parameter efficiency under extreme conditions.
3. **Noise-Resilient Hardware Test:** Run QFGN on multiple quantum backends (IBM-Kingston vs. IBM-Sherbrooke) and correlate output quality (PSNR) with specific hardware metrics (T1/T2 times, gate fidelities) to quantify practical impact of quantum noise.
