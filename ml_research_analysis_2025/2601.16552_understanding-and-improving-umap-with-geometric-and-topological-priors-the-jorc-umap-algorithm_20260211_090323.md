# Understanding and Improving UMAP with Geometric and Topological Priors: The JORC-UMAP Algorithm

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.16552
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16552
- **Authors**: Xiaobin Li; Run Zhang
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: JORC-UMAP integrates Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Jaccard similarity to reduce manifold tearing and structural collapse in UMAP, improving visualization fidelity and downstream task accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses critical limitations in UMAP's k-nearest neighbor graph construction, which often fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry due to reliance on local Euclidean distances. This can lead to topological tearing (broken manifold structures) and structural collapse (loss of dimensionality). The authors propose JORC-UMAP, which incorporates geometric priors through Ollivier-Ricci curvature to reinforce edges at geometric bottlenecks and reduce redundant links, while using Jaccard similarity as a topological prior to filter noise-induced spurious connections. This dual-prior approach better distinguishes true manifold structure from noise, resulting in more faithful dimensionality reduction.

## Method Summary
JORC-UMAP enhances UMAP's neighbor graph construction by integrating two complementary priors. The geometric prior uses Ollivier-Ricci curvature to identify and reinforce edges at geometric bottlenecks, preventing manifold tearing by ensuring connectivity across narrow passages. The topological prior employs Jaccard similarity to filter out noise-induced spurious connections by measuring shared neighborhood overlap between points. These priors work synergistically: curvature provides geometric awareness while Jaccard similarity ensures topological consistency. The method modifies UMAP's edge weighting scheme to incorporate these priors, resulting in a more robust k-NN graph that better preserves the underlying manifold structure before proceeding with UMAP's standard low-dimensional embedding optimization.

## Key Results
- JORC-UMAP demonstrates reduced tearing and collapse compared to standard UMAP and other DR methods on synthetic and real-world datasets
- Improved SVM accuracy on MNIST (0.970 vs 0.967) and better triplet preservation scores
- Maintains computational efficiency while providing geometry-aware enhancements to UMAP
- Successfully distinguishes true manifold structure from noise-induced spurious connections

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
JORC-UMAP addresses fundamental weaknesses in UMAP's distance-based graph construction by incorporating domain knowledge about manifold geometry and topology. The Ollivier-Ricci curvature acts as a geometric prior that identifies regions where Euclidean distances fail to capture true manifold structure, particularly at bottlenecks where curvature indicates high geometric importance. By reinforcing these critical edges, the method prevents the tearing that occurs when manifold connections are lost. Simultaneously, Jaccard similarity serves as a topological prior that measures the overlap between point neighborhoods, effectively filtering out connections that appear close in Euclidean space but lack topological consistency. This dual-prior approach creates a more robust representation that balances geometric fidelity with topological accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Ollivier-Ricci curvature**: Measures how distances change when comparing neighborhoods between points; needed to identify geometric bottlenecks where manifold structure is most vulnerable to tearing. Quick check: Curvature values near zero indicate geodesic distances approximate Euclidean distances; negative values signal potential manifold tearing.
- **Jaccard similarity**: Quantifies shared neighborhood overlap between points; needed to distinguish genuine manifold connections from noise-induced spurious links. Quick check: High Jaccard values indicate strong topological consistency between points' neighborhoods.
- **Manifold topology preservation**: The goal of maintaining intrinsic manifold structure during dimensionality reduction; needed to ensure that reduced representations faithfully capture the original data's geometric and topological properties. Quick check: Preservation can be measured through connectivity patterns and local neighborhood relationships in reduced space.
- **k-NN graph construction**: The process of building a graph where nodes are connected to their k nearest neighbors; needed as the foundation for manifold learning algorithms. Quick check: Graph density and connectivity should reflect the underlying manifold's topology.
- **Dimensionality reduction challenges**: Issues like tearing (breaking manifold structure) and collapse (over-simplifying dimensionality); needed to understand why standard methods fail in certain scenarios. Quick check: Tearing manifests as disconnected components in reduced space; collapse appears as excessive clustering or dimensionality loss.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
k-NN graph construction -> Ollivier-Ricci curvature computation -> Jaccard similarity filtering -> Edge weight adjustment -> UMAP embedding optimization

**Critical Path:**
1. Compute initial k-NN graph using Euclidean distances
2. Calculate Ollivier-Ricci curvature for each edge to identify geometric bottlenecks
3. Compute Jaccard similarity for edge pairs to assess topological consistency
4. Adjust edge weights using both curvature and Jaccard measures
5. Apply modified graph to UMAP's embedding optimization

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Geometric prior (curvature) vs computational overhead: Curvature calculations add complexity but provide crucial geometric awareness
- Topological filtering (Jaccard) vs noise sensitivity: Filtering reduces noise impact but may remove genuine but weak connections
- Edge reinforcement vs sparsity: Balancing between preventing tearing and maintaining computational tractability

**Failure Signatures:**
- Excessive edge pruning leading to disconnected components
- Over-reinforcement creating artificial connections across true gaps
- Computational bottlenecks with very large or high-dimensional datasets
- Sensitivity to curvature estimation accuracy in noisy regions

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Compare JORC-UMAP against standard UMAP on synthetic datasets with known bottlenecks (e.g., Swiss roll with hole)
2. Evaluate performance on real-world image datasets with varying noise levels
3. Conduct ablation study isolating contributions of curvature vs Jaccard components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Performance improvements may not generalize beyond tested datasets
- Computational overhead from curvature and Jaccard calculations not quantified
- Effectiveness in highly complex or overlapping manifold scenarios remains unclear
- Limited ablation studies to isolate individual prior contributions

## Confidence

**Performance improvements over UMAP (High)**: Supported by quantitative results on multiple datasets including MNIST and synthetic benchmarks.

**Effectiveness of geometric and topological priors (Medium)**: Strong theoretical justification, but empirical validation across diverse scenarios is limited to specific dataset types.

**Computational efficiency (Low)**: Lack of detailed runtime analysis and benchmark comparisons weakens claims about maintaining efficiency.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct runtime benchmarks comparing JORC-UMAP with UMAP and other DR methods on datasets of varying sizes and dimensions
2. Test JORC-UMAP on datasets with highly overlapping or non-linear manifolds to assess robustness
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contributions of Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Jaccard similarity to overall performance
