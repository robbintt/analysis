# Federated Learning with Feedback Alignment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.12762
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12762
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** FLFA improves federated learning accuracy by up to 6.5% on BloodMNIST by using global model weights as shared feedback matrix during backpropagation.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses local drift in federated learning caused by non-IID data distribution across clients. The authors propose Federated Learning with Feedback Alignment (FLFA), which integrates feedback alignment into FL by using the global model's weights as a shared feedback matrix during local training's backward pass. This creates a unified backward pathway that aligns local updates with the global model without additional communication overhead. The method demonstrates consistent accuracy improvements across diverse FL methods, datasets, and challenging conditions while maintaining minimal computational overhead.

## Method Summary
FLFA integrates feedback alignment into federated learning by using the global model's weights as a shared feedback matrix during the backward pass. At the start of each round, clients receive the global model and set their feedback matrix B equal to the global weights. During backpropagation at selected layers, error signals are computed using B instead of local weights, creating a unified gradient pathway. The method includes adaptive scaling of B to match local weight norms and layer selection based on gradient cosine similarity to target the most divergent or aligned layers. This approach mitigates local drift without additional communication overhead.

## Key Results
- FLFA achieves up to 6.5% accuracy improvement on BloodMNIST compared to standard FedAvg
- Consistent performance gains across diverse datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-100) and methods (FedNova, FedProx, FedAvg)
- Eliminates local drift (H_BP - H_FLFA ≈ 0) while maintaining zero additional communication overhead
- Ablation studies confirm necessity of adaptive scaling and demonstrate superiority over random feedback matrices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Using global model weights as shared feedback matrix creates unified gradient pathway that mitigates local drift
- **Mechanism:** Replaces local weights (W^T) with global weights (W_global) in backward pass, anchoring all clients to common reference point
- **Core assumption:** Error signals via fixed global weights remain sufficiently informative despite forward-backward asymmetry
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states FLFA uses global weights as shared feedback matrix; Section 4.1 shows weight divergence term is eliminated when all clients use same B=W^r

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Adaptive scaling of feedback matrix maintains validity of feedback signal as local weights evolve
- **Mechanism:** Scales B such that ||B|| ≈ ||W_local|| to keep |1-α|||B|| small
- **Core assumption:** Local weight norms evolve similarly enough that scalar adjustment preserves directional benefits
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 4.1 explains adaptive scaling prevents feedback signal misalignment; Table 4 shows ablation without scaling reduces performance below baseline

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Applying feedback alignment to one critical layer propagates alignment effects through entire network
- **Mechanism:** Error signals propagate backward layer-by-layer; aligning at one layer implicitly regularizes preceding layers
- **Core assumption:** Cascading effect is strong enough that correcting drift at one point prevents divergence from compounding
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 4.3 states FLFA need not be applied to all layers due to cascading error signal propagation

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Feedback Alignment (FA)**
  - **Why needed here:** FLFA builds on FA, a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation that decouples forward weights (W) from backward feedback weights (B)
  - **Quick check question:** In standard Feedback Alignment, does the network learn to transpose the forward weights, or do the forward weights learn to align with the fixed random feedback?

- **Concept: Local Drift in FL**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the specific failure mode FLFA targets - occurs when local objectives pull models too far from global optimum due to data heterogeneity
  - **Quick check question:** Why does optimizing the local objective J_i(w) strictly using local data often hurt the global objective J(w) in non-IID settings?

- **Concept: Norm-Based Gradient Adjustment**
  - **Why needed here:** FLFA introduces normalization trick (scaling B) to balance magnitude of feedback signal
  - **Quick check question:** If local weights have norm of 0.5 and global feedback matrix has norm of 2.0, how does FLFA adjust the feedback matrix before using it for backward pass?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Server -> Global Model W_global -> Clients (w_i, B) -> FLFA Module -> Layer Selection -> Backward Pass Adjustment
- **Critical path:**
  1. Server distributes W_global
  2. Client sets B ← W_global for selected layer(s)
  3. Forward pass uses local w_i
  4. Backward pass at selected layer computes δ using scaled B
  5. Update local w_i using modified gradient
  6. Aggregate Δw_i to server

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Drift vs. Correctness: Using W_global (semantically meaningful) aligns clients better than random matrices, but introduces dependency on global model quality
  - Overhead: Zero communication overhead vs. minimal compute overhead for norm calculations
  - Layer Selection: "Lowest similarity" targets bottlenecks, "highest similarity" reinforces stability; paper suggests defaulting to lowest similarity for aggressive correction

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy Drop: Verify adaptive scaling is active (FLFA† failure mode)
  - Divergence: Check if feedback matrix B is being updated incorrectly
  - Random B Failure: Performance may drop below baseline if using random initialization instead of global weights

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Reproduction: Run FedAvg on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet(β=0.3) to establish local drift magnitude
  2. Integration: Apply FLFA to layer with lowest gradient cosine similarity; measure drift reduction
  3. Ablation: Disable adaptive scaling (set α=1) to confirm norm matching necessity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** Under what specific conditions should FLFA use "lowest similarity" versus "highest similarity" layer selection strategy, and can this decision be automated without requiring round-zero gradient analysis?
- **Open Question 2:** Does FLFA's theoretical drift bound remain valid when bounded input and error signal assumptions are violated, such as with unnormalized activations or exploding gradients?
- **Open Question 3:** Can FLFA be effectively combined with privacy-preserving mechanisms like differential privacy, given that server-side layer selection requires computing cosine similarities between client gradients?

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees depend on assumptions about weight norm similarity across clients that may not hold in extreme non-IID settings
- Adaptive scaling mechanism's effectiveness is demonstrated empirically but lacks rigorous theoretical justification for optimal scaling parameters
- Layer selection via gradient similarity may be dataset-dependent rather than universally optimal across all architectures

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Empirical improvement claims (6.5% on BloodMNIST, consistent gains across methods) well-supported by ablation studies and multiple dataset evaluations
- **Medium confidence:** Theoretical convergence bounds provide reasonable justification, though practical tightness in highly heterogeneous settings requires further validation
- **Low confidence:** Long-term stability under continuous rounds of training with evolving global models, particularly when global model quality degrades, is not thoroughly examined

## Next Checks
1. Test FLFA's performance when global model is initially poor (early training rounds) to verify feedback quality remains informative
2. Evaluate method's sensitivity to number of local epochs (beyond tested 5) to understand robustness to aggressive local training
3. Conduct experiments with random feedback matrices (B ≠ W^global) across all tested datasets to quantify benefit of semantically meaningful feedback versus pure alignment
