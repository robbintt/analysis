# Airport Passenger Flow Forecasting via Deformable Temporal-Spectral Transformer Approach

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.11845
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11845
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: DTSFormer achieves 49.47 MAE and reduces MAPE by 6.2% compared to second-best baseline on airport passenger flow forecasting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a deformable temporal-spectral transformer (DTSFormer) for airport passenger flow forecasting that dynamically partitions input sequences into multiscale temporal patches using window function-based masking. The approach extracts heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages while employing frequency-domain attention to capture both high- and low-frequency components, enabling the model to emphasize volatility and periodicity. Comprehensive experiments on real-world passenger flow data from Beijing Capital International Airport demonstrate consistent superiority over state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons.

## Method Summary
The DTSFormer framework combines deformable temporal partitioning with frequency-domain attention to address the challenges of modeling airport passenger flow dynamics. The core innovation lies in dynamically dividing input sequences into multiscale temporal patches using a window function-based masking approach, which enables extraction of heterogeneous trends at different temporal resolutions. Within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism captures both high- and low-frequency components to emphasize volatility and periodicity patterns. The model then fuses multi-frequency features in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. The architecture processes temporal patches at multiple scales, applies frequency-domain transformations to capture periodic patterns, and integrates these representations through attention mechanisms to produce final forecasts.

## Key Results
- Achieves mean absolute error of approximately 49.47 on Beijing Capital International Airport passenger flow data
- Reduces MAPE by 6.2% compared to the second-best baseline forecasting model
- Demonstrates consistent performance improvements across different prediction horizons

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The DTSFormer architecture works by dynamically partitioning input sequences into multiscale temporal patches using deformable window function-based masking, which allows the model to capture heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. The frequency-domain attention mechanism within each scale extracts both high-frequency components (representing volatility and short-term fluctuations) and low-frequency components (representing long-term periodicity and trends). By fusing these multi-frequency features in the time domain, the model can jointly model complex temporal dynamics that exhibit both rapid changes and sustained patterns. This multi-scale, multi-frequency approach addresses the inherent complexity of airport passenger flow, which involves both predictable periodic patterns (daily, weekly cycles) and unpredictable short-term variations due to external factors.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal patch extraction**: Required to handle varying temporal scales in passenger flow data; quick check: verify patch sizes match expected temporal patterns (hourly, daily, weekly)
- **Frequency-domain attention**: Needed to separate periodic patterns from random fluctuations; quick check: ensure frequency decomposition preserves both high and low frequency information
- **Multi-scale fusion**: Essential for combining short-term and long-term temporal dependencies; quick check: validate fusion weights properly balance different temporal scales
- **Deformable masking**: Allows adaptive temporal partitioning based on data characteristics; quick check: confirm mask adapts to varying passenger flow patterns
- **Window function-based partitioning**: Provides smooth transitions between temporal scales; quick check: verify window functions don't introduce artifacts at scale boundaries

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Sequence -> Temporal Patch Extraction -> Frequency Domain Attention -> Multi-frequency Fusion -> Output Prediction

**Critical Path**: The core processing flow follows: deformable temporal partitioning → frequency decomposition → attention weighting → feature fusion → prediction. The frequency-domain attention module is critical as it determines how well the model captures both periodic patterns and volatile fluctuations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The deformable partitioning approach trades computational complexity for improved temporal resolution adaptability, while the frequency-domain attention adds processing overhead but enables better separation of signal components. The multi-scale approach increases model capacity but requires careful regularization to prevent overfitting.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include: (1) poor adaptation of deformable masks to non-periodic patterns, (2) frequency decomposition losing critical temporal information, (3) multi-scale fusion becoming dominated by one temporal resolution, and (4) overfitting to the single airport dataset without generalizing to new environments.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test model performance on synthetic data with known periodic and random components to validate frequency separation capability
2. Evaluate single-scale vs multi-scale performance to quantify the benefit of temporal patch decomposition
3. Compare frequency-domain attention against standard time-domain attention to isolate the contribution of frequency processing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance validation limited to single airport dataset (Beijing Capital International Airport), raising generalizability concerns
- Lacks ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of deformable masking, frequency-domain attention, and multi-frequency fusion components
- Comparison against state-of-the-art methods is unspecified, making it difficult to assess relative positioning in the broader forecasting landscape

## Confidence
- **Technical framework**: Medium - Well-defined methodological approach but lacks component-level validation
- **Performance claims**: Medium - Strong results on single dataset but limited external validation
- **Generalizability**: Low - No evidence of performance across different airports or transportation contexts
- **Ablation validation**: Low - Missing studies to isolate individual component contributions

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DTSFormer on passenger flow data from multiple airports with different scales and operational patterns to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of deformable masking, frequency-domain attention, and multi-frequency fusion components
3. Compare against more recent state-of-the-art forecasting methods specifically designed for airport or transportation contexts, including computational efficiency and real-time deployment feasibility
