# Goal-Directedness is in the Eye of the Beholder

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.13247
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13247
- Authors: Nina Rajcic; Anders Søgaard
- Reference count: 37
- One-line primary result: Goal-directedness in AI systems cannot be measured objectively due to conceptual and technical limitations in both behavioral and mechanistic approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that goal-directedness in AI systems cannot be measured objectively due to fundamental limitations in both behavioral and mechanistic approaches. Behavioral definitions face granularity problems and become computationally intractable in multi-agent settings, while mechanistic approaches fail to detect goals in internal model states due to multiple realizability. The authors propose that goal-directedness should be studied as an emergent property through multi-agent simulations rather than attempting direct measurement.

## Method Summary
The paper uses a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical experiments to demonstrate the limitations of measuring goal-directedness. The key empirical component involves training up to 1,000 linear feed-forward neural networks on two distinct synthetic binary classification tasks, then attempting to classify which goal each network was trained toward using linear and non-linear probing classifiers. The experiments show that probing classifiers cannot reliably distinguish between different goals based on model parameters, converging to chance performance.

## Key Results
- Probing classifiers trained on model weights cannot reliably detect goal-directedness due to multiple realizability
- Behavioral measurement becomes computationally intractable in multi-agent settings due to cyclic dependencies
- Goals are not directly encoded in model parameters, making them unlearnable for probing classifiers
- Simulations in controlled environments offer a more promising approach to understanding goal-directed behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Mechanistic probing fails because goals are multiply realizable—many distinct parameter configurations can implement the same goal-directed behavior. If goals had consistent internal representations, probing classifiers would achieve above-chance performance on held-out models.

### Mechanism 2
Behavioral measurement becomes intractable in multi-agent settings because causal influence diagrams assume acyclic dependency structures. Introducing multiple interacting agents creates cycles in the relevance graph, preventing factorization into conditional probabilities and rendering exact inference intractable.

### Mechanism 3
Goals are partially externalized—they cannot be fully specified by internal states alone. An agent's goal is defined in part by the environment and context in which it operates, making purely internal goal attribution incomplete.

## Foundational Learning

- **Causal Influence Diagrams (CIDs)**: Formal foundation for behavioral goal-directedness measures. Understanding their structure (decision nodes, utility nodes, relevance graphs) is prerequisite to understanding why multi-agent settings break the measurement approach. *Quick check: Can you sketch a CID for a single agent choosing actions to maximize a utility function?*

- **Multiple Realizability**: Core mechanistic objection to probing. If you don't understand why the same function can be implemented by infinitely many parameter configurations, you won't understand why probing fails. *Quick check: Why can two neural networks with completely different weights implement the same input-output function?*

- **Instrumentalism vs. Essentialism about Mental States**: The paper's conclusion rests on an instrumentalist view—goals are useful predictive constructs, not objective internal properties. Confusing the two leads to measurement approaches that reify what is merely explanatory. *Quick check: What does it mean to say intentionality is "a level of explanation" rather than a causal mechanism?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Agent models -> Environment simulation -> Interaction layer -> Observation/logging
- **Critical path**: 1) Define environment constraints and resource distributions 2) Instantiate agents with varying capability profiles 3) Run multi-agent simulations across varying conditions 4) Observe whether persistent, norm-sensitive, intervention-responsive behavior emerges 5) Correlate emergent patterns with environmental structure
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simulation fidelity vs. interpretability; single vs. multi-agent; log granularity vs. subjectivity
- **Failure signatures**: Attributing goals from single trajectories; assuming observed behavior generalizes; treating simulation outcomes as objective measurements
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate probing experiment with varied architectures 2) Build minimal two-agent grid world to test cyclic dependency claims 3) Design simulation tracking persistence and norm-sensitivity across constraints

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can multi-agent simulations detect goal-directedness features (persistence, norm-sensitivity) without relying on anthropomorphic definitions or specific internal goal representations?

- How can researchers mitigate "link uncertainty" to ensure safety evaluations in controlled simulations accurately predict behavior in real-world, drifting usage contexts?

- Is it possible to construct a formal definition of goal-directedness that resolves the "granularity problem" without requiring exhaustive, case-specific specifications?

- Can heuristics or approximation methods be developed to make goal-directedness measurement computationally tractable in multi-agent settings with cyclic dependencies?

## Limitations

- The probing experiment with synthetic linear networks lacks complete specification of architectures and data distributions
- The tractability argument for multi-agent settings is theoretically sound but lacks empirical demonstration beyond toy examples
- The externalism claim about goals depending on environmental context is philosophically compelling but not empirically validated through controlled simulation experiments

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The instrumentalist framing and conclusion that simulations offer a better approach than direct measurement
- **Medium confidence**: The multiple realizability argument and probing experiment results require replication with varied architectures
- **Low confidence**: The computational intractability claim in multi-agent settings needs empirical validation beyond theoretical argument

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the probing experiment with varied architectures (wider networks, different activation functions) to test whether multiple realizability consistently blocks goal detection.

2. Build a minimal two-agent grid world simulation to empirically test whether cyclic dependencies prevent goal-directedness measurement as claimed.

3. Design a simulation tracking persistence and norm-sensitivity across varying environmental constraints to observe whether goal-directed patterns emerge without explicit goal representation.
