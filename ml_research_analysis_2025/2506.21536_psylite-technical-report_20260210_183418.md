# PsyLite Technical Report

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.21536
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21536
- **Reference count:** 6
- **Primary result:** Hybrid distillation (general + psychological datasets) + ORPO preference optimization improves counseling professionalism by 47.6% and safety by 2.4%, running on 5GB memory

## Executive Summary
PsyLite addresses key limitations in AI-driven psychological counseling by enhancing dialogue safety, scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. It uses a two-stage training strategy combining hybrid distillation (general + psychological datasets) and ORPO preference optimization to improve reasoning, counseling professionalism, and safety. The model achieves a 47.6% improvement in CPsyCounE professionalism scores and a 2.4% improvement in SafeDialBench safety scores. Deployed via Ollama and Open WebUI with conditional RAG for humor integration, PsyLite runs on 5GB memory (GGUF q4_k_m quantization), offering a practical solution for resource-constrained environments.

## Method Summary
PsyLite uses a two-stage training pipeline. First, hybrid distillation fine-tuning combines 10k general-domain samples (filtered from Chinese-DeepSeek-R1-Distill-data-110k-SFT) with 3k psychological counseling samples (from CPsyCounD with Chain-of-Thought injection from DeepSeek R1) in a 10:3 ratio using QLoRA (LR: 1e-4, Epochs: 5). Second, ORPO preference optimization is applied using the PKU-SafeRLHF-single-dimension dataset (LR: 5e-6, Lambda: 0.2, Steps: 3k). The model is quantized to GGUF q4_k_m and deployed via Ollama with Open WebUI frontend, featuring conditional RAG for safety classification and optional humor integration.

## Key Results
- 47.6% improvement in CPsyCounE counseling professionalism scores
- 2.4% improvement in SafeDialBench dialogue safety scores
- 5GB memory footprint enables deployment on resource-constrained devices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hybrid distillation data fine-tuning enables the model to acquire psychological counseling knowledge while maintaining general reasoning capabilities.
- Mechanism: The paper uses a combined dataset ("psy-mix-gen-distill-13k") with a 10:3 ratio of general-domain distillation data (from DeepSeek R1) to domain-specific psychological counseling data (CPsyCounD). This one-step, end-to-end training approach is designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The general data imparts chain-of-thought reasoning, while the counseling data provides professional knowledge.
- Core assumption: The 10:3 ratio is sufficient to balance generalization and specialization. The authors explicitly state this design choice helps the model "avoid overfitting in specific domain training while maintaining its generalization ability."
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Mentions "hybrid distillation data fine-tuning" as a key strategy.
  - [section 3.1.1] Details the construction of the `psy-mix-gen-distill-13k` dataset from two distinct sources.
  - [section 5.2] Argues for one-step training over a sequential approach to ensure the model learns counseling techniques and general knowledge simultaneously.
  - [corpus] No directly comparable mechanism in related work; most related papers focus on data generation or emotion tracking, not hybrid training for reasoning preservation.
- Break condition: If the ratio of general-to-domain data is altered significantly (e.g., predominantly domain data) or if sequential training is used, the model's general reasoning ability or domain-specific counseling skill will likely degrade due to catastrophic forgetting.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Injecting Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into psychological counseling datasets preserves reasoning ability during domain fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: The paper uses a teacher model (DeepSeek R1) to generate step-by-step reasoning traces for questions in the psychological dataset. This CoT is injected into the training data. Without this, fine-tuning on counseling data (which typically lacks reasoning chains) would cause the model to lose the deep-thinking skills learned from general data.
- Core assumption: The quality of the generated CoT is sufficient to transfer reasoning capabilities to the smaller model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] Explicitly argues that fine-tuning on non-CoT data leads to a deterioration of thinking ability.
  - [section 3.1.1] Describes the process: "inject the obtained CoT into the original data to complete the creation of the 3k psychological distill datasets."
  - [corpus] Weak or missing. Related papers do not explicitly validate this specific CoT injection mechanism.
- Break condition: If CoT is not injected into the domain dataset, the model will likely produce shallow, imitative responses instead of deep, reasoned counseling.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) directly shapes the model's output distribution towards safer dialogue without a separate reward model.
- Mechanism: In the second training stage, ORPO is applied using a preference dataset (`PKU-SafeRLHF-single-dimension`). Its loss function (L_ORPO) combines a supervised fine-tuning loss with a relative ratio loss. This ratio loss (L_OR) directly maximizes the log-odds of a preferred (safe) response over a rejected (unsafe) one, aligning the model with safety preferences.
- Core assumption: The preference dataset accurately represents safe vs. unsafe responses for the target domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Cites "ORPO preference optimization" for enhancing "safe dialogue ability."
  - [section 3.1.2] Details the ORPO loss function (Eq. 3, 4) and its role in suppressing rejected responses.
  - [section 4.2.3] Shows a 2.4% improvement in the SafeDialBench score, attributing it to the ORPO training.
  - [corpus] Weak or missing. No related papers in the corpus validate ORPO specifically.
- Break condition: If the preference dataset is of low quality or if hyperparameters (like lambda) are misconfigured, the optimization may fail, leading to inconsistent or inadequate safety improvements.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Catastrophic Forgetting**
  - Why needed here: This is the central problem PsyLite solves. A naive fine-tune on psychological data would erase the model's general reasoning. Understanding this motivates the hybrid data strategy.
  - Quick check question: Why can't we simply fine-tune a general LLM on a psychological counseling dataset and expect it to be both a good counselor and a good general reasoner?

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation**
  - Why needed here: The project uses "distillation" in two ways: from a general teacher model (DeepSeek R1) to transfer reasoning, and then into a domain-specific dataset via CoT injection.
  - Quick check question: In the context of this paper, what is being "distilled" from DeepSeek R1 into the psychological counseling dataset?

- **Concept: Preference Optimization (ORPO/DPO)**
  - Why needed here: This is the second stage of training. It's crucial for moving beyond simple imitation (SFT) to active alignment with safety goals. ORPO is a specific, efficient implementation of this idea.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between ORPO and traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) that requires a separate reward model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** InternLM2.5-7B-distill-orpo (core model) -> Quantized GGUF q4_k_m -> Ollama (deployment) -> Open WebUI (frontend) -> Conditional RAG (safety/humor logic)
- **Critical path:** The two-stage training pipeline is the most critical element. The first stage (hybrid SFT) is the linchpin; failure to correctly merge the general and domain-specific distillation data would undermine both reasoning and counseling ability. The ORPO stage is secondary but essential for the reported safety gains.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Generalization vs. Specialization:** The 10:3 data ratio trades general knowledge (1.5 point drop on CEval) for a massive gain in counseling skill.
  - **Efficiency vs. Performance:** The one-step training saves cost/time but requires careful dataset curation.
  - **Resource vs. Fidelity:** The 4-bit quantization enables broad deployment on ~5GB memory at a potential cost to nuance and accuracy compared to full-precision models.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Reasoning Collapse:** The model provides generic, template-like counseling advice without logical justification. Indicates the CoT injection or general data ratio was insufficient.
  - **Safety Inconsistency:** The model occasionally generates harmful or inappropriate content. Suggests the ORPO preference dataset may not cover edge cases or hyperparameters need tuning.
  - **Context Misjudgment:** The agent fails to correctly classify user state, refusing benign requests or attempting humor during serious crises. Indicates a flaw in the Conditional RAG logic.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1.  **Reproducibility Test:** Replicate the evaluation of `InternLM2.5-7B-distill-orpo` against its baseline on CEval, CPsyCounE, and SafeDialBench to confirm reported deltas.
  2.  **Ablation Study on Data Ratio:** Retrain the SFT model with a different ratio (e.g., 5:8) or without CoT injection to quantify the impact on general reasoning vs. domain skill.
  3.  **End-to-End Agent Test:** Deploy the full agent with Conditional RAG and stress-test the safety and humor injection workflows with adversarial user prompts (e.g., simulated crisis, jailbreak attempts) to evaluate robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the optimal hyperparameters for ORPO preference optimization in this specific domain to ensure stable convergence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.3 notes that due to resource constraints, "we were unable to explore the most ideal hyperparameter settings," observing that reward metrics fluctuated rather than converging.
- Why unresolved: The project schedule and computing power were insufficient to perform a systematic search for the ideal learning rate and lambda values.
- What evidence would resolve it: A hyperparameter search study showing stable increases in reward accuracy and margin over training steps.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the "crosstalk humor" integration quantitatively affect user satisfaction and therapeutic alliance compared to standard counseling responses?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims the Conditional RAG for humor "enhances user experience" (Section 3.3.2), but the Experiment section (4.2) only evaluates safety and professionalism, lacking metrics on user engagement or humor appropriateness.
- Why unresolved: No user study or subjective evaluation metric was included to validate the utility or reception of the injected humor.
- What evidence would resolve it: A/B testing results with human feedback specifically rating user satisfaction and perceived empathy in humor-enhanced vs. control sessions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the 10:3 ratio of general to psychological data the optimal balance for preventing capability forgetting during fine-tuning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.2 discusses the trade-off between maintaining generalization (CEval) and learning professional knowledge (CPsyCounE), settling on a 10:3 ratio, but the sensitivity of this ratio is not fully explored.
- Why unresolved: The paper validates this single ratio but does not provide ablation studies comparing it against other mixtures (e.g., 1:1 or pure domain data).
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study reporting CEval and CPsyCounE scores across various data mixing ratios to map the performance frontier.

## Limitations

- **Data Quality and Composition:** The hybrid dataset construction relies on a specific 10:3 ratio of general to psychological data. The paper does not provide a detailed breakdown of the general dataset quality or the exact filtering criteria used to select the 10k high-scoring samples from the 110k Chinese-DeepSeek-R1 dataset.
- **Mechanism Validation:** The paper claims that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) injection is crucial for preserving reasoning ability during domain fine-tuning, but there is no direct ablation study comparing the performance of a model trained with and without CoT injection.
- **Safety and ORPO:** The 2.4% improvement in SafeDialBench safety scores is attributed to ORPO training, but the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the types of unsafe responses that were corrected or a comparison with other safety fine-tuning methods.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The reported improvements in CPsyCounE professionalism scores (47.6%) and the memory efficiency claim (5GB footprint) are based on direct evaluation of the final model against baselines.
- **Medium Confidence:** The two-stage training methodology (hybrid SFT + ORPO) and the use of the mixed dataset are well-documented, but the long-term stability of the model's performance and its robustness to out-of-distribution prompts are not thoroughly tested.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific impact of CoT injection on the model's reasoning ability during psychological counseling is inferred from general research on CoT but not directly validated in this context.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on CoT Injection:** Retrain the SFT model using the same 10:3 data ratio but without injecting CoT traces into the psychological dataset. Evaluate and compare the resulting model's performance on CPsyCounE and a reasoning-focused benchmark (e.g., C-Eval) to quantify the specific contribution of CoT to both counseling skill and general reasoning.

2. **Safety Robustness Test:** Conduct a comprehensive safety evaluation of the ORPO-trained model using a diverse set of adversarial prompts, including simulated crisis scenarios, jailbreak attempts, and prompts designed to elicit harmful advice. Compare its performance against a baseline model fine-tuned only with SFT safety examples and document the types of unsafe responses each model generates.

3. **Long-Term Stability and Generalization:** Deploy the PsyLite agent in a simulated or controlled real-world environment for an extended period (e.g., one month). Monitor its performance on key metrics (professionalism, safety, user satisfaction) over time to assess for any degradation in quality. Additionally, test the model's ability to handle novel counseling scenarios not present in the training data to evaluate its generalization capabilities.
