# Bridging Writing Manner Gap in Visual Instruction Tuning by Creating LLM-aligned Instructions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.18320
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18320
- Authors: Dong Jing; Nanyi Fei; Zhiwu Lu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Aligning visual instruction writing style with inner LLM improves LLaVA-7B and QwenVL performance across 15 benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical issue in visual instruction tuning where the writing style of visual instruction data differs from the inner language model (LLM) in multi-modal models. The authors identify that discrepancies in vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure between visual instruction datasets and the LLM's preferred style can degrade model performance. They propose a novel approach to align visual instruction writing styles with the inner LLM by using the LLM to rewrite and review soft-format visual instructions, preserving semantics while improving stylistic alignment.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a method to bridge the writing manner gap by leveraging the inner LLM itself to transform visual instruction data. They use the LLM to rewrite visual instructions into a format that matches the LLM's own writing style, including vocabulary preferences, grammatical structures, and sentence patterns. The process involves both automatic rewriting by the LLM and human review to ensure semantic preservation. This aligned dataset is then used for visual instruction tuning of multi-modal models like LLaVA-7B and QwenVL.

## Key Results
- LLaVA-7B and QwenVL trained on LLM-aligned datasets show non-trivial improvements across 15 different benchmarks
- Models demonstrate better resistance to hallucinations and enhanced open-ended reasoning capabilities
- Human evaluation confirms successful alignment of writing style while maintaining semantic integrity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from reducing the cognitive load and adaptation overhead for the model. When visual instructions match the LLM's preferred writing style, the model can focus more on learning the visual-language mapping rather than also translating between writing styles. This alignment creates a more consistent training signal and reduces the model's need to compensate for stylistic differences during inference.

## Foundational Learning

**Visual Instruction Tuning**: The process of training multi-modal models on paired visual and textual instruction data. Why needed: Essential for developing models that can understand and execute visual commands. Quick check: Verify models can follow visual instructions accurately.

**Writing Manner Gap**: The stylistic differences between training data and model's internal language patterns. Why needed: Understanding this gap is crucial for effective training. Quick check: Compare vocabulary and syntax distributions between data and model outputs.

**Soft-format Instructions**: Visual instructions presented in natural language format rather than rigid templates. Why needed: More flexible and closer to real-world usage. Quick check: Ensure instructions maintain clarity and precision.

**Semantic Preservation**: Maintaining the original meaning while changing writing style. Why needed: Critical for effective instruction following. Quick check: Human evaluation of instruction equivalence.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Visual Instruction Data -> LLM Rewriting Module -> Aligned Instruction Dataset -> Multi-modal Model Training -> Fine-tuned Model

**Critical Path**: The key innovation is the LLM rewriting step, which transforms raw visual instructions into LLM-aligned format. This aligned data then becomes the training corpus for visual instruction tuning, directly impacting model performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational overhead (LLM rewriting) for improved model performance. Alternative approaches like dataset filtering or model adaptation were considered but rejected due to scalability and effectiveness concerns.

**Failure Signatures**: If the rewriting process introduces semantic drift, models may perform poorly on tasks requiring precise instruction following. Over-alignment could lead to loss of instruction diversity and reduced generalization.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Compare model performance on standard vs. aligned datasets across multiple benchmarks
2. Ablation study varying degrees of rewriting intensity to find optimal alignment
3. Cross-dataset generalization test to verify alignment benefits transfer to unseen instruction styles

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the source material.

## Limitations

- The writing manner gap definition and its impact are subjective, relying on human evaluation that may introduce bias
- The methodology assumes LLM-aligned instructions will generalize across diverse tasks without thorough validation
- The study does not address potential overfitting to specific benchmarks or scalability to larger, more diverse datasets

## Confidence

High: Improvement in model performance across 15 benchmarks is objectively measurable
Medium: Reliance on human evaluation for writing style alignment and hallucination resistance claims
Low: Limited discussion of potential negative impacts of over-alignment or loss of instruction diversity

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a large-scale ablation study to quantify the specific contribution of writing manner alignment versus other factors in the dataset
2. Perform cross-domain validation to ensure the improvements generalize beyond the tested benchmarks
3. Implement automated metrics to complement human evaluation and reduce potential bias in assessing writing manner alignment and hallucination resistance
