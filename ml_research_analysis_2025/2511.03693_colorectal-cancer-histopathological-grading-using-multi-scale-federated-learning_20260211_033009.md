# Colorectal Cancer Histopathological Grading using Multi-Scale Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.03693
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03693
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Federated model achieves 83.5% overall accuracy on CRC-HGD, outperforming centralized training at 81.6%

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a federated learning framework for colorectal cancer histopathological grading that addresses privacy constraints in multi-institutional data sharing. The method employs a dual-stream ResNetRS50 backbone to capture both fine-grained nuclear detail and broader tissue context at different scales, integrated with FedProx for stable federated training. Experiments on the CRC-HGD dataset show the federated model achieves 83.5% overall accuracy, outperforming centralized training (81.6%), with 87.5% recall for Grade III tumors and 88.0% accuracy at 40× magnification.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a dual-stream ResNetRS50 backbone processing dual-scale patches (320×320 for context, 224×224 for detail) with features concatenated before classification. FedProx regularization (μ=0.01) mitigates client drift across heterogeneous hospital data distributions. The pipeline includes stain normalization (Macenko/Reinhard), Otsu thresholding for background removal, and MixUp augmentation (α=0.2). Training uses FedAvg with 10 rounds of 3 local epochs per client using Adam optimizer (lr=3×10^-4, weight decay 1×10^-4).

## Key Results
- Federated model achieves 83.5% overall accuracy on CRC-HGD v2, outperforming centralized training (81.6%)
- 87.5% recall for Grade III tumors (poorly differentiated) at 40× magnification
- 88.0% accuracy at 40× magnification, demonstrating effectiveness of multi-scale approach
- FedProx integration enables stable training across simulated heterogeneous hospital data distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Concurrent processing of fine-grained detail and broad tissue context improves grading accuracy, particularly for aggressive tumors.
- **Mechanism:** Dual-stream ResNetRS50 processes 320×320 (context) and 224×224 (detail) patches, concatenating features to correlate cellular atypia with tissue-level architectural disruption.
- **Core assumption:** Grade III tumor diagnosis requires simultaneous assessment of nuclear irregularities and absence of normal glandular structures.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract describes dual-stream design; section 3.3 specifies stream resolutions; corpus cites multi-scale efficacy in colon cancer detection.
- **Break condition:** Patch misalignment or insufficient magnification degrades fusion performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** FedProx regularization stabilizes convergence in presence of non-IID histopathology data across hospitals.
- **Mechanism:** Adds proximal term (μ/2||w-w^t||²) to local loss, anchoring updates closer to global model to prevent client drift.
- **Core assumption:** Institutional data distributions vary enough to cause drift but share enough biological signal for global model viability.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions FedProx for stable training; section 3.4 specifies μ=0.01; corpus cites theoretical FL literature.
- **Break condition:** Improper μ setting causes either inability to adapt or training divergence.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Federated framework acts as regularizer, achieving better generalization than centralized training.
- **Mechanism:** Forcing single model to fit distinct local distributions filters out institution-specific noise while retaining robust biological features.
- **Core assumption:** Performance gap (83.5% vs 81.6%) results from learning paradigm rather than hyperparameter differences.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract reports FL outperforming centralized; section 4.2 highlights superior performance despite distributed training.
- **Break condition:** Excessive local epochs cause overfitting, destroying regularization benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Federated Averaging (FedAvg)**
  - **Why needed here:** Communication protocol for aggregating local model updates into global model.
  - **Quick check question:** If a hospital drops out during a round, how does FedAvg handle missing weights in aggregation sum?

- **Concept: Non-IID Data (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed)**
  - **Why needed here:** Histopathology data is inherently non-IID due to varying scanners, staining protocols, and patient demographics.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a standard CNN trained centrally on Hospital A's data likely fail when deployed at Hospital B?

- **Concept: Multi-Scale Feature Fusion**
  - **Why needed here:** Pathology requires context; tumor grading requires correlating nuclear morphology with tissue architecture.
  - **Quick check question:** In this architecture, are the two streams processed by shared weights or separate encoders?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (dual-scale patches) -> Dual-stream ResNetRS50 encoders -> Concatenation layer -> Dense/ReLU/Dropout -> Softmax

- **Critical path:** Stain normalization is the critical failure point; misaligned stain profiles cause out-of-distribution inputs regardless of model weights.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Dual-Stream vs Single-Stream: Higher compute cost (2×ResNet50) but necessary for 87.5% Grade III recall
  - FedProx (μ) vs FedAvg: Sacrifices some local accuracy for global stability
  - Patch size: 320px captures detail but loses context; 224px captures context but loses fine detail; fusion resolves this

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low Grade III Recall (<70%): Fine-scale stream failure or insufficient class balance handling
  - Training Divergence: Client drift indicates μ too low or local epochs too high
  - Validation >> Test Accuracy: Overfitting to specific stain profiles; check data leakage

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check (Centralized): Train dual-stream model on full dataset without FL
  2. Ablation (Single vs Dual Scale): Compare FL with only 224px, only 320px, and fused inputs
  3. Sensitivity Analysis (μ): Sweep μ ∈ {0.0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1} to find optimal stability-efficiency tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Would the federated framework maintain its performance advantage over centralized training when deployed across truly heterogeneous institutions with different scanner hardware, staining protocols, and patient demographics?
- **Basis in paper:** Explicit call for developing federated domain adaptation techniques in Future Work section
- **Why unresolved:** Current study uses single dataset with simulated federation rather than real inter-institutional variability
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Multi-institutional study across 3+ hospitals with genuinely distinct protocols comparing federated vs centralized performance

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What mechanisms drive the federated model's 1.9% accuracy improvement over centralized training, and is this reproducible or an artifact of experimental setup?
- **Basis in paper:** Paper reports FL achieving 83.5% vs centralized 81.6% without explaining counterintuitive result
- **Why unresolved:** No ablation study disentangles whether improvement stems from FedProx regularization, sampling strategy, or stochasticity
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Controlled ablation experiments varying FedProx μ, sampling strategies, and random seeds with statistical significance testing

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can explainable AI features be integrated into federated frameworks without compromising privacy or incurring prohibitive communication costs?
- **Basis in paper:** Explicit call for incorporating XAI features such as heatmaps and attention maps
- **Why unresolved:** Generating and transmitting explanations in FL introduces privacy concerns and communication overhead
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Federated XAI method generating local attention maps with global aggregation, validated through privacy metrics and pathologist assessment

## Limitations
- Single dataset (CRC-HGD) limits generalizability to real institutional heterogeneity
- Contradictory specification of which pixel resolution maps to fine vs coarse streams
- Method for creating non-IID client distributions not fully specified
- Performance comparison lacks statistical significance testing

## Confidence
- **Mechanism 1 Confidence: High** - Well-supported by architecture description and corpus citation
- **Mechanism 2 Confidence: Medium** - Theoretical basis established but limited empirical validation specific to this dataset
- **Mechanism 3 Confidence: Low** - Surprising result contradicts literature trends; highly dependent on unspecified experimental conditions

## Next Checks
1. Sanity Check: Retrain dual-stream model centrally on full dataset to establish performance upper bound
2. Ablation Study: Isolate contribution of each scale by training single-stream models within FL framework
3. FedProx Sensitivity: Systematically vary proximal term coefficient μ to identify optimal value for this dataset's heterogeneity
