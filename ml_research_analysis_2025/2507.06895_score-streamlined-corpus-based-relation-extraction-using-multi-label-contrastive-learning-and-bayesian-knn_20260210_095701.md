# SCoRE: Streamlined Corpus-based Relation Extraction using Multi-Label Contrastive Learning and Bayesian kNN

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06895
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06895
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art relation extraction models while reducing energy consumption by up to three orders of magnitude

## Executive Summary
SCoRE introduces a streamlined approach to relation extraction that avoids PLM fine-tuning by treating the encoder as an informed prior for dataset creation. The method leverages multi-label supervised contrastive learning to cluster similar relation patterns and employs Bayesian kNN for robust inference. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art models while achieving substantial energy efficiency gains.

## Method Summary
SCoRE processes each sentence through a frozen PLM to generate token embeddings, then averages and concatenates head and tail entity embeddings to form 2h-dimensional input vectors. These vectors are projected via MLP onto a hypersphere using multi-label supervised contrastive learning, where relation label overlap determines proximity in the embedding space. Bayesian kNN with flat priors performs inference by computing distance-weighted likelihoods over retrieved neighbors, with universal thresholds converting probabilities to predictions.

## Key Results
- Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art models on MicroF1 and MacroF1 across five benchmarks
- Reduces energy consumption by up to three orders of magnitude compared to fine-tuning approaches
- Novel evaluation metrics (Correlation Structure Distance and Precision at R) demonstrate strong alignment with knowledge graph structures and recommender system utility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Frozen PLM Encoder
Freezing the PLM encoder prevents overfitting to noisy distant supervision labels while preserving general linguistic understanding. The PLM performs a single forward pass to generate token embeddings, with head and tail entity mentions averaged separately and concatenated to form 2h-dimensional input vectors. No gradient updates occur in the PLM. This assumes pre-trained representations already contain sufficient relational signal; noise comes from label assignment, not representation quality.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Label Contrastive Learning
Multi-label supervised contrastive learning creates a metric space where relation label overlap determines proximity. The contrastive loss uses β_ij weighting based on shared relations between sample pairs, pulling together samples with overlapping relation sets while pushing apart those without overlap. The MLP maps inputs onto a hypersphere (L2-normalized outputs). This assumes relation co-occurrence patterns in noisy DS data reflect genuine semantic similarity rather than annotation artifacts.

### Mechanism 3: Bayesian kNN Inference
Bayesian kNN inference exploits the geometric structure learned by contrastive training without requiring a parametric classifier. After training, hidden representations are stored in a datastore, and for each test sample, k-nearest neighbors are retrieved. Posterior probabilities are computed using distance-weighted likelihoods with flat priors. A universal threshold c converts probabilities to predictions. This assumes flat priors optimize recall for long-tail relations and the contrastive embedding structure already encodes class information locally.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Contrastive Learning Objective
  - Why needed here: The loss function modifies standard contrastive learning with β_ij weighting for multi-label overlap. You must understand how temperature τ and distance metric affect cluster tightness.
  - Quick check question: Given two samples with labels {r1, r2} and {r2, r3}, what is their β_ij weighting?

- **Concept:** Multi-Label Classification Metrics
  - Why needed here: Understanding MicroF1 vs MacroF1 differences is crucial for interpreting performance across imbalanced relation distributions.
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts all labels as positive, what are its MicroF1 and MacroF1 scores?

- **Concept:** Bayesian Inference in kNN
  - Why needed here: The flat prior assumption and distance-weighted likelihood computation are central to SCoRE's inference strategy.
  - Quick check question: How does changing the prior from flat to informative affect recall vs precision?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
BERT-base encoder -> Entity embedding averaging -> MLP projection -> Contrastive learning -> Embedding datastore -> Bayesian kNN inference

### Critical Path
The critical path is: Sentence preprocessing → PLM encoding → Entity embedding computation → MLP training with contrastive loss → kNN inference with Bayesian posterior calculation.

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Energy Efficiency vs. Model Capacity**: Avoiding PLM fine-tuning saves significant energy but may limit adaptation to specialized domains
- **Memory vs. Speed**: Storing large embedding datasets enables fast inference but requires substantial storage
- **Recall vs. Precision**: Flat priors prioritize recall, potentially increasing false positives for long-tail relations

### Failure Signatures
- High CSD with low macroF1: Poor semantic clustering in embedding space
- Over-prediction of labels: Threshold c too low or insufficient regularization
- Memory overflow on large datasets: Embedding datastore exceeds available RAM

### Three First Experiments
1. **MLP Architecture Search**: Grid search over layers (1-3), neurons (128-1024), and output dimensions (64-512) to find optimal configuration
2. **Distance Metric Comparison**: Ablation study comparing Euclidean vs cosine distance on validation set performance
3. **Threshold Calibration**: Tune universal threshold c on validation set to balance precision-recall tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the SCoRE framework be extended to encompass entity linking and end-to-end relational triple extraction?
- How can SCoRE be effectively integrated into a human-in-the-loop framework to maximize its utility as a recommender system?
- Does the minimal, non-fine-tuning approach of SCoRE generalize effectively to larger or more recent PLMs beyond BERT-base?

## Limitations
- The paper does not report optimal MLP architectures per dataset, requiring additional hyperparameter searches for faithful reproduction
- Distance metric selection (Euclidean vs cosine) is not consistently reported across datasets, affecting reproducibility of novel metrics
- Energy consumption claims focus on training costs only, without measuring inference-time energy usage or storage requirements

## Confidence

**High Confidence** - Core contrastive learning mechanism and Bayesian kNN inference framework are well-specified and theoretically sound. Modular design allowing PLM substitution is clearly articulated.

**Medium Confidence** - Empirical superiority over baselines is supported by five benchmarks, but novel CSD and P@R metrics lack extensive validation. CSD's correlation structure interpretation and P@R's recommender system applicability are promising but require more thorough analysis.

**Low Confidence** - Energy consumption claims (up to three orders of magnitude reduction) are based on training-phase comparisons only. Without inference-time energy measurements and consideration of storage requirements for large embedding datasets, these claims may overstate practical efficiency gains.

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset Availability and Preprocessing** - Verify the complete preprocessing pipeline for all five benchmarks, particularly Wiki20D which may have limited availability. Confirm that the removal of 'NA' relations and 512-token filtering does not introduce bias in long-tail relation distributions.

2. **Distance Metric Impact Study** - Conduct ablation experiments comparing Euclidean versus cosine distance for each dataset. Measure how distance metric choice affects CSD scores, P@R performance, and overall F1 metrics to establish which metric is optimal per dataset.

3. **Inference-Time Energy Measurement** - Measure actual energy consumption during kNN inference on test sets, including embedding retrieval and posterior computation. Compare against fine-tuned model inference to determine if training-time savings persist throughout the full pipeline.
