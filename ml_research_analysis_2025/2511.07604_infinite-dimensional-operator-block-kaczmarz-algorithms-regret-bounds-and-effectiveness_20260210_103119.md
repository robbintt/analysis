# Infinite-Dimensional Operator/Block Kaczmarz Algorithms: Regret Bounds and $λ$-Effectiveness

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.07604
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07604
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Dimension-free $O(1/k)$ average regret bounds for block Kaczmarz algorithms in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, with explicit $\lambda$-dependence

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing regret bounds of block Kaczmarz algorithms in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, extending the classical Kaczmarz method to modern machine learning contexts. The authors develop operator-theoretic regret bounds with explicit $\lambda$-dependence for generalized Kaczmarz algorithms with relaxation parameter $\lambda \in (0,2)$. They establish dimension-free $O(1/k)$ average regret bounds that hold for any relaxation parameter, and show these bounds are sharp when the system is $\lambda$-effective and the measurement operators are partial isometries. For the noisy case with i.i.d. additive noise, they derive mixed regret bounds that separate the estimation error from the noise contribution, providing explicit noise-aware guidance for choosing the relaxation parameter based on the noise level and iteration count.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes the Generalized Kaczmarz algorithm in Hilbert spaces, verifying regret bounds for iterative linear system solvers $Xw^* = y$. The method uses sequential online updates with measurement operators $X_t$ and observations $y_t = X_t w^* + \eta_t$. The update rule is $w_t = w_{t-1} + \lambda X_t^\dagger(y_t - X_t w_{t-1})$, where $X_t^\dagger$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. The objective metric is average regret $\frac{1}{k}\sum_{t=1}^k \|X_t w_{t-1} - y_t\|^2$. The analysis establishes convergence rate $O(1/k)$ for noiseless effective systems and mixed regret bounds for noisy systems, with explicit guidance for choosing $\lambda$ based on noise level and iteration count.

## Key Results
- Dimension-free $O(1/k)$ average regret bounds for block Kaczmarz algorithms in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces
- Mixed regret bounds in noisy settings that separate estimation error from noise contribution
- Optimal $\lambda$ selection formula for noise-aware parameter tuning
- Characterization of $\lambda$-effectiveness for exponential systems via Hardy space theory and singular measures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** In noisy settings, the algorithm's average regret decomposes additively into a decaying estimation error and a persistent noise floor.
- **Mechanism:** The update recursion $w_t = w_{t-1} + \lambda X_t^\dagger(y_t - X_t w_{t-1})$ is expanded to separate the noiseless state evolution from the propagated noise history. By assuming i.i.d. mean-zero noise, cross-terms vanish under expectation, leaving the sum of squared residuals as the sum of a decaying norm $\|A_t\|^2$ and an accumulating noise term $\|B_t\|^2$.
- **Core assumption:** Noise vectors $\eta_t$ are i.i.d., mean-zero, and independent of the algorithm's history (Assumption 2.2 & Theorem 3.1 setup).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "derive mixed regret bounds that separate the estimation error from the noise contribution"
  - [section]: Proof of Theorem 3.1, Equations (4)–(8), specifically the separation into $A_t$ (noiseless) and $B_t$ (noise).
  - [corpus]: Related work (Paper 114513) supports the use of "telescoping energy residuals" and operator defect identities for analyzing such decompositions in signal processing.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The relaxation parameter $\lambda$ controls a trade-off between the convergence rate of the estimation error and the amplification of the noise floor.
- **Mechanism:** The regret bound is derived as $\frac{2\|w^*\|^2}{\lambda(2-\lambda)k} + \left(\frac{2\lambda C}{2-\lambda} + 1\right)\sigma^2$. Minimizing this bound analytically yields an optimal $\lambda^*$ that shrinks as the horizon $k$ grows or noise $\sigma^2$ increases.
- **Core assumption:** The surrogate loss function accurately reflects the true regret; the system is $\lambda$-effective to ensure the initial term decays.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "providing explicit noise-aware guidance for choosing the relaxation parameter"
  - [section]: Corollary 4.7 and the subsequent optimization of $f(\lambda) = \frac{a}{\lambda(2-\lambda)} + \frac{2b\lambda}{2-\lambda}$.
  - [corpus]: Paper 4344 ("Worth Their Weight") discusses regularization and block methods, aligning with the general need to tune step-sizes for robustness, though without this specific $\lambda$-dependence formula.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Convergence (effectiveness) for exponential systems is guaranteed by the singularity of the spectral measure, which forces the algorithm's generating function to behave as an "inner function" in the Hardy space.
- **Mechanism:** The convergence of the infinite product $\tilde{T}_n = (I-\lambda P_n)\cdots(I-\lambda P_1)$ is linked to the integral of a specific analytic function $\phi(z)$. The paper proves that for singular measures, boundary values of the Cauchy transform force $\phi(z)$ to satisfy inner function properties (unit modulus on the boundary), ensuring the necessary integral identity holds for effectiveness.
- **Core assumption:** Projections are rank-one (e.g., exponential functions); the system is stationary.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "exponential system... is $\lambda$-effective for all $\lambda \in (0,2)$ if and only if the underlying measure is singular"
  - [section]: Theorem 7.7 and Proposition 7.11, which explicitly construct the inner function $\phi(z) = \frac{1-\lambda F(z)}{1-\lambda+\lambda F(z)}$.
  - [corpus]: Evidence is weak in the provided corpus; most neighbors focus on finite-dimensional randomized Kaczmarz rather than spectral measure theory in Hardy spaces.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Strong Operator Topology (SOT)**
  - **Why needed here:** In infinite dimensions, standard matrix convergence (norm convergence) is too restrictive. You need SOT to understand what it means for the sequence of operators $\tilde{T}_n$ to "converge to zero" effectively.
  - **Quick check question:** If $\|T_n x\| \to 0$ for every vector $x$, but $\|T_n\|$ does not go to 0, is the system effective? (Yes, this is SOT convergence).

- **Concept: Regret in Online Learning**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper analyzes performance via "regret" (cumulative loss vs. optimal hindsight loss), not just final error. This is crucial for understanding why the "Cost of Learning" (Remark 4.5) implies high cumulative regret is actually a sign of successful convergence in the noiseless case.
  - **Quick check question:** In the noiseless effective case, does low cumulative regret imply success or failure? (Failure; it implies the algorithm didn't traverse the full "difficulty budget" to reach $w^*$).

- **Concept: Hardy Space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$ & Inner Functions**
  - **Why needed here:** The proofs regarding $\lambda$-effectiveness rely on mapping the problem to analytic functions on the unit disk. You cannot verify the convergence conditions (Theorem 7.7) without understanding the boundary behavior of these functions.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is the "inner function" property (unit modulus on the boundary) necessary here? (It allows the Parseval-type identity to hold, confirming the energy decomposition required for convergence).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Kaczmarz Core -> Projection Generator -> Regret Accumulator -> Lambda Controller
- **Critical path:**
  1. Select $\lambda$ (static or dynamic via noise estimates).
  2. Receive task/operator $X_t$ and observation $y_t$.
  3. Compute error residual $r_t$ and project onto row space of $X_t$.
  4. Update weight $w_t$.
  5. Accumulate regret; verify $\lambda$-effectiveness (if system properties are known).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Relaxation ($\lambda$):** High $\lambda$ (over-relaxation) reduces iteration count in specific cases but amplifies noise. Low $\lambda$ (under-relaxation) improves noise robustness but slows convergence.
  - **Block vs. Single:** Block methods (using $X_t$ matrices) generalize the update but require bounded pseudoinverse norms (Assumption 2.2).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Stagnating Regret:** If regret settles at a high value without decaying as $1/k$, the system is likely not $\lambda$-effective (e.g., using exponentials on a non-singular measure with $\lambda \neq 1$).
  - **Noise Explosion:** If $\lambda$ is set too high in a noisy environment, the term $\frac{2\lambda C}{2-\lambda}\sigma^2$ dominates, causing the average regret to grow.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline $\lambda$-Sweep:** Run the algorithm on a synthetic singular measure system with fixed noise. Plot average regret vs. $k$ for $\lambda \in \{0.5, 1.0, 1.5\}$ to validate the $1/(\lambda(2-\lambda))$ dependence.
  2. **Noise Robustness Check:** Fix $\lambda$ and vary $\sigma^2$. Confirm the linear dependence of the asymptotic regret floor on $\sigma^2$ (Theorem 4.6).
  3. **Effectiveness Boundary:** Apply the algorithm to a non-singular (Lebesgue) measure with $\lambda \neq 1$ and verify that convergence (regret decay) fails compared to the $\lambda=1$ case.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can high-probability or "tail" regret bounds be derived for the generalized Kaczmarz algorithm in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces?
- Can the combination of regret analysis and operator theory presented be extended to non-linear models or iterative methods beyond the Kaczmarz algorithm?
- How do the regret bounds behave if the uniform boundedness of the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse (Assumption 2.2) is relaxed for ill-posed problems?

## Limitations
- The $\lambda$-effectiveness condition, while necessary for strong $O(1/k)$ bounds, is difficult to verify in practice for general systems
- The analysis assumes i.i.d. noise and partial isometry operators, which may not hold in real-world applications
- The singular measure requirement for exponential systems with $\lambda \neq 1$ is a strong constraint that limits applicability

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The dimension-free $O(1/k)$ regret bounds (Theorem 2.4) and the noise-aware mixed regret decomposition (Theorem 3.1) are well-supported by the operator-theoretic analysis
- **Medium Confidence:** The $\lambda$-effectiveness condition and its characterization via Hardy space theory (Section 7) are mathematically sound but require careful numerical validation
- **Medium Confidence:** The optimal $\lambda$ selection formula (Corollary 4.7) provides explicit guidance but assumes known system properties

## Next Checks
1. **Numerical Verification of Bounds:** Implement a finite-dimensional approximation of the exponential system on a singular measure. Sweep $\lambda \in (0,2)$ and plot the empirical average regret vs. $k$ to verify the $O(1/(\lambda(2-\lambda)k))$ scaling and compare to the theoretical prediction.

2. **Noise Robustness Test:** Add i.i.d. Gaussian noise at varying levels $\sigma^2$ to the synthetic data. Confirm that the asymptotic regret floor scales linearly with $\sigma^2$ as predicted by Theorem 4.6, and validate the $\lambda^* = \sqrt{1+4C\sigma^2k} - 1$ optimal selection rule from Corollary 4.7.

3. **Effectiveness Boundary Experiment:** Construct a system where the spectral measure is a normalized Lebesgue measure (non-singular). Apply the algorithm with $\lambda \neq 1$ and verify that the regret does not decay as $1/k$, demonstrating the necessity of the singular measure condition for $\lambda$-effectiveness when $\lambda \neq 1$.
