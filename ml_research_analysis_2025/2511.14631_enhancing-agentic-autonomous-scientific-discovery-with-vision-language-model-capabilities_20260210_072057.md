## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for improving autonomous scientific discovery by incorporating vision-language models (VLMs) as intermediate evaluators of scientific plots. The core innovation is treating plots as checkpoints in multi-agent systems, where VLMs evaluate them against dynamically generated, domain-specific rubrics. This enables agents to correct their own errors in real-time and adapt research trajectories based on unexpected features.

The method is demonstrated through two workflows: a self-correction loop where faulty plots are debugged iteratively, and a discovery mode where anomalies trigger exploratory data analysis. In a 10-task benchmark spanning multiple scientific domains, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass@1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for text-only baselines. The approach also provides auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

## Method Summary
The method treats plot generation as a verifiable checkpoint in multi-agent scientific workflows, using VLMs to evaluate figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics. The system employs two modes: correction mode for iterative debugging of faulty plots, and discovery mode for exploring unexpected features. A hierarchical agent architecture (AG2-based) orchestrates the workflow, with separate agents handling visual evaluation, code reasoning, and experiment generation. The VLM evaluates plots using structured Pydantic schemas populated by runtime-generated rubrics, enabling consistent evaluation criteria across domains without manual specification.

## Key Results
- VLM-augmented systems achieve pass@1 scores of 0.7-0.8 across 10 scientific tasks, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for text-only baselines
- In correction mode, VLM identified a double-scaling bug in CMB spectra plotting, correctly pinpointing displaced acoustic peaks and proposing targeted code fixes
- In discovery mode, the system detected self-absorption dips in spectral lines and generated alternative experimental hypotheses for comparison

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Visual Checkpointing
Treating plot generation as verifiable checkpoints enables error detection that text/code analysis alone misses. Plots compress multiple analytical steps into a visual representation that VLMs can evaluate against domain-specific physical expectations, revealing misalignments invisible in summary statistics.

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic Rubric-Guided Evaluation
Context-specific rubrics generated at runtime enable consistent evaluation criteria across domains without manual specification. GPT-4o translates natural language tasks into domain-specific criteria that populate structured schemas constraining VLM output to checkable items.

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Visual-Reasoning Decomposition
Separating visual analysis from code reasoning reduces hallucination and grounds fixes in observed artifacts. The VLM sees only the plot and rubric, returning structured verdicts, while a separate agent receives VLM feedback and code to propose targeted fixes without access to full reasoning context.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration (AG2)**
  - Why needed: The system relies on hierarchical message passing, nested chats, and conditional handoffs. Understanding agent roles and state pruning is essential for debugging workflow failures.
  - Quick check: Can you trace which agent maintains the complete conversational history and which agents receive pruned subsets?

- **Vision-Language Model Capabilities and Limitations**
  - Why needed: VLMs provide the core evaluation signal. You need to know what visual reasoning patterns they reliably capture and where they fail.
  - Quick check: What types of visual discrepancies did the VLM successfully identify in the CMB case study, and what might it miss?

- **Pydantic Schemas for Structured Output**
  - Why needed: Deterministic routing depends on VLMs returning valid structured outputs. Understanding schema design and validation helps prevent parsing failures.
  - Quick check: What verdict values trigger the correction loop vs. the discovery workflow?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: User task → Planner → Control → Engineering Team → Code execution → Plot generation → Rubric Generator → Plot Judge/Scientist → Plot Debugger/Experiment Proposer → Engineering Team
- **Critical path**: 1) Task execution through engineering team to plot generation; 2) Rubric generation and VLM evaluation; 3) Correction loop or discovery mode based on VLM verdict; 4) Winner selection and narrative output
- **Design tradeoffs**: Correction vs discovery mode selection, rubric specificity vs flexibility, max retry iterations, text-only fallback availability
- **Failure signatures**: Stuck retry loops (over-constrained criteria), premature "continue" verdicts (under-specified rubrics), irrelevant exploratory experiments (misinterpreted anomalies), schema validation errors (output parsing failures)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline calibration with known-good task to verify correct verdicts; 2) Induced error recovery with double-scaling bug to test correction workflow; 3) Discovery mode trigger with spectral line anomalies to test exploratory analysis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- VLM effectiveness depends on training distribution covering scientific domains; novel visual signatures may cause false positives/negatives
- Rubric generation introduces failure point; under-specified criteria lead to unreliable VLM evaluation regardless of model capability
- Claims about broad domain applicability require validation beyond two detailed case studies; rubric generation robustness across domains unproven

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Iterative correction workflow and discovery mode mechanics are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Pass@1 benchmark results are plausible but depend on unreported hyperparameters and data accessibility
- **Low confidence**: Broad domain applicability claims require further validation beyond case studies

## Next Checks
1. **VLM Generalization Test**: Evaluate the VLM judge on deliberately generated plots from scientific domains not represented in the original benchmark to assess failure modes with novel visual patterns
2. **Rubric Robustness Audit**: Systematically vary the rubric generator's output by removing specific criteria from known-good tasks and measure the VLM's error detection rate
3. **Ablation on Visual vs Text Features**: Re-run the benchmark with plots replaced by equivalent numerical summaries and compare pass@1 scores to measure visual pattern recognition value
