- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive comparative analysis of DeepSeek, ChatGPT, and Google Gemini across architectures, training methodologies, and benchmark performance, highlighting each model's strengths and limitations

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of three leading large language models: DeepSeek, ChatGPT, and Google Gemini. The study evaluates their architectures, training methodologies, and performance across various benchmarks including reasoning, coding, and multilingual tasks. DeepSeek employs a Mixture-of-Experts approach for efficiency in domain-specific applications, ChatGPT leverages dense transformers with RLHF for conversational fluency, and Gemini uses a multimodal architecture for integrated text, code, and image processing. The authors analyze datasets, technical comparisons, and performance metrics, highlighting each model's strengths and limitations. The research offers insights into future directions for LLM development, emphasizing the potential of hybrid systems and the importance of ethical and sustainable AI practices.

## Method Summary
This systematic review employed the PRISMA methodology to analyze 59 papers on DeepSeek, ChatGPT, and Gemini. The evaluation used standardized benchmarks including MMLU, GPQA Diamond, MATH-500, HumanEval, HellaSwag, and CommonsenseQA, along with standardized exams like SAT, GRE, LSAT, and USMLE. Experiments used single-query setups with 1,000-token input prompts, processed independently without parallel execution. Performance was measured across accuracy, reasoning capability, response time, coherence, and cost-efficiency metrics, with normalized percentage scores across multiple industry-standard benchmarks.

## Key Results
- DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts architecture activates only task-relevant parameters, reducing computational overhead while maintaining domain-specific accuracy
- ChatGPT's RLHF training produces superior conversational fluency and alignment with human preferences compared to base models
- Gemini's multimodal transformer enables emergent reasoning across text, code, and image data through cross-attention fusion mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Conditional parameter activation reduces computational overhead while maintaining task-specific accuracy
- **Mechanism:** DeepSeek employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Instead of dense activation, the model uses a routing network to select a subset of "expert" parameters relevant to the specific input domain (e.g., medical or legal). This reduces the FLOPs per inference step compared to dense models
- **Core assumption:** The routing mechanism successfully identifies the correct domain experts without significant loss of information
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "DeepSeek employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach, activating only the parameters most relevant to the task..."; Section IV.A describes "MoE architecture conditionally activated pertinent parameters at inference, modulating computational cost to domain-specific prompts"
- **Break condition:** Performance degrades on mixed-domain prompts where routing ambiguity causes "expert" conflict or suboptimal selection

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Reward modeling steers text generation toward human-aligned conversational flow
- **Mechanism:** ChatGPT uses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). A reward model is trained on ranked human preferences. The main language model is then optimized via reinforcement learning (specifically PPO) to maximize this reward, prioritizing helpfulness and safety over raw predictive perplexity
- **Core assumption:** The reward model accurately generalizes human preferences to unseen data (distributional robustness)
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "...ChatGPT relies on a dense transformer model enhanced through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)..."; Section V.E mentions the combined objective: $L_{combined}(\Theta) = L_{NLL}(\Theta) - \alpha \cdot R(\Theta)$, where $R(\Theta)$ is the reward term
- **Break condition:** "Reward hacking" occurs where the model generates output that maximizes the reward score but is nonsensical or repetitive (mode collapse)

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Cross-attention fusion enables emergent reasoning across disparate data modalities
- **Mechanism:** Google Gemini utilizes a multimodal transformer. It uses cross-attention layers to project embeddings from different modalities (text, image patches, code) into a shared representational space. The formula $Z(img \to text) = \text{softmax}(\dots)V(img)$ describes how image context is integrated into text generation
- **Core assumption:** Visual and textual tokens can be effectively aligned in a shared geometric space without losing modality-specific nuance
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "...Gemini actually uses a multimodal transformer architecture that integrates text, code, and images..."; Section V.E describes the simplified cross-attention mechanism used to fuse image and text embeddings
- **Break condition:** "Semantic drift" where visual details (e.g., clock hands, specific object counts) are hallucinated or misinterpreted due to low-resolution patch encoding or attention dilution

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transformer Attention ($Q, K, V$)**
  - **Why needed here:** All three models rely on the self-attention mechanism described in the "Mathematical relationship" section (V.E). Understanding how Query, Key, and Value matrices interact is essential to grasp how Gemini performs cross-attention or how DeepSeek routes tokens
  - **Quick check question:** If you double the sequence length in a standard self-attention layer, what happens to the computational complexity? (Answer: Quadruples, $O(n^2)$)

- **Concept: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Routing**
  - **Why needed here:** DeepSeek's efficiency claim rests entirely on MoE. You must understand that not all parameters are active simultaneously to interpret the "cost-effective training" results
  - **Quick check question:** In a sparse MoE model with 100 experts and top-2 gating, what fraction of parameters are active for a single token? (Answer: Very small, typically ~1-2 experts plus shared parameters)

- **Concept: RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**
  - **Why needed here:** ChatGPT's distinct "conversational agility" is attributed to this. Understanding the shift from maximum likelihood (next-token prediction) to reward optimization explains why it feels more "aligned" than raw base models
  - **Quick check question:** What is the role of the "Reward Model" in RLHF? (Answer: It acts as a proxy for human judgment, scoring the LLM's outputs to guide training)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - DeepSeek: Input -> Router (MoE) -> Selected Experts (Active Params) -> Output (Specialized for high efficiency/reasoning)
  - ChatGPT: Input -> Dense Transformer Layers -> PPO Policy Optimization (RLHF) -> Output (Specialized for conversational context)
  - Gemini: Multimodal Input (Text/Image) -> Encoders -> Cross-Attention Fusion -> Output (Specialized for integrated reasoning)

- **Critical path:** Selecting the architecture depends on the resource constraint. If inference cost is the bottleneck, MoE (DeepSeek) is preferred. If the task requires interpreting visual diagrams and text simultaneously, Multimodal Transformers (Gemini) are required

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - MoE vs. Dense: MoE offers better "performance per FLOP" but suffers from training instability and higher memory bandwidth requirements (loading different experts)
  - Specialization vs. Generalization: Gemini aims for broad multimodal generalization but may exhibit "systematic errors" in specific visual details (Section I, Table I), whereas specialized reasoning models may lack conversational nuance

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Hallucinations: All models suffer, but RLHF models may hallucinate with higher confidence
  - Multimodal Misalignment: The paper notes Gemini may misrepresent simple visual details (e.g., clock times)
  - MoE Load Imbalance: DeepSeek may route too many tokens to a single expert, creating a bottleneck (Table I)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Cost/Reasoning Baseline: Run the MATH-500 benchmark on DeepSeek vs. ChatGPT to verify the "cost-effective reasoning" claim (Figure 8)
  2. Multimodal Stress Test: Input complex images with text overlays into Gemini to test the cross-attention limits described in the mechanism section
  3. Safety/Bias Evaluation: Use standardized prompts (as per Section II) to compare safety guardrails between the RLHF-tuned ChatGPT and the efficiency-tuned DeepSeek

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can a unified hybrid architecture effectively combine DeepSeek's cost efficiency, ChatGPT's conversational agility, and Gemini's multimodal integration without inheriting their individual weaknesses?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VII(B) states that "hybrid systems that merge the conversational ease of ChatGPT, the real-time data integration of Gemini, and DeepSeek's cost efficiency" represent a key future opportunity
- **Why unresolved:** Current architectures involve distinct trade-offs; for instance, Gemini's robust multimodal processing requires significantly higher computational resources than DeepSeek's text-focused MoE design
- **Evidence:** The successful deployment of a system that demonstrates superior cross-modal performance at a fraction of the training cost of current dense models

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can reflective mechanisms, such as refined chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques, be optimized to improve interpretability and accuracy without causing unacceptable latency?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VII(A) notes that while reflective techniques like CoT enhance error correction, they currently result in "additional computational overhead and increased latency"
- **Why unresolved:** The paper highlights that ensuring internal checks detect errors without introducing new biases or slowing down real-time application performance remains a difficult balance
- **Evidence:** A modified CoT framework that maintains high reasoning accuracy on benchmarks like MATH-500 while strictly reducing inference time compared to current reasoning models

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What specific ethical and regulatory benchmarks are necessary to standardize the evaluation of bias and safety across models trained under different data curation philosophies?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VII(B) calls for "robust ethical and regulatory standards" and "clear benchmarks for performance [and] fairness" to ensure systems are socially responsible
- **Why unresolved:** The paper observes that models like DeepSeek enforce strict censorship, while others like ChatGPT may hallucinate, creating inconsistent global applicability and safety standards
- **Evidence:** A standardized evaluation framework that successfully quantifies bias reduction and hallucination rates across models trained on disparate, culturally specific datasets

## Limitations
- **Data provenance and benchmark reproducibility:** Tables IX-X aggregate scores from external sources (artificialanalysis.ai) without full documentation of evaluation dates, model versions, or prompt templates
- **Architectural specificity gaps:** The paper lacks technical details on routing algorithms, cross-attention layer configurations, or reward model architectures
- **Temporal validity:** Claims are current as of February 2025 but LLM capabilities evolve rapidly, potentially invalidating comparisons

## Confidence
**High Confidence:**
- Comparative performance rankings across standard benchmarks
- Basic architectural descriptions (MoE for DeepSeek, dense transformers for ChatGPT, multimodal for Gemini)
- Training methodology summaries (RLHF for ChatGPT, web data for all models)

**Medium Confidence:**
- Specific efficiency metrics and parameter counts
- Nuanced performance differences in specialized domains
- Future prospects and research direction recommendations

**Low Confidence:**
- Exact numerical performance differentials without access to raw evaluation data
- Detailed claims about routing efficiency and cross-attention mechanisms
- Domain-specific reasoning superiority claims without benchmark replication

## Next Checks
1. **Benchmark Replication Protocol:** Execute standardized evaluation using official benchmark repositories (MMLU, HumanEval, MATH-500) with documented prompt templates, generation parameters, and model versions to verify claimed performance differentials
2. **Architecture Documentation Request:** Request technical specifications for DeepSeek's MoE routing algorithm, Gemini's cross-attention layer configurations, and ChatGPT's reward model architecture from respective model developers or through technical documentation analysis
3. **Temporal Stability Analysis:** Conduct repeated evaluations of key benchmarks across different time periods (e.g., monthly intervals) to quantify model performance volatility and assess the temporal validity of comparative claims
