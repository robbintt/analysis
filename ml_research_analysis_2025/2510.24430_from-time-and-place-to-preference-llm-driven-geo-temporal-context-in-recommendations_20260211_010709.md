# From Time and Place to Preference: LLM-Driven Geo-Temporal Context in Recommendations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.24430
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24430
- **Reference count**: 5
- **Primary result**: LLM-generated geo-temporal embeddings improve recommendation accuracy, especially for general users.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a scalable framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate geo-temporal embeddings from a timestamp and coarse location, capturing holidays, seasonal trends, and local/global events. The approach addresses the challenge of incorporating real-world context into recommendation systems without relying on static calendars or manual feature engineering. The framework is evaluated on MovieLens, LastFM, and a production dataset, demonstrating significant performance gains, particularly for general users. The embeddings are integrated into sequential models either through direct feature fusion or an auxiliary semantic alignment loss.

## Method Summary
The framework uses LLMs to generate embeddings for a given timestamp and coarse location, capturing temporal events, holidays, and local context. These geo-temporal embeddings are incorporated into sequential recommendation models through two integration methods: (1) direct feature fusion with metadata embeddings, and (2) an auxiliary loss that enforces semantic and geo-temporal alignment. The embeddings are pre-computed offline on a daily basis and injected into the model at inference. The framework is evaluated on MovieLens, LastFM, and a production dataset, with the latter two using the semantic alignment approach due to their larger size.

## Key Results
- Geo-temporal embeddings improve ranking metrics (HR and NDCG) on MovieLens and a production dataset.
- The framework shows the most significant gains for general users rather than niche segments.
- On LastFM, results were small and inconsistent, suggesting domain-dependent effectiveness.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by translating real-world temporal and geographical context into dense embeddings that capture the dynamic influences on user preferences. LLMs can interpret complex, context-rich information from timestamps and locations, such as holidays or major events, which static calendars cannot represent. By injecting these embeddings into sequential models, the system can adapt recommendations to changing user behavior patterns driven by real-world events. The auxiliary loss further aligns the learned representations with the geo-temporal context, reinforcing the model's sensitivity to external influences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Geo-temporal embeddings**: Dense vector representations that encode the influence of time and place on user behavior. *Why needed*: To capture dynamic, context-rich signals that static features miss. *Quick check*: Ensure embeddings reflect known events (e.g., holidays, festivals) in the data.
- **Semantic alignment loss**: A regularization term that encourages the model's learned representations to align with geo-temporal embeddings. *Why needed*: To strengthen the model's responsiveness to contextual cues. *Quick check*: Verify that the loss decreases during training and correlates with improved metrics.
- **Sequential recommendation models**: Models that predict user preferences based on their interaction history. *Why needed*: To leverage temporal patterns in user behavior. *Quick check*: Confirm that the model captures sequential dependencies in the interaction data.
- **Offline embedding generation**: Pre-computing geo-temporal embeddings in batches to reduce runtime cost. *Why needed*: To avoid real-time LLM API calls, which are expensive and slow. *Quick check*: Validate that daily embeddings remain relevant and accurate.
- **Coarse location inputs**: Using broad geographic regions instead of precise coordinates. *Why needed*: To improve scalability and reduce privacy concerns. *Quick check*: Ensure embeddings remain meaningful at the chosen level of geographic granularity.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Geo-temporal context (timestamp, location) -> LLM API -> Geo-temporal embeddings -> Sequential model (w/ or w/o auxiliary loss) -> Recommendations

**Critical Path**
1. Input timestamp and coarse location to LLM.
2. Generate geo-temporal embeddings offline.
3. Inject embeddings into sequential model at inference.
4. Train model with or without auxiliary semantic alignment loss.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Pre-computing embeddings reduces runtime cost but introduces up to 24h latency, missing real-time events.
- Using coarse location improves scalability but may miss hyper-local trends.
- Direct feature fusion is simple but may dilute the embedding's signal; auxiliary loss enforces alignment but adds training complexity.

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance on datasets with weak temporal or geographical signals (e.g., LastFM).
- Overfitting to specific events if embeddings are too fine-grained or noisy.
- High inference latency if embeddings are not cached or pre-computed.

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Evaluate embedding informativeness by correlating them with known events in the data.
2. Compare direct fusion vs. auxiliary loss integration on a small dataset.
3. Test the effect of varying the semantic alignment loss weight λ on model performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Do the offline improvements in ranking metrics translate to statistically significant gains in user engagement during live A/B testing?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state in the Conclusion, "As future work, we plan to... A/B test the propose approach in a production environment with actual user settings."
- **Why unresolved**: Offline metrics like Hit Rate (HR) and NDCG do not always correlate with real-world user satisfaction or retention due to factors like position bias.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Results from controlled online experiments showing significant increases in click-through rates or watch time.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the framework generalize to domains with weaker geo-temporal signals, such as music streaming, where initial results were inconsistent?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper notes that results on the LastFM dataset were "small and inconsistent," suggesting the method's effectiveness may be domain-dependent despite the authors' goal of a domain-agnostic framework.
- **Why unresolved**: It is unclear if the lack of improvement on LastFM is due to the specific dataset characteristics or a fundamental mismatch between LLM-generated event context and music preferences.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A comparative analysis of embedding informativeness across diverse domains or specific prompt engineering tailored to non-event-driven consumption.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can the framework be optimized for real-time responsiveness to breaking events without relying solely on daily pre-computation?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The methodology relies on an "offline job that generates ground-truth... for the following day," which may fail to capture the "real-time changes" and "dynamic context" highlighted as key motivations in the Introduction.
- **Why unresolved**: The current implementation introduces a latency of up to 24 hours, potentially missing the immediate impact of sudden global events on user preferences.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches that inject context at inference time compared to the daily batch method.

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness is primarily validated on MovieLens, LastFM, and one production dataset, with limited testing on other recommendation domains.
- The LLM-driven embedding generation relies on an external API (OpenAI), introducing potential cost, latency, and reproducibility concerns.
- The semantic alignment loss requires tuning a weighting parameter λ, but the sensitivity analysis is limited to a narrow range.

## Confidence
- **High**: Core claim that geo-temporal embeddings improve recommendation quality on evaluated datasets.
- **Medium**: Generalization to new domains or finer-grained location data.
- **Medium**: Effectiveness of the auxiliary loss mechanism.
- **Low**: Reproducibility of LLM-generated embeddings across different API versions or providers.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework on additional recommendation datasets (e.g., e-commerce, news) to test domain generalization.
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis for the semantic alignment loss weight λ across a broader range and on multiple datasets.
3. Implement and test the framework with alternative LLM providers or open-source models to assess reproducibility and cost-effectiveness.
