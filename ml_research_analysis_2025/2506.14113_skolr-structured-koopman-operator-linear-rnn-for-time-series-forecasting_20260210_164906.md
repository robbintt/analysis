# SKOLR: Structured Koopman Operator Linear RNN for Time-Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14113
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14113
- Authors: Yitian Zhang; Liheng Ma; Antonios Valkanas; Boris N. Oreshkin; Mark Coates
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SKOLR achieves state-of-the-art performance with linear RNN efficiency, reaching MSE as low as 0.132 on Weather dataset while using only 3.31 MiB GPU memory and training 4× faster than best baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a theoretical connection between Koopman operator approximation and linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time-series forecasting. By representing dynamic states using time-delayed observations, the authors show that a structured Koopman operator is equivalent to linear RNN updates. The proposed SKOLR model integrates learnable spectral decomposition with a parallelized linear RNN stack, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
SKOLR represents dynamic states through time-delayed observations and connects this representation to linear RNN updates through structured Koopman operator approximation. The model uses learnable spectral decomposition combined with a parallelized linear RNN stack to implement the structured Koopman operator. This architecture allows SKOLR to maintain the computational advantages of linear RNNs while achieving superior forecasting performance through the Koopman operator framework.

## Key Results
- Achieves MSE as low as 0.132 on Weather benchmark dataset
- Shows up to 10.9% improvement over Koopman-based alternatives on chaotic systems
- Uses only 3.31 MiB GPU memory while training 4× faster than the best-performing baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper establishes that time-delayed observations can represent dynamic states in a way that makes structured Koopman operators equivalent to linear RNN updates. This equivalence allows the model to leverage the theoretical advantages of Koopman operator theory while maintaining the computational efficiency of linear RNNs. The learnable spectral decomposition component enables the model to adaptively capture the underlying dynamics of the time series, while the parallelized linear RNN stack implements the structured Koopman operator efficiently.

## Foundational Learning
- Koopman operator theory: Provides a linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems by lifting states into a higher-dimensional space where dynamics become linear
  - Why needed: Enables linear modeling of complex nonlinear dynamics through spectral decomposition
  - Quick check: Verify that the lifted space captures the essential dynamics through eigenvalue analysis

- Time-delayed embedding: Uses past observations at different time lags to construct a higher-dimensional state representation
  - Why needed: Creates a complete representation of system dynamics without requiring explicit state space models
  - Quick check: Confirm that embedding dimension is sufficient to reconstruct the attractor geometry

- Spectral decomposition: Factorizes the Koopman operator into eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that capture the system's dynamic modes
  - Why needed: Enables efficient representation and computation of the operator through its spectral properties
  - Quick check: Validate that learned eigenvalues correspond to meaningful temporal frequencies in the data

- Linear RNN updates: Applies linear transformations to hidden states across time steps
- Why needed: Provides computational efficiency while maintaining expressive power through recurrence
- Quick check: Verify that the linear recurrence captures the dominant dynamic modes

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Time-delayed observations -> Structured Koopman operator -> Linear RNN stack -> Forecasting output

Critical path: Input time series → Time-delay embedding → Spectral decomposition learning → Parallel linear RNN updates → Forecast prediction

Design tradeoffs:
- Spectral decomposition complexity vs. computational efficiency
- Embedding dimension selection vs. model capacity
- Parallelization degree vs. hardware utilization
- Linear approximation accuracy vs. model simplicity

Failure signatures:
- Poor performance on highly nonlinear dynamics where linear approximation breaks down
- Sensitivity to embedding dimension selection
- Convergence issues in spectral decomposition learning
- Memory bottlenecks when scaling to very long sequences

3 first experiments:
1. Validate time-delayed embedding reconstruction on synthetic chaotic systems
2. Test spectral decomposition convergence and eigenvalue stability
3. Benchmark computational efficiency against standard linear RNN implementations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Computational efficiency claims require validation across diverse hardware configurations and longer sequence lengths
- GPU memory claim of 3.31 MiB appears exceptionally low and needs independent verification
- Parallelized linear RNN stack implementation details are not fully specified
- Limited comparison with nonlinear Koopman-based alternatives

## Confidence
- High: Theoretical connection between Koopman operators and linear RNNs through time-delayed observations
- Medium: Computational efficiency claims relative to baselines
- Medium: Empirical performance improvements over Koopman-based alternatives
- Low: Generalizability of performance gains to diverse time-series domains

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark SKOLR against additional Koopman-based methods including nonlinear approximations and verify computational efficiency claims across multiple hardware platforms
2. Test SKOLR on longer sequence lengths (>1000 timesteps) to assess scalability and whether the 4× speedup holds for large-scale problems
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of spectral decomposition, time-delayed embedding, and parallel RNN stack to determine which components drive the performance improvements
