# Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT): A Novel Framework for Evaluating Goal-Oriented Agentic AI Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23006
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23006
- Authors: Hassen Dhrif
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: 120% increase in daily listening time, 146% increase in content discovery rates, and 71% increase in service retention through improved goal alignment in voice-activated audio systems

## Executive Summary
The CAT framework addresses a critical gap in evaluating how well AI system tasks align with their intended goals, moving beyond basic task-level metrics to measure meaningful user outcomes. It introduces a three-layer architecture that systematically connects task execution to goal achievement through a Goal Achievement Index (GAI) and pattern recognition system. Validated through synthetic Alexa+ audio services data, CAT demonstrates significant improvements in user engagement and content discovery, showing promise for goal-oriented AI evaluation across diverse audio domains.

## Method Summary
The CAT framework employs a three-layer architecture: a Goal Layer defining strategic objectives, an Execution Monitoring Layer using pattern recognition algorithms to observe system behavior, and an Integration Layer that combines evaluation streams into actionable metrics. The core methodology computes a Goal Achievement Index (GAI) using weighted task performance and goal progress indicators, models dependencies between task execution and goal achievement through hidden states, and optimizes via Markov Decision Processes. Implementation follows a four-phase cycle of strategic decomposition, baseline assessment, dynamic evaluation, and adaptive optimization. The framework was validated using synthetic interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, with evaluation metrics including daily listening time, content discovery rate, and service retention.

## Key Results
- 120% increase in daily listening time compared to baseline systems
- 146% improvement in content discovery rates
- 71% increase in service retention
- Transfer success rates across audio domains ranging from 68% to 87%, with cross-domain patterns identified as key feature vector components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Goal Achievement Index (GAI) provides a quantifiable measure of alignment between low-level task execution and high-level goal achievement.
- Mechanism: A weighted ratio formula aggregates normalized task performance metrics (Ti) with goal progress indicators (Gi), using context-sensitive weights (wi) that adjust for operational conditions. The formula GAI = Σ(wi·Ti·Gi) / Σ(wi·Ti) produces a bounded score where both inputs range [0,1].
- Core assumption: Task-level performance metrics have a stable, quantifiable relationship to goal progress indicators that can be captured through linear weighting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "introduces a three-layer architecture that systematically connects task execution to goal achievement, using a Goal Achievement Index"
  - [Section 3.2]: Explicitly defines GAI formula with podcast discovery example showing Topic Classification (0.92) mapped to Episode Completion (0.65)
  - [corpus]: Weak direct support—neighbor papers focus on adversarial generation and security testing rather than goal-task alignment metrics.
- Break condition: If task-goal relationships are highly non-linear, context-dependent in unpredictable ways, or if goals conflict such that no single index can capture tradeoffs, GAI may produce misleading scores.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A probabilistic pattern recognition system models dependencies between task execution states and goal achievement states via hidden intermediate states.
- Mechanism: The framework computes P(g|t) = ∫P(g|h,t)·P(h|t)dh across state space S, where hidden states h (e.g., user satisfaction) mediate between task execution t (e.g., command processing) and goal achievement g (e.g., sustained engagement). Three-stage process: task-state mapping, state-goal relationship modeling, and integration.
- Core assumption: Hidden states exist and can be modeled as mediating variables with tractable conditional distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.3]: Full probabilistic formulation with audiobook example (t: voice command → h: attention/comprehension → g: book completion)
  - [Section 4.2.2]: Modified F1 score incorporating entropy H(p) for pattern complexity
  - [corpus]: No direct mechanistic support; corpus papers emphasize adversarial attacks and role-based ambiguity rather than probabilistic goal modeling.
- Break condition: If hidden states are not observable or inferable with sufficient accuracy, or if the conditional dependencies P(g|h,t) and P(h|t) are unstable across contexts, the integration will propagate error.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical decomposition of strategic objectives into measurable components enables systematic evaluation across abstraction levels.
- Mechanism: A four-phase implementation—Strategic Decomposition (Si = f(Gi, Mi, Ci)), Baseline Assessment, Dynamic Evaluation, and Adaptive Optimization (framed as MDP)—creates a continuous improvement cycle. The decomposition function applies d (decomposition), m (metric mapping), and w (weighting) operators sequentially.
- Core assumption: Strategic objectives can be decomposed without loss of semantic coherence and the resulting metrics remain meaningful proxies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.4.1]: Formal decomposition function with audio content discovery example (Gi: engagement duration, completion rate; Mi: session >30min, completion >80%)
  - [Section 3.5]: Integration function I(c,f) balancing quality Q, cost C, and performance P with tunable λ weights
  - [corpus]: No direct support—corpus papers do not address hierarchical evaluation frameworks for agentic systems.
- Break condition: If decomposition loses critical goal semantics, or if constraints (Ci) such as bandwidth or licensing prevent metric measurement, the framework cannot close the evaluation loop.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
  - Why needed here: Phase IV optimization is explicitly framed as an MDP with policy π*, discount factor γ, and utility function U. Understanding state-action-reward formalisms is prerequisite to adapting the adaptive optimization component.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the discount factor γ must be in [0,1) and how it affects long-horizon goal optimization?

- **Concept: Probabilistic Graphical Models / Conditional Independence**
  - Why needed here: The pattern recognition system's factorization P(g|t) = ∫P(g|h,t)·P(h,t)dh assumes a specific conditional independence structure. Interpreting and validating this structure requires fluency in latent variable models.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for h to mediate the relationship between t and g, and how would you test this mediation assumption empirically?

- **Concept: Goal Alignment in Agentic Systems**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central claim is that current evaluation focuses on task efficacy (agent/tool selection) rather than goal alignment. Understanding the distinction between instrumental and terminal goals is essential.
  - Quick check question: For a podcast recommendation agent, what is the difference between a task metric (e.g., "topic classification accuracy") and a goal metric (e.g., "episode completion rate"), and why might optimizing the former not improve the latter?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Goal Layer (strategic objectives) -> Execution Monitoring Layer (pattern recognition and hidden state modeling) -> Integration Layer (GAI computation and MDP optimization)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define goals Gi with explicit measurement criteria Mi and constraints Ci (Section 3.4.1)
  2. Establish baseline B(s) using weighted performance metrics (Equation 4)
  3. Deploy GAI computation and pattern recognition in production or simulation
  4. Run adaptive optimization as MDP to update policy π*
  5. Integrate via I(c,f) balancing quality, cost, and performance

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Synthetic vs. real data: Paper uses synthetic data for privacy and edge-case coverage; limits ecological validity
  - Metric complexity vs. interpretability: Modified F1* with entropy captures pattern complexity but may obscure failure root causes
  - Weight specification: Dynamic weights (wi, vi, λi) require domain expertise; incorrect weighting distorts GAI

- **Failure signatures:**
  - GAI consistently high but goal metrics stagnant: Task-goal mapping is misspecified
  - Pattern recognition F1* drops sharply: Hidden state modeling P(h|t) may be unstable under distribution shift
  - Cross-domain transfer success <70%: Feature vector components may not capture transferable structure

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation:** Compute GAI for an existing voice service using historical task and goal metrics; compare against expert judgment of goal alignment to test convergent validity.
  2. **Ablation on weighting schemes:** Vary wi assignments (equal weights vs. context-adaptive) and measure impact on GAI sensitivity to known goal-relevant changes.
  3. **Hidden state probing:** For a single domain (e.g., music streaming), instrument user satisfaction surveys as proxy for h; estimate P(h|t) and P(g|h,t) separately to test whether the factorization holds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does CAT framework performance compare when validated with real user interaction data versus synthetic data?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "We acknowledge that this synthetic data has limitations and may not capture all nuances of real-world interactions... real-world application would require additional validation and refinement of the framework's components."
  - Why unresolved: All reported results (120% improvement in listening time, 146% in content discovery) derive from synthetic data modeled after aggregate statistics, not actual user interactions.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A/B testing on production Alexa+ systems comparing CAT-enhanced versus baseline configurations with real user engagement metrics.

- **Open Question 2:** What evaluation approaches can effectively handle multi-intent voice queries within the CAT framework?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "Our experiments indicate challenges in evaluating systems handling multi-intent voice queries" (Section 5.5).
  - Why unresolved: The current Goal Achievement Index (GAI) formulation assumes single-task-to-goal mapping, but complex queries may involve multiple simultaneous goals with conflicting success criteria.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Extended GAI formulation demonstrating reliable evaluation on synthetic multi-intent query datasets, validated against human judgments of goal satisfaction.

- **Open Question 3:** What transfer learning mechanisms can improve cross-domain adaptation between audio domains with dissimilar consumption patterns?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "The lower success rate in audio to music transfer (68%) indicates challenges in adapting between long-form and short-form content consumption patterns" and "Further investigation of transfer learning mechanisms across audio domains" identified as future work.
  - Why unresolved: The transfer metric τ(s₁, s₂) shows 19-point gap between best (87% music→podcast) and worst (68% audio→music) transfer, suggesting current feature vectors insufficiently capture transferable representations.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Modified feature representations or domain adaptation techniques achieving <10% variance in transfer success rates across all domain pairs.

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on synthetic data (1M interaction points) raises concerns about ecological validity when transferred to real-world systems.
- Key parameters including the probabilistic model for synthetic data generation, hidden state inference algorithm, and prediction model for engagement remain unspecified.
- The weighted GAI formula assumes linear relationships between task performance and goal achievement that may not hold across diverse contexts or when goals conflict.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The three-layer architectural framework provides a coherent structure for connecting task execution to goal achievement
- Medium confidence: The GAI formula produces bounded scores that can distinguish alignment levels, though weighting sensitivity remains a concern
- Low confidence: Pattern recognition system's ability to accurately model hidden states and their mediation effects has limited empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain transferability test:** Apply CAT framework to a non-audio domain (e.g., customer service chatbots) and measure Goal Achievement Ratio improvement against baseline systems
2. **Weight sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary wi weights in GAI computation across multiple domains to identify thresholds where score manipulation becomes possible without goal improvement
3. **Hidden state validation:** Use A/B testing to correlate inferred hidden states h with explicit user satisfaction surveys, measuring correlation strength and temporal stability
