# CND-IDS: Continual Novelty Detection for Intrusion Detection Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.14094
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14094
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Up to 6.1× F-score improvement over state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning algorithms for intrusion detection

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of detecting evolving cyber attacks in intrusion detection systems when only unlabeled streaming network traffic is available. CND-IDS introduces a continual novelty detection framework that combines a continual feature extractor with a PCA-based novelty detector trained solely on normal data. The method achieves superior performance in detecting both known and zero-day attacks while adapting to evolving threat patterns, demonstrating up to 6.1× F-score improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
CND-IDS addresses two key challenges in intrusion detection: evolving cyber attacks and lack of labeled attack data. The framework uses a Continual Feature Extractor (CFE) - a 4-layer MLP autoencoder that continuously updates feature representations using a novel continual novelty detection loss. This loss combines cluster separation (via K-Means pseudo-labeling and triplet margin loss), reconstruction, and continual learning losses. The PCA-based novelty detector is trained solely on normal data and identifies attacks by thresholding PCA reconstruction errors. The method is evaluated on four realistic intrusion datasets and demonstrates superior performance in detecting both known and zero-day attacks while maintaining low computational overhead suitable for real-time deployment.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 6.1× F-score improvement compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning algorithms
- Demonstrates 6.5× better forward transfer for zero-day attack detection
- Shows consistent performance across four diverse intrusion datasets (CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15, WUSTL-IIoT, XIIoTID)
- Maintains low computational overhead suitable for real-time deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by continuously updating feature representations to adapt to evolving attack patterns while maintaining separation between normal and anomalous clusters. The cluster separation loss ensures that normal traffic remains well-separated from attack traffic in the learned feature space, while the reconstruction loss preserves important data characteristics. The continual learning loss prevents catastrophic forgetting by maintaining similarity between current and past embeddings. The PCA detector then effectively identifies anomalies based on reconstruction errors in this optimized feature space.

## Foundational Learning
- **PCA for novelty detection**: Why needed - detects anomalies by measuring reconstruction error; Quick check - verify 95% variance retention captures normal patterns
- **Triplet margin loss**: Why needed - enforces separation between normal and anomalous clusters; Quick check - ensure margin of 2 effectively separates clusters
- **Continual learning regularization**: Why needed - prevents catastrophic forgetting across experiences; Quick check - verify L_CL maintains similarity between current and past embeddings
- **Best-F thresholding**: Why needed - optimizes detection threshold for maximum F1 score; Quick check - confirm thresholding maximizes F1 on validation data
- **K-Means clustering for pseudo-labels**: Why needed - provides supervision signal for cluster separation loss; Quick check - validate elbow method produces meaningful cluster counts
- **Autoencoder feature extraction**: Why needed - learns compressed representations for efficient anomaly detection; Quick check - verify reconstruction loss captures essential data patterns

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Network traffic -> CFE (4-layer MLP autoencoder) -> Encoded features -> PCA -> Reconstruction error -> Anomaly score -> Binary detection
- **Critical path**: CFE training with CND loss -> PCA fitting on normal data -> Reconstruction error computation -> Best-F thresholding -> Detection
- **Design tradeoffs**: Reconstruction vs cluster separation vs continual learning losses (λ_R=λ_CL=0.1); fixed architecture vs adaptive complexity; PCA vs more complex detectors
- **Failure signatures**: Negative BwdTrans indicates catastrophic forgetting; low FwdTrans suggests poor zero-day detection; high false positives indicate PCA not capturing normal patterns
- **First experiments**: 1) Train CFE on single experience with cluster separation loss; 2) Fit PCA on encoded normal data and compute reconstruction errors; 3) Apply Best-F thresholding and evaluate F1 score

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How robust is CND-IDS when the "clean normal data" (Nc) used to train the PCA novelty detector contains some proportion of adversarial or attack samples?
- Can CND-IDS maintain its advantages when subjected to adversarial perturbations designed to evade the reconstruction-error detector?
- How does CND-IDS perform in scenarios where normal network behavior itself drifts significantly over time (concept drift in benign traffic)?

## Limitations
- Relies on access to clean normal data (Nc) which may not be available in all deployment scenarios
- Performance depends on K-Means clustering quality and cluster count selection
- May struggle with concept drift in normal traffic patterns over extended periods

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core methodology combining continual feature extraction with PCA-based novelty detection is clearly specified and theoretically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: CND loss formulation and sequential training procedure are adequately described, though implementation details could affect results
- **Low Confidence**: Dataset-specific preprocessing details, K-Means hyperparameter selection, and Best-F thresholding implementation remain unclear

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the Best-F thresholding method on a simple synthetic dataset to ensure it correctly maximizes F1 score as intended
2. Test the cluster separation loss with varying K values (5, 10, 15) on a subset of data to verify the elbow method produces consistent, meaningful cluster assignments
3. Verify backward transfer (BwdTrans) implementation by specifically testing catastrophic forgetting scenarios with controlled experience sequences and ensuring L_CL correctly preserves knowledge from previous experiences
