# BEAT2AASIST model with layer fusion for ESDD 2026 Challenge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15180
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15180
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Third-place ranking on Track 2 with 0.35% EER

## Executive Summary
The ESDD 2026 Challenge addresses environmental sound deepfake detection, a novel task where realistic audio manipulation poses growing risks. The BEAT2AASIST method extends BEATs-AASIST by splitting BEATs features along frequency or channel dimensions and processing through dual AASIST branches. This enables specialized detection of spoofing cues, while multi-layer fusion strategies and vocoder-based augmentation improve robustness. The approach achieves competitive performance across challenge tracks, with ensemble models reaching 0.35% EER on Track 2.

## Method Summary
BEAT2AASIST processes mel-spectrograms through a pretrained BEATs encoder to obtain 768-dim token sequences, which are split along frequency or channel dimensions. Each split feeds an independent AASIST branch for graph-based classification. Top-k transformer layer fusion (k=4 or 10) uses concatenation, CNN-gated, or SE-gated strategies to enrich representations. Vocoder augmentation (HiFi-GAN, BigV-GAN, UnivNet) generates proxy artifacts for unseen spoofing methods. Models train with weighted cross-entropy (fake=0.1, real=0.9) and SpecAug for 20 epochs at batch size 32.

## Key Results
- Track 1: 1.60% EER (single model) to 1.15% EER (ensemble)
- Track 2: 0.46% EER (single model) to 0.35% EER (ensemble)
- Frequency-based splitting with CNN-gate fusion performs best on Track 2
- Channel-based splitting with SE-gate fusion performs best on Track 1
- Third-place ranking on Track 2 in official challenge evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Splitting BEATs-derived features and processing through dual AASIST branches improves detection of complementary spoofing cues. The 768-dim BEATs output tensor splits along frequency axis (high/low halves) or channel axis (384-dim each), with each branch specializing in processing specific artifact distributions. This forces the model to capture non-uniform artifact patterns across dimensions.

### Mechanism 2
Aggregating top-k transformer layers via gated fusion yields richer representations than using only the final layer. BEATs produces 12 layer outputs; top-k layers (4 or 10) fuse via concatenation, CNN-gated (3 conv layers + softmax on mel-spectrogram), or SE-gated (channel-wise attention on layer outputs). Early layers capture local patterns while later layers capture semantic content.

### Mechanism 3
Vocoder-based augmentation improves generalization to unseen TTA/ATA generators. Neural vocoders (HiFi-GAN, BigV-GAN, UnivNet) convert mel-spectrograms to waveforms via copy-synthesis, introducing vocoder-specific artifacts. The detector learns artifact patterns common across vocoder families as proxies for generative model fingerprints.

## Foundational Learning

- **Self-supervised audio representations (BEATs)**: Essential for understanding BEATs as the front-end feature extractor converting mel-spectrograms to 768-dim token sequences via patch embedding and transformer stack. Quick check: Can you explain why BEATs uses discrete audio tokenizers rather than continuous features?

- **Graph-based anti-spoofing (AASIST)**: Critical for understanding AASIST as the back-end classifier using spectro-temporal graph attention to model relationships between time and frequency nodes. Quick check: How does AASIST differ from standard classification heads in modeling spectro-temporal dependencies?

- **Vocoder architectures and artifacts**: Necessary for grasping why different vocoders (HiFi-GAN, BigV-GAN, UnivNet) introduce characteristic artifacts. Quick check: What phase or spectral artifacts does HiFi-GAN typically introduce in synthesized audio?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Mel-spectrogram (128 bins, 25ms frame, 10ms shift) → BEATs encoder (pretrained, 12 transformer layers) → Layer selector (top-k, k ∈ {4, 10}) → Fusion module (concat | CNN-gate | SE-gate) → Feature splitter (freq-axis | channel-axis) → Dual AASIST branches (independent graph attention) → Output concatenation → Binary classification

- **Critical path**: BEATs feature quality → Fusion weight computation → Split decision (freq vs channel) → AASIST graph attention. Errors propagate; bad features cannot be recovered downstream.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Frequency vs channel splitting captures spectral vs distributed representation patterns. Paper shows channel+SE-gate wins Track 1 (1.70% EER), freq+CNN-gate wins Track 2 (0.46% EER). k=4 vs k=10: smaller k is faster but may miss early-layer artifacts. Ensemble overhead: best results require 2-3 model ensembles; single-model deployment trades 0.05-0.15% EER for inference simplicity.

- **Failure signatures**: High EER on unseen generators: vocoder augmentation insufficient → add generator-specific augmentation or domain adaptation. Large eval-test gap: overfitting to progress set → increase SpecAug intensity, reduce model capacity. Frequency-split underperforming channel-split: artifacts localized in embedding space rather than spectral space → switch to channel splitting.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline validation: Run BEATs-AASIST (single branch, k=4 concat) on Track 2 dev set. Target: ≤0.75% EER per Table 1 #1.
  2. Ablation: split strategy: Compare frequency vs channel splitting with SE-gate (k=4) on fixed dev split. Hypothesis: channel splitting outperforms on Track 1, frequency on Track 2.
  3. Ablation: fusion strategy: With best split from #2, compare concat vs CNN-gate vs SE-gate. Hypothesis: gated fusion outperforms concat by 0.1-0.2% EER.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Why does frequency-based splitting outperform channel-based splitting on Track 2, while channel-based splitting achieves better performance on Track 1? No analysis is provided linking track-specific dataset characteristics to the effectiveness of each splitting strategy.

### Open Question 2
What determines the optimal top-k transformer layer count for different fusion strategies, and can it be predicted a priori? The relationship between fusion type, splitting dimension, and optimal layer depth remains uncharacterized.

### Open Question 3
How effectively does vocoder-based augmentation transfer to unseen TTA/ATA generators not represented in the augmentation set? The assumption that vocoder artifacts serve as proxies for generative model fingerprints lacks empirical validation.

### Open Question 4
Why does the "extremely low-resource" Track 2 achieve substantially lower EER (0.35%) than Track 1 (1.60%) despite having less training data? This counterintuitive result is not discussed.

## Limitations
- Missing architecture details for AASIST, CNN-gate, and SE-gate modules
- No ablation studies on vocoder augmentation effectiveness
- Layer fusion transferability to environmental audio not validated
- Lack of analysis explaining track-specific performance differences

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims**:
- Environmental sound deepfake detection is a novel and important task
- BEATs-AASIST baseline provides competitive performance
- EnvSDD 2026 Challenge dataset and evaluation framework are valid

**Medium Confidence Claims**:
- Dual-branch processing improves detection of complementary spoofing cues
- Layer fusion strategies enrich feature representations
- Vocoder augmentation improves generalization to unseen methods

**Low Confidence Claims**:
- Specific performance gains from each architectural modification
- Optimal hyperparameters for layer fusion and splitting strategies
- Relative importance of different spoofing cues across environmental sound categories

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture Implementation Validation**: Implement the exact BEATs-AASIST baseline with single branch and k=4 concatenation fusion. Verify that baseline EER matches or exceeds 0.75% on Track 2 development set before proceeding with dual-branch modifications.

2. **Split Strategy Ablation**: Systematically compare frequency-based vs channel-based splitting on fixed development data using SE-gate fusion (k=4). Measure not only EER differences but also analyze which split strategy better detects known artifact patterns in the dataset.

3. **Vocoder Augmentation Impact**: Train models with and without vocoder augmentation on the same data splits. Measure both in-domain performance (progress set) and out-of-domain generalization (black-box test set) to quantify the actual robustness benefits.
