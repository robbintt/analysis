- Introduces benchmark suite evaluating LLMs' grounded planning and reasoning in text-based BabyAI environment

## Executive Summary
LLM-BabyBench is a novel benchmark suite designed to evaluate the grounded planning and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in a text-based interactive environment derived from the BabyAI platform. The suite comprises three tasks—predicting environment state changes from action sequences, generating low-level action plans to achieve subgoals, and decomposing high-level instructions into subgoal sequences—each supported by tailored datasets generated from expert agent traces. A standardized evaluation harness enables reproducible benchmarking, including environment interaction for validating generated plans. Baseline evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal significant performance gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and hierarchical task decomposition, with success rates varying widely across difficulty levels and model architectures. The benchmark highlights the current limitations of LLMs in grounded reasoning and provides a controlled, extensible framework for future research in embodied AI. All resources, including datasets, code, and evaluation tools, are publicly available.

## Method Summary
LLM-BabyBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing grounded reasoning in LLMs through three distinct tasks: Predict (state change prediction from action sequences), Plan (generating low-level navigation action sequences), and Decompose (breaking high-level instructions into subgoal sequences). The benchmark leverages the BabyAI platform's grid world environment, using expert agent traces to generate ground truth data across 16 levels spanning Easy to Very Hard difficulties. All experiments employ Tree-of-Thought prompting strategies, with results validated through environment interaction. The evaluation harness provides standardized metrics including success rates, efficiency ratios, and comprehension/precision rates, enabling direct comparison across different LLM architectures and prompting approaches.

## Key Results
- Models show significant performance degradation from Easy (78% success) to Very Hard levels (22% success), highlighting difficulty scaling challenges
- Spatial reasoning limitations evident in maze-like environments where models fail to maintain consistent positional tracking
- Hierarchical task decomposition collapses on long-horizon missions, with Precision Rate dropping to 0% for 7+ subgoal sequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its controlled environment that isolates specific reasoning capabilities while maintaining ecological validity. By using expert agent traces as ground truth, the benchmark establishes clear performance baselines against which LLM capabilities can be measured. The text-based interface enables direct LLM interaction without requiring multimodal processing, focusing evaluation on reasoning rather than perception. The three-task structure progressively challenges different aspects of grounded reasoning: state prediction tests spatial reasoning, plan generation evaluates sequential decision-making, and decomposition assesses hierarchical thinking. The standardized evaluation harness ensures reproducibility and fair comparison across models by controlling for environmental factors and providing consistent metrics.

## Foundational Learning

**BabyAI Environment** - Grid-based world with rooms, objects, and navigation challenges; needed because it provides a controlled setting for testing spatial reasoning and planning without requiring complex perception systems; quick check: verify environment renders correctly with MiniGrid dependencies installed.

**Tree-of-Thought Prompting** - Multi-step reasoning approach where models generate and evaluate multiple solution paths; needed because it enables systematic exploration of planning strategies and subgoal decomposition; quick check: confirm ToT implementation supports configurable branching depth and evaluation criteria.

**Omniscient Observation** - Full grid state visibility during task execution; needed because it eliminates perception uncertainty, isolating reasoning capabilities from sensory processing challenges; quick check: verify environment provides complete state information in observation format.

**Subgoal Hierarchy** - Decomposition of high-level tasks into atomic actions (GoNextTo, Pickup, etc.); needed because it enables structured planning and provides measurable intermediate steps for evaluation; quick check: ensure subgoal definitions align with BabyAI action vocabulary.

**Efficiency Metrics** - Comparison of LLM-generated vs optimal action sequence lengths; needed because it quantifies planning quality beyond binary success/failure; quick check: verify optimal plan generation works correctly for benchmark levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** GitHub Repo -> Evaluation Harness -> BabyAI Environment -> LLM Inference -> Datasets (Predict/Plan/Decompose)

**Critical Path:** Model selection → ToT prompting setup → Dataset loading → Environment initialization → Plan execution → Metric computation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Omniscient observation simplifies reasoning evaluation but reduces ecological validity compared to partial observability; text-based interface focuses on reasoning over perception but may not capture multimodal challenges of real robotics.

**Failure Signatures:** Maze navigation degradation (positional tracking errors), long-horizon decomposition collapse (omitted intermediate subgoals), coordinate system confusion (incorrect final position calculations)

**First Experiments:** 1) Run Predict task on single-room level with Claude/GPT-4o to verify basic functionality, 2) Execute Plan task on Easy difficulty with local open model to test environment interaction, 3) Test Decompose task with ToT prompting on 3-subgoal mission to validate hierarchical reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- OmniBot expert agent ground truth generation may introduce systematic biases that don't reflect human-like reasoning strategies
- Omniscient observation setting creates unrealistic information access compared to embodied agents with partial visibility
- Performance gaps across difficulty levels may reflect task design rather than fundamental LLM limitations

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The benchmark's core contribution as a standardized evaluation framework is well-supported. The dataset generation methodology, task definitions, and evaluation harness implementation are clearly specified and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence:** The interpretation of performance gaps as evidence of LLM limitations in grounded reasoning assumes the benchmark tasks capture essential challenges of embodied AI. This claim is reasonable but could be influenced by the simplified grid world setting.

**Low Confidence:** The benchmark's generalizability to real-world robotic planning scenarios is uncertain due to the text-based interface and perfect information assumption.

## Next Checks

1. **Ground Truth Verification**: Compare OmniBot-generated plans against human expert traces on a subset of tasks to quantify systematic differences in planning strategies that could bias benchmark results.

2. **Partial Observability Extension**: Implement a limited visibility variant of the benchmark where models only receive local grid observations, then measure performance degradation compared to the omniscient setting.

3. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Evaluate whether models that perform well on BabyBench show improved performance on a different text-based planning benchmark (e.g., ALFWorld or virtual home environments) to test generalizability of the results.
