# BEAT-Net: Injecting Biomimetic Spatio-Temporal Priors for Interpretable ECG Classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.07316
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07316
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Primary result:** Matches leading 1D-CNN baselines on three large-scale ECG datasets while achieving 30-35% data efficiency

## Executive Summary
BEAT-Net is a supervised ECG classification framework that reformulates the problem as language modeling through QRS-tokenization. The model explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology into beat morphology, spatial lead perspectives, and temporal rhythm dependencies using specialized encoders, avoiding implicit learning of physiological structures typical in 1D-CNN approaches. BEAT-Net matches the accuracy of leading 1D-CNN baselines on three large-scale ECG datasets (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) while achieving 30-35% data efficiency—recovering fully supervised performance with only a third of annotated data.

## Method Summary
BEAT-Net transforms continuous ECG signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences through R-peak centered tokenization, extracting fixed-length segments around each ventricular activation landmark. The four-stage pipeline processes these tokens through: a Word Encoder (1D ResNet) for beat-level morphology, a Spatial Encoder with lead-specific affine transformations to normalize view-dependent variations, a Temporal Encoder with additive positional embeddings for rhythm context, and a Sentence Encoder (Transformer) for global reasoning. The framework uses BCE-Logits loss, AdamW optimizer, and is trained end-to-end on PyTorch with a single RTX A6000.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.936 AUC on CSN with only 35% of training data, outperforming full-data 1D-CNN baselines
- Maintains 0.873-0.952 AUC range across PTB-XL classification categories matching xresnet1d101 performance
- Provides inherent interpretability through attention mechanisms that align with clinical heuristics like Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** QRS-centered tokenization acts as a morphological filter that suppresses non-informative inter-beat noise while preserving diagnostically relevant structure.
- **Mechanism:** R-peak detection identifies ventricular activation landmarks, extracting fixed-length segments around each anchor. This discretizes continuous waveforms into biologically aligned heartbeat tokens, ordered chronologically and by lead index.
- **Core assumption:** R-peak landmarks provide sufficient anchoring for morphological alignment; diagnostic information is localized within fixed windows around R-peaks.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract], [section 2.1], HeartLang corpus (arxiv:2502.10707)
- **Break condition:** If R-peak detection fails on noisy signals or arrhythmias with absent/abnormal QRS morphology, token alignment degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Lead-specific affine transformations enforce spatial inductive bias that standardizes view-dependent morphological variations across the 12-lead configuration.
- **Mechanism:** Spatial Encoder applies learned scale γ_c and bias β_c per lead: z_s^i = z^i ⊙ γ_c + β_c. This normalizes the same physiological event appearing differently across leads (e.g., Lead II vs. V1).
- **Core assumption:** Lead-specific variability is predominantly affine-transformable; inter-lead relationships follow consistent geometric patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 2.2.2], [section 4.4], related work on spatio-temporal attention for ECG (arxiv:2509.19308)
- **Break condition:** If pathology fundamentally alters inter-lead relationships (e.g., lead misplacement, dextrocardia), learned affine parameters may over-normalize pathological signal.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Explicit decomposition of morphology, space, and time yields data efficiency by constraining the hypothesis space to physiologically plausible representations.
- **Mechanism:** Four-stage pipeline forces feature hierarchy: Word Encoder extracts beat-level morphology, Spatial Encoder normalizes lead perspectives, Temporal Encoder injects sequential position embeddings, Sentence Encoder performs global Transformer reasoning. Each stage handles one physiological dimension.
- **Core assumption:** Cardiac physiology decomposes cleanly into morphological, spatial, and temporal components; these factors are approximately independent.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 2], [table 2], [figure 3], "Domain Knowledge is Power" (arxiv:2509.08116)
- **Break condition:** If diagnostic decisions require simultaneous joint reasoning across all three dimensions (non-decomposable interactions), the sequential pipeline may lose critical cross-component dependencies.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: R-peak Detection and QRS Complex Anatomy**
  - Why needed here: The entire tokenization pipeline depends on accurate R-peak localization. Understanding P-QRS-T wave morphology explains why centering on R-peaks preserves diagnostic content.
  - Quick check question: Given an ECG segment, can you identify which peak corresponds to the R-wave and explain why it serves as a stable anchor across beats?

- **Concept: 12-Lead ECG Spatial Geometry**
  - Why needed here: The Spatial Encoder's affine transformations assume leads capture different projections of the same cardiac electrical vector. Understanding lead placements (limb vs. precordial) clarifies why identical pathology appears differently across leads.
  - Quick check question: Why would Lead II be preferred for rhythm analysis while V1-V6 are preferred for morphological assessment like hypertrophy?

- **Concept: Transformer Positional Encoding**
  - Why needed here: The Temporal Encoder uses additive positional embeddings to inject sequence order. Without this, the Transformer cannot distinguish beat N from beat N+1, losing rhythm information essential for arrhythmia detection.
  - Quick check question: If you permuted the order of heartbeat tokens before the Temporal Encoder, what diagnostic capability would be lost?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input X ∈ R^(C×T) → [QRS Tokenizer] → H ∈ R^(S×L) (heartbeat tokens) → [Word Encoder F_word] → Z ∈ R^(S×D) (morphological embeddings) → [Spatial Encoder] → Z^s (lead-normalized) → [Temporal Encoder] → Z^t (position-injected) → [Sentence Encoder (Transformer)] → pooled representation → [MLP Head] → ŷ (classification logits)

- **Critical path:** QRS-tokenization quality → Word Encoder residual feature extraction → Spatial/Temporal encoder integration. Ablation shows single-component removal drops AUC ~2.5%, but removing both drops 5.1%—the encoders are complementary but the path is sequential.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Tokenization window length L: Too narrow → truncates P/T waves; too wide → includes adjacent beat noise. Paper uses fixed L (value not specified).
  - Sequence length S: Standardization requires padding/truncation. Long sequences → memory burden; short sequences → loses long-range rhythm context.
  - Transformer depth vs. efficiency: Paper emphasizes "lightweight supervised framework" over large-scale pre-training, but Sentence Encoder capacity is not ablated separately.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - If Rhythm AUC drops disproportionately (baseline 0.952 → 0.933 without Temporal Encoder): Temporal embeddings are degraded or positional encoding initialized poorly
  - If Form tasks underperform: Check QRS-tokenization alignment or Spatial Encoder γ/β learning rate
  - If cross-dataset transfer fails (CSN → CPSC2018): Tokenization may overfit to sampling rate or noise characteristics of source distribution

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Tokenization ablation:** Compare QRS-centered tokens vs. fixed-window patching (no R-peak alignment) on PTB-XL Rhythm subclass. Expect Figure 2-style gap confirming biological alignment matters.
  2. **Data efficiency curve replication:** Train BEAT-Net on CPSC2018 at 10%, 25%, 35%, 50%, 100% data fractions. Plot AUC vs. fraction. Confirm 35% recovery point matches paper claim.
  3. **Spatial attention visualization:** Extract Spatial Encoder attention weights on held-out PTB-XL test set. Verify Lead II dominance for rhythm labels and precordial lead dominance for Form labels without explicit supervision.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can BEAT-Net be extended to integrate multi-modal clinical data, such as patient demographics or imaging, alongside the tokenized ECG signals? The conclusion states the framework "paves the way for future multi-modal applications," but the current architecture is designed exclusively for ECG signal inputs.

- **Open Question 2:** How does classification performance degrade when the upstream R-peak detection (tokenization) is inaccurate due to signal noise or extreme arrhythmias? The method relies on the QRS-tokenizer to generate "biologically aligned heartbeat units" based on detected R-peaks, but does not evaluate robustness to tokenization errors.

- **Open Question 3:** Does the hierarchical encoder architecture offer lower inference latency and smaller model size compared to the 1D-CNN baselines? The introduction claims the approach addresses "strict computational constraints" typical of bedside monitors, yet results only report AUC and data efficiency, not computational cost.

## Limitations

- **Major architectural gaps:** Critical parameters like tokenization window length L, sequence length S, and Word Encoder/Transformer architecture details are unspecified, preventing direct reproduction.
- **Unverified robustness:** Performance sensitivity to R-peak detection errors, pathological lead misplacement, and cross-dataset noise characteristics is not evaluated.
- **Computational claims unsubstantiated:** The paper claims computational efficiency benefits but does not report model parameters, FLOPs, or inference speed comparisons to 1D-CNN baselines.

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (QRS-tokenization):** Medium confidence - Concept is well-grounded but direct ablation comparison is not shown
- **Mechanism 2 (Lead-specific affine):** Medium confidence - Attention visualizations support the claim but pathological generalization is unverified
- **Mechanism 3 (Data efficiency):** High confidence - Direct empirical evidence from data efficiency curves and ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. **Tokenization ablation study:** Implement controlled comparison between BEAT-Net's QRS-centered tokenization and fixed-window segmentation without R-peak alignment on PTB-XL Rhythm subclass to validate biological alignment benefit.

2. **Cross-dataset noise robustness:** Evaluate BEAT-Net's data efficiency claim on CPSC2018 by training at multiple data fractions (10%, 25%, 35%, 50%, 100%) and comparing to 1D-CNN baseline on full data to confirm 35% recovery point.

3. **Lead-specific attention validation:** Extract and visualize Spatial Encoder attention weights from trained BEAT-Net on held-out PTB-XL test set to verify Lead II dominance for rhythm and V1-V6 dominance for morphological tasks without explicit supervision.
