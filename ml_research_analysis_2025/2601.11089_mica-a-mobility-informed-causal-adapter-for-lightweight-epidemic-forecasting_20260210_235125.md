# MiCA: A Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter for Lightweight Epidemic Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.11089
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11089
- Reference count: 16
- Improves lightweight epidemic forecasting by 7.5% average relative error reduction via mobility-derived causal structure

## Executive Summary
MiCA (Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter) is a lightweight module that enhances epidemic forecasting by integrating mobility-derived causal structure into temporal models. The method uses PCMCI causal discovery to infer directed mobility relations from historical data, then incorporates these via gated residual mixing, allowing selective use of spatial dependencies while maintaining robustness to noise and limited data. Evaluated on four real-world datasets (COVID-19 incidence/mortality, influenza, dengue), MiCA consistently improves lightweight backbones, achieving performance competitive with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal models while remaining computationally efficient and architecture-agnostic.

## Method Summary
MiCA operates by first preprocessing mobility time series through differencing and z-score normalization, then applying PCMCI causal discovery to extract a directed causal prior (S_p) representing significant lagged dependencies. This prior is integrated into lightweight temporal backbones (RAM-pruned PatchTST or DLinear) through a global gated residual mixing mechanism (CRM) controlled by learnable mixing weight λ, with optional edge-wise gating (PGP) to suppress spurious links. The adapter runs as a single layer fusing temporal and spatial representations before decoding to forecasts. Training combines prediction loss with regularization on λ and edge gate sparsity.

## Key Results
- Achieves 7.5% average relative error reduction across four datasets (COVID-19 incidence/mortality, influenza, dengue)
- Outperforms state-of-the-art spatio-temporal models while maintaining lower computational cost
- Ablation studies show PGP module consistently improves performance by filtering spurious causal edges
- Causal prior from PCMCI provides significant advantage over simple correlation-based spatial priors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Causal discovery from mobility data provides a directional prior that improves forecasting when raw mobility signals are noisy and indirect.
- Mechanism: PCMCI identifies lagged, conditional dependencies in preprocessed mobility time series, producing a signed causal-strength matrix that reflects both magnitude and significance across time lags. This prior is aggregated with exponential-decay weighting to emphasize dominant links.
- Core assumption: Mobility dynamics are weakly stationary after differencing, and statistically significant lagged correlations in mobility approximate directional transmission drivers for disease spread.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing." [section 3.3–3.4] PCMCI returns Val (signed strengths) and Pval (significance); aggregation via Eq. (20)–(21) yields Sp with significance threshold α=0.05.
- Break condition: If mobility series are nonstationary beyond first-order differencing, or if true disease spread drivers are orthogonal to measured mobility (e.g., unobserved superspreader events), the causal prior may be uninformative or misleading.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Global gated residual mixing enables selective integration of the causal prior, allowing the model to fall back on temporal patterns when mobility signals are unreliable.
- Mechanism: A learnable global mixing weight λ (parameterized via softplus) controls how much of the causally-propagated representation S_p Z_{n-1} is added to the backbone output. Initialization with θ<0 starts with minimal causal influence.
- Core assumption: The backbone temporal encoder is sufficiently expressive to capture local dynamics, and the causal prior provides complementary spatial structure rather than redundant or conflicting information.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions." [section 3.4] Eq. (22)–(24) define CRM; Theorem 1 bounds output perturbation by L·λ·||W_o||_2·||S||_2·||Z||_F.
- Break condition: If λ saturates at high values due to insufficient regularization (L_λ), the model may over-rely on noisy mobility priors, degrading performance on datasets where mobility is weakly predictive.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Edge-wise gating suppresses spurious or weak causal links, reducing overfitting to noisy mobility artifacts.
- Mechanism: A learned gate matrix G = σ(MLP(S_p)) assigns adaptive confidence to each directed edge in the causal prior. Elementwise gating (G ⊙ S_p) Z_{n-1} filters unreliable links before residual mixing.
- Core assumption: Spurious edges exist in the PCMCI-derived graph due to finite-sample noise or unmeasured confounders, and a data-driven gate can identify them from downstream task signals.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.4] Eq. (25)–(26) define PGP; L_sparse = η||G||_1 encourages sparsity. [section 4.2, Figure 3] Ablation shows removing PGP consistently degrades performance across RAM and DLinear backbones.
- Break condition: If training data are too scarce to learn meaningful edge-wise gates (e.g., very short time series), G may collapse to near-uniform values, reducing PGP to a no-op or introducing additional noise.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: PCMCI (Peter–Clark Momentary Conditional Independence)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how MiCA constructs its causal prior requires familiarity with constraint-based causal discovery, conditional independence tests, and lagged dependencies in time series.
  - Quick check question: Given a bivariate time series (X_t, Y_t), what does it mean for Y to be conditionally independent of X at lag τ given parents of Y?

- Concept: Residual connections with learnable gating
  - Why needed here: MiCA's CRM and PGP both use gated residual forms; understanding gradient flow and the role of initialization (θ<0) is essential for debugging convergence.
  - Quick check question: If λ is initialized near zero, what is the initial effective contribution of the causal prior to the output representation?

- Concept: Leakage-free evaluation in time-series forecasting
  - Why needed here: The causal prior must be constructed only from training-window mobility data; using future mobility would artificially inflate performance.
  - Quick check question: If mobility data from the test period were inadvertently included in PCMCI, what type of performance bias would you expect during evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Epidemic time series X -> Temporal Backbone (RAM/DLinear) -> E_N; Mobility time series M -> PCMCI -> S_p -> MiCA Adapter (CRM+PGP) -> Z_N -> Fusion (E'_N + Z_N) -> Decoder -> Ŷ

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess mobility (differencing + z-score) within training window only.
  2. Run PCMCI to obtain Val, Pval; aggregate into S_p with significance threshold α=0.05.
  3. Initialize global mixing parameter θ<0; train backbone + MiCA with L = L_pred + L_λ + L_sparse.
  4. At inference, S_p is fixed; only backbone and gating parameters are used.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single adapter layer (D=1) vs. multi-layer: Paper uses D=1 to reduce overfitting on short series; deeper stacking may help if data are abundant.
  - CRM-only vs. CRM+PGP: PGP adds parameters and compute but filters spurious edges; ablation shows consistent gains.
  - Backbone choice: RAM-pruned PatchTST has lower capacity than full PatchTST; MiCA compensates with spatial structure but may underperform if temporal patterns are highly complex.

- Failure signatures:
  - λ collapses to near-zero: Causal prior contributes nothing; check L_λ strength and mobility data quality.
  - High variance across seeds on small datasets: May indicate insufficient data for edge-wise gating; consider disabling PGP or increasing L_sparse.
  - Performance degrades at longer horizons: Suggests causal prior does not generalize; inspect S_p stability across training splits.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Table 1 baseline: Train RAM and DLinear on COVID-19 Incidence with and without MiCA; verify ~1–2% RMSE reduction.
  2. Ablate PGP: Run RAM+MiCA with PGP disabled (w/o PGP) on Influenza; confirm MAE increase per Figure 3.
  3. Prior sensitivity: Replace PCMCI-derived S_p with Pearson correlation matrix on Dengue dataset; expect 4–6% RMSE increase per Figure 5.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can performance be improved by updating the causal mobility graph dynamically during testing rather than keeping it fixed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "The resulting causal prior remains fixed during evaluation."
- Why unresolved: This rigidity may prevent adaptation to sudden regime shifts in human mobility, such as unexpected lockdowns or holiday travel surges.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of fixed-prior performance against a rolling-window adaptive prior mechanism during high-volatility periods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the causal adapter provide benefits when integrated into heavier models (e.g., GNNs) that already possess strong spatial reasoning capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Experiments are limited to "lightweight temporal backbones" and compare against, but do not combine with, parameter-heavy spatio-temporal models.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if MiCA acts as a general performance booster or merely compensates for the lack of spatial modules in lightweight architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating MiCA into a graph-based baseline like DCRNN to measure any additive improvements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the requirement for stationarity via differencing degrade the model's ability to capture long-term epidemic trends?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The method relies on the assumption that "Causal discovery requires weak stationarity," necessitating differencing which removes trends.
- Why unresolved: Removing trends might discard primary signals of epidemic growth (exponential phases) critical for forecasting.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study evaluating forecast decomposition (trend vs. residual) using stationary vs. non-stationary inputs.

## Limitations

- Dataset sources and preprocessing details are underspecified, particularly the exact date ranges, geographic granularity, and mobility data provenance for the four evaluation datasets.
- Training hyperparameters, regularization weights, and backbone architecture specifics are not disclosed, making faithful reproduction difficult without extensive tuning.
- The paper does not report ablation on backbone capacity, leaving unclear whether performance gains are due to spatial structure or architectural differences.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mechanism by which PCMCI-derived causal priors improve lightweight backbones is well-supported by ablation studies and quantitative results.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency and generalizability to unseen mobility patterns are supported by runtime analysis and validation on four datasets, but lack statistical robustness testing.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that edge-wise gating consistently suppresses spurious edges is supported by ablation but not by qualitative inspection of learned gates or edge stability across training folds.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce baseline results**: Train RAM and DLinear on COVID-19 Incidence with and without MiCA; verify the ~1–2% RMSE reduction reported in Table 1.
2. **Ablate PGP module**: Run RAM+MiCA with PGP disabled on Influenza dataset; confirm the MAE increase shown in Figure 3 ablation study.
3. **Test causal prior sensitivity**: Replace PCMCI-derived S_p with Pearson correlation matrix on Dengue dataset; expect 4–6% RMSE increase per Figure 5, validating the importance of directional causal discovery.
