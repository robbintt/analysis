- Primary result: Framework for decomposing stochastic transducers into interacting sub-transducers using information-theoretic measures

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a principled framework for decomposing complex world models represented as stochastic transducers into simpler, interpretable components. The approach addresses the challenge of scaling world modeling to high-dimensional processes by enabling modular decomposition that preserves causal structure while allowing for distributed inference. By introducing measures of intransducibility and acausality, the framework provides tools for identifying natural partitions in transducer networks, enabling both computational efficiency and enhanced interpretability in AI systems.

## Method Summary
The core method employs two information-theoretic measures to guide transducer decomposition: intransducibility detects when variable sets cannot be generated by causal transducers (applicable when latent variables are known), while acausality quantifies interface deviations from feedforward realizability (used when latents are inaccessible). These measures enable recursive algorithms that factor monolithic transducers into sparse networks of prime transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces. The framework establishes formal conditions for transducer composition and decomposition, demonstrating that composite transducers preserve minimality when constructed from ε-transducers. A coarse-graining approach reduces network complexity while maintaining marginal interface preservation, facilitating parallelizable inference through localized causal structure.

## Key Results
- Formal conditions established for transducer composition and decomposition
- Algorithms developed for identifying modular substructures in high-dimensional processes
- Composite transducers proven to preserve minimality when built from ε-transducers
- Methods demonstrated for coarse-graining networks while preserving marginal interfaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages information-theoretic principles to identify natural modular boundaries in complex processes. By quantifying how well interfaces between subsystems can be realized as causal transducers, the method reveals where decomposition is both possible and beneficial. The intransducibility measure captures the fundamental limitations of representing certain variable relationships causally, while acausality measures quantify the degree to which interfaces violate causal structure assumptions. These metrics enable systematic identification of prime transducers and their compositions, ensuring that decomposition preserves the essential predictive capabilities of the original model while enabling modular reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- Stochastic Transducers: Generalizations of POMDPs that map input sequences to output sequences probabilistically; needed for modeling sequential decision processes in world modeling; check by verifying that output probabilities depend only on finite input history.
- Intransducibility: Information-theoretic measure detecting when variable sets cannot be causally generated; needed to identify natural decomposition boundaries; check by computing whether conditional distributions factorize appropriately.
- Acausality: Metric quantifying deviation from feedforward transducer realizability; needed when latent variables are unknown; check by measuring information flow across interfaces.
- Prime Transducers: Minimal transducers that cannot be further decomposed; needed as building blocks for composite structures; check by verifying that all sub-partitions fail intransducibility tests.
- ε-Transducers: Transducers with bounded approximation error; needed to ensure composition preserves approximation guarantees; check by bounding the total variation distance between composed and target distributions.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Monolithic Transducer -> Decomposition Algorithm -> Network of Prime Transducers -> Coarse-Graining Module -> Distributed Inference System
Critical path: Input sequence → Prime transducer processing → Interface combination → Output prediction
Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs. decomposition accuracy; modularity vs. interface complexity; distributed inference benefits vs. communication overhead
Failure signatures: Decomposition into trivial single-variable components (over-decomposition); inability to identify any prime transducers (under-decomposition); loss of predictive accuracy after decomposition
First experiments:
1. Apply decomposition to a known modular stochastic process and verify recovery of ground truth structure
2. Compare inference time and accuracy between monolithic and decomposed versions on a benchmark task
3. Test coarse-graining algorithm on a complex transducer network to measure complexity reduction while maintaining interface fidelity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability to truly high-dimensional, real-world processes remains uncertain
- Reliance on sufficient data for reliable information-theoretic measure estimation
- Practical applicability to world modeling tasks requires further empirical validation
- Computational complexity of decomposition algorithms may limit real-time applications

## Confidence
High: Formal conditions for transducer composition and decomposition are mathematically sound and rigorously defined
Medium: Preservation of minimality when composing ε-transducers follows logically from theoretical framework
Low: Practical applicability to real-world world modeling tasks remains uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark the decomposition algorithms on high-dimensional synthetic processes with known ground truth structure to quantify decomposition accuracy and computational scaling
2. Implement the framework on a multi-agent simulation environment where distributed inference benefits can be measured against monolithic approaches
3. Test the robustness of intransducibility and acausality measures under varying levels of noise and data sparsity to establish practical estimation requirements
