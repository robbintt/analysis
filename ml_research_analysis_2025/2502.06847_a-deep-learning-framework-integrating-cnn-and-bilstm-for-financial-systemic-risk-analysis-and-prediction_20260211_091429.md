# A Deep Learning Framework Integrating CNN and BiLSTM for Financial Systemic Risk Analysis and Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.06847
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06847
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: 0.89 accuracy, 0.87 recall, 0.88 F1-score on financial systemic risk prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework combining CNN and BiLSTM for financial systemic risk prediction. The model first extracts local patterns from multidimensional financial data using CNN, then models bidirectional temporal dependencies using BiLSTM. Experiments on real financial data demonstrate that the integrated approach outperforms individual CNN, BiLSTM, Transformer, and TCN models, achieving strong performance in capturing market features and temporal relationships for intelligent risk management.

## Method Summary
The framework processes multidimensional financial time series (prices, volumes, volatility, interest rates) through a sequential CNN-BiLSTM architecture. CNN applies one-dimensional convolutions with ReLU activation and max-pooling to extract local features across different scales. These features are fed into BiLSTM layers that model bidirectional temporal dependencies, with forward and backward LSTM states concatenated. An attention mechanism weights time-step importance before a fully connected layer with sigmoid activation produces risk probability outputs. The model is trained using backpropagation with cross-entropy loss.

## Key Results
- Achieved 0.89 accuracy, 0.87 recall, and 0.88 F1-score on systemic risk prediction
- Outperformed standalone BiLSTM, CNN, Transformer, and TCN baseline models
- Demonstrated effective capture of multidimensional market features and temporal dependencies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- CNN extracts local multi-scale patterns from multidimensional financial data that single-purpose models miss.
- Convolution kernels slide across time steps to identify short-term market signals, with max-pooling preserving salient features.
- Core assumption: Financial risk signals manifest as local patterns detectable via convolution.
- Evidence: Paper explicitly states CNN extracts "local patterns of multidimensional features"; neighbor papers apply CNN-BiLSTM to EEG and IoT domains.
- Break condition: If market signals are purely long-term trends without local structure, CNN's contribution diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
- BiLSTM captures bidirectional temporal dependencies that unidirectional models cannot.
- Forward and backward LSTM process sequences in both directions, with concatenated hidden states enabling use of both historical and future context.
- Core assumption: Risk prediction benefits from bidirectional context within the input window.
- Evidence: Paper states BiLSTM "models the bidirectional dependency of time series"; neighbor paper ID 33695 uses similar approach for EEG seizure detection.
- Break condition: If input windows are too short or strict causality is required, bidirectional processing provides marginal benefit.

### Mechanism 3
- Sequential CNN→BiLSTM integration outperforms parallel approaches by combining localized feature extraction with temporal context modeling.
- CNN transforms raw time series into refined features that BiLSTM then models temporally, with attention weighting time-step importance.
- Core assumption: Local patterns and temporal dependencies are complementary information sources.
- Evidence: Paper states integration "improves prediction accuracy and robustness"; neighbor papers ID 58146 and ID 53837 use similar cascades in different domains.
- Break condition: If CNN over-smooths features before BiLSTM, sequential integration underperforms parallel architectures.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Convolutional feature extraction (1D)
  - Why needed: Understand how kernels slide across time steps to extract local patterns
  - Quick check: Given [2, 5, 3, 8, 1] and kernel [1, -1], what is the output of valid convolution?

- Concept: LSTM gating (forget, input, output gates)
  - Why needed: BiLSTM's long-term dependency modeling relies on gating for gradient flow
  - Quick check: Which gate determines how much of the previous cell state to retain?

- Concept: Bidirectional sequence processing
  - Why needed: Understand h_t = h_t(forward) + h_t(backward) for model interpretation
  - Quick check: At step 5 in a 10-step sequence, what information can backward LSTM access that forward LSTM cannot?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Normalization → CNN feature extraction → BiLSTM temporal modeling → Attention weighting → Fully connected → Sigmoid
- Critical path: Input → Normalization → CNN → BiLSTM → Attention → Fully connected → Sigmoid. CNN-to-BiLSTM handoff is key integration point.
- Design tradeoffs: Sequential CNN→BiLSTM ensures refined features for temporal modeling but risks information loss; bidirectional processing provides better context but unsuitable for strict real-time streaming; deep architecture achieves higher F1 (0.88) but reduces explainability.
- Failure signatures: Validation loss plateaus while training loss continues (overfitting); high training accuracy but poor recall (class imbalance); feature collapse in CNN output (check kernel initialization and learning rate).
- First 3 experiments: 1) Reproduce baseline comparisons on same data split to validate performance gaps. 2) Ablation study: remove attention layer and measure F1-score degradation. 3) Window sensitivity analysis: vary input sequence length and observe impact on long-term dependency modeling.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does integrating unstructured multimodal data (financial news, policy documents) with numerical time series improve prediction accuracy compared to numerical-only inputs?
  - Basis: Paper explicitly states future research will "introduce methods such as... multimodal data analysis"
  - Why unresolved: Current study uses only structured historical transaction data
  - Resolution evidence: Comparative performance analysis of current model vs. modified version with NLP features from financial news

- Question: Can reinforcement learning be integrated into the CNN-BiLSTM architecture to transform it from passive predictor to active decision support agent?
  - Basis: Paper identifies "combin[ing] emerging algorithms such as reinforcement learning" as future direction
  - Why unresolved: Current framework is supervised classification model lacking dynamic risk control mechanisms
  - Resolution evidence: Demonstration of RL-enhanced framework executing risk mitigation strategies in simulated market environment

- Question: How does model generalization degrade when applied to highly volatile or non-stationary market conditions that differ from training distribution?
  - Basis: Paper notes "generalization ability needs to be further verified when facing more volatile and non-stationary financial markets"
  - Why unresolved: High accuracy reported on test set but no specific testing on extreme market turbulence
  - Resolution evidence: Stress-test results showing performance specifically on out-of-sample data from distinct periods of extreme market turbulence

## Limitations
- Exact data universe (tickers, date range, feature definitions) and systemic risk labeling methodology unspecified
- Model hyperparameters (layer depths, filter counts, hidden units, learning rate) not provided
- Ablation study on attention contribution not performed
- No public code or data available for exact reproduction

## Confidence
- Data construction and labeling methodology: Low confidence (major gaps)
- CNN-BiLSTM architecture effectiveness: Medium confidence (weak direct evidence but transferable patterns from neighbor papers)
- Reported performance metrics: Medium confidence (gaps in methodology specification)
- Attention mechanism contribution: Low confidence (no ablation study provided)

## Next Checks
1. Run ablation: remove attention layer and measure F1-score drop to quantify attention's contribution
2. Vary systemic risk labeling threshold and horizon; check if performance is robust across definitions
3. Reproduce baseline models (BiLSTM, CNN, Transformer, TCN) on same data split to confirm claimed performance gaps
