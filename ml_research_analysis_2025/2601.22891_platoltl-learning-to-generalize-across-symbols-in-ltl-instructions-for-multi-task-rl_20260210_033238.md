# PlatoLTL: Learning to Generalize Across Symbols in LTL Instructions for Multi-Task RL

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22891
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22891
- Authors: Jacques Cloete; Mathias Jackermeier; Ioannis Havoutis; Alessandro Abate
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieves 98% success rate on RGBZoneEnv and 93% on FalloutWorld while generalizing to unseen atomic propositions

## Executive Summary
PlatoLTL addresses the challenge of training reinforcement learning policies that generalize across both LTL formula structures and atomic propositions, including those unseen during training. The method reformulates atomic propositions as instances of parameterized predicates, allowing policies to learn shared structure across related propositions. A novel neural network architecture embeds and composes these predicates to represent LTL specifications, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel propositions and tasks.

The approach demonstrates strong performance on two novel benchmark environments (RGBZoneEnv and FalloutWorld) that feature large or infinite vocabularies of atomic propositions. PlatoLTL achieves high success rates (98% in RGBZoneEnv, 93% in FalloutWorld) on complex LTL specifications while converging faster than baseline methods. Critically, it maintains comparable performance on unseen propositions, unlike baseline approaches that fail to generalize.

## Method Summary
PlatoLTL reformulates atomic propositions as instances of parameterized predicates, allowing policies to learn shared structure across related propositions. The method employs a neural network architecture that embeds and composes these predicates to represent LTL specifications. This enables zero-shot generalization to novel propositions and tasks by learning to generalize across both LTL formula structures and atomic propositions. The approach is evaluated on two novel benchmark environments with large or infinite vocabularies of atomic propositions, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to baseline methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves 98% success rate on RGBZoneEnv with complex LTL specifications
- Maintains 93% success rate on FalloutWorld while generalizing to unseen propositions
- Converges faster than baseline methods on both benchmark environments
- Demonstrates effective generalization to continuous (infinite) sets of propositions through structured embeddings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PlatoLTL works by transforming atomic propositions into parameterized predicate instances, creating a shared representation space that captures semantic relationships between different propositions. The neural architecture learns to embed these predicates in a way that preserves their logical structure and relationships, allowing the policy to generalize from seen to unseen propositions by leveraging the learned predicate embeddings. This approach effectively decouples the logical structure of LTL formulas from the specific atomic propositions, enabling transfer learning across different instruction sets.

## Foundational Learning
- LTL semantics and temporal logic operators: Understanding the meaning and composition of LTL operators (always, eventually, until) is essential for grasping how PlatoLTL represents and processes specifications.
- Parameterized predicate representation: The concept of treating atomic propositions as instances of parameterized predicates is crucial for understanding the generalization mechanism.
- Neural architecture for symbolic reasoning: Familiarity with how neural networks can be structured to handle symbolic logic and composition is important for understanding PlatoLTL's design.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input State -> Predicate Encoder -> LTL Parser -> Policy Network -> Action Output

**Critical Path:**
State features are processed through the predicate encoder to create embeddings, which are then composed according to the LTL formula structure parsed by the syntactic parser. The resulting representation is fed into the policy network to generate actions.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Explicit predicate parameterization vs. direct symbol embedding: Allows generalization but requires additional structure
- Syntactic parsing approach: Provides flexibility for arbitrary LTL but may limit scalability to very complex formulas
- Shared predicate embeddings: Enables cross-proposition generalization but requires careful design to avoid interference

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor generalization to unseen propositions may indicate insufficient predicate embedding capacity
- Slow convergence could suggest suboptimal predicate parameterization
- Performance degradation on complex LTL might indicate limitations in the syntactic parsing approach

**First Experiments:**
1. Test predicate embedding quality on a simple proposition generalization task
2. Evaluate LTL formula parsing accuracy on increasingly complex specifications
3. Assess policy performance on seen vs. unseen propositions in a controlled environment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance on continuous control tasks or high-dimensional state spaces is not evaluated
- Scalability of syntactic parsing approach to extremely complex LTL formulas remains untested
- Robustness to adversarial or semantically ambiguous propositions is not explored

## Confidence

**Performance on benchmark environments:** High
**Generalization to unseen propositions:** High
**Scalability to infinite proposition spaces:** Medium
**Robustness to complex LTL structures:** Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test PlatoLTL on continuous control benchmarks (e.g., MuJoCo or PyBullet tasks) with LTL specifications to evaluate scalability to high-dimensional state spaces.
2. Evaluate the method's performance on LTL formulas with deeply nested temporal operators (e.g., nested until/always operators) to assess parsing robustness.
3. Conduct experiments with semantically ambiguous or adversarial atomic propositions to test the method's robustness to proposition quality and consistency.
