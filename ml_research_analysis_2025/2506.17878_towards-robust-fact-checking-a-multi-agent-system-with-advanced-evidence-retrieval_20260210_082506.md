# Towards Robust Fact-Checking: A Multi-Agent System with Advanced Evidence Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.17878
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17878
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods across FEVEROUS, HOVER, and SciFact datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that decomposes complex claims into verifiable subclaims, retrieves targeted evidence, and synthesizes verdicts with human-interpretable explanations. The system employs four specialized agents working sequentially to transform raw claims into structured verification outputs. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, particularly in multi-hop reasoning tasks where the system outperforms the best baseline by up to 23.15% for 3-hop claims.

## Method Summary
The system implements a pipeline of four specialized agents: (1) subclaim generation that decomposes complex claims into simpler, verifiable components; (2) query generation that creates targeted search queries for each subclaim; (3) evidence retrieval that collects supporting or refuting information from credible sources; and (4) verdict synthesis that combines evidence to produce final judgments with explanations. This decomposition approach enables more focused evidence collection and reasoning, addressing the challenge of verifying complex claims that require multi-hop reasoning or cross-domain knowledge.

## Key Results
- 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score compared to baseline methods across three benchmark datasets
- Up to 23.15% improvement over best baseline for 3-hop claims in multi-hop reasoning tasks
- Demonstrated effectiveness across FEVEROUS, HOVER, and SciFact benchmark datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from decomposing complex claims into simpler subclaims, enabling more targeted and efficient evidence retrieval. By generating specific queries for each subclaim, the system can access more relevant evidence than traditional single-query approaches. The specialized agents allow for domain-specific optimization at each stage of the fact-checking process, while the sequential pipeline ensures that errors in early stages can be corrected or mitigated in later stages through evidence synthesis.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-hop reasoning**: Understanding how claims require chaining multiple inference steps through different evidence sources - needed to evaluate the system's effectiveness on complex claims requiring intermediate reasoning steps.

**Evidence retrieval optimization**: Knowledge of how targeted query generation improves precision over broad search approaches - needed to assess the system's ability to find relevant supporting information.

**Agent specialization trade-offs**: Understanding the benefits and limitations of task decomposition into specialized agents - needed to evaluate scalability and potential bottlenecks in the verification pipeline.

**Claim decomposition strategies**: Familiarity with methods for breaking down complex claims into verifiable subcomponents - needed to assess the quality and effectiveness of the subclaim generation process.

**Benchmark dataset characteristics**: Knowledge of FEVEROUS, HOVER, and SciFact dataset properties and their relevance to real-world fact-checking - needed to contextualize the reported performance improvements.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Claim -> Subclaim Generator -> Query Generator -> Evidence Retriever -> Verdict Synthesizer

**Critical path**: The verification pipeline follows a sequential flow where each agent's output becomes the next agent's input, with the subclaim generator being the critical bottleneck as errors here propagate through the entire system.

**Design tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes accuracy and interpretability over computational efficiency, with specialized agents providing better performance but potentially creating latency issues at scale. The modular design allows for component-level optimization but requires careful coordination between agents.

**Failure signatures**: Poor subclaim generation leads to irrelevant evidence retrieval, weak query generation results in missed critical evidence, and inadequate verdict synthesis produces incorrect final judgments despite having relevant evidence.

**First experiments**: 1) Test the system on claims requiring temporal reasoning to assess handling of time-dependent information. 2) Evaluate computational latency across different claim complexities to understand deployment constraints. 3) Conduct ablation studies removing individual agents to quantify their contribution to overall performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on F1 metrics without discussing precision-recall trade-offs or computational efficiency
- Limited discussion of how the system scales to more complex reasoning chains beyond 3-hop claims
- Evaluation doesn't address performance on claims requiring temporal reasoning, conflicting evidence resolution, or multi-modal information

## Confidence
- **High**: Single-hop verification tasks on benchmark datasets
- **Medium**: Multi-hop scenarios beyond 3-hop claims
- **Low**: Real-world claims requiring temporal reasoning or conflicting evidence resolution

## Next Checks
1. Test the system on claims requiring temporal reasoning and conflicting evidence resolution to assess robustness beyond evaluated datasets
2. Evaluate computational efficiency and latency across different claim complexities to understand practical deployment constraints
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify contribution of each agent component and identify optimization opportunities
