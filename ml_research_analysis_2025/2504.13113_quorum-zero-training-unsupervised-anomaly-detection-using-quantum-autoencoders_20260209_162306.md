# Quorum: Zero-Training Unsupervised Anomaly Detection using Quantum Autoencoders

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.13113
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13113
- Authors: Jason Zev Ludmir; Sophia Rebello; Jacob Ruiz; Tirthak Patel
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Zero-training quantum anomaly detection framework achieving 23% higher average F1 score than quantum neural network baseline

## Executive Summary
Quorum introduces a quantum anomaly detection framework that requires no training, addressing the challenge of unsupervised anomaly detection in quantum machine learning. The method leverages quantum amplitude encoding, random quantum transformations, and SWAP tests to identify anomalies based on statistical deviations across multiple ensemble groups and compression levels. By distributing data into buckets and randomly selecting features, Quorum enhances anomaly visibility without requiring parameter optimization or labeled data. Experimental evaluation on medical, industrial, and lexical datasets shows that Quorum achieves 23% higher average F1 score compared to a quantum neural network baseline, with up to 80% detection rate within the top 10% of highest-deviation samples.

## Method Summary
Quorum uses amplitude encoding to convert normalized tabular data into quantum states, then applies random quantum autoencoders with partial qubit resets to create compressed representations. The framework executes multiple ensemble groups, each using random circuit parameters, feature subsets, bucket assignments, and compression levels. A SWAP test measures reconstruction fidelity between transformed and reference states, and deviation scores are aggregated across all runs. Data is partitioned into buckets to enhance local anomaly contrast, and the final anomaly score sums normalized z-scores across all ensemble groups. The approach requires no training, avoiding barren plateau issues common in quantum machine learning.

## Key Results
- Achieves 23% higher average F1 score compared to quantum neural network baseline
- Detects up to 80% of anomalies within the top 10% of highest-deviation samples
- Demonstrates strong resilience to quantum noise in simulations
- Shows effectiveness across four diverse datasets (medical, industrial, lexical, power plant)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Differential Response to Random Quantum Transformations
- Claim: Anomalous data points exhibit higher statistical deviation under random quantum autoencoder transformations than normal data points.
- Mechanism: Data is encoded via amplitude encoding, passed through an autoencoder with randomly initialized gate angles (from U(0, 2π)), and a SWAP test measures reconstruction fidelity. Normal data purportedly maintains higher fidelity across random transformations, while anomalies accumulate deviation. Anomaly scores aggregate these deviations across multiple runs.
- Core assumption: Anomalies possess structural properties that cause them to behave differently under random unitary transformations, though the paper does not theoretically prove why this holds.

### Mechanism 2: Localized Bucketing Enhances Anomaly Contrast
- Claim: Partitioning data into smaller random subsets (buckets) amplifies the detectability of anomalies through local statistical comparison.
- Mechanism: The dataset is divided into B buckets based on expected anomaly prevalence. Each data point is compared against others in its bucket rather than the full dataset, reducing the "averaging out" effect where anomalies are masked by dominant normal patterns. Deviation is computed as (p_i - μ)/σ per bucket.
- Core assumption: Anomalies are sufficiently rare that at least one anomaly per bucket is probable, and local statistics reveal deviations masked in global statistics.

### Mechanism 3: Ensemble Aggregation Across Compression Levels
- Claim: Aggregating SWAP test deviations across multiple compression levels and random initializations yields robust anomaly scores without training.
- Mechanism: Each ensemble group applies different random circuit parameters, feature subsets, bucket assignments, and compression levels (number of qubits reset in the bottleneck). Anomaly scores sum normalized deviations across all runs. This leverages the random projection principle: multiple random subspaces reveal structure invisible in single projections.
- Core assumption: Signal from true anomalies is consistent enough across random projections to accumulate, while noise cancels out.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Amplitude Encoding
  - Why needed here: All data must be converted to valid quantum states (‖ψ‖² = 1) before quantum processing. Understanding this explains the normalization scheme and overflow state.
  - Quick check question: Given features [0.3, 0.4, 0.5], can you compute valid amplitude-encoded probabilities?

- Concept: SWAP Test
  - Why needed here: This is the sole measurement mechanism for detecting reconstruction fidelity. Without understanding it, you cannot interpret anomaly scores.
  - Quick check question: What does a SWAP test output of 0.5 vs. 1.0 indicate about two quantum states?

- Concept: Parameter Shift Rule and Barren Plateaus
  - Why needed here: Explains why Quorum avoids training entirely—the paper motivates its design by highlighting gradient computation difficulties in QML.
  - Quick check question: Why do barren plateaus make training variational quantum circuits difficult?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Preprocessing -> Normalization -> Amplitude Encoding -> Random Ansatz -> Partial Reset -> Inverse Decode -> SWAP Test -> Deviation Scoring -> Ensemble Aggregation
- Critical path: 1) Normalize features to [0, 1/M] range, 2) Encode sample twice (transform path + reference path), 3) Apply random ansatz with compression to transform path, 4) Execute SWAP test, 5) Accumulate (p_i - μ_bucket) / σ_bucket across all runs, 6) Rank samples by total anomaly score
- Design tradeoffs: Bucket size (smaller increases sensitivity but reduces robustness), compression level (higher amplifies deviation but risks information loss), ensemble size (more groups improve robustness but increase executions), qubit count (3-qubit used, scaling adds complexity)
- Failure signatures: Near-uniform anomaly scores (features lack discriminative power), high variance across ensemble groups (reduce compression or increase ensemble size), detection rate curve too flat (bucket size miscalibrated), noisy simulation significantly worse than noiseless (check gate fidelity thresholds)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Reproduce breast cancer dataset results with default parameters to validate pipeline correctness, 2) Ablation on bucket probability p ∈ {0.5, 0.75, 0.95} on Pen-Global dataset to observe F1 score variation, 3) Noisy simulation using IBM Brisbane calibration data to verify noise resilience claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Open Question 1: Does Quorum maintain its noise resilience and detection accuracy when deployed on physical quantum hardware rather than noisy simulations?
  - Basis in paper: The authors note in Section V that executing on real hardware was "cost-prohibitive," forcing reliance on Qiskit Aer simulations with modeled noise parameters.

- Open Question 2: How does detection performance scale when increasing the encoding from 3 qubits to higher dimensions (e.g., 4 or 5 qubits)?
  - Basis in paper: Section IV.F states the approach can be scaled to larger encodings to capture "even more nuanced relationships," but experiments were limited to 3-qubit encodings due to computational constraints.

- Open Question 3: Can the selection of bucket sizes and compression levels be theoretically optimized, or must they remain empirical hyperparameters?
  - Basis in paper: The ablation study demonstrates significant variance in F1 scores based on bucket probability, suggesting performance is sensitive to these parameters.

## Limitations

- Core mechanism unproven: The theoretical basis for why anomalies exhibit higher deviation under random quantum transformations remains asserted but not mathematically derived
- Implementation details underspecified: Partial qubit reset implementation and exact ansatz structure create reproducibility challenges
- No classical baseline comparison: Framework only compared against quantum neural network, omitting classical unsupervised methods like Isolation Forests

## Confidence

- High confidence: Experimental methodology, dataset selection, and basic circuit construction are well-documented and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The ensemble aggregation mechanism and its ability to cancel noise while preserving signal is plausible but not rigorously proven
- Low confidence: The theoretical basis for why anomalies exhibit higher deviation under random transformations is asserted but not mathematically derived

## Next Checks

1. Theoretical analysis: Prove or disprove why anomalous data points should exhibit systematically different behavior under random unitary transformations compared to normal data points
2. Ablation study: Systematically vary bucket sizes and ensemble group counts to identify optimal parameters and understand their impact on detection performance
3. Cross-domain validation: Test Quorum on synthetic anomaly datasets with known ground truth to verify that detection rates are not artifacts of dataset-specific characteristics
