# Towards culturally-appropriate conversational AI for health in the majority world: An exploratory study with citizens and professionals in Latin America

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.01719
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01719
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Participatory workshops across Peru and Argentina revealed that cultural misalignment in health CAI stems from entanglement with economics, geography, and logistics, requiring family/community-centered design rather than individual-focused approaches

## Executive Summary
This study explored cultural misalignment in conversational AI for health in Latin America through eight participatory workshops with 108 citizens and professionals across Peru and Argentina. Using projective storytelling techniques and customized AI interactions, researchers identified that culture in health contexts is deeply entangled with economic constraints, geographic barriers, and logistics, rather than being merely surface-level preferences. The study found that family and community play central roles in health decision-making, challenging individual-focused CAI design, and highlighted concerns about trust, privacy, and inappropriate advice. Based on these findings, the researchers proposed a "Pluriversal Framework for Conversational AI in Health" that integrates cultural, social, and material systems to guide culturally appropriate design.

## Method Summary
The study employed eight participatory workshops (5 hours each) with 108 participants across Lima, Huancayo, Córdoba, Carlos Paz, London, and Cardiff. Participants engaged in projective storytelling using visual worksheets depicting health scenarios, followed by customized chatbot interactions via GPT-3.5 Turbo API with persona-based prompts created from group stories. Audio recordings were transcribed and translated, then analyzed using Braun & Clark reflexive thematic analysis to generate 107 codes across six categories. The approach combined qualitative data collection with real-time AI customization to explore health communication barriers and opportunities specific to Latin American contexts.

## Key Results
- Cultural misalignment in health CAI arises from entanglement with economic, geographic, and logistical factors beyond surface-level preferences
- Family and community centrality in health decision-making requires CAI to model relational dynamics, not just individual users
- Participants saw opportunities for CAI in supporting access, tailoring information, and providing emotional support while expressing concerns about trust, privacy, and inappropriate advice
- The study introduced a "Pluriversal Framework for Conversational AI in Health" integrating cultural, social, and material systems for culturally appropriate design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Participatory storytelling surfaces cultural-systemic entanglements that surveys miss
- Mechanism: Projective techniques (third-person stories) allow participants to reveal lived experiences without personal disclosure, exposing how culture intertwines with economics, geography, and logistics in health decisions
- Core assumption: Workshop participants' narratives generalize to broader populations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "entanglement of culture with economics, geography, and logistics" identified through participatory workshops
  - [section 5.1.5] Stories showed family power dynamics, gender roles, and intergenerational households affecting healthcare access in ways transactional surveys would miss
  - [corpus] Related work on convivial CAI (FMR=0.74) supports participatory approaches for service contexts
- Break condition: If target communities cannot participate in workshops (literacy, time, trust barriers), proxy methods needed

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Relational health decision-making requires modeling family/community units, not just individuals
- Mechanism: In Latin American contexts, patients function as part of family decision-making units; CAI that addresses only the individual ignores key influencers (family, in-laws, community) who control access and adherence
- Core assumption: Family-centric decision patterns hold across diverse Latin American contexts
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "centrality of family and community in decision-making"
  - [section 5.1.5] Older patients refused care if unaccompanied by adult children; women's health decisions controlled by in-laws
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence on relational CAI architectures; primarily theoretical support
- Break condition: If deployment context is highly individualistic (e.g., young urban professionals), individual-focused design may suffice

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pluriversal design (tolerance + relationality) may outperform data-scaling alone for cultural fit
- Mechanism: Rather than training on more cultural data (expensive, limited transparency), systems can embody principles of openness, humility, and context-inquiry that work across unfamiliar contexts
- Core assumption: Tolerance-based communication strategies transfer across cultural contexts
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.2.1] TCE taxonomy focuses on transactional exchange; misses entangled systemic factors
  - [section 7.1] "more relationality and tolerance, rather than just more data, may be called for"
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence limited; no direct comparisons of tolerance-based vs data-scaling approaches
- Break condition: If high-stakes medical advice requires precise cultural knowledge, tolerance strategies insufficient

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Pluriversality** (designing for "a world where many worlds fit")
  - Why needed here: Replaces assumption that CAI should "master" culture with orientation toward coexistence and humility
  - Quick check question: Can your system acknowledge uncertainty and ask clarifying questions rather than assume cultural norms?

- Concept: **Relational vs. individual autonomy**
  - Why needed here: Health decisions in many contexts involve family/community; individual-focused CAI may misrepresent who the actual decision-maker is
  - Quick check question: Have you identified who influences the user's health decisions beyond the direct interlocutor?

- Concept: **Surface vs. deep cultural adaptation** (Resnicow 1999 framework)
  - Why needed here: Surface (language, concepts) is easier but misses social/historical factors; deep adaptation required for trust
  - Quick check question: Does your adaptation address historical distrust of institutions, family structures, and economic constraints?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Individual realm**: Demographics, medical history, emotional state, information needs, linguistic form
  - **Relationships realm**: Family interdependence, kinship structure, community dynamics, responsibilities/reciprocity
  - **Ecosystems realm**: Healthcare infrastructure, economic/political systems, geography, safety/crime, natural environment
  - **Cross-cutting**: Power/discrimination, norms, values/beliefs, artifacts/tools, concepts

- Critical path:
  1. Map target population's decision-making units (individual vs. family vs. community)
  2. Identify ecosystem constraints (medication availability, transport, cost barriers)
  3. Design prompts/system to surface relational context, not just individual symptoms
  4. Implement guardrails against regionally inappropriate recommendations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More data vs. more humility: Data improves accuracy but expensive and may embed stereotypes; humility strategies scale but less precise
  - Multimodal (WhatsApp + images) vs. text-only: Addresses literacy gaps but requires more infrastructure
  - Local deployment vs. API-based: Local preserves privacy/works offline; API-based easier to deploy

- Failure signatures:
  - Recommending unavailable resources (medicines, foods, services not locally accessible)
  - Addressing only the individual when family controls decisions
  - Ignoring economic constraints (e.g., expensive treatments for low-income users)
  - Breaking guardrails via social engineering (participant demonstrated flattery could extract prescription advice)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Context-probing prompt evaluation**: Test whether system asks about family involvement, economic constraints, and local resource availability before giving advice
  2. **Regional availability check**: Query system for recommendations, verify against local pharmacy/service directories for target region
  3. **Relational scenario testing**: Present scenarios where family influences decisions; evaluate whether system acknowledges non-present stakeholders

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can CAI models be developed or adapted to effectively model relational dynamics, such as family and community influences, in health conversations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly list this as an open question in Section 7, noting that current models focus on individuals rather than the "functional unit" of the family decision-making observed in their study.
- Why unresolved: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) typically frame interactions as one-to-one exchanges between a user and a bot, lacking the technical architecture to represent collective decision-making units or interdependent relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of model architectures or prompting strategies that successfully incorporate variables for family interdependence and community dynamics, validated by studies showing improved alignment with collective health decisions in Latin America.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can models effectively integrate information on local logistics and economic constraints (e.g., availability or price of medicine) into their responses?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states in Section 7 that computing professionals must address how to integrate these factors, as the study found culture is inextricably "entangled" with material realities like supply shortages or transport limitations.
- Why unresolved: Existing cultural taxonomies and training data generally separate "culture" from "infrastructure," leading to inappropriate advice (e.g., recommending unavailable treatments) that users perceive as culturally insensitive.
- What evidence would resolve it: A CAI system capable of accessing and utilizing real-time or location-specific logistics data to provide advice that is medically accurate and materially accessible in the user's specific region.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What would a CAI based on humility and tolerance rather than cultural mirroring look like in practice?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 7.1, the authors ask, "What would a CAI based on humility and tolerance rather than cultural mirroring be like?" as a counterpoint to the impossible goal of "cultural omniscience."
- Why unresolved: Current approaches focus on "hyper-customization" or increasing cultural data, but the authors suggest this cannot capture the heterogeneity of individual lived experience; a "pluriversal" approach based on openness and mutual respect is unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Interaction design patterns derived from intercultural communication or psychotherapy principles that demonstrate high user trust and perceived appropriateness without relying on specific cultural stereotypes or deep demographic data.

## Limitations

- Geographic specificity limits generalizability - findings from Peru and Argentina may not extend across diverse Latin American contexts
- Sample size (8 workshops, 108 participants) and convenience sampling approach limit external validity
- Reliance on self-reported experiences may differ from actual health decision-making behavior
- Theoretical framework requires empirical testing in real-world deployments

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Identification of cultural misalignments in current health CAI systems (trust, privacy, inappropriate advice concerns) - supported by multiple participant groups across different locations
- **Medium Confidence**: Centrality of family and community in health decision-making - well-documented in Latin American contexts but requires validation in specific deployment contexts
- **Medium Confidence**: Entanglement of culture with economic and geographic factors - observed patterns need broader population validation
- **Low Confidence**: Proposed "Pluriversal Framework" as a generalizable design solution - theoretical framework requires empirical testing in real-world deployments

## Next Checks

1. **Regional specificity test**: Deploy prototype CAI systems in at least 3-4 distinct Latin American regions with different socioeconomic profiles to validate whether the identified cultural patterns hold across diverse contexts.

2. **Family decision-making validation**: Conduct follow-up studies with actual family units making health decisions together to verify whether CAI addressing only individuals indeed fails to capture critical influencers and constraints.

3. **Guardrail robustness evaluation**: Systematically test CAI systems with adversarial prompts across different cultural contexts to measure whether "relational tolerance" approaches maintain appropriate boundaries better than data-scaling approaches alone.
