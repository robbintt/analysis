# MEIcoder: Decoding Visual Stimuli from Neural Activity by Leveraging Most Exciting Inputs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20762
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20762
- Authors: Jan Sobotka; Luca Baroni; Ján Antolík
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: State-of-the-art visual stimulus reconstruction from V1 neural activity using MEI priors

## Executive Summary
MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction from primary visual cortex neural activity by combining neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs) as a strong prior with SSIM-based loss and adversarial training. The method outperforms existing approaches especially on scarce data and limited neuron counts, reliably capturing low-level features without hallucination. MEIcoder uses a shared CNN core with subject-specific readin modules, enabling multi-subject pre-training and fine-tuning, and demonstrates high-fidelity reconstructions from as few as 1,000-2,500 neurons.

## Method Summary
MEIcoder decodes visual stimuli from neural activity using a parameter-efficient architecture with a shared CNN core and subject-specific readin modules. The readin module combines neural responses with learnable neuron embeddings, which are pointwise-multiplied with precomputed MEIs (neuron-specific most exciting inputs) to generate context representations. These are processed through a 6-layer CNN core to reconstruct images. Training uses a combined loss of negative log-SSIM (λ=0.9) and adversarial loss (λ=0.1), with 300 epochs of AdamW optimization. MEIs are generated via gradient ascent on a CNN encoder, providing spatial templates of each neuron's preferred stimulus pattern that serve as a strong computational prior.

## Key Results
- Achieves SSIM ~0.40 and Alex(5) ~0.99 on BRAINREADER dataset with 4,500 training samples
- MEIs drive main performance gains, with ablation showing 15-20% performance drop when removed
- High-fidelity reconstructions from 1,000-2,500 neurons, with Alex(2) >0.95 at ~1,000 neurons
- Outperforms baselines in SSIM, pixel correlation, and AlexNet identification metrics across three datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Neuron-specific Most Exciting Inputs (MEIs) serve as a strong computational prior that drives the majority of reconstruction performance gains.
- Mechanism: MEIs provide explicit spatial templates of each neuron's preferred stimulus pattern. During decoding, neural responses weight these templates, which are then combined through learned nonlinear transformations in the CNN core to reconstruct images.
- Core assumption: The receptive field properties captured by MEIs are sufficient to constrain the inverse mapping from neural activity to visual stimuli, and residual nonlinearities can be learned by the decoder.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers of the performance"
  - [section 4.5] "The results in Figure 4 show that MEIs have the most significant positive influence on the state-of-the-art performance of MEIcoder. Indeed, compared to the individual ablations of the SSIM loss or the neuron embeddings, the removal of MEIs leads to the largest drop in performance in terms of all metrics."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on MEI-based priors for neural decoding; related work focuses on fMRI decoding with diffusion models rather than single-neuron receptive field priors.
- Break condition: MEI quality degrades substantially (Table 6 shows performance drops when MEIs are corrupted with high noise std=3), or neurons have highly nonlinear response properties not captured by MEI templates.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SSIM-based reconstruction loss prioritizes perceptually salient structural features over pixel-wise accuracy, improving visual reconstruction quality.
- Mechanism: The negative log-SSIM loss (Equation 1) optimizes for structural similarity including luminance, contrast, and spatial structure correlations, rather than minimizing mean squared error which treats all pixel deviations equally.
- Core assumption: Perceptual image quality correlates better with structural similarity metrics than with pixel-wise distance for the task of visual stimulus reconstruction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "we found this training objective more effective at producing perceptually accurate reconstructions compared to standard objectives such as the mean squared error (MSE)"
  - [section 4.5] Ablation shows SSIM loss removal causes measurable performance degradation across metrics.
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus papers discuss reconstruction but don't compare loss functions systematically.
- Break condition: When precise pixel-level accuracy is required over perceptual quality, or when SSIM's assumptions about human perception don't match evaluation criteria.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Parameter-efficient core/readin architecture enables multi-subject pre-training with subject-specific fine-tuning, improving data efficiency.
- Mechanism: The shared CNN core learns general visual decoding transformations across subjects, while lightweight subject-specific readin modules (using MEIs and neuron embeddings) adapt to individual neural response patterns. This allows knowledge transfer even when neuron counts and response-stimulus mappings differ.
- Core assumption: There exist transferable visual decoding principles across subjects despite individual variation in neural coding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method uses a shared CNN core with subject-specific readin modules, enabling multi-subject pre-training and fine-tuning"
  - [section 4.4] "Comparing the FT version against others in Table 1... outperforming the single-subject training in some cases"
  - [corpus] Corpus papers (e.g., "From Flat to Round") discuss individual anatomical variations but don't address this specific transfer learning approach.
- Break condition: When subject-specific neural coding differs fundamentally (limited transfer gains observed on SENSORIUM 2022 dataset per section 5 limitations).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Receptive fields and MEIs
  - Why needed here: Understanding that neurons respond preferentially to specific spatial patterns is essential for grasping why MEIs provide an effective prior for decoding.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a neuron's "most exciting input" approximates its receptive field for linear neurons but differs for nonlinear neurons?

- Concept: Inverse problems in neural decoding
  - Why needed here: The paper frames decoding as an inverse problem where neural activity is a compressed, noisy representation of visual stimuli.
  - Quick check question: Why does neural population sparsity and limited neuron counts make the decoding inverse problem ill-posed?

- Concept: Adversarial training for natural image priors
  - Why needed here: The discriminator pushes reconstructions toward natural image statistics without hallucination.
  - Quick check question: How does the adversarial loss differ from using a pre-trained generative model (like diffusion) as a prior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Neural responses → MEI weighting → core CNN → image
- Critical path: Neural responses → MEI multiplication → core CNN → reconstructed image. The MEI multiplication is the key biological prior injection point.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - MEIs provide strong prior but require pre-training an encoding model (~70 min overhead)
  - SSIM loss improves perceptual quality but may sacrifice pixel accuracy
  - Parameter-efficient architecture limits model capacity; may not scale to higher visual areas (V4, IT) without architectural changes
- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting to training images: check validation SSIM divergence
  - Hallucination (genai-style): should be rare; check discriminator balance
  - Blurry reconstructions: may indicate weak MEI signal or insufficient neuron count
  - Spatial misalignment: MEI computation or retinotopy issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate single-subject MEIcoder on BRAINREADER with 4,500 training samples; verify SSIM ~0.40 and Alex(5) ~0.99
  2. Ablate MEIs (replace with random noise or learned embeddings) to confirm performance drop matches paper's ~15-20% figure
  3. Test neuron scaling: train with 1,000, 2,500, 5,000, 8,587 neurons to reproduce Figure 8 scaling curve and verify Alex(2) >0.95 with ~1,000 neurons

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can MEIcoder effectively decode visual stimuli from higher-order visual areas (e.g., V4 or IT) where receptive fields are more complex than in V1?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section: "we did not test our method on higher-order areas such as V4."
- Why unresolved: While MEIcoder handles V1 non-linearity, neurons in higher areas exhibit complex shape selectivity and larger receptive fields, which may not be as effectively reconstructed using the current MEI-weighting strategy designed for localized retinotopy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying MEIcoder to datasets of macaque V4/IT neural recordings and evaluating if the SSIM and identification scores remain state-of-the-art compared to GenAI baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why does multi-subject transfer learning improve performance on the BRAINREADER dataset but fail to do so on the SENSORIUM 2022 dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note: "Empirically, we found performance gains from transfer on the BRAINREADER dataset, but not on the SENSORIUM 2022 data."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the failure is due to architectural constraints (shared core capacity), differences in data heterogeneity between the two mouse populations, or distinct noise characteristics preventing effective weight reuse.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic ablation study analyzing domain shifts and neuron embedding alignment between SENSORIUM subjects to identify the bottleneck in the transfer learning pipeline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can evaluation metrics be improved to better align with the qualitative visual fidelity observed in scaling experiments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 4.5, the authors observe that "quantitative measures start to plateau, but the qualitative (visual) results keep steadily improving."
- Why unresolved: Standard metrics like Pixel Correlation and two-way identification appear to saturate earlier than the model's actual perceptual performance, potentially obscuring the true benefits of scaling data or neuron counts.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and validation of a new metric that correlates with the "steady qualitative improvement" noted by the authors, specifically measuring high-frequency texture and edge fidelity.

## Limitations

- Dataset access constraints: BRAINREADER data availability not clearly specified, limiting reproducibility for main results
- MEI generation details underspecified: exact encoder architecture and training parameters for generating neuron-specific MEIs are not provided
- Limited cross-dataset generalization: transfer learning benefits observed primarily on BRAINREADER dataset, with SENSORIUM 2022 showing minimal gains

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Claims about MEI ablation performance degradation are well-supported by direct experimental evidence showing 15-20% performance drops when MEIs are removed.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about multi-subject pre-training benefits are moderately supported but limited to one dataset (BRAINREADER), with transfer learning showing minimal gains on SENSORIUM 2022.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about perceptual quality improvements from SSIM loss are supported by ablation studies but lack direct perceptual human evaluation to confirm the subjective quality improvements.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate MEI ablation study on SENSORIUM 2022 to verify performance degradation matches BRAINREADER results (~15-20% drop) and test generalizability of MEI importance claims.
2. Test transfer learning on SENSORIUM 2022 by fine-tuning pre-trained BRAINREADER model to verify whether limited gains are dataset-specific or reflect fundamental constraints in cross-subject transfer.
3. Conduct controlled ablation of SSIM vs MSE loss on a subset of BRAINREADER data with human perceptual evaluation to verify that structural similarity correlates with human judgments of reconstruction quality.
