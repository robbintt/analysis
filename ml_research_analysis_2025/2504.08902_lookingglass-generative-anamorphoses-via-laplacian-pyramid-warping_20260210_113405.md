- Anamorphic image generation method using Laplacian Pyramid Warping for high-frequency preservation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LookingGlass, a novel approach for generating high-quality anamorphic images using latent diffusion models. The method addresses the challenge of preserving high-frequency details during complex spatial transformations by implementing Laplacian Pyramid Warping in pixel space. The approach extends Visual Anagrams to latent space models and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods across three anamorphic setups, achieving better CLIP alignment scores and lower FID/KID metrics while maintaining reasonable inference times on modern hardware.

## Method Summary
LookingGlass employs a two-stage generation process where the model first generates a hidden image that appears distorted when viewed normally but reveals the target content through specific devices like mirrors or lenses. The core innovation is Laplacian Pyramid Warping, which operates in pixel space to preserve high-frequency details during spatial transformations. The method uses latent rectified flow models and implements image warping at multiple scales using Laplacian pyramids, effectively avoiding artifacts that arise from direct latent-space deformations. The approach is evaluated on three anamorphic setups: vertical flip, 135° rotation, and cylindrical mirror configurations.

## Key Results
- CLIP alignment scores improved from 0.673 to 0.698 for SyncTweedies on cylindrical mirror setup
- Lower FID/KID metrics demonstrate better image quality preservation compared to baselines
- User study with 27 participants showed preference for generated results over prior work in prompt fidelity, style adherence, and visual quality
- ~80s inference time per pair using Stable Diffusion 3.5 on RTX 4090

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Laplacian Pyramid Warping technique works by decomposing images into multiple frequency bands and applying spatial transformations at each scale independently. This multi-scale approach preserves high-frequency details that would otherwise be lost during complex geometric transformations. By operating in pixel space rather than latent space, the method avoids the smoothing and detail loss typically associated with latent-space deformations. The frequency-aware warping ensures that fine details remain sharp and visible even after significant spatial distortion.

## Foundational Learning
- **Laplacian Pyramid Decomposition**: A multi-scale image representation technique that separates image content into different frequency bands. Why needed: Enables frequency-aware processing of spatial transformations. Quick check: Verify pyramid reconstruction matches original image within numerical tolerance.
- **Anamorphic Image Generation**: Creating images that appear distorted normally but reveal hidden content through specific viewing devices. Why needed: Core problem domain requiring preservation of hidden information through geometric transformations. Quick check: Test with simple mirror transformations to validate basic functionality.
- **Latent Diffusion Models**: Generative models that operate in compressed latent space rather than pixel space. Why needed: Provides foundation for understanding the challenge of preserving details during spatial transformations. Quick check: Compare generation quality with and without spatial transformations.
- **CLIP Score Alignment**: Measuring semantic alignment between generated images and text prompts using contrastive language-image pretraining models. Why needed: Quantitative metric for evaluating prompt fidelity in generated images. Quick check: Validate CLIP score improvements across different prompt variations.
- **FID/KID Metrics**: Fréchet Inception Distance and Kernel Inception Distance for measuring distribution similarity between generated and real images. Why needed: Standard metrics for evaluating generative model quality. Quick check: Ensure metrics are consistent across multiple evaluation runs.
- **Rectified Flow Models**: Diffusion models that use flow-based transformations in latent space. Why needed: Underlying model architecture for the generation process. Quick check: Verify stable training and generation capabilities.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Stable Diffusion 3.5 -> Laplacian Pyramid Decomposition -> Multi-scale Warping -> Reconstruction -> Anamorphic Output

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from the base diffusion model through the Laplacian pyramid decomposition, where each frequency band undergoes independent warping operations. The warped components are then reconstructed to produce the final anamorphic image. The multi-scale approach ensures that high-frequency details are preserved through the transformation process.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The method trades computational complexity for quality preservation, as multi-scale processing requires more computation than single-scale approaches. Operating in pixel space provides better detail preservation but requires careful handling of the latent-to-pixel conversion. The choice of pyramid levels balances computational cost against frequency separation quality.

**Failure Signatures**
Common failure modes include loss of fine details in extreme transformations, visible seams at pyramid level boundaries, and generation artifacts when the warping operation exceeds the model's learned transformation capabilities. The method may also struggle with very high-frequency patterns that cannot be adequately represented in the chosen pyramid structure.

**First Experiments**
1. Generate simple vertical flip anamorphoses to verify basic functionality and quality preservation
2. Test with 135° rotation setup to evaluate handling of moderate geometric transformations
3. Validate cylindrical mirror generation to assess performance on more complex transformation scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation conducted using only Stable Diffusion 3.5, limiting generalizability to other latent diffusion models
- ~80s inference time per pair may not scale efficiently for larger batch processing or real-time applications
- User study with 27 participants provides reasonable validation but may not capture diverse perceptual preferences across broader populations
- CLIP alignment improvements rely on relative score differences that could be influenced by prompt selection bias

## Confidence
- High: Technical validity of Laplacian Pyramid Warping implementation and its effectiveness in preserving high-frequency details during spatial transformations
- Medium: Quantitative improvements in CLIP scores and FID/KID metrics across different anamorphic setups
- Medium: User study preference results, given the reasonable sample size but limited demographic diversity

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method across multiple latent diffusion models (e.g., SDXL, Kandinsky) to assess architectural generalization
2. Conduct a larger-scale perceptual study with diverse participant demographics to validate robustness of user preferences
3. Benchmark computational efficiency for batch generation scenarios to determine practical deployment constraints
