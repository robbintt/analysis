core_contribution: This paper addresses the limitations of existing information-theoretic
  multi-view learning methods that rely on the assumption of multi-view redundancy,
  which states that common information between views is necessary and sufficient for
  downstream tasks. The proposed Comprehensive Information-theoretic Multi-view Learning
  (CIML) framework explicitly discards this assumption by jointly leveraging both
  common and unique information.

# Towards Comprehensive Information-theoretic Multi-view Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.02084
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02084
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposed CIML framework outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view learning methods by explicitly leveraging both common and unique information across views

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel information-theoretic framework for multi-view learning that challenges the conventional assumption of multi-view redundancy. The Comprehensive Information-theoretic Multi-view Learning (CIML) framework explicitly models both common information shared across views and unique information specific to individual views. The method consists of two complementary modules: one that learns compressed common representations using Gacs-Korner common information and Information Bottleneck principles, and another that captures unique information while minimizing redundancy between views. Theoretical analysis proves that the learned joint representations are predictively sufficient for downstream tasks.

## Method Summary
CIML operates through two interconnected modules that jointly optimize for both common and unique information across multiple views. The consistency-learning module first identifies the Gacs-Korner common information between views and then applies the Information Bottleneck principle to compress this common information into task-relevant representations. Simultaneously, the uniqueness-learning module uses Information Bottleneck to extract compressed unique representations from each view while explicitly minimizing mutual information between unique representations and common representations, as well as among different unique representations. This dual approach ensures that the final joint representation captures both shared and distinctive information without redundancy, theoretically guaranteeing predictive sufficiency for downstream tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 100% accuracy on MSRC-v1 dataset, outperforming all baseline methods
- Demonstrates superior performance across six real-world datasets including LandUse-21, Caltech101-20, NUS, Scene-15, and NoisyMNIST
- Validates the theoretical claim that modeling both common and unique information improves multi-view learning performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly breaking away from the traditional multi-view redundancy assumption that common information alone is sufficient for learning. By recognizing that unique information in each view can contain task-relevant signals not captured by common information, CIML creates a more comprehensive representation. The Information Bottleneck principle ensures that representations are compressed to retain only task-relevant information while discarding noise. The mutual information minimization between common and unique components prevents redundancy and ensures complementary information capture. This architecture allows the model to leverage the full information spectrum available across views rather than discarding potentially valuable unique signals.

## Foundational Learning

**Gacs-Korner Common Information**: A measure of the shared information between multiple random variables that captures what is common to all views. Needed because traditional mutual information measures don't properly capture multi-way common information. Quick check: Verify that the common information measure satisfies the properties of non-negativity and monotonicity.

**Information Bottleneck Principle**: A framework for extracting relevant representations by compressing input while preserving information about a target variable. Needed to ensure learned representations are both compact and task-relevant. Quick check: Confirm that the compression tradeoff parameter β appropriately balances information preservation versus compression.

**Mutual Information Minimization**: A technique to reduce redundancy between different information components. Needed to ensure unique representations capture genuinely distinctive information rather than overlapping with common information. Quick check: Verify that mutual information between common and unique components decreases during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Views -> Consistency Module (Gacs-Korner + IB) -> Common Representation; Input Views -> Uniqueness Module (IB) -> Unique Representations -> Joint Representation

**Critical Path**: Data flows through both modules in parallel, with the consistency module processing all views together to extract common information, while the uniqueness module processes each view independently to capture distinctive features. The two streams converge to form the final joint representation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances between capturing sufficient common information for generalization while preserving unique information that might contain domain-specific cues. The mutual information minimization introduces additional computational overhead but ensures cleaner separation of information types.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may occur when views are highly redundant (making unique information extraction unnecessary) or when views are nearly independent (making common information extraction difficult). The method may also struggle with noisy unique information that could degrade overall performance.

**Three First Experiments**: 1) Compare performance with and without the uniqueness module to quantify the contribution of unique information. 2) Test on synthetic datasets with controlled correlation structures to validate behavior across different view relationships. 3) Implement ablation studies with different compression levels in the Information Bottleneck to find optimal tradeoff parameters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees are based on idealized assumptions that may not hold in all real-world scenarios
- The assumption that unique information is valuable may not be universally applicable, particularly for highly redundant views
- Limited empirical validation across diverse domains and view configurations
- No statistical significance testing between methods in experimental results

## Confidence

**Performance Claims**: High confidence - Results show consistent improvement over baselines with standard evaluation metrics, though limited dataset diversity and lack of significance testing reduce certainty.

**Theoretical Framework**: Medium confidence - Information-theoretic formulation is mathematically sound, but practical applicability across diverse scenarios needs broader validation.

**Assumption Rejection**: Medium confidence - The claim that multi-view redundancy assumption is limiting is theoretically reasonable, but empirical evidence of failure scenarios is limited.

## Next Checks

1. Test CIML on datasets with varying degrees of view correlation (highly correlated, moderately correlated, and nearly independent views) to validate whether the framework consistently benefits from modeling both common and unique information across different correlation structures.

2. Conduct ablation studies comparing CIML with variants that only use common information, only use unique information, or use different weighting schemes between the two components to quantify the actual contribution of each information type.

3. Implement cross-domain validation by training on one dataset and testing on structurally similar but distinct datasets to evaluate the generalization capability of the learned representations beyond the training distribution.
