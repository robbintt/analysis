# Fairness Interventions: A Study in AI Explainability

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.14766
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14766
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Primary result**: FairDream achieves Equalized Odds when targeting Demographic Parity, revealing conservative bias in fairness correction.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates fairness interventions in AI classification, focusing on the transparency of corrective methods. FairDream, a fairness package, increases error weights on disadvantaged groups during model training to mitigate bias. Experiments show that while targeting Demographic Parity, FairDream instead achieves Equalized Odds, suggesting a conservative bias inherent to data distribution. The study compares FairDream with GridSearch and argues that Equalized Odds, conditioned on true labels, provides a more reliable fairness metric than Demographic Parity in cases where labels are factual and transparent.

## Method Summary
FairDream is an in-processing fairness method that applies sample-weighted loss functions to XGBoost classifiers. It detects protected group disparities by comparing selection rates across features and triggers correction when ratios exceed a threshold (typically 3:1). The method trains 5 competing models with ascending group weights computed as w_n(S_k) = rate_indivs_disadvantaged × exp(n × gap_fair_scores). Models are evaluated using a trade-off score (1/3 × ROC-AUC + 2/3 × fair_score), and the best model is selected. The approach is tested on Census income data and benchmarked against GridSearch from Fairlearn library.

## Key Results
- FairDream achieves Equalized Odds when targeting Demographic Parity, revealing conservative bias inherent to data environment.
- FairDream maintains higher accuracy than GridSearch while achieving similar fairness outcomes.
- The method converges to Equalized Odds due to incentivizing predictions aligned with true labels rather than overall selection rates.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: FairDream's sample-weighted loss function causes convergence toward Equalized Odds even when users target Demographic Parity.
- **Mechanism**: FairDream assigns ascending weights to disadvantaged groups based on their baseline disparity. These weights multiply the classification error term directly in the loss function (L = Σ w_n(S_k) × l(y_i, ŷ_i)). Because weights apply to errors relative to true labels, the model is incentivized to predict ŷ_i aligned with ground truth y_i, which equalizes TPR and FPR across groups rather than overall selection rates.
- **Core assumption**: The training data's true labels are factually reliable and should constrain the correction.
- **Evidence anchors**: Experiments show FairDream tends toward Equalized Odds; FairDream-style classifier is strongly incentivized to give predictions in accordance with true label y_i ∈ {0,1}.
- **Break condition**: If true labels contain systematic bias or are evaluative rather than factual, the mechanism may perpetuate unfair base rates.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: GridSearch achieves Demographic Parity by allowing predictions to deviate from true labels when the fairness constraint penalty exceeds the classification error penalty.
- **Mechanism**: GridSearch formulates the problem as constrained optimization: minimize loss subject to F(φ) ≤ η, implemented via Lagrange multipliers. The fairness term λᵀ(F(φ) - η) can dominate the classification loss term, incentivizing ŷ_i = 1 even when y_i = 0 if needed to equalize overall positive rates.
- **Core assumption**: Violating label fidelity is acceptable if it achieves the target fairness criterion.
- **Evidence anchors**: GridSearch predicted every woman to earn over $50,000 (ROC-AUC = 56%, false positive rate = 100%); fairness term incentivizes predicting ŷ_i = 1 even if true label is y_i = 0.
- **Break condition**: When λ values are small relative to classification loss weights, GridSearch may behave similarly to FairDream.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The divergence between user intent (Demographic Parity) and actual outcome (Equalized Odds) can be understood as a near-Simpson's reversal effect.
- **Mechanism**: When conditioning on true labels Y, the apparent group disparity in predictions (p(Ŷ=1|A=1) >> p(Ŷ=1|B=1)) reverses or equalizes within each label stratum. This reflects that the intervention respects ceteris paribus counterfactuals—comparing individuals with the same income level across age groups—rather than unconditional group averages.
- **Core assumption**: Fairness evaluations should hold relevant properties (like true income) constant when making counterfactual comparisons.
- **Evidence anchors**: FairDream achieves near conditional independence of predictor's decision relative to age variable; triad of counterfactuals is formally inconsistent in standard semantics.
- **Break condition**: When base rates are equal across groups, the paradox structure dissolves and DP ≈ EO.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Demographic Parity vs. Equalized Odds**
  - **Why needed here**: These are the two competing fairness criteria the paper investigates. DP requires p(Ŷ=1|A) = p(Ŷ=1|B) unconditionally; EO requires p(Ŷ=1|A,Y=y) = p(Ŷ=1|B,Y=y) for y∈{0,1}.
  - **Quick check question**: If a model selects 50% of both men and women for a job, but among qualified candidates it selects 80% of men and 20% of women, which criterion is satisfied and which is violated?

- **Concept: In-processing Fairness Methods**
  - **Why needed here**: FairDream is an in-processing method (intervenes during training), distinct from pre-processing (modifying data) and post-processing (adjusting thresholds). Understanding this placement clarifies why the method interacts with the loss function directly.
  - **Quick check question**: Why might an in-processing method be preferable when you need to explain the correction mechanism to non-technical stakeholders?

- **Concept: Base Rate Sensitivity**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper argues that ignoring base rate differences leads to "base rate neglect" when demanding Demographic Parity.
  - **Quick check question**: If Group A has a 10% true positive base rate and Group B has a 40% true positive base rate, can a classifier achieve both Demographic Parity and high accuracy? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Detection module → Reweighting engine → Multi-model training → Trade-off evaluation → Model selection → Explainability output
- **Critical path**: Detection → Weight computation → Multi-model training → Trade-off evaluation → Model selection → Explainability output (showing which criterion was actually achieved)
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Transparency vs. flexibility: Weight formula is simple and deterministic for lay-user interpretability, but may not optimize EO as precisely as gradient-based constrained methods.
  - Accuracy vs. Demographic Parity: FairDream explicitly trades DP for accuracy; if DP is legally mandated, GridSearch may be required despite accuracy loss.
  - Conservative vs. revisionary correction: FairDream assumes labels are factual; evaluative labels may require pre-processing to address label bias.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Near-random AUC (~50-60%) with high OPR equality: Indicates GridSearch-style overfitting to fairness constraint.
  - Persistent TPR/FPR gaps after correction: May indicate weight scaling is insufficient.
  - Calibration gap widening: Expected trade-off when optimizing EO; not a failure if EO is the target.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Train standard XGBoost on Census data; measure OPR, TPR, FPR gaps by age group to establish detection threshold trigger points.
  2. FairDream vs. GridSearch ablation: Run both methods targeting DP on same train/test split; compare ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and actual fairness criterion achieved.
  3. Feature sensitivity test: Apply FairDream correction independently on age, sex, and education features; observe whether EO convergence holds across different protected attributes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can fairness interventions like FairDream be adapted to handle evaluative or judge-dependent labels (e.g., "good credit risk") where the ground truth itself may be biased, rather than factual labels like income?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper distinguishes between factual labels (income) and evaluative ones (credit risk), noting that for evaluative labels, acting on the labels is a delicate matter.
- **Why unresolved**: FairDream is designed to converge toward Equalized Odds based on the assumption that true labels are reliable and factual. The authors admit that this conservative approach may fail or be inappropriate when the "true" labels reflect historical social biases.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A theoretical or empirical extension of FairDream applied to datasets with known biased labels showing how the reweighting mechanism would need to change.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Why does the FairDream reweighting mechanism result in random classifier behavior (ROC-AUC ~50%) when applied to Neural Networks, and can this architectural incompatibility be resolved?
- **Basis in paper**: Results on neural networks were non-significant, as FairDream and GridSearch systematically implemented random classifiers to reach perfect Demographic Parity.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper successfully demonstrates FairDream's efficacy on tree-based models but fails to explain the specific optimization dynamics that cause the method to collapse into random guessing when applied to deep learning architectures.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An analysis of gradient updates or loss landscapes in neural networks under FairDream's exponential weighting scheme.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Does the "transparency" provided by FairDream's reweighting explanation actually improve lay user trust and comprehension compared to standard constraint-based methods?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper is titled "A Study in AI Explainability" and argues that ensuring fairness requires explaining which variables constrain its realization.
- **Why unresolved**: While the mechanism (weights based on disadvantage) is mathematically transparent to the authors, it remains an untested hypothesis that this specific implementation clarifies mechanisms and outcomes of corrections for non-technical users.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Results from a user study where lay participants interpret FairDream's outputs versus GridSearch outputs.

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: How does FairDream's correction impact non-protected variables and downstream decision-making (ripple effects) in a live deployment environment?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper briefly mentions the "ripple effect trap" and suggests that controlled experimentation on effects of new labels distribution is needed.
- **Why unresolved**: The study is confined to static datasets (Census) and does not investigate whether leveling up weights for a disadvantaged group inadvertently distorts correlations with other features.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A/B testing or field experiments in a live setting to measure long-term outcomes and ripple effects on variables not explicitly protected during training.

## Limitations

- The core claim that FairDream inherently converges to Equalized Odds due to conservative data assumptions lacks mechanistic detail across different datasets and bias structures.
- The mechanism linking true label fidelity to Equalized Odds achievement is theorized but not empirically validated across multiple domains beyond the Census income prediction task.
- The normative distinction between factual and evaluative labels as a basis for choosing between DP and EO remains philosophical rather than practically testable.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: FairDream achieves higher accuracy than GridSearch while maintaining Equalized Odds; the trade-off between DP and accuracy is real and measurable.
- **Medium confidence**: The conservative bias mechanism (weighting errors relative to true labels) reliably produces EO rather than DP; this requires validation across datasets with different label characteristics.
- **Low confidence**: The philosophical argument for EO as the "correct" fairness criterion when labels are factual; this is normative rather than empirical.

## Next Checks

1. Test FairDream across multiple datasets with varying base rate disparities (e.g., COMPAS recidivism, credit scoring) to verify EO convergence is consistent.
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the weight scaling formula to determine sensitivity to exponential term parameters.
3. Implement a controlled experiment where true labels are systematically biased (evaluative vs. factual) to test whether FairDream perpetuates unfair base rates.
