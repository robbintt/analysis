# Exploring Patterns Behind Sports

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.07491
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07491
- Authors: Chang Liu; Chengcheng Ma; XuanQi Zhou
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: Hybrid ARIMA-LSTM model achieves high accuracy (RMSE=0.098, MAE=0.072) for Olympic medal prediction using feature engineering, statistical testing, and interpretability methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a hybrid ARIMA-LSTM model for time series prediction in sports contexts, integrating feature engineering (embedding, PCA), statistical testing (runs test), and interpretability methods (SHAP). The model captures both linear and nonlinear patterns in medal count data, achieving high accuracy with low RMSE and MAE scores. The framework includes athlete and national team evaluation via embedding and PCA, KNN for interval prediction, and ablation studies to validate component significance. Additional analyses explore gender participation trends, "traditional advantages" using SHAP, and optimal coaching investment strategies via Coach Impact Index. Results highlight model robustness and provide actionable insights for Olympic performance forecasting and resource allocation.

## Method Summary
The method combines ARIMA for linear trend modeling with LSTM for nonlinear dependencies, using embedding and PCA for feature engineering. The process involves preprocessing historical Olympic data, creating 10-dimensional embeddings for categorical variables (NOC, edition, games, awards, sport), concatenating to 50-dimensional vectors, and reducing to 5 dimensions via PCA. A sliding window constructs state matrices, ARIMA predicts linear trends (d=1, tuned p/q), LSTM captures nonlinear patterns, and KNN (K=2) generates prediction intervals. The model is trained for 500 epochs with MSE loss and evaluated using RMSE and MAE in embedding space.

## Key Results
- Hybrid ARIMA-LSTM achieves RMSE=0.098 and MAE=0.072 for medal count predictions
- Model captures both linear trends (ARIMA) and nonlinear dependencies (LSTM) effectively
- Ablation studies validate component significance, with KNN providing robust prediction intervals
- Sensitivity analysis shows accuracy drops to 51% below 75% data coverage threshold

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Linear-Nonlinear Pattern Decomposition
The hybrid architecture improves forecasting by separating linear trends from complex nonlinear dependencies in medal data. ARIMA captures linear autocorrelations and stationarity, while LSTM uses gating mechanisms to capture long-term nonlinear dependencies in residuals. Core assumption: The time series contains additive components where linear signal is captured by autoregression, leaving LSTM to focus on nonlinear residuals.

### Mechanism 2: Dimensionality Reduction via Embedding and PCA
High-cardinality categorical data (athletes, countries) is converted to continuous vectors, capturing latent "quality" features. Categorical variables are mapped to 10-dimensional vectors, concatenated, and compressed via PCA to 5 dimensions, reducing noise while retaining variance. Core assumption: Principal components from static athlete embeddings represent dynamic competitive strength of national teams.

### Mechanism 3: Instance-Based Interval Estimation (KNN)
Prediction intervals are derived from historical precedents rather than theoretical distributions. The model projects predicted state into embedding space and uses K-Nearest Neighbors to find similar historical situations, with actual outcomes forming the prediction interval. Core assumption: Euclidean distance in reduced feature space correlates with similarity in medal-winning potential.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Stationarity and Differencing (ARIMA)**
  - Why needed here: Medal counts require stationarity (constant mean/variance) via differencing ($d$) before autoregressive modeling
  - Quick check question: If a country's medal count trends strictly upward over 100 years, is the raw series stationary?

- **Concept: LSTM Gating (Long Short-Term Memory)**
  - Why needed here: LSTM captures nonlinear dependencies using gating mechanisms to prevent vanishing gradients in long Olympic history sequences
  - Quick check question: What does the "Forget Gate" technically do to the cell state $C_{t-1}$?

- **Concept: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
  - Why needed here: Reduces 50-dimensional athlete vectors to 5 dimensions by finding axes of maximum variance
  - Quick check question: Does PCA ensure that compressed features are independent or merely uncorrelated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input data → Embedding/PCA preprocessing → ARIMA linear prediction → LSTM nonlinear processing → KNN interval estimation
- **Critical path:** Concatenation of ARIMA-predicted features ($N_t$) and PCA-reduced athlete matrix ($M_t$) immediately prior to LSTM input
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Memory vs. Noise: Excluding athletes absent >5 games reduces noise but may discard "legendary" influence
  - Compression vs. Information: Reducing to 5 dimensions improves efficiency but risks losing specific sport-nuance signals
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Data Sparsity: Accuracy drops to ~51% below 75% data coverage
  - Runs Test Rejection: Random medal sequences (p-value > 0.10) are not learnable by this architecture
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation Study: Train without ARIMA branch to quantify linear component contribution to RMSE
  2. Window Sensitivity: Vary "outdated athlete" exclusion threshold to assess impact on predictions
  3. Interval Calibration: Verify KNN-predicted intervals accurately cover ground truth values (95% coverage target)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the model's prediction accuracy be stabilized for NOCs with sparse historical data or participation rates below 75% coverage? The paper identifies the 75% threshold but doesn't propose mechanisms like transfer learning or data augmentation for low-data regimes.

### Open Question 2
Does excluding athletes participating in more than five consecutive Olympic Games introduce systematic bias against nations with higher "legendary" athlete retention? The paper assumes these athletes represent "noise" without validating if their exclusion removes critical performance indicators.

### Open Question 3
Does the "Coach Impact Index" fail to capture coaching value in team sports where medal counts are capped at one per tournament? The index relies on medal volume deviations and may be mathematically insensitive to improvement in sports with single medal outcomes.

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed architectural specifications (LSTM configuration, embedding methodology) hinders exact reproduction
- Linear-nonlinear decomposition mechanism may not hold for all time series patterns in sports contexts
- KNN-based interval estimation has minimal direct evidence in provided corpus

## Confidence
- High confidence: Hybrid ARIMA-LSTM framework for time series prediction
- Medium confidence: Specific 50→5 dimensional PCA reduction for athlete embeddings
- Low confidence: KNN-based interval estimation method

## Next Checks
1. **Interval Calibration Test:** Verify KNN-predicted intervals achieve claimed coverage rates by calculating percentage of true values falling within predicted bounds across multiple validation folds
2. **Data Sparsity Analysis:** Systematically vary data coverage threshold below 75% to quantify where prediction accuracy collapses
3. **ARIMA Component Isolation:** Conduct ablation study removing ARIMA branch entirely and compare performance to validate hybrid approach provides statistically significant improvement over pure LSTM
