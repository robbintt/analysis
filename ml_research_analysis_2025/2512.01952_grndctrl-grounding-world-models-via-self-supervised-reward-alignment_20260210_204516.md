# GrndCtrl: Grounding World Models via Self-Supervised Reward Alignment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.01952
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01952
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Up to 64% reduction in translation error under counterfactual scenarios using self-supervised geometric rewards

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RLWG (Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained video world models with physically verifiable spatial and temporal structure. The method uses geometric and perceptual rewards from frozen evaluators to improve trajectory stability and spatial coherence in world model rollouts. GrndCtrl, instantiated with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), achieves substantial improvements over supervised fine-tuning baselines, particularly in counterfactual action scenarios where directionally inverted actions must be followed while maintaining geometric consistency.

## Method Summary
GrndCtrl post-trains Cosmos-Predict2-2B Video2World via 100 steps of GRPO, sampling 8 stochastic rollouts per context from controlled diffusion noise. Rewards come from frozen MapAnything (pose/depth) and VideoAlign (visual/motion) evaluators. The framework combines translation, rotation, depth reprojection, and video quality rewards with fixed weights (α=β=0.5). Baseline SFT fine-tunes the DiT backbone for 20k steps with MSE+EDM loss. Likelihood ratios are computed over first 60% of 35 diffusion timesteps for stability.

## Key Results
- Up to 64% reduction in translation error under counterfactual action scenarios
- 15-30% translation error reduction in Seen regime with T+R rewards only
- Full reward set produces most balanced performance, maintaining video quality while improving geometric consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Verifiable geometric rewards provide denser physical grounding than reconstruction losses
- Frozen 3D evaluator extracts relative pose/depth from rollouts; rewards compare against commanded actions
- Assumes evaluator accuracy; fails if evaluator errors systematically bias reward signal

### Mechanism 2
- Group-relative advantage estimation stabilizes continuous video generation updates
- Sample G stochastic rollouts; compute normalized advantages within group; apply clipped surrogate with KL regularization
- Assumes sufficient variance across rollouts; fails if all rollouts are uniformly good/bad

### Mechanism 3
- Multi-objective reward combination trades off local coherence against global alignment
- Translation+rotation rewards improve long-horizon trajectory alignment; depth reprojection enforces local geometric smoothness
- Assumes individual rewards are complementary; fails if over-optimization on one reward causes collapse

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion sampling as stochastic differential equations**
  - Why needed: GrndCtrl generates diverse rollouts via controlled noise injection (η) in reverse SDE/ODE sampling
  - Quick check: Explain how η controls trade-off between ODE determinism and SDE stochasticity

- **Policy gradient with clipped surrogate objective (PPO-style)**
  - Why needed: GRPO adapts PPO-style clipping to video generation, stabilizing updates via likelihood ratio clipping
  - Quick check: What role does clip ratio ε play in preventing destructive policy updates?

- **3D geometric reprojection and pose cycle-consistency**
  - Why needed: Depth temporal reprojection reward validates geometric coherence across frames using depth, relative pose, and intrinsics
  - Quick check: How does depth reprojection error indicate geometric inconsistency in a rollout?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Pretrained world model → 3D evaluator (MapAnything) → Video evaluator (VideoAlign) → GRPO loop
- **Critical path**: 1) SFT baseline on target dataset (20k steps) 2) GRPO post-training (100 steps, G=8 rollouts) 3) Checkpoint selection based on reward variance and rollout quality
- **Design tradeoffs**: Full SFT vs LoRA (only full-size works), early vs late diffusion steps (first 60% only), memory vs batch size (GRPO: batch=1/GPU, SFT: batch=8/GPU)
- **Failure signatures**: High reward variance (normal), low reward variance (training collapse), visual noise accumulation (gradual quality degradation)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce SFT baseline on small navigation dataset 2) Add T+R rewards only (confirm 15-30% error reduction) 3) Full reward set on counterfactual actions (check >50% error reduction)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: What are the variance dynamics of reward-aligned world model training, and how can stable GRPO optimization be maintained when rollout variance is insufficient?
- **Basis**: Section 6 states understanding variance dynamics remains open
- **Why unresolved**: GRPO requires sufficient reward variance; uniform rollout quality causes training collapse
- **Evidence needed**: Theoretical/empirical characterization of minimum variance thresholds and adaptive mechanisms

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What principled multi-reward weighting schemes could optimize trade-offs between global alignment, local consistency, and visual fidelity?
- **Basis**: Section 6 notes lack of exploration of alternative/adaptive weighting strategies
- **Why unresolved**: Current fixed weights (α=β=0.5) show DTRI improves local coherence but degrades global alignment
- **Evidence needed**: Comparative experiments with learned/adaptive reward weighting demonstrating improved Pareto frontiers

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can pixel-level noise accumulation in GRPO post-training be prevented without relying solely on KL-regularization?
- **Basis**: Appendix C identifies gradual visual noise increase exceeding evaluator tolerance
- **Why unresolved**: KL-regularization provides partial mitigation but doesn't eliminate fundamental tension
- **Evidence needed**: Alternative regularization mechanisms or architectural modifications decoupling trajectory grounding from pixel quality

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: Can RLWG generalize beyond navigation to other embodied domains such as manipulation?
- **Basis**: Paper evaluates exclusively on navigation datasets; Related Work mentions manipulation but no experiments
- **Why unresolved**: Geometric rewards tailored to egocentric navigation; manipulation may require different verifiable constraints
- **Evidence needed**: Experiments applying GrndCtrl to manipulation benchmarks with appropriate reward reformulations

## Limitations
- Evaluator reliability assumption carries significant risk if MapAnything fails on out-of-distribution visual artifacts
- GRPO normalization mechanism sensitivity to reward variance not fully characterized; uniform rollout quality causes training collapse
- Long-horizon stability beyond 13-frame sequences and cross-dataset generalization remain unproven

## Confidence

- **High**: Translation/rotation error improvements in Seen regime (15-30% reduction), video quality maintenance under full reward set
- **Medium**: Counterfactual action performance (64% reduction claim), depth reprojection benefits in unseen scenarios, multi-objective reward complementarity
- **Low**: Long-horizon stability beyond 13-frame sequences, cross-dataset generalization when evaluator is trained on different visual domains

## Next Checks

1. **Evaluator robustness test**: Systematically degrade rollout visual quality and measure reward signal stability; verify MapAnything maintains geometric consistency
2. **Reward variance sensitivity**: Sweep group size G and noise schedule β(t) to identify optimal variance ranges; document training collapse thresholds
3. **Long-horizon extension**: Scale rollouts from 13 to 50+ frames and measure noise accumulation rate; compare KL regularization effectiveness against periodic pixel supervision baselines
