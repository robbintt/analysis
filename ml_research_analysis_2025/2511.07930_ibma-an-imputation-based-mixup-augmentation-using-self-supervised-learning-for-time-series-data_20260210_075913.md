# IBMA: An Imputation-Based Mixup Augmentation Using Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.07930
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07930
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Primary result**: IBMA consistently improves time series forecasting performance, achieving 22 out of 24 improvements and 10 best-case results across multiple datasets and models

## Executive Summary
IBMA (Imputation-based Mixup Augmentation) is a novel data augmentation technique for time series forecasting that combines self-supervised imputation with Mixup interpolation. The method first reconstructs masked sequences through imputation, then applies Mixup to blend these augmented samples, aiming to enhance model generalization and performance across diverse forecasting tasks. The approach leverages the strengths of both imputation (handling missing data effectively) and Mixup (creating interpolated samples between instances) to capture complex temporal patterns.

## Method Summary
IBMA works by first applying self-supervised imputation to reconstruct masked portions of time series data, creating augmented versions of the original sequences. These imputed sequences are then combined using Mixup interpolation, where linear combinations of pairs of samples (both input features and corresponding labels) are generated. This dual approach addresses the challenge of limited labeled time series data by creating synthetic yet realistic samples that maintain temporal coherence while expanding the training distribution. The method is designed to be model-agnostic and can be applied to various time series forecasting architectures.

## Key Results
- IBMA achieved improvements in 22 out of 24 experimental conditions across three models (DLinear, TimesNet, iTransformer) and six datasets
- The method demonstrated 10 best-case performance results, particularly excelling with the iTransformer model
- Consistent performance gains were observed across energy consumption datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2) and financial data (Illness, Exchange Rate)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
IBMA's effectiveness stems from its ability to generate diverse, realistic training samples that help models learn more robust temporal patterns. The imputation component creates plausible reconstructions of masked sequences, forcing the model to learn underlying data distributions and temporal dependencies. The Mixup component then interpolates between these augmented samples, creating a smoother decision boundary and improving generalization. This combination addresses both the scarcity of training data and the need for models to handle various temporal patterns and noise levels.

## Foundational Learning
- **Self-supervised learning**: Training models to learn useful representations from unlabeled data; needed for imputation to work without external labels, verified by successful reconstruction of masked sequences
- **Mixup interpolation**: Creating convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels; needed to generate synthetic samples that bridge between existing data points, verified by improved model generalization
- **Time series imputation**: Reconstructing missing or masked values in sequential data; needed to handle temporal dependencies and missing data scenarios, verified by maintaining temporal coherence in augmented samples
- **Data augmentation**: Artificially expanding training datasets through transformations; needed to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting, verified by consistent performance improvements across models
- **Temporal pattern recognition**: Identifying and learning recurring patterns in sequential data; needed to capture complex dependencies in time series, verified by improved forecasting accuracy
- **Model generalization**: A model's ability to perform well on unseen data; needed to ensure practical utility beyond training data, verified by consistent out-of-sample performance

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Raw Time Series -> Masking Module -> Imputation Engine -> Mixup Interpolator -> Augmented Dataset -> Forecasting Model
- **Critical path**: The core pipeline processes data through masking, imputation, and Mixup stages before feeding into the forecasting model, with each stage building on the previous to create increasingly refined augmented samples
- **Design tradeoffs**: The method balances between creating sufficiently diverse samples (through aggressive masking and interpolation) and maintaining temporal realism (through careful imputation), with hyperparameters controlling this balance
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance may manifest when imputation generates unrealistic sequences, when Mixup ratios are inappropriate for the data distribution, or when the augmented samples introduce artifacts that confuse the forecasting model
- **First experiments**: 1) Ablation study comparing performance with only imputation, only Mixup, and combined IBMA; 2) Sensitivity analysis of masking ratios and Mixup coefficients on different dataset characteristics; 3) Comparison of different imputation methods (mean, forward-fill, model-based) within the IBMA framework

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability across diverse time series domains remains unverified, as current results focus primarily on energy consumption and financial data
- Computational overhead and scalability implications are not thoroughly characterized, leaving uncertainty about practical deployment costs
- The method's sensitivity to different masking strategies and imputation approaches is not systematically studied

## Confidence
- **Effectiveness claim**: High - Substantial empirical evidence across multiple models and datasets supports this claim
- **Generalizability claim**: Medium - Consistent results across tested domains, but limited diversity reduces confidence
- **Technical novelty claim**: Medium - The integration method appears novel, though individual components are established

## Next Checks
1. Apply IBMA to time series datasets from diverse domains (medical, environmental, IoT sensor data) to assess generalizability beyond energy and financial data
2. Conduct a systematic ablation study removing either the imputation component or Mixup component separately to quantify individual contributions
3. Measure and compare wall-clock training and inference times with and without IBMA across different dataset sizes and model architectures
