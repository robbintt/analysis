# Zubov-Net: Adaptive Stability for Neural ODEs Reconciling Accuracy with Robustness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21879
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21879
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieves 91.29% clean accuracy on CIFAR-10 while significantly improving robustness against adversarial attacks compared to baselines

## Executive Summary
Zubov-Net addresses the fundamental trade-off between accuracy and adversarial robustness in Neural ODEs by leveraging Zubov's stability theory. The method reformulates Zubov's equation as a consistency loss between prescribed and true regions of attraction, enabling active control of the region geometry during training. By introducing an input-attention-based convex neural network for Lyapunov functions and employing tripartite losses (consistency, classification, and separation), Zubov-Net achieves both high clean accuracy and improved robustness against stochastic noises and adversarial attacks on SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.

## Method Summary
Zubov-Net implements a tripartite training framework where a ResNet-18 feature extractor feeds into a Neural ODE block (2-layer MLP with Tanh activation), whose terminal state is classified using a novel Input-Attention-based Convex Neural Network (IACNN) Lyapunov function. The training simultaneously minimizes three losses: consistency loss enforcing Zubov's equation (aligning prescribed and true regions of attraction), classification loss using W(h(T)) as output function, and separation loss pushing different class basins apart. A parallel boundary sampling algorithm identifies counterexamples on the edge of stability regions, while gradient projection generates additional training points to minimize the consistency loss. The method guarantees trajectory containment within certified basins when the consistency loss reaches zero.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91.29% clean accuracy on CIFAR-10
- Improves FGSM robustness from 50.12% to 56.83% on CIFAR-10 (ε=8/255)
- Shows significant robustness improvements against 8 stochastic noise types and 5 adversarial attacks
- Demonstrates effectiveness across SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Alignment of Prescribed and True Attraction Regions
The consistency loss derived from Zubov's equation forces the vector field to point inward on prescribed region boundaries. When minimized to zero, this guarantees equivalence between the theoretical certified region (PRoA) and the actual dynamical behavior (RoA), ensuring formal stability guarantees.

### Mechanism 2: Convex Separation via Input-Attention
The IACNN enforces convexity in the Lyapunov function architecture, creating well-behaved level sets that are easier to verify and harder for adversarial perturbations to cross. Combined with a separation loss that actively pushes class boundaries apart, this creates distinct, convex basins for each class.

### Mechanism 3: Certified Trajectory Containment
The combination of consistency loss and classification output function guarantees that the entire ODE trajectory remains within the certified attraction basin. If the terminal state is inside the PRoA and the vector field is consistent, the trajectory cannot have exited the PRoA at any previous time step.

## Foundational Learning

- **Lyapunov Stability Theory**: Provides the mathematical framework where a Lyapunov function acts as an "energy" measure; if energy always decreases, the system is stable. Quick check: Can you explain why a "region of attraction" is defined as a sub-level set of a Lyapunov function?
- **Zubov's Theorem**: Characterizes the entire domain of attraction using a specific PDE, going beyond standard Lyapunov methods that only guarantee local stability. Quick check: How does the consistency loss approximate the differential condition required by Zubov's theorem?
- **Neural ODEs**: Base architecture where hidden states evolve over time via a solver, making trajectory stability crucial. Quick check: In a Neural ODE, what does the vector field f(h, t) represent, and how does it differ from a standard ResNet block?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Image → ResNet-18 → ODE Solver (dopri5) → Terminal State → Classification Loss; Parallel Branch: Intermediate states → Gradient Projection → Consistency Loss
- **Critical path**: Input → ResNet → ODE Solver → Terminal State → Classification; Lyapunov function computed in parallel to evaluate stability
- **Design tradeoffs**: Convexity constraint may restrict decision boundary complexity; substantial computational overhead from boundary sampling and gradient projection
- **Failure signatures**: Loss divergence indicates dynamics too complex or Lyapunov network too small; numerical instability suggests solver tolerances need adjustment; over-regularization shows as accuracy drop with maintained robustness
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline benchmark on CIFAR-10 with FGSM to verify 6.17% improvement over FxTS-Net; 2) Ablation on consistency loss to observe robustness collapse against Gaussian noise; 3) t-SNE visualization to confirm disappearance of misaligned PRoA overlaps during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees depend on convergence to zero consistency loss, but non-zero values during training leave ambiguity about guarantee validity
- Convexity constraint may limit expressivity, potentially sacrificing classification accuracy for stability guarantees
- Substantial computational overhead from parallel boundary sampling and gradient projection increases training time significantly

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical soundness of Lyapunov theory for stability characterization
- **Medium Confidence**: Empirical robustness improvements are substantial and reproducible
- **Low Confidence**: Claim that IACNN's convexity "maintains training stability" lacks empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Ablation study comparing convex vs non-convex Lyapunov networks to quantify trade-off between stability guarantees and accuracy
2. Convergence analysis tracking consistency loss across all training epochs to determine if near-zero values are required for theoretical guarantees
3. Runtime profiling measuring training time per epoch with and without parallel boundary sampling to quantify computational overhead
