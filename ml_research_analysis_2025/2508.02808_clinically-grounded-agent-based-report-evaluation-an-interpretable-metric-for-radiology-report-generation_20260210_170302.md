# Clinically Grounded Agent-based Report Evaluation: An Interpretable Metric for Radiology Report Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.02808
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02808
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces ICARE, an interpretable, clinically-grounded agent-based evaluation framework for radiology report generation that aligns significantly better with expert judgment than prior metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ICARE, an interpretable and clinically-grounded agent-based evaluation framework for radiology report generation. The method uses two LLM agents, each assigned either a ground-truth or generated report, to generate and answer clinically meaningful multiple-choice questions. Agreement on answers provides interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall, with each score linked to specific question-answer pairs. Human studies with board-certified clinicians confirm that ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment than prior metrics and that its generated questions are clinically appropriate. Perturbation analyses show sensitivity to clinical content, while stability analyses demonstrate robustness. Model comparisons reveal interpretable error patterns such as omission and hallucination across clinical concepts. ICARE offers a transparent, scalable, and clinically meaningful alternative to existing evaluation methods for radiology report generation.

## Method Summary
ICARE uses a dual-agent LLM setup where each agent generates n multiple-choice questions from its assigned report (ground truth or generated), filters questions to retain only those requiring report-specific knowledge, then answers both question sets using only its assigned report. The method computes ICARE-GT (agreement on ground truth-derived questions, proxy for clinical precision) and ICARE-GEN (agreement on generated-report questions, proxy for clinical recall), with ICARE-AVG as their average. The filtering step ensures questions can only be answered correctly when the report is available, preventing generic medical knowledge from inflating scores. The framework uses LLAMA 3.1 70B and is evaluated on the IU X-ray dataset with three RRG model outputs.

## Key Results
- Human studies with board-certified clinicians show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment than prior metrics
- Perturbation analyses demonstrate ICARE's sensitivity to clinical content, with scores decreasing proportionally to random word deletion
- ICARE-GT scores consistently lower than ICARE-GEN scores, indicating models are more likely to omit relevant clinical findings than introduce unsupported content
- Model comparisons reveal interpretable error patterns, with clusters below diagonal indicating omission-dominated errors and clusters above diagonal reflecting hallucination-dominated errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Question-answering agreement serves as a robust proxy for semantic similarity by extracting specific clinical facts from reports. If a generated report yields the same answers as the ground truth, it implies clinical equivalence regardless of phrasing. This assumes LLMs generate questions that adequately cover the clinically relevant information space of the report.

### Mechanism 2
Separating question sources enables disentanglement of omission from hallucination errors. Questions from ground truth test if generated report missed existing info (omission), while questions from generated report test if it introduces unsupported info (hallucination). This assumes disagreements on generated-report questions indicate hallucination rather than GT failing to answer valid questions.

### Mechanism 3
Filtering questions answerable without report context ensures evaluation of specific patient data rather than general medical knowledge. The system retains only questions answered correctly with report but incorrectly without it, assuming the LLM's closed-book knowledge is distinct from its in-context reasoning capability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Clinical Precision vs. Recall (In this context):** Standard definitions differ - in ICARE, "Precision" (ICARE-GT) checks if generated report covers ground truth (omission check), while "Recall" (ICARE-GEN) checks if generated content is grounded in ground truth (hallucination check). *Quick check: If generated report misses a finding present in GT, which score drops: ICARE-GT or ICARE-GEN?*

- **Positional Bias in LLMs:** LLMs favor specific answer positions regardless of content. *Quick check: Why does architecture require shuffling answer choices both before and after filtering step?*

- **Agent-Based Evaluation:** The "Agent" is a functional role (Generator or Answerer) assigned to an LLM, allowing same model to simulate different perspectives. *Quick check: In ICARE architecture, does single agent handle both question generation and answering for specific report?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Agent GT -> MCQ Generator -> Filter Module -> Answerer Module -> Agreement Calculator; Agent GEN -> MCQ Generator -> Filter Module -> Answerer Module -> Agreement Calculator
- **Critical path:** The Filtering Step (Section 3.2) - without this, system generates high scores for generic reports containing valid medical platitudes but no specific patient data
- **Design tradeoffs:** Cost vs. Interpretability (4+ LLM calls per report pair makes it significantly slower/expensive than BERTScore); Metric Stability (generative agents introduce variance, though addressed by stability analysis)
- **Failure signatures:** High Generic Score (filter fails, reports get high scores for stating "Lungs are clear" even if patient has pneumonia); Cluster Drift (model updates shift semantic clusters in Figure 4, requiring recalibration of omission vs hallucination baselines)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Sanity Check - randomly delete 20% of words from GT report, verify ICARE scores decrease proportionally; 2) Filter Efficacy - manually review 50 filtered-out questions, confirm they are actually answerable without report; 3) Bias Audit - run metric on "reversed" dataset where "Generated" report is actually GT, check for asymmetry to identify if metric favors one direction of questioning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Generalization to other modalities:** How effectively does ICARE framework generalize to imaging modalities with higher complexity (e.g., CT, MRI) or non-radiology clinical text generation tasks? (Page 15 states this is important direction for future work, but current study validates exclusively on IU X-ray dataset for chest radiographs)

- **LLM dependency:** To what extent does choice of underlying LLM affect stability and clinical validity of generated questions and agreement scores? (Method relies on LLAMA 3.1 70B, but framework "can be applied with any sufficiently capable language model" without testing this variance)

- **Paraphrasing robustness:** Is metric robust to stylistic perturbations (paraphrasing) that preserve clinical meaning, distinguishing them from semantic errors? (Perturbation analyses focus on random word deletion, but paper claims metric captures meaning "regardless of phrasing" without testing valid paraphrasing)

## Limitations

- Framework relies on quality and coverage of LLM-generated questions, which may miss rare but clinically critical findings or introduce subtle biases in question selection
- Computational cost (4+ LLM calls per report pair) may restrict practical deployment for large-scale evaluation
- Filtering mechanism introduces complexity and potential failure points if LLM's closed-book knowledge overlaps significantly with specific cases

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Clinical precision/recall disentanglement mechanism and its validation through perturbation analysis
- **Medium confidence:** Clinical appropriateness of generated questions and alignment with human judgment (human study results)
- **Medium confidence:** Filtering mechanism's effectiveness in removing general knowledge questions, though requires careful prompt engineering

## Next Checks

1. **Edge case stress test:** Systematically evaluate ICARE on reports containing rare but clinically significant findings (e.g., specific types of pneumothorax, uncommon fractures) to verify question coverage
2. **Cross-LLM validation:** Repeat full evaluation pipeline using different LLM (e.g., GPT-4 or Claude) to assess robustness to model-specific biases in question generation and answering
3. **Cost-benefit analysis:** Benchmark ICARE's computational requirements against evaluation quality gains, measuring correlation between ICARE scores and downstream clinical outcomes (e.g., diagnostic accuracy in downstream tasks)
