# Goal-Driven Adaptive Sampling Strategies for Machine Learning Models Predicting Fields

## Quick Facts

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of adaptive sampling for machine learning models predicting aerodynamic fields, where both scalar quantities (like drag) and distributed fields (like pressure distribution) must be accurately predicted with minimal computational cost. The authors propose a goal-driven adaptive sampling strategy that combines a Gaussian process surrogate for scalar values with a composite acquisition function that includes both epistemic uncertainty and the misfit between scalar and field predictions. This approach is model-agnostic and works with various deep learning architectures for field prediction. The method is tested on the NASA Common Research Model wing, where it achieves significant improvements over baseline sampling strategies. The composite infill criterion consistently outperforms both pure Gaussian process error-based sampling and pure Monte Carlo sampling, with results showing better accuracy for both field predictions and integrated scalar quantities. The approach is also demonstrated for uncertainty propagation analysis, showing good agreement with experimental data for both surface pressure and skin friction coefficient predictions.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines Gaussian process (GP) surrogates for scalar outputs with deep learning models for distributed field predictions, using a composite acquisition function that balances epistemic uncertainty and prediction consistency between models. The approach begins with an initial design of experiments (DoE) of 30 Sobol samples, then sequentially selects 30 infill samples using three different criteria: surrogate error (SE), SE weighted by prediction misfit (SEwMisfit), and Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between predictive distributions. The field prediction model uses a graph neural network (GNN) with message-passing layers, while the scalar model uses a GP with squared-exponential kernel. MC dropout provides uncertainty estimates for the GNN predictions. The composite acquisition function weights both epistemic uncertainty and the difference between GP and GNN predictions to select informative samples that improve both scalar and field predictions simultaneously.

## Key Results
- Composite acquisition functions (SEwMisfit, JSD) consistently outperform pure Gaussian process error-based sampling and pure Monte Carlo sampling across all metrics
- The method achieves better accuracy for both field predictions and integrated scalar quantities compared to baseline strategies
- For uncertainty propagation analysis, the approach shows good agreement with experimental data for both surface pressure and skin friction coefficient predictions
- Adaptive sampling with composite criteria requires fewer CFD samples to achieve target accuracy thresholds (r² ≥ 0.99, normalized RMSE < 3% for scalars)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by creating a feedback loop between scalar and field predictions that guides sampling toward regions where both predictions are uncertain or inconsistent. The composite acquisition function captures epistemic uncertainty from the GP surrogate while also identifying where the scalar and field predictions disagree, ensuring that new samples address gaps in both models simultaneously. This goal-driven approach is more efficient than pure uncertainty-based sampling because it targets regions that improve overall prediction quality rather than just reducing uncertainty in one model.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Gaussian Process Regression**: Probabilistic model for scalar outputs that provides uncertainty estimates; needed for epistemic uncertainty quantification in acquisition function.
   - Why needed: Provides uncertainty estimates for scalar quantities and forms the epistemic uncertainty component of the acquisition function
   - Quick check: Verify GP achieves baseline r² > 0.99 and RMSE < 3% on validation set before adaptive sampling

2. **Graph Neural Networks for Field Prediction**: Deep learning architecture that operates on unstructured meshes to predict distributed field quantities like pressure and skin friction
   - Why needed: Handles the irregular structure of CFD meshes and predicts spatially distributed quantities
   - Quick check: Verify GNN training convergence and reasonable field predictions on initial DoE samples

3. **Active Learning with Composite Acquisition Functions**: Sequential sampling strategy that combines multiple criteria to select informative samples
   - Why needed: Balances exploration (uncertainty reduction) and exploitation (discrepancy reduction) for efficient sampling
   - Quick check: Visualize acquisition landscape at multiple iterations to verify exploration of full input domain

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Space -> Acquisition Function -> CFD Solver -> GP Surrogate (Scalars) -> GNN (Fields) -> Composite Metric

**Critical Path**: Sobol DoE -> GP & GNN Training -> Acquisition Optimization -> CFD Evaluation -> Model Retraining -> Metrics Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity of running multiple acquisition criteria against improved sampling efficiency. Composite acquisition functions require more computation per sample selection but achieve target accuracy with fewer total CFD samples.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- GNN MC-dropout variance erratic across iterations, causing unstable infill selection
- SE-only infill improves scalars but leaves field errors high
- Acquisition optimization trapped in local optima

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Implement and verify GP surrogate achieves baseline accuracy on initial DoE before adaptive sampling
2. Test acquisition function computation and optimization on a small test problem
3. Run single adaptive sampling iteration to verify CFD integration and model retraining pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Implementation details critical for exact reproduction are incomplete, particularly regarding GNN edge construction and acquisition optimization specifics
- Claims about computational efficiency gains are difficult to verify without wall-clock timing data for individual CFD samples
- The method's performance on problems beyond aerodynamic field prediction has not been demonstrated

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core methodology combining GP surrogates with field prediction models via composite acquisition functions is sound and well-documented
- **Medium confidence**: The quantitative claims regarding performance improvements are supported by results, but exact reproducibility depends on CFD implementation details not fully specified
- **Low confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency gains are difficult to verify without wall-clock timing data for individual CFD samples

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce scalar prediction accuracy: Verify GP surrogate achieves baseline r² > 0.99 and RMSE < 3% on the 20-sample validation set before adaptive sampling begins
2. Validate field prediction convergence: Track C_p and C_f field RMSE across adaptive iterations to confirm the 15-20 iteration window where SEwMisfit/JSD criteria outperform pure SE sampling
3. Confirm acquisition function behavior: Visualize the acquisition landscape at multiple iterations to verify differential evolution exploration covers the full input domain and is not trapped in local optima
