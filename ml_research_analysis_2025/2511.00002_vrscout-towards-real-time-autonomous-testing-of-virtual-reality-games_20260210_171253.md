# VRScout: Towards Real-Time, Autonomous Testing of Virtual Reality Games

## Quick Facts

## Executive Summary
VRScout introduces a deep learning-based autonomous agent for real-time testing of virtual reality games. The system learns from human demonstrations using an enhanced Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) that predicts multi-step action sequences, enabling coherent human-like behavior. A dynamically adjustable sliding horizon balances responsiveness and precision by adapting the agent's temporal context at runtime. Evaluated on three commercial VR games (Beat Saber, SuperHot, and Pistol Whip), VRScout achieved expert-level performance with limited training data while maintaining real-time inference at 60 FPS on consumer hardware.

## Method Summary
VRScout employs imitation learning from human demonstrations, using an ACT model to predict sequences of future actions rather than single steps. The system captures VR game states through synchronized images and controller data, encodes them using ResNet-18 and manual feature extraction, then processes temporal chunks through the ACT transformer. A CVAE-style latent embedding captures variability in demonstrations. The dynamic sliding horizon adjusts prediction context based on motion speed, while a virtual VR device driver injects predictions directly into unmodified commercial games through the OpenVR SDK.

## Key Results
- Achieved expert-level gameplay performance on Beat Saber, SuperHot, and Pistol Whip with only 4 hours of human demonstration data
- Maintained real-time inference at 60 FPS on NVIDIA 4090 hardware while operating in unmodified commercial VR environments
- Outperformed single-step prediction baselines significantly, with Beat Saber results showing 87% accuracy vs 65% and 73 max combo vs 11 without sliding window

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-step action prediction enables coherent, human-like behavior by capturing temporal dependencies
- Mechanism: ACT model predicts sequences of actions, learning longer-term strategies through temporal ensembling of multiple predictions
- Core assumption: Human VR gameplay exhibits consistent temporal patterns learnable from limited demonstrations
- Evidence anchors: ACT architecture allows higher-level strategy capture; single-step baseline drifted rapidly into unseen states
- Break condition: If games require rapid strategic pivots not present in training, chunked predictions may lag

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dynamic sliding horizon adapts responsiveness vs smoothness based on real-time task demands
- Mechanism: Adjusts prediction window length and exponential weighting based on motion speed, with higher speeds triggering shorter horizons
- Core assumption: Motion speed correlates with task urgency and serves as reliable proxy for optimal horizon length
- Evidence anchors: Beat Saber testing showed 73 max combo vs 11 without sliding window; motion speed proved most reliable adjustment factor
- Break condition: If motion speed doesn't correlate with decision complexity, adaptive signal may misconfigure horizon

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Virtual VR device driver enables direct interaction with unmodified commercial games
- Mechanism: Built on Valve OpenVR SDK, exposes virtual headset and controllers to SteamVR, injecting normalized predictions as device inputs
- Core assumption: Games don't implement anti-bot detection distinguishing virtual from physical device inputs
- Evidence anchors: Successfully operated in unmodified environments achieving expert performance; based on OpenVR SDK
- Break condition: If games detect virtual device signatures or require hardware authentication, injection pathway blocked

## Foundational Learning

- **Imitation Learning / Behavior Cloning**: VRScout learns from human demonstrations rather than reward shaping. Quick check: Can you explain why behavior cloning can fail when the agent encounters states outside the training distribution?

- **Temporal Ensembling**: System combines multiple action predictions over time using exponential weighting. Quick check: How does increasing decay parameter `m` in `w_i = exp(-m·i)` affect influence of older predictions?

- **CVAE (Conditional Variational Autoencoder)**: VRScout uses CVAE-style latent embedding to capture variability in human demonstrations. Quick check: What role does KL divergence term play in loss function, and what happens if weighted too heavily?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: VR images (30 Hz) -> ResNet-18 encoder; User actions -> feature vector -> CVAE Module -> ACT Transformer -> Temporal Ensemble -> Dynamic Horizon Controller -> Virtual Device Driver

- **Critical path**: Collect synchronized VR images + actions at 30 Hz -> Encode features -> Group into temporal chunks -> Decode to predict action sequence -> Apply temporal ensembling with dynamic horizon -> Inject via virtual device driver at 60 Hz

- **Design tradeoffs**: Longer prediction horizon provides smoother actions but higher latency; more training data improves generalization but increases collection time; episodic sampling yields ~8% higher scores but requires careful data organization

- **Failure signatures**: Single-step baseline drifts into unseen states producing incoherent gameplay; insufficient data (<2 hours) prevents correct action performance; non-adaptive horizon degrades combo stability on fast maps; poor-quality demonstrations inherit suboptimal strategies

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline validation with CNN-MLP single-step model to confirm chunking necessity; 2) Horizon ablation testing fixed vs dynamic windows across Beat Saber maps; 3) Data scaling experiments with 1h, 2h, 3.5h demonstrations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Cannot exceed human-level performance or discover novel strategies beyond training distribution
- Evaluation limited to rhythm and action games, unclear generalizability to puzzle, strategy, or open-world VR games
- Virtual device driver approach may be detectable by anti-bot systems, limiting real-world deployment

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core technical contributions (ACT architecture, dynamic sliding horizon, virtual device driver) are well-documented and reproducible; performance claims supported by experimental data
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalization across different VR games supported but limited to three titles in similar genres; "small amount of training data" is relative
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about real-world deployment readiness and compatibility with all commercial VR games not fully substantiated

## Next Checks

1. **Anti-detection robustness**: Test virtual device driver against updated game versions and other commercial VR titles to verify injection mechanism remains undetected

2. **Cross-genre generalization**: Evaluate VRScout on puzzle, strategy, and open-world VR games with different interaction patterns to validate approach generalization

3. **Robustness to suboptimal demonstrations**: Train on mixed-quality demonstrations and evaluate performance degradation to test system's ability to learn from non-optimal human data
