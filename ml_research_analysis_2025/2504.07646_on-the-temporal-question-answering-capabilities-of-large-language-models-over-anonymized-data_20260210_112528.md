# On the Temporal Question-Answering Capabilities of Large Language Models Over Anonymized Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.07646
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07646
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: The paper evaluates LLM performance on temporal question-answering tasks using anonymized datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how large language models perform on temporal question-answering tasks when presented with anonymized data. The study examines whether anonymization techniques affect the models' ability to reason about time-based queries. Through systematic evaluation, the authors analyze performance differences across multiple LLMs when processing temporal information in anonymized contexts, highlighting the trade-offs between privacy preservation and reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a black-box API-based evaluation methodology, testing multiple LLMs on temporal QA datasets with anonymized content. The study uses controlled comparisons between anonymized and non-anonymized versions of temporal questions, though specific details about the anonymization process and temporal entity handling remain unclear from the available information.

## Key Results
- LLM performance on temporal QA tasks shows measurable degradation when processing anonymized data
- Cross-LLM performance consistency varies across different temporal reasoning challenges
- The impact of anonymization on temporal reasoning capabilities remains partially unexplained

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that temporal reasoning in LLMs depends on contextual cues and entity recognition, which can be disrupted by anonymization. The mechanism by which anonymization affects temporal understanding appears to involve the loss of explicit temporal markers and contextual relationships that models use for reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- Temporal reasoning in LLMs: Essential for understanding time-based queries; quick check: can the model order events chronologically
- Anonymization techniques: Needed to preserve privacy while maintaining utility; quick check: are temporal entities preserved or obfuscated
- Context window utilization: Critical for maintaining temporal relationships; quick check: does the model maintain coherence across temporal references

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Question Input -> Temporal Entity Recognition -> Reasoning Module -> Answer Generation -> Output
Critical path: The reasoning module that connects temporal entities to produce answers
Design tradeoffs: Privacy preservation vs. reasoning accuracy
Failure signatures: Loss of temporal coherence, incorrect event ordering, inability to resolve temporal ambiguities
First experiments:
1. Test baseline temporal reasoning on non-anonymized data
2. Apply progressive anonymization levels to same dataset
3. Compare performance across different LLM architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the specific impact of different anonymization techniques on temporal reasoning, the generalizability of findings across domains, and the optimal balance between privacy preservation and reasoning capability.

## Limitations
- Black-box API evaluation limits understanding of internal model behavior
- Unclear specification of anonymization techniques for temporal entities
- Domain-specific focus may limit generalizability of findings

## Confidence
- Temporal reasoning degradation due to anonymization: Medium
- Cross-LLM performance consistency: Medium
- Anonymization method impact on temporal reasoning: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies testing different anonymization granularities (preserving vs. removing temporal markers) to isolate their impact on performance
2. Replicate the evaluation on a non-historical temporal QA dataset to assess domain generalizability
3. Implement controlled experiments comparing anonymized vs. non-anonymized versions of identical questions to measure direct performance impact
