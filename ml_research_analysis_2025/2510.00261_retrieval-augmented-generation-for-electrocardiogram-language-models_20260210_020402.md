# Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Electrocardiogram-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.00261
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00261
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** First open-source RAG pipeline for ECG analysis shows consistent performance gains over non-RAG baselines across multiple datasets and metrics

## Executive Summary
This work introduces the first open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs), designed to improve generative performance in ECG analysis tasks. The authors address the gap in ELM research by developing a comprehensive framework that integrates RAG to enhance contextual awareness and reduce hallucinations during natural language generation (NLG). The pipeline retrieves relevant ECG signals, features, and diagnostic reports using FAISS-based similarity search and incorporates them into prompts for conditioning the ELM. Experiments on three public datasets (ECG-Chat Instruct, ECG-QA MIMIC-IV-ECG, and PTB-XL) demonstrate consistent performance gains over non-RAG baselines, with improvements in BLEU-4 (e.g., 38.10% vs. 22.85%), ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore F1, and accuracy (e.g., 18.27% vs. 9.65%). Ablation studies reveal that using RAG during both training and inference yields the best results, while retrieval of fewer items (k=1) slightly outperforms larger k values. RAG placement (system prompt vs. user query) shows comparable outcomes, and accurate retrieval is critical for performance. The study provides actionable insights for ELM design and establishes a reproducible foundation for future multimodal RAG applications.

## Method Summary
The proposed RAG-ELM pipeline consists of three main components: ECG signal processing, retrieval, and generative modeling. The ECG signal processing stage extracts morphological and interval features from raw ECG signals using a Multimodal ECG Feature Extractor (MFE) module. The retrieval stage employs FAISS-based similarity search to find k most similar ECG records from a database containing ECG signals, extracted features, and corresponding diagnostic reports. The generative modeling stage uses a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where retrieved items are incorporated into prompts as contextual information to condition the ELM during training and inference. The system was evaluated on three public datasets: ECG-Chat Instruct, ECG-QA MIMIC-IV-ECG, and PTB-XL, with comparisons against non-RAG baselines and ablation studies to assess the impact of RAG configuration.

## Key Results
- RAG-enhanced ELMs achieved 38.10% BLEU-4 score versus 22.85% for non-RAG baselines on ECG-Chat Instruct
- Accuracy improved from 9.65% to 18.27% on ECG-QA MIMIC-IV-ECG with RAG implementation
- Ablation studies showed optimal performance when RAG was used during both training and inference phases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RAG-ELM pipeline works by addressing the fundamental challenge of limited context in ECG analysis tasks. By retrieving relevant historical ECG signals, extracted features, and diagnostic reports, the system provides the ELM with comprehensive contextual information that would otherwise be unavailable. This contextual enrichment enables the model to generate more accurate and clinically relevant natural language outputs by grounding its responses in actual patient data. The FAISS-based similarity search efficiently identifies the most relevant historical records based on ECG signal similarity, while the incorporation of retrieved items into prompts through fine-tuning allows the model to learn how to effectively utilize this additional information. The mechanism reduces hallucinations by forcing the model to reference actual data rather than generating responses purely from learned patterns, leading to more reliable and verifiable outputs in clinical ECG interpretation tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** ECG Signal -> MFE Feature Extraction -> FAISS Retrieval -> Prompt Conditioning -> Transformer ELM -> NLG Output

**Critical Path:** Raw ECG signal flows through MFE for feature extraction, which feeds into FAISS for similarity-based retrieval of historical records. Retrieved items are formatted into prompts that condition the transformer ELM during both training and inference, producing natural language diagnostic outputs.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system balances retrieval quality versus computational efficiency by using FAISS for fast similarity search, while the choice of k retrieved items involves a tradeoff between context richness and prompt complexity. The architecture also balances between incorporating retrieved context during training (for learning optimal utilization) versus inference-only (for flexibility but potentially less optimal performance).

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation occurs when retrieval accuracy is low, when retrieved items are irrelevant or noisy, when prompt formatting is suboptimal, or when the ELM fails to effectively integrate retrieved context. Common issues include retrieval of dissimilar ECG records, incorrect feature extraction, and model overfitting to training data without generalization.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Validate FAISS retrieval accuracy by testing with known similar/dissimilar ECG pairs
2. Test MFE feature extraction quality by comparing extracted features against ground truth measurements
3. Evaluate prompt conditioning effectiveness by testing with manually curated retrieved items versus random retrievals

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance improvements primarily benchmarked against non-RAG baselines rather than state-of-the-art multimodal approaches
- Limited qualitative assessment of clinical relevance and practical utility of generated outputs
- Reliance on public datasets may not capture the complexity and variability of real-world clinical ECG data

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core RAG implementation methodology, FAISS-based retrieval system, and demonstrated performance improvements over non-RAG baselines
- **Medium Confidence**: Specific architectural choices and their relative contributions to performance gains
- **Medium Confidence**: Clinical utility and practical applicability of the generated outputs

## Next Checks
1. Conduct head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art multimodal ECG analysis models that don't use RAG to establish relative performance benefits
2. Perform comprehensive qualitative evaluation with domain experts to assess clinical relevance, accuracy, and practical utility of RAG-enhanced outputs
3. Test the RAG pipeline on proprietary clinical datasets to evaluate performance in real-world settings with greater data variability and complexity
