- Low-cost inverted pendulum system for bridging sim-to-real gap in deep reinforcement learning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a low-cost inverted pendulum apparatus designed to study the challenges of transferring deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms from simulation to real-world environments. The system uses readily available components including a hobby servo, rotary encoder, ESP32 microcontroller, and 3D printed parts to create an accessible platform for both education and research. The work demonstrates that standard DRL algorithms struggle with real-world implementation due to noise and delays, while a dimension reduction technique using GRU preprocessing shows improved performance on the physical system.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a hybrid inverted pendulum system combining a hobby servo motor with a high-resolution rotary encoder for precise angle measurement. The hardware platform uses an ESP32 microcontroller for data acquisition and actuation, connected to a computer running DRL algorithms via a serial connection. A complementary high-fidelity MuJoCo simulation environment models the physical system's dynamics, including friction, gear backlash, and motor deadzones. The authors implement and test standard DRL algorithms (DQN and TD3) on both simulated and real environments, then propose a dimension reduction approach using GRU preprocessing (R-DQN, R-TD3) to improve real-world performance by learning compact state representations from noisy sensor data.

## Key Results
- Standard DRL algorithms (DQN, TD3) successfully solve the simulated environment but fail on the real-world system due to noise and delays
- The proposed GRU preprocessing approach (R-DQN, R-TD3) improves performance on the real system by learning compact state representations
- The low-cost apparatus (under $200) provides an accessible platform for studying sim-to-real transfer challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The GRU preprocessing technique works by learning to extract relevant features from high-dimensional, noisy sensor data before feeding it to the DRL algorithm. This addresses the sim-to-real gap by compensating for real-world imperfections that are difficult to model accurately in simulation. The hybrid servo-encoder design provides precise angle measurement while maintaining low cost, enabling detailed study of real-world delays and imperfections in sensing, communication, learning, and actuation.

## Foundational Learning
- Inverted pendulum dynamics: Understanding the unstable equilibrium and control requirements for swing-up and balancing tasks
- Sim-to-real transfer challenges: Recognizing how simulation inaccuracies, sensor noise, and actuation delays impact real-world performance
- Deep reinforcement learning algorithms: Familiarity with DQN and TD3 architectures and their limitations in real-world applications
- Recurrent neural networks: Understanding GRU layers for temporal sequence processing and dimension reduction
- Sensor fusion and noise filtering: Techniques for extracting reliable signals from noisy sensor data

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Sensors -> ESP32 -> Serial communication -> Computer -> DRL algorithm -> Control signal -> ESP32 -> Actuator
Critical path: Encoder reading → ESP32 processing → Serial transmission → DRL inference → Control command → Servo actuation
Design tradeoffs: Low cost vs. precision (hobby servo + encoder), computational power vs. real-time performance (ESP32), model complexity vs. sample efficiency
Failure signatures: High-frequency oscillations indicate sensor noise, sluggish response suggests communication delays, unstable behavior points to modeling errors
First experiments: 1) Characterize system response time and delays, 2) Test DRL algorithms in simulation, 3) Validate sensor noise characteristics and filtering requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize beyond the specific pendulum configuration and hybrid servo-encoder design
- Limited ablation studies to isolate critical components of the GRU preprocessing method
- Incomplete characterization of noise and delay distributions across operating conditions
- No discussion of total assembly and calibration time investment required for the system

## Confidence
High confidence in hardware design description and component specifications
Medium confidence in performance claims regarding standard DRL algorithms failing on real system
Medium confidence in GRU preprocessing effectiveness due to limited statistical validation

## Next Checks
1. Perform statistical analysis across at least 10 independent training runs for each algorithm to establish confidence intervals on performance metrics
2. Test the GRU preprocessing approach on alternative dimension reduction methods (PCA, autoencoders) to determine if the improvement is specific to GRUs or general to learned representations
3. Characterize the full noise and delay distributions through systematic measurement across different operating conditions to enable more accurate simulation models
