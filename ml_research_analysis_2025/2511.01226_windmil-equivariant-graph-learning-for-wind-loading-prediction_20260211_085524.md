# WindMiL: Equivariant Graph Learning for Wind Loading Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01226
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Reflection-equivariant GNN achieves RMSE ≤ 0.02 for mean pressure coefficients and >96% hit rate on reflected test sets

## Executive Summary
WindMiL addresses the challenge of efficiently predicting wind loads on low-rise buildings, which are critical for structural safety but traditionally expensive to compute using wind tunnel testing or large-eddy simulations (LES). The paper introduces a machine learning framework that combines systematic dataset generation with symmetry-aware graph neural networks. A large-scale dataset of 462 LES-simulated building geometries is created using signed distance function interpolation between three basis roof shapes, with each LES case requiring approximately 24 hours of computation. The WindMiL model employs a reflection-equivariant graph neural network that guarantees physically consistent predictions under mirrored geometries. Across interpolation and extrapolation evaluations, WindMiL achieves high accuracy for both mean and standard deviation of surface pressure coefficients (e.g., RMSE ≤ 0.02 for mean Cp) and maintains hit rates above 96% under reflected-test evaluation, while the non-equivariant baseline drops by more than 10%. This demonstrates that incorporating reflection symmetry into the model architecture improves both physical consistency and generalization to unseen symmetric configurations.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a reflection-equivariant graph neural network for predicting wind loading on low-rise buildings. The dataset consists of 462 building geometries generated through signed distance function (SDF) interpolation between three basis roof shapes (flat, gable, hip), with each geometry simulated via LES. The model uses a GraphSAGE backbone with residual connections and layer normalization, but incorporates a reflection-equivariance mechanism by averaging embeddings from original and reflected inputs. Specifically, for a reflection operator R that flips z-coordinates and normal vectors, the model computes embeddings as 0.5 · (f_θ(X) + f_θ(R(X))), where both passes share the same weights. The model predicts both mean and standard deviation of pressure coefficients on surface meshes, with input features including normalized coordinates and surface normals. Training is conducted on original geometries only, but evaluation includes both original and reflected test sets to verify physical consistency.

## Key Results
- WindMiL achieves RMSE ≤ 0.02 for mean pressure coefficient predictions on interpolation test sets
- The model maintains hit rates above 96% under reflected-test evaluation conditions
- Non-equivariant baseline shows >10% performance drop on reflected test sets compared to original test sets
- WindMiL successfully generalizes to extrapolation scenarios with similar accuracy to interpolation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The reflection-equivariant architecture guarantees that mirrored inputs produce mirrored outputs, which is physically necessary for wind loading predictions. By averaging embeddings from original and reflected geometries during training, the model learns representations that are inherently symmetric, eliminating the need for data augmentation and ensuring consistent predictions across symmetric building configurations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Signed Distance Functions (SDFs)**: Mathematical representations of shapes used to interpolate between building geometries; needed for systematic dataset generation
  - Quick check: Verify that interpolated shapes smoothly transition between basis geometries without artifacts
- **Reflection Equivariance**: Property where applying a symmetry transformation to inputs results in the same transformation of outputs; ensures physical consistency
  - Quick check: Test that predictions for reflected inputs match the reflection of predictions for original inputs
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Neural networks that operate on graph-structured data, processing node features through message passing
  - Quick check: Confirm that node feature updates respect the graph topology and preserve permutation invariance
- **LES Simulations**: Computational fluid dynamics method that resolves large turbulent eddies directly while modeling smaller scales
  - Quick check: Validate that pressure coefficient distributions are physically reasonable and comparable to wind tunnel data
- **Pressure Coefficient (Cp)**: Non-dimensional measure of surface pressure relative to dynamic pressure; key output variable
  - Quick check: Ensure predicted Cp values fall within physically plausible ranges (-3 to +3) for low-rise buildings
- **Hit Rate Metric**: Percentage of predictions within specified tolerance bands (±0.10 for mean Cp, ±0.05 for std Cp)
  - Quick check: Calculate hit rate separately for different pressure coefficient ranges to identify systematic biases

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: SDF Interpolation -> Surface Mesh Generation -> 6D Node Features -> Graph Construction -> Reflection-Equivariant GNN -> Pressure Coefficient Predictions

**Critical Path**: The equivariance mechanism is critical - the averaging of embeddings from original and reflected inputs must occur before the final predictor head and use shared weights throughout.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Using reflection averaging instead of data augmentation reduces training time and storage requirements but requires careful implementation to ensure shared weights and proper averaging location.

**Failure Signatures**: If the equivariant model doesn't outperform the baseline on reflected test sets, check that (1) reflection logic strictly enforces shared weights, (2) averaging happens before the final MLP head, and (3) input normalization is correctly applied.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify equivariance by testing that predictions for reflected inputs match within tolerance
2. Reconstruct the SDF interpolation pipeline to generate a comparable dataset from the three basis shapes
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing performance with and without the equivariant averaging mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Missing specific hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, network depth, optimizer) that affect reproducibility
- Unclear graph construction methodology (k-NN parameter or radius threshold)
- Dataset not yet publicly available, requiring either author contact or reconstruction

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core methodological contribution (reflection-equivariant GNN design and its superiority over non-equivariant baselines)
- **Medium confidence** in exact numerical performance due to missing hyperparameter details
- **Medium confidence** in dataset construction specifics pending availability of the published dataset

## Next Checks
1. Verify equivariance implementation by explicitly testing that predictions for reflected inputs match within tolerance
2. Reconstruct the SDF interpolation pipeline to generate a comparable dataset from the three basis shapes
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing performance with and without the equivariant averaging mechanism
