# Unveiling LLMs' Metaphorical Understanding: Exploring Conceptual Irrelevance, Context Leveraging and Syntactic Influence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04120
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04120
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs generate 15%-25% conceptually irrelevant interpretations and show limited context sensitivity in metaphor understanding

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates Large Language Models' capabilities in metaphor understanding through three experiments: spatial analysis, metaphorical imagination, and syntactic shuffle. The research reveals that LLMs rely heavily on static associations rather than dynamic contextual reasoning, with 15%-25% of interpretations being conceptually irrelevant and 65%-80% overlap between contextualized and de-contextualized predictions. The findings suggest LLMs are more sensitive to syntactic irregularities than to structural comprehension, highlighting limitations in their metaphor processing capabilities and calling for more robust computational approaches.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates multiple LLMs (DeepSeek-V3-671B, Qwen-Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1-671B, LLaMA-3.1-8B) using three experimental paradigms on Fig-QA and MUNCH datasets. Spatial analysis uses SVD to measure geometric deviation from conceptual planes in embedding space. Metaphorical imagination compares overlap ratios between contextualized and de-contextualized predictions. Syntactic shuffle tests detection accuracy under word order variations. All experiments use temperature=0 and text-embedding-3-small for consistency.

## Key Results
- LLMs generate 15%-25% conceptually irrelevant interpretations in spatial analysis
- 65%-80% overlap between contextualized and de-contextualized predictions indicates low context sensitivity
- Models show better performance on POS shuffle than original metaphors, suggesting reliance on syntactic irregularity detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** LLMs process metaphors via a static "Metaphor-Literal Repository" rather than dynamic contextual reasoning.
- **Mechanism:** When a "trigger word" appears, the model retrieves pre-learned literal associations directly from its weights, bypassing surrounding sentence context.
- **Core assumption:** High semantic overlap between contextualized and de-contextualized predictions implies context is being ignored.
- **Evidence anchors:** "depend on metaphorical indicators in training data rather than contextual cues" and "overlap ratio equals to 1 over 50% of cases."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Metaphor misinterpretation is caused by "Conceptual Irrelevance," measurable as geometric deviation in embedding space.
- **Mechanism:** The model projects the metaphor into high-dimensional space but lands off the correct "Conceptual Plane," resulting in literal or unrelated interpretations.
- **Core assumption:** Geometric proximity correlates with semantic conceptual alignment.
- **Evidence anchors:** "misinterpreting 'fall in love' as 'drop down from love'" and "concept-irrelevant information persists in 15%–25% of the output."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** LLMs detect metaphors primarily by identifying Syntactic Irregularity rather than parsing structural meaning.
- **Mechanism:** The model flags sentences where words violate expected usage roles as metaphorical, relying on "syntactic shocks" as a heuristic.
- **Core assumption:** Sensitivity to POS shuffling indicates reliance on syntax as detection heuristic.
- **Evidence anchors:** "LLMs perform better in POS shuffle than the original metaphors... resembles SPV scenarios."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper evaluates LLMs against CMT, which posits that metaphors are cross-domain mappings (Source → Target).
  - **Quick check question:** If an LLM interprets "The lawyer was a shark" as "The lawyer swam in the ocean," has it failed to align with the CMT target domain?

- **Concept:** Selection Preference Violation (SPV)
  - **Why needed here:** The "Syntactic Shuffle" experiment relies on SPV—the idea that metaphors often break grammatical norms.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the phrase "The stone died" constitute a Selection Preference Violation?

- **Concept:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in Semantics
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses SVD to derive the "Conceptual Plane" from embedding matrices.
  - **Quick check question:** In spatial analysis, does a high perpendicular distance (dp) indicate successful or failed metaphor interpretation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → Trigger Detector → Repository → Output (dominant path); Input → Context Processor → Output (weak path)
- **Critical path:** The paper suggests the dominant path is Input → Trigger Detector → Repository → Output
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Speed vs. Depth: Relying on the "Repository" allows fast generation but results in 15-25% conceptually irrelevant errors
  - Syntax vs. Semantics: Designing for SPV detection makes the model sensitive to grammatical errors but blind to meaning
- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Overlap Ratio: Generating same interpretation with and without context
  - Geometric Drift: High dp scores in spatial analysis
  - Trigger Word False Positives: Identifying metaphors solely due to trigger words
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Spatial Validation:** Run metaphor through model, embed output, calculate perpendicular distance to human-annotated Conceptual Plane
  2. **Context Ablation:** Generate literal substitutions with/without context, calculate overlap ratio
  3. **Syntactic Stress Test:** Shuffle word order of known metaphor, measure detection accuracy changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does few-shot prompting or fine-tuning effectively mitigate concept-irrelevant errors and improve context leveraging?
- **Basis in paper:** "Since our experiments are implemented on LLMs without fine-tuning or few-shot prompting, future work could explore the growth of learning ability under these scenarios."
- **Why unresolved:** Current study evaluates native, zero-shot capabilities to establish baseline
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative benchmarks showing accuracy and overlap ratios for fine-tuned models versus zero-shot baselines

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How do identified limitations in conceptual mapping and syntactic sensitivity transfer to non-English languages?
- **Basis in paper:** "Cross-linguistic challenges in metaphor comprehension are closely connected with translation tasks, yet the capacity of LLMs to understand metaphors across multiple languages remains unexplored."
- **Why unresolved:** Experiments conducted solely on English datasets
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Replicating experiments on multilingual metaphor corpus

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What constitutes the optimal dimensionality reduction method for spatial analysis?
- **Basis in paper:** "An appropriate dimensionality reduction method could yield more explicit results... but the effectiveness of the ideal approach is hard to define."
- **Why unresolved:** Study relies on SVD but uncertainty about method distortion
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative analysis of various embedding techniques and reduction methods

## Limitations

- Geometric distance in embedding space may not directly correlate with semantic conceptual alignment for metaphor comprehension
- Low context sensitivity could reflect model efficiency in leveraging global training knowledge rather than poor understanding
- Binary detection approach in syntactic shuffle fails to capture nuanced understanding of metaphor intensity or gradience

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** LLMs demonstrate limited context sensitivity (65%-80% overlap), well-supported by quantitative overlap metrics
- **Medium Confidence:** LLMs generate 15%-25% conceptually irrelevant interpretations, though geometric correlation assumption requires validation
- **Low Confidence:** LLMs are more sensitive to syntactic irregularities than structural comprehension, as detection heuristics could explain results

## Next Checks

1. **Human Correlation Study:** Conduct human evaluation where annotators rate LLM interpretations using same dp and cosθ metrics to validate geometric distance correlation with human judgment

2. **Controlled Context Manipulation:** Design experiments with systematically varied context (helpful vs. misleading) to isolate whether models truly ignore context versus leveraging global knowledge

3. **Cross-Lingual Metaphor Transfer:** Test same metaphor processing pipeline on multilingual datasets to distinguish between fundamental model limitations and English-specific artifacts
