core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of protecting privacy in knowledge

# Chase Anonymisation: Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Graphs with Logical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.12418
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12418
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Novel (k,x)-chase anonymization framework protects KGs against reasoning-based attacks while preserving utility

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in knowledge graph (KG) privacy protection by developing a framework that safeguards against attackers who leverage logical reasoning capabilities. Traditional k-anonymity methods fail in KGs because attackers can distinguish between isomorphic subgraphs using derived knowledge from reasoning rules. The authors introduce chase-anonymity, which ensures subgraphs remain indistinguishable even when reasoning-derived facts are considered. The approach introduces two algorithms (KLONE and KGUARD) that add synthetic nodes and edges to achieve privacy guarantees while maintaining semantic utility for business applications.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a (k,x)-chase anonymization framework that extends traditional k-anonymity to account for reasoning-derived knowledge in KGs. The key insight is using chase-equivalence, where subgraphs are considered indistinguishable if they remain so even after applying reasoning rules. The framework introduces two algorithms: KLONE, which uses a greedy approach to add synthetic nodes, and KGUARD, which optimizes for minimal additions while maintaining utility. Both algorithms preserve semantic utility through a Jaccard-based similarity metric that measures query result overlap between original and anonymized graphs. The approach specifically targets neighborhood attacks with reasoning (NAR), where attackers use both structural information and reasoning capabilities to re-identify individuals.

## Key Results
- KGUARD outperforms KLONE by adding significantly fewer nodes (e.g., 0.25% vs 200% for 10,000-node graphs)
- Achieves 100% anonymization rate against NAR attacks compared to 60-90% for traditional k-anonymity
- Maintains utility metrics close to 1.0 across synthetic and real-world datasets including company ownership data
- Successfully protects privacy while preserving reachability query capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by ensuring that each induced subgraph of size x has k chase-isomorphic subgraphs, making them indistinguishable even when reasoning rules are applied. Unlike traditional structural anonymization that only considers the graph topology, chase-anonymity accounts for all facts that can be derived through logical reasoning. The algorithms strategically add synthetic nodes and edges to create these indistinguishable subgraphs while optimizing for minimal additions and utility preservation through Jaccard similarity optimization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Chase-equivalence**: A relationship between subgraphs that remains indistinguishable even after applying reasoning rules - needed because traditional isomorphism fails when reasoning-derived facts exist; quick check: verify two subgraphs remain indistinguishable under all applicable rules
- **Neighborhood attack with reasoning (NAR)**: Attack scenario where adversaries use both structural information and reasoning capabilities to re-identify individuals - needed because attackers can leverage business logic and domain knowledge; quick check: simulate attacker using both graph structure and known rules
- **Jaccard similarity for utility**: Metric measuring overlap between query results on original and anonymized graphs - needed to quantify semantic preservation during anonymization; quick check: compare result sets for representative queries before/after anonymization
- **Induced subgraph isomorphism**: Structural similarity between subgraphs without considering derived facts - needed as baseline comparison for chase-anonymity; quick check: verify traditional k-anonymity fails on test cases with reasoning
- **Reasoning rules in KGs**: Logical implications that derive new facts from existing ones - needed because real-world KGs contain business logic and domain constraints; quick check: identify all rules that can fire in test graphs

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: KG data -> Anonymization Engine (KLONE/KGUARD) -> Synthetic node generator -> Utility optimizer -> Output anonymized KG

**Critical Path**: Input KG → Subgraph extraction → Chase-equivalence checking → Synthetic node addition → Utility evaluation → Final anonymized output

**Design Tradeoffs**: KLONE prioritizes completeness with greedy additions vs KGUARD prioritizes efficiency with optimized additions; utility preservation vs privacy strength tradeoff; synthetic node overhead vs computational complexity

**Failure Signatures**: Utility degradation when Jaccard similarity drops below threshold; incomplete anonymization when chase-equivalence not achieved; performance degradation on large graphs due to subgraph enumeration complexity

**First Experiments**:
1. Test on synthetic Erdos-Renyi graphs with known reasoning rules to validate chase-anonymity guarantees
2. Compare KLONE vs KGUARD on scale-free graphs to measure node addition overhead differences
3. Evaluate utility preservation on company ownership dataset with real-world business rules

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees rely on chase-equivalence which may not capture all real-world reasoning capabilities
- Experimental evaluation focuses on relatively small synthetic graphs, raising scalability questions
- Utility preservation claims depend on Jaccard metrics that may not fully capture all semantic dimensions
- Limited evaluation of diverse query types beyond reachability queries

## Confidence
- **High**: The core contribution of extending k-anonymity to handle reasoning-derived knowledge through chase-equivalence is technically sound and addresses a genuine gap in KG privacy protection
- **Medium**: The practical effectiveness of KGUARD over KLONE in real-world scenarios needs further validation, though experimental results are promising
- **Low**: The claim that the approach maintains "semantic utility" through Jaccard similarity requires more rigorous validation across diverse business use cases

## Next Checks
1. Test scalability on larger KGs (millions of nodes) to evaluate KGUARD's claimed complexity advantage
2. Evaluate utility preservation across diverse query types beyond reachability, including aggregation and pattern-matching queries
3. Assess robustness against adaptive attackers who can modify their reasoning strategies based on observed anonymization patterns
