# Simplex-Optimized Hybrid Ensemble for Large Language Model Text Detection Under Generative Distribution Drif

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22153
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22153
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: 94.2% accuracy and 0.978 AUC on 30,000-document corpus with generative distribution drift

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of distinguishing human-written text from machine-generated text when facing generative distribution drift—where detector performance degrades against newer language models or paraphrased content. The authors propose a hybrid ensemble combining three complementary detectors: a RoBERTa-based classifier for semantic detection, a curvature-based detector using likelihood perturbations, and a stylometric classifier based on linguistic features. These components are fused using simplex-constrained weights selected via grid search on a validation set. The ensemble achieves 94.2% accuracy and 0.978 AUC, outperforming individual detectors and reducing false positives on scientific articles crucial for educational applications.

## Method Summary
The method implements a three-branch ensemble: (1) RoBERTa-base fine-tuned for semantic detection with binary cross-entropy loss, (2) a curvature-inspired detector using GPT-2 Medium reference model with 20 perturbations per document and Platt scaling, and (3) a stylometric model extracting five hand-crafted features (TTR, burstiness, perplexity, stopword KL divergence, syntactic depth) classified by a random forest. These components are fused on the probability simplex with weights optimized via grid search on a validation set. The GenDrift-30K dataset includes 30,000 documents across training (10K), validation (5K), and test (10K) splits, with human text from Reuters, Wikipedia, and arXiv, and machine text from various generators including GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2, GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, and paraphrased variants.

## Key Results
- Ensemble achieves 94.2% accuracy and 0.978 AUC on the test set
- Outperforms individual detectors by 2.1-4.3% in accuracy
- Reduces false positive rate on scientific articles from 8.9% to 5.8%
- Maintains >93.5% accuracy under ±0.15 weight perturbations
- Curvature component contributes ~3% AUC gain and paraphrase robustness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier captures semantic and contextual patterns that differ between human and machine text when training and test generators are aligned.
- Mechan: Binary classification head on [CLS] token from RoBERTa-base encoder; fine-tuned with cross-entropy loss on labeled human/machine corpora.
- Core assumption: The training generator distribution is representative enough of test conditions; semantic cues remain detectable across domains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a RoBERTa-based classifier fine-tuned for supervised detection"
  - [section IV-B] "p1(x) = σ(w^T_cls Dropout(h[CLS]) + b_cls)... fine-tuned with binary cross-entropy loss"
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers confirm transformer-based detectors (DeBERTa, RoBERTa) are standard baselines but suffer domain transfer issues.
- Break condition: When evaluated on text from unseen model families or heavily paraphrased outputs, performance degrades (Table III shows RoBERTa drops to 73.1% on paraphrased attacks).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A curvature-based score leveraging perturbations and log-likelihood differences can identify machine-generated text without task-specific retraining.
- Mechan: Given input x, generate k perturbed variants via masking; compute S(x) = [q(x) - mean(q(x̃))] / Var(q(x̃)) using reference model q; calibrate to probability via Platt scaling.
- Core assumption: Machine-generated text lies near local likelihood optima of the reference model, so original text scores higher than perturbations; the reference model (GPT-2 Medium) remains informative for newer generators.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a curvature-inspired score based on perturbing the input and measuring changes in model likelihood"
  - [section IV-C] "If x lies near a local optimum of the reference model's likelihood surface, then q(x) will tend to be higher than the scores of its perturbations"
  - [corpus] Limited direct replication in neighbors; related work cites DetectGPT as theoretical basis.
- Break condition: Assumption: If future generators diverge substantially from GPT-2 reference, or if access to log-probabilities is restricted, this component becomes less informative (acknowledged in Section VII-D).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A lightweight stylometric model using hand-crafted linguistic features provides complementary signals, particularly reducing false positives on structured human writing.
- Mechan: Extract 5 features (TTR, burstiness, n-gram perplexity, stopword KL divergence, syntactic depth); classify with 200-tree random forest.
- Core assumption: Surface-level stylistic patterns differ between human and machine text in ways that persist across generators and are not captured by neural encoders.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a compact stylometric model built on hand-crafted linguistic features"
  - [section IV-D] "While this model is weaker than RoBERTa on in-distribution data, it behaves differently on scientific text and paraphrased outputs"
  - [section VI-C] "Removing M3 produces the largest increase in false positives on academic text"
  - [corpus] Related work on stylometric detection confirms feature-based methods remain relevant as complements.
- Break condition: For short texts or domains where surface characteristics overlap heavily, stylometric signals may be weak.

### Mechanism 4
- Claim: Simplex-constrained fusion with grid-searched weights reduces variance and bounds worst-case risk across generator mixtures.
- Mechan: Combine p1, p2, p3 via weighted sum with w ∈ Δ₃; select w* by maximizing F1 on validation set via coarse grid search (step 0.05).
- Core assumption: Component errors are not perfectly correlated; convex combinations can achieve lower variance than any single component (Proposition 1).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "outputs... are fused on the probability simplex, and the weights are chosen via validation-based search"
  - [section III-C] "If component detectors are not perfectly correlated... there exist weights such that Var(f̄) is strictly smaller"
  - [section VI-F] "Accuracy remains above 93.5%... with ±0.15 weight perturbations"
  - [corpus] Ensemble approaches (weighted averaging, gating networks) appear in several neighbor papers as robustness strategies.
- Break condition: If components become highly correlated on a new generator distribution, variance reduction benefits diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Probability simplex and convex combinations**
  - Why needed here: Fusion weights are constrained to sum to 1 with all non-negative; understanding that this bounds outputs to valid probability ranges and guarantees variance reduction under weak correlation.
  - Quick check question: If w = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2] and components output [0.9, 0.4, 0.6], what is the ensemble prediction? (Answer: 0.5×0.9 + 0.3×0.4 + 0.2×0.6 = 0.69)

- Concept: **Perturbation-based detection and likelihood curvature**
  - Why needed here: The curvature detector relies on the intuition that generated text is locally optimal under the generator's likelihood surface.
  - Quick check question: Why would perturbing machine-generated text typically lower its log-likelihood more than perturbing human text? (Answer: Machine text is sampled from regions the model deems high-probability; perturbations move away from this local optimum.)

- Concept: **Stylometric features for authorship analysis**
  - Why needed here: The M3 branch uses classic forensic linguistics features; understanding what each captures helps interpret failure modes.
  - Quick check question: Why might Type Token Ratio (TTR) differ between human and machine text? (Answer: Humans may show more vocabulary variation or repetition patterns that differ from LLM decoding distributions.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **M1 (Semantic)**: Raw text → RoBERTa-base tokenizer (512 max) → encoder → [CLS] head → probability p₁
  - **M2 (Curvature)**: Raw text → T5 masking (k=20 perturbations) → GPT-2 Medium scoring → normalized difference → Platt calibration → probability p₂
  - **M3 (Stylometric)**: Raw text → feature extractor (5 dims) → Random Forest (200 trees) → probability p₃
  - **Fusion**: [p₁, p₂, p₃] → weighted sum (w* ≈ [0.55, 0.30, 0.15]) → ensemble probability ŷ

- Critical path:
  1. Text preprocessing and normalization (shared)
  2. Parallel inference across M1, M2, M3 (M2 is latency bottleneck due to k perturbations)
  3. Probability calibration (Platt scaling for M2; RF outputs probabilities natively)
  4. Simplex fusion with pre-computed weights
  5. Threshold at 0.5 for binary decision (adjustable for FPR control)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Latency vs. robustness**: M2 requires 20 perturbation scorings per document; ablation shows it contributes ~3% AUC gain and paraphrase robustness.
  - **Static vs. adaptive weights**: Grid-searched weights are fixed at deployment; dynamic weighting (conditioned on text length/domain) is noted as future work.
  - **Calibration vs. accuracy**: Ensemble improves calibration over RoBERTa alone (Figure 2b), trading slight peak accuracy for reliable probability estimates.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Short texts (<150 words)**: Curvature estimates become noisy; RoBERTa has limited context. Stylometric features may still provide signal.
  - **Heavily edited AI text**: Surface features may converge to human-like patterns; curvature signal persists longer.
  - **Scientific/technical writing**: RoBERTa over-flags formulaic prose; M3 provides corrective signal (Table IV shows FPR drops from 8.9% to 5.8%).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Component isolation**: Run each detector (M1, M2, M3) independently on a held-out mixture of generators; confirm performance ordering matches paper (M1 > M2 > M3 on in-distribution).
  2. **Ablation under drift**: Remove one component at a time and evaluate on out-of-distribution generators (GPT-4, Claude); verify M2 and M3 contribute larger relative gains under drift.
  3. **Weight sensitivity analysis**: Perturb w* by ±0.10 across each dimension; confirm performance remains within ~0.7% of optimal (sanity check for deployment robustness).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can input-conditional weighting schemes outperform the static simplex fusion used in the current ensemble?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section VIII that a "more flexible design could condition weights on observable properties of the text" rather than using static weights.
  - Why unresolved: The current grid search identifies a single fixed weight vector for all inputs, potentially ignoring variations in reliability across different text lengths or domains.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating a dynamic meta-learner against the static grid search on the GenDrift-30K dataset.

- How does the ensemble perform on texts generated through iterative human-AI collaboration or extensive human editing?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VII.D notes the dataset does not exhaust adversarial strategies and that "human AI collaborative writing... may introduce new challenges."
  - Why unresolved: The current dataset relies on binary human/machine labels, failing to represent the spectrum of mixed authorship common in real-world workflows.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the detector on a dataset specifically constructed to contain co-authored and iteratively edited texts.

- Can the perturbation-based curvature component be distilled or approximated to reduce latency without sacrificing robustness?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "computation cost" as a limitation and list "reducing computation through model distillation" as a direction for future work.
  - Why unresolved: The curvature detector requires generating $k=20$ perturbations per document, creating a bottleneck for real-time applications.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the accuracy/latency trade-off of a distilled perturbation module versus the full T5-based perturbation method.

## Limitations

- Performance depends critically on the validation set being representative of the true drift space; future generators may diverge substantially from both training and validation distributions
- The curvature component requires access to a reference model's log-probabilities (GPT-2 Medium), which may be restricted in commercial deployment scenarios
- Stylometric features are handcrafted and may not generalize to all domain types or adversarial scenarios where machine text is deliberately edited to mimic human patterns

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The ensemble architecture and experimental results. The three-component design is clearly specified, the GenDrift-30K dataset construction is detailed, and the reported performance metrics (94.2% accuracy, 0.978 AUC) are internally consistent with the methodology described. The ablation studies showing component contributions are reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: The variance reduction claims under simplex fusion. While Proposition 1 provides theoretical justification, the empirical demonstration relies on limited weight perturbations (±0.15) and assumes component independence. Real-world deployment may face correlated errors across components that aren't captured in the validation setup.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability to unseen generator families. The paper demonstrates robustness across three test generators (GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, PEGASUS-paraphrased) but doesn't test against more diverse model architectures or extreme paraphrasing techniques. The claim that this approach "addresses generative distribution drift" is based on a relatively narrow definition of drift.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Generator Robustness Test**: Evaluate the ensemble on a broader set of generators including code-specific models (CodeLlama, StarCoder), multilingual models (BLOOM, mT5), and smaller variants of the same architecture (LLaMA-2 7B vs 13B vs 70B). Measure accuracy degradation and identify which component fails first under each type of distribution shift.

2. **Dynamic Weight Adaptation**: Replace the static simplex weights with a lightweight gating network that conditions weight selection on text length, domain indicators, or component confidence scores. Compare performance against the grid-searched weights on the test set, particularly focusing on the scientific text subset where stylometric correction is most valuable.

3. **Adversarial Robustness Evaluation**: Generate machine text that has been paraphrased or edited using human-in-the-loop refinement to maximize similarity to human writing patterns. Test whether the curvature component maintains its advantage over purely semantic detection, and measure the ensemble's false negative rate when faced with deliberately human-like machine text.
