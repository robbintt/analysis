# CEAID: Benchmark of Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detection Methods for Central European Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26051
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26051
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Finetuned detectors significantly outperform statistical and pretrained models for MGT detection across seven Central European languages

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in machine-generated text detection research by focusing on seven Central European languages (Croatian, Czech, German, Hungarian, Polish, Slovak, Slovenian) rather than English-centric approaches. The authors construct a comprehensive multilingual, multi-domain dataset combining news and social-media domains from multiple generators. They evaluate three detector categories—statistical (zero-shot), pretrained, and finetuned—across various training language combinations to identify optimal detection strategies.

The study reveals that finetuned detectors consistently outperform other approaches, with German and Polish emerging as critical training languages for cross-lingual transfer. Statistical detectors show severe vulnerability to homoglyph-based obfuscation attacks, while finetuned models demonstrate greater robustness. The research also highlights that detecting shorter social-media texts is more challenging than news articles, and cross-lingual transfer to Slovenian requires specific language combinations including Polish or Czech.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a multilingual, multi-domain dataset by combining news articles and social-media posts generated by various language models (GPT-2, GPT-3, Llama-2) across seven Central European languages. They evaluate three categories of detectors: statistical methods (zero-shot), pretrained models, and finetuned detectors, testing different training language combinations. The evaluation framework systematically compares detection performance across domains, obfuscation attacks (particularly homoglyphs), and cross-lingual transfer scenarios.

## Key Results
- Finetuned detectors significantly outperform both statistical and pretrained models across all tested languages
- German and Polish are especially important to include during training for optimal cross-lingual generalization
- Statistical detectors are highly vulnerable to homoglyph-based obfuscation (up to 95% performance drop)
- Detection is more challenging for shorter social-media texts compared to news articles
- Cross-lingual transfer to Slovenian is particularly difficult, requiring Polish or Czech in training mix

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Finetuned detectors work better because they adapt to the specific linguistic patterns and stylistic features of each language through supervised training on labeled examples. The multilingual training leverages shared linguistic features across Central European languages while maintaining language-specific detection capabilities. Statistical methods fail because they rely on fixed statistical patterns that can be easily disrupted by obfuscation techniques and don't adapt to language-specific characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Zero-shot detection**: Methods that don't require training on specific data but rely on pre-defined statistical measures or linguistic rules. Needed because it provides baseline performance and enables quick deployment without labeled data. Quick check: Compare detection accuracy on clean vs. obfuscated text.

2. **Multilingual transfer learning**: Training models on multiple languages to improve performance on unseen languages. Needed because Central European languages share certain features but have distinct characteristics. Quick check: Test detection performance when training with different language combinations.

3. **Adversarial robustness**: Ability of detectors to maintain performance against obfuscation attacks. Needed because MGT detectors must work in real-world scenarios where text may be deliberately modified. Quick check: Evaluate performance drop under various obfuscation techniques.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Dataset Construction -> Detector Training -> Evaluation Framework -> Performance Analysis

**Critical path**: Clean data generation → Detector training (statistical/pretrained/finetuned) → Cross-lingual evaluation → Adversarial testing → Performance comparison

**Design tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes comprehensive evaluation across multiple languages and domains over exploring newer language models or more sophisticated obfuscation techniques. This provides robust comparative results but may miss emerging threats.

**Failure signatures**: Statistical detectors fail catastrophically under homoglyph attacks (>95% performance drop). Pretrained models show moderate degradation. Finetuned detectors maintain higher performance but still show some vulnerability to advanced obfuscation.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Compare baseline statistical detector performance on clean vs. homoglyph-obfuscated text
2. Evaluate finetuned detector performance with different training language combinations
3. Test cross-lingual transfer performance to Slovenian from various training language sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on specific generative models (GPT-2, GPT-3, Llama-2) without exploring newer models like GPT-4 or Claude
- Dataset size, while carefully constructed, may limit generalization to rare linguistic phenomena or domain-specific contexts
- Does not investigate adversarial training approaches or more sophisticated obfuscation techniques beyond homoglyph substitution

## Confidence

| Major Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------------|------------------|
| Finetuned detectors' superior performance | High |
| Importance of German and Polish for cross-lingual transfer | Medium-High |
| Homoglyph attack vulnerability | High |
| Difficulty of detecting shorter social-media texts | Medium-High |

## Next Checks
1. Test detector robustness against additional obfuscation techniques including paraphrasing, back-translation, and grammatical modifications
2. Evaluate detector performance on texts generated by newer language models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) and compare with GPT-2/3 results
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine minimal language combinations that maintain acceptable detection performance across all seven Central European languages
