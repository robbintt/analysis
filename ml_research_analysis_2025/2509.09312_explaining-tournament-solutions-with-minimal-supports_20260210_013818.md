# Explaining Tournament Solutions with Minimal Supports

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.09312
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09312
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Introduces minimal supports (MSs) as compact, certified explanations for why a candidate wins under various tournament solutions.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces minimal supports (MSs) as compact, certified explanations for why a candidate wins under various tournament solutions. An MS is a minimal sub-tournament where the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how the rest is completed. The authors characterize MS structures and sizes for common rules (top cycle, uncovered set, Copeland, Borda, maximin, and weighted uncovered set), providing polynomial-time algorithms to compute smallest MSs (SMSs) for five of the six solutions, with the weighted uncovered set being NP-complete. SMSs enable rigorous, intuitive explanations by highlighting the essential pairwise comparisons that ensure the candidate's victory, making tournament outcomes more transparent and accessible to users.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a framework for computing minimal supports (MSs) - smallest sub-tournaments that guarantee a candidate's victory. For path-based solutions like Top Cycle and Uncovered Set, MSs are characterized as rooted out-trees of depth at most 2, computed via BFS/Dijkstra algorithms in O(m²) time. For score-based rules (Borda, Copeland, Maximin), MSs are computed using greedy algorithms that maintain score margins ensuring the winner's victory. The Weighted Uncovered Set is shown to be NP-complete, with SMS size bounded between n+m-2 and (n+1)(m-1). The framework provides both theoretical characterization and practical algorithms for generating certified explanations of tournament outcomes.

## Key Results
- Characterizes MS structures as rooted out-trees (depth ≤2) for path-based rules (Top Cycle, Uncovered Set)
- Provides polynomial-time algorithms (O(m²)) for five of six tournament solutions
- Shows Weighted Uncovered Set SMS computation is NP-complete via reduction from Set Cover
- Establishes tight bounds on SMS sizes: m-1 for path-based rules, n+m-2 to (n+1)(m-1) for weighted uncovered set

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Abductive Sub-graph Extraction
- **Claim:** Providing a minimal sub-tournament (MS) acts as a formal "abductive explanation" for a candidate's victory by identifying a subset of comparisons sufficient to guarantee the outcome.
- **Mechanism:** The algorithm isolates a partial tournament $G' \subseteq G$ where the target candidate $w$ is a "necessary winner"—meaning $w$ wins in every possible completion of the missing edges. By minimizing $G'$, the system filters non-essential information.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes the user interprets the presence of specific pairwise victories (edges) as the primary causal factor for the election result, rather than the absence of defeats.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "This notion corresponds to an abductive explanation... minimal sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how the rest... is completed."
  - [section 3] "MSs provide a rigorous base to explain the outcome... as they correspond to abductive... explanations."
  - [corpus] The corpus is largely applications of tournaments (Pokemon, SQL); it does not contradict this mechanism but offers no direct validation of the "abductive" formalism.
- **Break condition:** If the tournament rule relies on global cardinality constraints (e.g., specific total vote counts) rather than relative dominance, a purely structural sub-graph may fail to capture the necessary context.

### Mechanism 2: Path-Based Structural Reduction (Top Cycle & Uncovered Set)
- **Claim:** For path-based solutions like the Top Cycle (TC) and Uncovered Set (UC), the mechanism reduces the complex tournament graph to a rooted out-tree.
- **Mechanism:** The algorithm prunes edges such that for every candidate $c$, there exists a unique directed path from the winner $w$ to $c$. This structure guarantees minimality: removing any edge breaks a path and invalidates the victory condition.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes that reachability (via paths) is the sole determinant of winning for these specific rules.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.1] "Proposition 1... for all MSs X for $w \in TC(G)$, X is a w-rooted out-tree."
  - [section 4.1] "Corollary 4... X is a w-rooted out-tree of depth at most 2 [for UC]."
  - [corpus] No direct structural evidence in corpus papers; mechanism is derived purely from the paper's proofs.
- **Break condition:** If the tournament solution is not path-based (e.g., Copeland or Borda), this tree structure is insufficient to explain the score.

### Mechanism 3: Score-Margin Constraints (Borda & Copeland)
- **Claim:** For scoring rules (Borda, Copeland), the mechanism shifts from preserving paths to preserving "score margins" between the winner and losers.
- **Mechanism:** The algorithm constructs a minimal set of comparisons $X$ such that the winner's minimum possible score in any completion of $X$ exceeds the maximum possible score of every loser. This often involves keeping the winner's victories and just enough defeats of the losers.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes that "winning" is strictly a function of aggregated scores, and that a winner's victory can be certified by bounding the upper limit of losers' scores.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.4] "We then give a formula to compute $\sigma_{min}$ and $\sigma_{max}$... [and] introduce the notion of score margin."
  - [section 4.4] "Proposition 23... w is a necessary winner... if and only if for all c... $\delta(c, G) \ge 0$."
  - [corpus] The corpus paper "JudgeSQL" uses weighted tournaments but does not detail this margin-based certification logic.
- **Break condition:** If the scoring rule is highly sensitive to the specific weights of *all* edges (not just a subset), the minimal support might become too large to be explanatory.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Tournament Solutions & Dominance**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper assumes familiarity with how rules like Top Cycle or Borda translate a graph of pairwise preferences into a winner.
  - **Quick check question:** In a tournament graph, if candidate A beats B, and B beats C, does A necessarily beat C (transitivity)? (Note: The paper assumes tournaments are complete asymmetric graphs, but not necessarily transitive).

- **Concept: Necessary Winners (Partial Information)**
  - **Why needed here:** The core logic of a "Minimal Support" relies on defining a winner based on *incomplete* information (a partial tournament) that holds true for all completions.
  - **Quick check question:** If you only know that Candidate A beats Candidate B, is A a necessary winner of the tournament? (Hint: No, because unknown edges could allow C to beat A).

- **Concept: Complexity Classes (P vs. NP)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper highlights that finding minimal supports is tractable (Polynomial time) for 5 rules but intractable (NP-complete) for the Weighted Uncovered Set.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the NP-completeness of the Weighted Uncovered Set imply that we cannot efficiently compute a "Smallest Minimal Support" for it in large tournaments?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer -> Rule Selector -> Solver Engine (Path Engines/ Margin Engines/ Hardness Handler) -> Explainer
- **Critical path:** The computation of the **Smallest Minimal Support (SMS)**. This is the bottleneck where the system must efficiently prune the full tournament graph down to its essential causal edges.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Optimality vs. Speed:** For wUC, you must trade guaranteed minimality (Smallest MS) for computational speed (heuristic MS), as finding the exact SMS is NP-complete.
  - **Win-Count vs. Size:** For rules like Maximin and Borda, you must choose between the absolute smallest SMS or a "Maxwin-SMS" (which highlights the winner's strengths but might be slightly larger).
  - **Assumption:** Users prefer smaller explanations (Grice's manner) over exhaustive data, provided the logic holds.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Explosion in wUC:** Runtime blows up on dense weighted graphs if exactness is enforced for the Weighted Uncovered Set.
  - **Empty Support:** If the candidate $w$ is *not* actually a winner of the input tournament, the solver should return an error rather than an empty set.
  - **Inconsistent Explanation:** If the pruning is too aggressive (breaking minimality), a "completion" check would reveal the winner loses.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Implement the O(m^2) Tree Extraction:** Code the Dijkstra-based algorithm for the Top Cycle to verify it produces a directed out-tree of size $m-1$.
  2. **Validate Score Margins (Borda):** Create a synthetic weighted tournament and run the Algorithm 2 (FindMaxWinSMS-Borda) to see if it correctly bounds the losers' max scores using fewer edges than the full tournament.
  3. **Stress Test wUC Complexity:** Attempt to compute SMS for wUC on increasing graph sizes to observe the exponential curve described in Theorem 9, confirming the NP-completeness boundary.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do minimal support-based explanations effectively improve user trust and comprehension compared to full information disclosure?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states, "Several key directions merit further exploration: empirically evaluating the usefulness of the presented explanations."
- **Why unresolved:** The current work focuses on formal definitions, structural properties, and algorithmic efficiency rather than human-computer interaction or cognitive load factors.
- **Evidence:** Quantitative results from user studies measuring verification time and satisfaction rates when using MS explanations versus baseline full-graph visualizations.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Is it possible to approximate Smallest Minimal Supports (SMSs) for the Weighted Uncovered Set within a bounded factor or via fixed-parameter tractability?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Theorem 9 establishes NP-completeness for computing SMSs for the Weighted Uncovered Set, but the paper provides no practical solution for this specific case.
- **Why unresolved:** While efficient polynomial algorithms exist for five of the six rules, the hard case lacks strategies for handling large instances.
- **Evidence:** An approximation algorithm with proven performance guarantees or an FPT algorithm parameterized by the number of candidates.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What are the set-theoretical relationships between minimal supports generated by different tournament solutions on the same preference profile?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion proposes that "minimal supports for different rules on the same tournament could be compared from a set-theoretical perspective."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper characterizes MSs individually for specific rules (e.g., TC, Copeland) but does not analyze how these supports overlap or differ when applied to the same data.
- **Evidence:** Formal characterizations showing inclusion relationships or intersection bounds between SMSs of distinct rules like Borda and Copeland.

## Limitations
- NP-completeness of Weighted Uncovered Set SMS computation limits practical scalability for weighted tournaments
- Lack of empirical validation with real-world datasets beyond synthetic examples
- No evaluation of user comprehension or trust in minimal support explanations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Theoretical correctness of SMS characterization for path-based rules (TC, UC) and score-based rules (Borda, Copeland, Maximin). The reduction to rooted out-trees and margin-based formulations are mathematically sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: Practical effectiveness of explanations in improving user understanding. While the paper establishes SMS as "certified" explanations, it does not validate whether users can effectively interpret them.
- **Low Confidence**: Computational feasibility for large-scale weighted tournaments, particularly for the NP-complete wUC case where no practical approximation algorithms are provided.

## Next Checks
1. Implement and verify the O(m²) tree extraction algorithm for Top Cycle on synthetic tournaments
2. Test score margin computation for Borda on weighted examples to ensure correct winner certification
3. Run complexity experiments on Weighted Uncovered Set to observe NP-complete behavior empirically
