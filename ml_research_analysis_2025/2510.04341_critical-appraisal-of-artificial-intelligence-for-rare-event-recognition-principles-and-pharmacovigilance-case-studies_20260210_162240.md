# Critical appraisal of artificial intelligence for rare-event recognition: principles and pharmacovigilance case studies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04341
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04341
- Reference count: 34
- One-line primary result: Proposed framework prevents misleading accuracy estimates in rare-event AI by emphasizing prevalence-aware metrics and human review of error patterns

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of evaluating AI models for rare-event recognition, where standard accuracy metrics can be highly misleading. The authors propose a structured approach combining statistical evaluation with Structured Case-Level Examination (SCLE) to ensure operational value. Through three pharmacovigilance case studies, they demonstrate how test set design, prevalence-aware metrics, and human review of errors provide more reliable assessment than aggregate statistics alone.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of test set construction with appropriate positive/negative controls, statistical evaluation using prevalence-aware metrics (recall, precision, specificity, AUROC), and SCLE involving stratified sampling of false positives, false negatives, and true positives for human review. Three case studies illustrate the approach: a rule-based pregnancy report retrieval system, an SVM-based duplicate detection model, and an LLM-based name redaction system. The methods emphasize avoiding optimism from enriched test sets and ensuring difficult positive controls are included.

## Key Results
- Prevalence-aware metrics prevent deployment of AI models that appear accurate but deliver limited operational value
- SCLE surfaces failure modes invisible to aggregate statistics through human review of stratified error samples
- Test set enrichment with positive controls inflates precision estimates unless explicitly adjusted for deployment prevalence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prevalence-aware metrics prevent deployment of AI models that appear accurate but deliver limited operational value in rare-event contexts.
- Mechanism: When positive events are scarce, overall accuracy is dominated by correct classification of abundant negatives. Selecting metrics that explicitly account for class imbalance (recall, precision, specificity) exposes the true cost-benefit tradeoff for the intended workflow.
- Core assumption: The relative costs of false positives and false negatives are asymmetric and can be quantified for the specific deployment context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "apparent accuracy can be misleading when prevalence is low"
  - [section] Page 12: "specificity of 99.95% resulted in a precision of only 55%, because of the low prevalence of positive controls"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; neighbors focus on explainability rather than prevalence-aware evaluation.
- Break condition: If error costs are symmetric or prevalence approaches balance (~50%), standard accuracy metrics become sufficient and this mechanism adds complexity without value.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Structured Case-Level Examination (SCLE) surfaces failure modes invisible to aggregate statistics.
- Mechanism: Human review of stratified samples from false positives, false negatives, and true positives reveals whether errors are understandable/acceptable or indicate systematic issues. Diagnostic tagging enables pattern detection across error types.
- Core assumption: Human reviewers can reliably distinguish between acceptable edge-case ambiguity and problematic model failures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose an approach to structured case-level examination (SCLE), to complement statistical performance evaluation"
  - [section] Page 17: "Examining false positives and false negatives can each give useful insights regarding the strengths and limitations of the AI model"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for SCLE specifically; related work on human-centered explanations (An Appraisal-Based Approach to Human-Centred Explanations) supports qualitative review principles.
- Break condition: If the task has no ambiguity and classifications are objectively verifiable, SCLE adds limited value over automated validation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Test set enrichment with positive controls inflates precision estimates unless explicitly adjusted for deployment prevalence.
- Mechanism: Naive precision computed on enriched test sets reflects the artificial class balance rather than real-world performance. Bayes' theorem enables correction if specificity and recall are reliably estimated.
- Core assumption: The model's specificity and recall generalize from test conditions to deployment prevalence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "pitfalls specific to the rare-event setting including optimism from unrealistic class balance"
  - [section] Page 11: "if test sets have been enriched with positive controls, naive test set precision estimates will be optimistic and not reflect real-world performance"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors do not address prevalence enrichment strategies directly.
- Break condition: If test set prevalence matches deployment prevalence, enrichment correction is unnecessary.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Confusion matrix decomposition (TP, FP, FN, TN)
  - Why needed here: All prevalence-aware metrics derive from these four counts. Misunderstanding their definitions leads to incorrect metric interpretation.
  - Quick check question: Given 1000 negatives and 10 positives, if a model predicts "negative" for all inputs, what is its accuracy? What is its recall?

- Concept: Bayes' theorem for prevalence correction
  - Why needed here: Enables translation between test-set metrics (estimated with enriched prevalence) and deployment expectations (real prevalence).
  - Quick check question: If precision is 55% on a test set with 0.07% prevalence, what happens to precision if deployment prevalence drops to 0.01%?

- Concept: Stratified sampling for error analysis
  - Why needed here: Random sampling yields too few positive examples in rare-event settings. Stratification ensures coverage of all classification categories for SCLE.
  - Quick check question: Why sample false positives separately rather than taking a random sample of all predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Test set construction module (positive/negative control selection, enrichment strategy) -> Statistical evaluation module (recall, precision, specificity, composite metrics) -> SCLE module (stratified sampling, diagnostic tagging, human review interface) -> Robustness analysis module (subset performance, stability for non-deterministic models)

- Critical path:
  1. Define intended use case and acceptable error costs → 2. Construct test sets aligned with deployment domain → 3. Compute prevalence-aware metrics → 4. Conduct SCLE on stratified error samples → 5. Assess subset robustness → 6. Compare to benchmarks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Enriched test sets: Faster annotation vs. inflated precision estimates requiring correction
  - Model-specific precision tests: Accurate for one model vs. non-reusable for benchmarks
  - High specificity requirements: Large negative control samples needed vs. annotation cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Precision estimates that don't account for test set enrichment
  - Recall estimates based only on "easy" positive controls identified by simple heuristics
  - Composite metrics (F1, AUC) applied without checking relevance to asymmetric error costs
  - No subset-specific performance analysis before deployment

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the name redaction case study analysis: Compute precision at both test-set prevalence (0.07%) and assumed deployment prevalence, documenting the gap.
  2. Design an SCLE protocol for a binary classification task: Define stratified sample sizes, create diagnostic tags relevant to the domain, and pilot with 20 examples per category.
  3. Audit an existing model evaluation: Identify whether test set prevalence matches deployment expectations and whether precision was corrected if enriched.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the validity of using generative LLMs as judges for performance evaluation of other AI models be rigorously established and maintained through human calibration?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "The use of LLMs as a judge may help reduce the resource burden of evaluation and allow performance evaluation at entirely new scales, but their validity must be ensured and demonstrated via human calibration."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a growing area of interest but does not propose or evaluate specific calibration methodologies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing LLM-as-judge evaluations against human expert annotations across multiple rare-event recognition tasks, with quantified agreement metrics and identification of systematic biases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What evaluation paradigms are needed for generative AI applications that produce free-text outputs rather than binary classifications, particularly for rare-event contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Generative applications are becoming more widespread where AI produces free text rather than numerical or categorical output... This would require a different approach to statistical evaluation."
- Why unresolved: The paper's framework focuses on binary classification metrics; extending prevalence-aware evaluation to text generation tasks remains undefined.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of evaluation frameworks for text editing/generation tasks in rare-event settings, including how SCLE sampling categories should be adapted.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How should the Structured Case-Level Examination framework be refined through testing across diverse real-world conditions and domains beyond pharmacovigilance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "While the principles underpinning SCLE have been derived from real-world experience, the more systematic framework proposed here needs testing and refinement under real-world conditions."
- Why unresolved: The proposed SCLE framework is newly introduced and has only been applied retrospectively to the three pharmacovigilance case studies presented.
- What evidence would resolve it: Prospective application of SCLE across multiple domains with rare-event recognition challenges, with systematic documentation of required adaptations and generalizability limits.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can test sets for rare-event AI be constructed to ensure inclusion of difficult positive controls without introducing enrichment-related optimism bias?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper repeatedly identifies "optimism from enriched test sets" and "lack of difficult positive controls" as key pitfalls, but offers no validated solution to this fundamental tension.
- Why unresolved: Random sampling yields too few positive controls for statistical power, while enrichment strategies risk selective omission of harder cases that AI and heuristics both miss.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of test set construction strategies that systematically quantify the bias-variance tradeoff in recall estimation under different enrichment approaches.

## Limitations

- The framework's applicability beyond pharmacovigilance remains untested, though the authors claim generalizability to other rare-event domains
- SCLE methodology relies on human judgment for diagnostic tagging, introducing potential subjectivity and variability between reviewers
- Specific threshold selection for model outputs is acknowledged as use-case dependent but not rigorously specified

## Confidence

- **High**: Prevalence-aware metrics prevent misleading accuracy estimates in rare-event contexts
- **Medium**: SCLE methodology adds value through human review of error patterns
- **Medium**: Test set enrichment requires prevalence correction for valid precision estimates

## Next Checks

1. Apply the framework to a non-pharmacovigilance rare-event domain (e.g., fraud detection) and compare metric distributions to pharmacovigilance case studies
2. Conduct inter-rater reliability testing on SCLE diagnostic tagging to quantify subjectivity and establish consistency requirements
3. Implement sensitivity analysis on threshold selection for the name redaction model, documenting precision-recall tradeoffs at different operating points
