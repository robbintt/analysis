# Explainable AI in Time-Sensitive Scenarios: Prefetched Offline Explanation Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.04283
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04283
- Reference count: 17
- One-line primary result: POEM achieves 83-96% reduction in explanation latency while maintaining quality through pre-computed explanations

## Executive Summary
POEM is a model-agnostic XAI algorithm designed for image data that addresses the need for fast, high-quality explanations in time-sensitive scenarios. The core innovation lies in its two-phase approach: an offline phase that precomputes an explanation base using an existing method (ABELE), and an online phase that rapidly retrieves the most suitable pre-computed explanation for new instances by leveraging neighborhood and decision tree structures. POEM enhances explanation generation by introducing novel strategies for exemplar and counterexample creation, as well as saliency map generation. Experimental results demonstrate that POEM achieves significant speed improvements (83-96% reduction in execution time) over its predecessor while maintaining high explanation quality.

## Method Summary
POEM employs a two-phase approach for local explainability. The offline phase trains an Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) and uses ABELE to generate an explanation base containing latent points, neighborhoods, and surrogate decision trees for sampled instances. The online phase encodes new instances into the latent space, searches the explanation base for the closest match, and verifies three conditions: same black-box classification, within the neighborhood hyperpolyhedron, and same decision tree branch. If all conditions are met, the pre-computed explanation is retrieved; otherwise, ABELE is run on-the-fly. The method generates exemplars from truncated normal distributions, counterexemplars through iterative perturbations, and saliency maps based on exemplar differences.

## Key Results
- POEM achieves 83-96% reduction in explanation latency compared to ABELE
- Hit percentages reach 98-99.4% for MNIST/FASHION with 5000 pre-computed explanations
- Execution time drops from ~300s to ~12-17s on high-hit datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Pre-computing explanations offline and retrieving them online drastically reduces explanation latency while preserving explanation quality. The offline phase builds an explanation base by running ABELE on sampled instances, storing tuples of latent points, neighborhoods, and surrogate decision trees in an indexed structure. At inference, new instances are encoded to latent space, and the system retrieves the closest pre-computed explanation whose decision tree and neighborhood conditions match. Core assumption: The latent space is sufficiently covered by the explanation base such that most new instances fall within a pre-computed neighborhood and share the same decision tree branch as some stored point.

### Mechanism 2
Three matching conditions ensure retrieved explanations remain faithful to the new instance's classification reasoning: (1) same black-box classification; (2) new point lies within the pre-computed neighborhood hyperpolyhedron; (3) same decision tree branch is reached. Only if all hold is the pre-computed explanation reused. Core assumption: The surrogate decision tree trained on synthetic neighbors captures local decision boundaries reliably, and the neighborhood hyperpolyhedron defines a meaningful region of explanation validity.

### Mechanism 3
Generating exemplars from truncated normal distributions constrained by rule predicates, and selecting maximally distant exemplars, produces more diverse and informative explanations. For factual rule r = p → b(x), each latent feature in p is sampled from a standard normal truncated by its predicate bounds; features not in p are unconstrained. After generating candidates, the furthest from the original instance (by Euclidean distance) are selected. Core assumption: Latent dimensions follow the standard normal distribution (per AAE design), and distance in latent space correlates with perceptual/semantic diversity in image space.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE)**
  - Why needed here: POEM relies on the AAE to encode images into a low-dimensional latent space with a known prior distribution (standard normal), enabling synthetic instance generation and neighborhood construction.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the discriminator in an AAE forces the aggregated posterior to match a specified prior distribution?

- **Concept: Surrogate Decision Trees for Local Explanation**
  - Why needed here: POEM (via ABELE) trains decision trees on synthetic neighborhoods to extract human-readable factual and counterfactual rules; understanding how trees partition feature space is essential.
  - Quick check question: Given a decision tree path, how would you extract a factual rule (premise → class) and a minimal counterfactual rule?

- **Concept: Latent Space Neighborhoods**
  - Why needed here: The explanation base indexes pre-computed neighborhoods; the online phase checks whether new points fall within these hyperpolyhedra.
  - Quick check question: In a 4-dimensional latent space with axis-aligned splits from a decision tree, what shape does a neighborhood hyperpolyhedron typically take?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** AAE (encoder/decoder/discriminator) -> Black-box classifier (RF/DNN) -> Explanation base (indexed lookup) -> Online matcher -> Exemplar/counterexemplar generators -> Saliency map generator

- **Critical path:** Offline: Train AAE → Sample D_t → For each t: encode → generate neighborhood → query black box → train decision tree → store tuple. Online: Encode x → find nearest t in explanation base → verify 3 conditions → extract rules → generate exemplars/counterexemplars/saliency map.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Explanation base size vs. coverage: Larger base → higher hit rate but more offline compute and storage
  - Latent dimensionality vs. interpretability: Lower dimensions simplify rule extraction but may lose image detail
  - Discriminator threshold α vs. synthetic quality: Higher α → stricter realism filter but more rejected candidates

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low hit percentage: Explanation base too small for class cardinality
  - High variance in online latency: Non-hits trigger full ABELE fallback
  - Uninformative counterexemplars: If ε is too large or m too small, iterative perturbation may fail

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Vary explanation base size (500, 1000, 2500, 5000) on MNIST - measure hit percentage and average explanation time
  2. Compare online POEM vs. full ABELE latency across MNIST, FASHION, EMNIST with both RF and DNN black boxes
  3. Run deletion experiment on saliency maps - progressively remove pixels by importance and plot classification probability drop

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can POEM be extended to non-image data modalities such as time series and tabular data?
- **Open Question 2:** What explanation base size is required for datasets with many class labels or high-dimensional latent spaces?
- **Open Question 3:** How do domain experts perceive POEM's explanations in real-world applications such as medical imaging?
- **Open Question 4:** Can the online phase's condition-matching failures serve as a reliable signal for detecting data distribution drift?

## Limitations
- Explanation base coverage is strongly dataset-dependent, degrading notably on EMNIST (26 classes) vs MNIST (10 classes)
- Neighborhood hyperpolyhedron matching relies heavily on surrogate decision tree quality without direct validation
- Performance may not scale well to multi-class problems without proportionally increasing explanation base size

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Execution time reduction (83-96%) - directly measured and reported with clear experimental setup
- **Medium confidence:** Explanation quality maintenance - evaluated through deletion experiments showing steep probability drops, but limited comparison to other XAI methods
- **Low confidence:** Cross-dataset generalization - performance on EMNIST suggests the approach may not generalize well to datasets with more classes or different data characteristics

## Next Checks
1. **Coverage analysis:** Systematically vary explanation base size (500, 1000, 2500, 5000) on EMNIST to quantify the relationship between base size and hit percentage
2. **Tree fidelity assessment:** Measure the accuracy of the surrogate decision trees on their training neighborhoods and analyze the correlation between tree fidelity and explanation quality for retrieved explanations
3. **Latent space analysis:** Validate that the AAE's latent space dimensions are indeed approximately standard normal and that Euclidean distance correlates with perceptual similarity for the exemplar selection strategy
