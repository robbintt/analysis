# Head Pursuit: Probing Attention Specialization in Multimodal Transformers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21518
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21518
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces a method using SOMP to identify and intervene on specialized attention heads that control semantic attributes in LLMs and VLMs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to identify and intervene on specialized attention heads in large generative models. Using Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SOMP), the authors project head outputs onto the unembedding matrix to rank heads by their relevance to target concepts. They demonstrate that intervening on as few as 1% of specialized heads can reliably suppress or enhance targeted semantic concepts across multiple tasks including question answering, toxicity mitigation, image classification, and image captioning. The method works consistently across both unimodal and multimodal transformers, offering a principled tool for understanding and editing large-scale generative models.

## Method Summary
The method extracts attention head outputs from forward passes, then applies SOMP using the unembedding matrix as a dictionary to identify sparse, semantically meaningful directions. Heads are ranked by variance explained on restricted dictionaries containing target concept tokens. Intervention is performed by rescaling selected head outputs during inference (α = -1 for suppression, α > 1 for enhancement). The approach is validated across multiple tasks: suppressing country names in TriviaQA, mitigating toxic content in RealToxicityPrompts, disrupting image classification on MNIST/SVHN/GTSRB, and controlling semantic attributes in Flickr30k captioning.

## Key Results
- Intervening on as few as 1% of specialized heads reliably suppresses or enhances targeted concepts
- Country name suppression reduced F1 score by up to 70% in question answering
- Toxic content reduction of 17-34% while maintaining task performance
- Image classification accuracy degradation up to 99% with targeted interventions
- Semantic attribute control in captioning achieved 60%+ concept frequency changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Attention heads exhibit sparse, concept-specific specialization that can be quantified by projecting their outputs onto the unembedding matrix. SOMP iteratively selects dictionary atoms that maximally correlate with head residuals across multiple samples, producing a ranked list of heads by variance explained for target concepts. This relies on the linear representation hypothesis that head outputs can be approximated as sparse linear combinations of semantically meaningful directions in the unembedding space.

### Mechanism 2
Intervening on a small subset of specialized heads (as few as 1%) reliably suppresses or enhances targeted semantic concepts in model outputs. During forward pass, selected head contributions to the residual stream are rescaled, affecting both direct contribution and indirect information flow to subsequent layers. This assumes specialized heads have causal influence over concept generation, not merely correlational relationships.

### Mechanism 3
Specialized heads cluster by semantic similarity—datasets with related semantics share overlapping functional heads. Heads selected for concept A (e.g., digit recognition) transfer to concept B (e.g., traffic signs containing numerals) because they encode shared underlying features. This assumes semantic relationships in training data create overlapping functional subspaces in attention heads.

## Foundational Learning

- **Residual Stream Decomposition**: Why needed here: The method isolates individual head contributions H_h,l to understand their separate effects. Quick check: Can you explain how each attention head writes to the residual stream and how this enables head-level analysis?

- **Matching Pursuit / Sparse Coding**: Why needed here: SOMP is the core algorithm for identifying sparse, interpretable directions that explain head variance. Quick check: Why does OMP select atoms greedily based on maximum correlation with residuals, and what advantage does SOMP provide over single-sample OMP?

- **Logit Lens**: Why needed here: The paper frames SOMP as a multi-sample generalization of Logit Lens; understanding LL clarifies the connection. Quick check: How does projecting intermediate activations through the unembedding matrix reveal token-level predictions at each layer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Head activation extraction -> Dictionary construction -> SOMP iteration -> Head ranking -> Intervention hook
- **Critical path**: 1. Define target concept token list; 2. Run SOMP to identify top-k specialized heads; 3. Validate specificity via random control heads; 4. Apply intervention and measure concept frequency + task quality
- **Design tradeoffs**: k (number of heads) - more heads = stronger effect but more collateral damage; α (rescaling factor) - higher values = more enhancement but CIDEr degradation; Dictionary completeness - incomplete lists bias selection
- **Failure signatures**: Random control shows similar effect → selection not specific; CIDEr drops below 0.5 → over-intervention; Enhancement increases concept but outputs become incoherent
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Replicate TriviaQA country suppression: k=8 heads, measure F1 on country vs. non-country questions; 2. Image classification disruption on MNIST: k=16 heads, verify random control shows minimal effect; 3. Caption enhancement for colors: k=16, α=5, confirm 60%+ concept increase with CIDEr > 0.8

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Fine-grained interventions**: Can more selective interventions, such as disabling heads only over image patches while preserving text understanding, achieve higher specificity than global rescaling?

- **Multimodal-output settings**: Can this method be adapted for image generation tasks, where semantic steering of visual attributes is required?

- **Nonlinear decomposition**: Does the linearity assumption inherent in SOMP limit the identification of specialized heads compared to nonlinear decomposition methods?

## Limitations

- Dictionary construction sensitivity: Effectiveness depends critically on token list quality and completeness, with no systematic analysis of sensitivity
- Intervention scope ambiguity: Exact mechanism of how rescaling interacts with multi-head attention and residual connections is not fully specified
- Limited evidence for cross-dataset transfer: Claims about semantic clustering of specialized heads appear novel with relatively limited supporting evidence

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: SOMP successfully identifies specialized heads; 0.8-3% head interventions reliably affect concepts; method works across unimodal and multimodal transformers; random controls show significantly less effect

**Medium Confidence**: Cross-dataset transfer based on semantic similarity; linear approximation captures meaningful semantic directions; head specialization patterns are consistent across architectures

**Low Confidence**: Exact threshold for dictionary completeness requirements; precise mechanism of intervention effects on attention dynamics; generalizability beyond tested domains

## Next Checks

1. **Dictionary sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary token dictionary completeness and specificity for the same concept to quantify method robustness to dictionary construction choices.

2. **Intervention mechanism clarification**: Implement and test detailed intervention protocols that explicitly model how head rescaling affects both direct contributions and indirect information flow through attention layers.

3. **Cross-model generalization study**: Apply SOMP to additional model architectures and domains (e.g., medical imaging, scientific text) to test generalizability of observed head specialization patterns and intervention effectiveness.
