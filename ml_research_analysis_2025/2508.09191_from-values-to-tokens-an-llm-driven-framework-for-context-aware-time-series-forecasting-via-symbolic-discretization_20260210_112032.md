core_contribution: TokenCast is a new framework for context-aware time series forecasting
  that uses a large language model to handle both numerical and textual inputs. It
  works by discretizing continuous time series into tokens, embedding them in the
  same space as contextual language tokens, and then fine-tuning the model to predict
  future values autoregressively.

# From Values to Tokens: An LLM-Driven Framework for Context-aware Time Series Forecasting via Symbolic Discretization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09191
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09191
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: TokenCast achieves state-of-the-art performance on context-aware time series forecasting by discretizing numerical values into tokens that share embedding space with contextual language tokens

## Executive Summary
TokenCast introduces a novel framework that bridges large language models with time series forecasting by converting continuous values into discrete tokens through symbolic discretization. The framework enables LLMs to process both numerical and textual inputs within the same embedding space, allowing the model to leverage natural language understanding for complex time series tasks. By fine-tuning the LLM to predict future values autoregressively, TokenCast demonstrates superior performance on diverse real-world datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with rich contextual features.

## Method Summary
The framework works by discretizing continuous time series data into symbolic tokens that can be embedded alongside contextual language tokens. These numerical tokens are mapped into the same semantic space as text, enabling the LLM to process both modalities simultaneously. The model is then fine-tuned using autoregressive prediction, where it learns to forecast future values based on historical patterns and contextual information. This approach allows the LLM to apply its natural language understanding capabilities to time series data, capturing complex temporal dependencies and contextual relationships that traditional forecasting methods might miss.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse real-world datasets
- Demonstrates particular strength on datasets with rich contextual features
- Shows robustness across different domains and application areas

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the LLM's inherent ability to understand context and relationships by embedding numerical time series data in the same semantic space as language tokens. This allows the model to capture both temporal patterns and contextual relationships simultaneously, enabling more sophisticated forecasting that considers multiple dimensions of information rather than just historical numerical values.

## Foundational Learning
- Symbolic discretization: converting continuous values to discrete symbols; needed to bridge numerical and language domains; quick check: verify tokenization preserves important value distinctions
- Autoregressive fine-tuning: training the model to predict future values sequentially; needed to capture temporal dependencies; quick check: examine prediction accuracy at different time horizons
- Shared embedding space: mapping numerical and textual tokens to the same semantic space; needed for unified processing; quick check: test cross-modal understanding capabilities

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Raw time series -> Symbolic discretization -> Token embedding -> LLM fine-tuning -> Autoregressive prediction

Critical path: The discretization and embedding components are most critical, as they determine how effectively numerical information is translated into a form the LLM can process.

Design tradeoffs: The symbolic discretization approach balances between granularity (preserving signal detail) and computational efficiency (reducing dimensionality). Higher discretization granularity preserves more signal but increases computational cost.

Failure signatures: Poor discretization may lose important signal information, leading to degraded forecasting accuracy. Insufficient fine-tuning may result in the LLM failing to learn temporal dependencies effectively.

First experiments:
1. Test discretization quality by reconstructing original values from tokens and measuring reconstruction error
2. Evaluate embedding space coherence by testing cross-modal similarity between numerical and textual representations
3. Benchmark autoregressive prediction accuracy against baseline models on simple time series datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for very high-dimensional or high-frequency time series where symbolic representation may become computationally prohibitive
- Assumption that LLM embeddings adequately capture semantic meaning of time series patterns, which lacks systematic validation
- Performance gains may be dataset-specific rather than representing universal superiority of the approach

## Confidence
- High confidence in methodology and technical implementation
- Medium confidence in claimed state-of-the-art performance based on limited benchmark comparisons
- Medium confidence in robustness claims across different domains

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of symbolic discretization versus LLM-based contextual understanding
2. Test scalability on high-frequency financial data and very long sequences to evaluate computational limits
3. Perform cross-domain transfer experiments to assess true generalization capability beyond tested datasets
