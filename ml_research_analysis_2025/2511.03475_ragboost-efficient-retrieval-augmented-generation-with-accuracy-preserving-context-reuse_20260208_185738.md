# RAGBoost: Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Accuracy-Preserving Context Reuse

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.03475
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03475
- **Reference count:** 24
- **Primary result:** 1.5-3× prefill performance improvement while preserving accuracy through context reuse

## Executive Summary
RAGBoost addresses the efficiency bottleneck in retrieval-augmented generation systems by implementing three complementary mechanisms: context indexing for efficient cache tracking, context ordering for maximizing prefix overlap, and context de-duplication for eliminating redundant computation in multi-turn conversations. The system intercepts retrieved documents before they reach the LLM, strategically reordering them to maximize KV cache reuse while maintaining reasoning quality through lightweight textual hints. Tested across four major datasets (MultihopRAG, NarrativeQA, QASPER, MT-RAG), RAGBoost achieves 1.5-3× throughput improvement over state-of-the-art methods while preserving or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

## Method Summary
RAGBoost intercepts retrieved documents and applies three optimization techniques: (1) Context indexing using a hierarchical tree structure to efficiently track cached document sequences, (2) Context ordering via prefix-matching search that reorders documents to maximize overlap with existing KV cache entries, and (3) Context de-duplication with location hints that eliminates redundant document processing while preserving semantic integrity. The system integrates with existing LLM inference engines like SGLang and vLLM, requiring only ~10 lines of modification to cache eviction handlers. The distance function for indexing uses document overlap and positional alignment with parameter α∈[0.001,0.01].

## Key Results
- Achieves 1.5-3× prefill performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods
- Raises KV-cache hit rates to 38.9%, representing 3–8× higher utilization than baseline
- Maintains reasoning accuracy through lightweight contextual hints
- Compatible with existing LLM inference engines (SGLang/vLLM) with minimal modifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Context Ordering for Prefix Alignment
RAGBoost reorders retrieved documents to match previously cached token sequences, increasing KV-cache hit rates and reducing prefill latency. By aligning new request prefixes with existing cache entries, the inference engine skips recomputation of identical tokens. The system assumes that reordering has lower impact on throughput than cache retrieval speed, and any reasoning quality loss can be restored via hints. Evidence shows this raises cache hit rates to 38.9% from baseline 5-6%.

### Mechanism 2: Contextual Hints for Semantic Restoration
After reordering documents, RAGBoost prepends explicit textual instructions about the original retrieval order to restore reasoning accuracy. For example: "Please read the context in the following priority order: [Doc 2] > [Doc 1] > [Doc 3]..." This leverages the LLM's instruction-following capabilities to manually direct attention to the most relevant documents. Hints add negligible token overhead while effectively preserving the model's ability to attend to documents by their original relevance ranking.

### Mechanism 3: Context Indexing for Efficient Lookup
A hierarchical tree index enables low-latency discovery of overlapping context segments across parallel sessions and multi-turn conversations. The tree uses a custom distance metric combining document overlap and positional alignment to cluster contexts. When a new request arrives, the system traverses this tree (O(|C|·log n)) to find the best matching cached sequence rather than scanning the entire cache linearly. Index operations complete within 15 µs, negligible compared to prefill latency.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: KV Cache & Prefix Caching** - Why needed: RAGBoost relies on understanding that LLMs cache Key-Value tensors of processed tokens, making "prefix matching" critical for skipping computation. Quick check: If a prompt has 10 tokens and the first 5 match a cached entry, how many tokens does the engine need to process for the prefill phase? (Answer: 5).

- **Concept: Prefill vs. Decode** - Why needed: The paper targets the "prefill" phase as the bottleneck for RAG. Understanding that prefill is compute-heavy and parallel while decode is memory-bound and serial explains why reordering helps (reducing prefill volume) without affecting decode speed. Quick check: Which phase contributes most to latency when processing a 50k-token context window in RAG? (Answer: Prefill).

- **Concept: RAG Relevance Semantics** - Why needed: RAGBoost modifies input order of retrieved documents. Understanding that in standard RAG, document position implies relevance (top-k are most relevant) explains why RAGBoost needs "hints" to prevent the model from ignoring best sources when moved for cache alignment. Quick check: Why might moving a highly relevant document from position 1 to position 5 hurt an LLM's answer quality? (Answer: "Lost-in-the-middle" effect or implicit positional bias).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Retrieval Module (FAISS/BM25) -> RAGBoost Layer (Context Index, Ordering/Scheduling, Hint Generator) -> Inference Engine (SGLang/vLLM)

- **Critical path:** Request -> Search Context Index (Find best prefix match) -> Reorder Docs (Align with prefix) -> Inject Hints (Restore semantics) -> Schedule (Batch prefix-sharing requests) -> Inference Engine (Prefill with high cache hit)

- **Design tradeoffs:** Trades "natural" retrieval order for cache efficiency, relying on hints to bridge the gap. Index must be stored in CPU RAM and updated on every cache eviction; claimed to be cheap (~15µs) compared to GPU latency.

- **Failure signatures:** Accuracy Drop (hints ignored or model capacity insufficient), Low Hit Rate (workloads with extremely low document overlap), Stale Cache (index falls out of sync with actual GPU cache).

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Ablation on Hinting: Run MultihopRAG with context ordering enabled but hints disabled to verify ~3% accuracy drop. 2) Overlap Stress Test: Construct synthetic dataset with controlled overlap (0%, 20%, 50%, 80%) to measure prefill speedup curve. 3) Index Scaling: Measure index construction time and search latency as cached contexts scale from 1k to 100k to ensure CPU overhead remains bounded.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can the context index construction algorithm be optimized beyond O(N²) complexity to support massive real-time workloads exceeding 100k concurrent contexts? The paper identifies this as a potential overhead for large-scale online workloads.

- **Open Question 2:** Does the contextual hint mechanism robustly preserve reasoning fidelity in domains where document order encodes strict temporal or causal relationships? The system's effectiveness in such domains remains unclear.

- **Open Question 3:** Can RAGBoost be effectively combined with approximate KV-cache matching methods (like CacheBlend) to achieve multiplicative performance gains? The paper states this is possible but doesn't demonstrate the integration.

## Limitations
- Performance gains highly dependent on document overlap across concurrent sessions, which may be low for diverse query workloads
- 3-8× cache hit improvement appears specific to certain dataset characteristics and may not transfer to all RAG applications
- Index construction overhead of ~8 seconds for 2K contexts could become significant in production systems with frequent cache turnover

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core mechanism of context de-duplication is well-established and the paper's implementation appears sound with conservative performance claims.

**Medium Confidence:** The context ordering mechanism (38.9% cache hit rate) and accuracy preservation through hints (~3% accuracy drop when hints are disabled) are demonstrated but may be sensitive to dataset characteristics and implementation details.

**Low Confidence:** The index construction and search efficiency claims (15 µs search time) appear optimistic for production-scale deployments with limited stress-testing data.

## Next Checks

1. **Accuracy Sensitivity Analysis:** Re-run MultihopRAG experiments with varying hint verbosity (0 hints, minimal hints, full hints) to quantify the exact trade-off curve between hint length and accuracy preservation across different model families.

2. **Index Scalability Benchmark:** Measure index construction and search latency as cache size scales from 100 to 100,000 contexts under realistic churn patterns (50% cache turnover per minute) to validate the claimed O(|C|·log n) complexity holds in practice.

3. **Overlap Dependence Validation:** Create synthetic query workloads with controlled document overlap percentages (0%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) to establish the minimum overlap threshold required for RAGBoost to provide net performance benefit after accounting for indexing overhead.
