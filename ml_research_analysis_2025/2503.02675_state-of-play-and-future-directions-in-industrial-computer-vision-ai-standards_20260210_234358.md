# State of play and future directions in industrial computer vision AI standards

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.02675
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02675
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Systematic review of industrial CV AI standards across ISO/IEC, IEEE, DIN, and others, identifying six key standardization topics and current challenges including fragmentation, bias, security, and innovation-regulation balance

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive systematic review of industrial computer vision AI standards, analyzing 22 standards from major international bodies including ISO/IEC, IEEE, DIN, CEN/CENELEC, and BSI. The authors classify standards across six key topics (Accuracy/Performance/Processing, System Design/Architecture, Security/Robustness/Risk, Data Management/Quality, Ethics/Privacy/Fairness, Biometric Identification/Authentication) and five lifecycle stages. The review reveals a fragmented standardization landscape where multiple bodies develop overlapping or conflicting guidelines, creating interoperability challenges for practitioners. The paper identifies critical challenges including bias mitigation, security/privacy concerns, and the need to balance innovation with regulation, while calling for more universally adopted guidelines to ensure responsible CV deployment.

## Method Summary
The study employs a literature survey methodology to identify and classify CV AI standards from international standardization bodies. The authors systematically analyze 22 standards, categorizing them by application domain (horizontal, healthcare, manufacturing, defense), topic coverage (six categories), and lifecycle stage (foundational, measurement, governance, performance, interface). The classification framework is visualized in Figure 1, with detailed standard assignments in Table I. The analysis combines content review of standard scopes and abstracts with synthesis of existing literature on standardization challenges. No algorithmic procedures or experimental validation are specified.

## Key Results
- Identified 22 CV AI standards across 7 international standardization bodies with significant topic overlap but jurisdictional fragmentation
- Classified standards into six core topics: Accuracy/Performance/Processing (APP), System Design/Architecture (SDA), Security/Robustness/Risk (SRR), Data Management/Quality (DMQ), Ethics/Privacy/Fairness (EPF), and Biometric Identification/Authentication (BIA)
- Found current standards primarily focus on horizontal applications with limited domain-specific guidance for healthcare, manufacturing, and defense sectors
- Identified key challenges: regulatory fragmentation, bias and fairness concerns, security/privacy risks, inadequate long-term risk assessment, and innovation-regulation balance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured standard classification enables systematic gap identification in industrial CV deployments.
- Mechanism: The six-topic taxonomy (APP, SDA, SRR, DMQ, EPF, BIA) mapped against lifecycle stages creates a matrix for evaluating regulatory coverage. Organizations can cross-reference their domain requirements against Table I to identify missing compliance coverage.
- Core assumption: The taxonomy comprehensively captures all relevant standardization dimensions.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "classifying them based on their application domains and topics"; [section III] detailed topic breakdown; [corpus] neighbor papers don't address standardization taxonomy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-body standardization creates interoperability challenges requiring active harmonization.
- Mechanism: Parallel development by ISO/IEC, IEEE, DIN, CEN/CENELEC, and BSI produces overlapping or conflicting specifications. The 21 standards across organizations reveal potential contradictions requiring cross-mapping.
- Core assumption: Organizations will prioritize harmonization rather than selecting single-body standards.
- Evidence anchors: [section IV.A] notes inconsistencies and contradictions from multiple bodies; [section III] Table I shows overlapping coverage; [corpus] Human-AI Interaction Design Standards paper mentions standards as adoption foundation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lifecycle-based standard classification guides procurement and audit workflows.
- Mechanism: Grouping standards into foundational, measurement, process/governance, performance, and interface categories maps to project phases. Early-stage projects reference foundational/terminology standards; procurement evaluates performance requirements.
- Core assumption: Projects follow lifecycle phases aligning with these categories.
- Evidence anchors: [section III] detailed lifecycle classification; [section II] CV module development lifecycle needs regulation; [corpus] no direct lifecycle evidence in neighbor papers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectural paradigms for CV**
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes familiarity with DNN-based CV systems to understand which standards apply to which architectural components.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how convolutional layers, pooling operations, and fully-connected layers contribute to feature extraction and classification in a typical CV pipeline?

- Concept: **Risk management frameworks (ISO 31000 lineage)**
  - Why needed here: Multiple standards reference risk assessment (SRR topic); understanding risk identification, analysis, evaluation, and treatment is prerequisite for applying Section IV.E guidance.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes risk assessment from risk management, and what are the four typical stages of a risk treatment plan?

- Concept: **Biometric system performance metrics (FMR, FNMR, EER)**
  - Why needed here: Table I lists multiple biometric standards (ISO/IEC 19795 series, 29794 series); these assume knowledge of false match/non-match rates.
  - Quick check question: If a facial recognition system has FMR=0.001 and FNMR=0.05 at a given threshold, what does this tell you about its security vs. convenience tradeoff?

```

- Critical path:
  1. Identify deployment domain (horizontal, healthcare, manufacturing, defense)
  2. Map to required topics from APP/SDA/SRR/DMQ/EPF/BIA
  3. Cross-reference Table I for applicable standards by organization
  4. Audit current system against lifecycle categories (foundational → interface)
  5. Document gaps; prioritize based on regulatory timeline

- Design tradeoffs:
  - ISO/IEC standards vs. IEEE: ISO/IEC offers broader international recognition; IEEE often provides more technical specificity (e.g., IEEE 3129-2023 for robustness testing).
  - Horizontal vs. domain-specific standards: Horizontal standards provide flexibility; domain-specific address sector-unique requirements but may conflict with horizontal guidance.
  - Comprehensive compliance vs. innovation velocity: Section IV.G warns that "excessive standardization risks to stifle innovation"—organizations must calibrate compliance depth.

- Failure signatures:
  - Compliance theater: Adopting standards documentation without implementing required processes.
  - Jurisdictional mismatch: Applying US-centric standards (IEEE, NIST) to EU deployments subject to AI Act without cross-mapping to CEN/CENELEC requirements.
  - Topic blindspots: Addressing APP and SDA standards while ignoring EPF (ethics/privacy) until regulatory enforcement.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Standards coverage audit**: Map current CV system documentation against the 21 standards in Table I. Identify which lifecycle categories have zero coverage.
  2. **Biometric performance variance test**: Apply ISO/IEC DIS 19795-10 methodology to quantify performance variation across demographic groups in your test dataset.
  3. **Cross-body contradiction analysis**: Compare IEEE 3129-2023 against ISO/IEC requirements for robustness testing. Document specification conflicts requiring reconciliation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can global consensus be achieved among fragmented international standardization bodies to ensure consistent industrial CV AI guidelines?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that varying regulatory frameworks and organizational fragmentation introduce "additional difficulties in achieving global convergence and consensus" (Section IV.A).
- **Why unresolved:** Different bodies (ISO, IEEE, NIST) currently develop guidelines that differ in scope and focus, creating inconsistencies.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The establishment of harmonized standards adopted simultaneously by major global economies or a unified international framework.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can enforceable guidelines for bias mitigation be established given differing ethical perspectives across regions?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section IV.B states that while regulations stress mitigation, enforceable guidelines remain difficult to establish due to these ethical variances.
- **Why unresolved:** Models trained on unbalanced datasets lead to discriminatory outcomes, but "ethical perspectives" vary by state/region.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A universally adopted standard defining specific, measurable bias metrics that are technically enforceable across jurisdictions.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What methodologies can shift CV AI risk assessment from a "build-then-test" approach to a continuous life-cycle monitoring framework?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section IV.E highlights the need for frameworks to continuously monitor AI systems, noting that current approaches neglect long-term risks.
- **Why unresolved:** The rapid evolution of AI technologies and post-deployment adaptation makes static, pre-deployment testing insufficient.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development and validation of real-time monitoring protocols that flag emerging risks during the operational phase of CV systems.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can standardization bodies balance the need for regulatory oversight with the flexibility required to foster technological innovation?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section IV.G highlights the risk that "excessive standardization risks to stifle innovation."
- **Why unresolved:** Strict standards may hinder the integration of novel hardware/software ecosystems or rapid model architecture updates.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Frameworks that define core safety/ethics principles while remaining agnostic to specific underlying architectures.

## Limitations
- The classification framework relies on author interpretation of standard scopes, which may vary between reviewers
- Analysis focuses primarily on Western standardization bodies, potentially missing relevant standards from other regions
- The paper doesn't address how rapidly evolving CV technologies might outpace standardization efforts, particularly in emerging areas like multimodal learning

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The taxonomy of six standardization topics (APP, SDA, SRR, DMQ, EPF, BIA) and five lifecycle stages is well-supported by the systematic review methodology and clearly articulated in Table I and Figure 1.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim about fragmentation creating interoperability challenges is supported by the multi-body landscape but lacks quantitative analysis of actual specification conflicts.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that the current standards landscape provides sufficient coverage for responsible CV deployment cannot be validated without empirical testing of real-world compliance gaps.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-validation of classifications**: Independently classify 5 randomly selected standards from Table I using the paper's taxonomy, then compare results for inter-rater agreement.
2. **Regional standard gap analysis**: Search for and evaluate CV standards from non-Western bodies (e.g., SAC, JISC) to determine if the six-topic framework captures all relevant global requirements.
3. **Technology trend mapping**: Identify CV technologies developed in the last 3 years (e.g., transformer-based architectures, federated learning) and assess whether current standards provide guidance for their responsible deployment.
