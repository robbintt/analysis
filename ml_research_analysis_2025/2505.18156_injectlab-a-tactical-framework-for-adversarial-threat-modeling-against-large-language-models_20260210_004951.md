# InjectLab: A Tactical Framework for Adversarial Threat Modeling Against Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.18156
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18156
- Authors: Austin Howard
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Tactical framework organizing 25+ prompt injection attacks into 6 ATT&CK-inspired tactics with YAML-based simulations and CLI tool.

## Executive Summary
InjectLab introduces a tactical framework for adversarial threat modeling against large language models (LLMs), inspired by MITRE ATT&CK. It organizes over 25 prompt-based attack techniques into six core tactics, each with detection heuristics and mitigation guidance. The framework includes YAML-based simulation tests modeled after Atomic Red Team methodology and a Python CLI tool for easy execution. InjectLab enables red teams, SOC analysts, and researchers to simulate real-world prompt injection attacks in a structured, repeatable way. It bridges gaps in existing AI security taxonomies by focusing specifically on language interface-level threats.

## Method Summary
InjectLab provides a structured approach to LLM threat modeling by organizing prompt injection attacks into six tactical categories aligned with MITRE ATT&CK methodology. The framework includes YAML-based simulation tests following Atomic Red Team methodology and a Python CLI tool for execution. Each attack technique is documented with detection heuristics and mitigation guidance. The framework currently focuses on manual prompt-level injection attacks and serves as a foundation for operational threat detection and red team exercises against LLM deployments.

## Key Results
- Organizes 25+ prompt injection techniques into 6 core tactics aligned with MITRE ATT&CK methodology
- Provides YAML-based simulation tests and Python CLI tool for repeatable attack execution
- Bridges gaps in AI security taxonomies by focusing specifically on language interface-level threats

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
InjectLab works by applying established cybersecurity frameworks to LLM security challenges. By adapting MITRE ATT&CK methodology, it provides a structured way to think about adversarial attacks against LLMs, similar to how network security evolved to use standardized frameworks. The YAML-based simulation tests allow for repeatable, automated testing of attack techniques, while the tactical organization enables systematic threat modeling and detection engineering. This approach bridges the gap between academic research on LLM vulnerabilities and practical security operations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Prompt injection mechanics**: Understanding how attackers manipulate LLM inputs through carefully crafted prompts. Needed because prompt-level attacks are the primary threat surface for deployed LLMs. Quick check: Can you explain how "instruction override" differs from "system prompt leakage"?
- **MITRE ATT&CK methodology**: Framework for organizing adversary tactics and techniques in cybersecurity. Needed because it provides a proven structure for threat modeling that can be adapted to LLMs. Quick check: Can you map the six LLM tactics to their closest network security ATT&CK counterparts?
- **YAML-based simulation testing**: Using YAML files to define repeatable attack scenarios. Needed because it enables automated testing and sharing of attack techniques. Quick check: Can you write a basic YAML simulation for a simple prompt injection?
- **Detection engineering fundamentals**: Creating rules and heuristics to identify malicious behavior. Needed because LLM security requires specialized detection approaches. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between signature-based and behavior-based detection in LLM context?
- **Red team methodology**: Systematic approach to security testing by simulating real-world attacks. Needed because practical security testing requires structured attack frameworks. Quick check: Can you outline the steps for conducting a red team exercise using InjectLab?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: CLI tool -> YAML simulation parser -> Attack execution engine -> Detection heuristics -> Mitigation guidance

Critical path: YAML simulation file -> CLI tool execution -> LLM interaction -> Attack detection -> Mitigation application

Design tradeoffs: Manual vs. automated testing (current manual focus allows deeper understanding but limits scale), breadth vs. depth of attack coverage (25+ techniques documented but not all extensively tested), academic rigor vs. operational practicality (strong theoretical foundation but limited field validation).

Failure signatures: False positives in detection heuristics, incomplete attack coverage, CLI tool integration issues, YAML simulation parsing errors, mitigation guidance that doesn't scale to production environments.

First experiments:
1. Execute a basic instruction override attack using the CLI tool with a simple YAML simulation
2. Run the detection heuristics against a known safe LLM interaction to establish baseline false positive rates
3. Attempt to combine two different attack techniques from the framework in a single simulation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework currently limited to prompt-level injection attacks, excluding broader threat surfaces like model exfiltration
- Attack catalog is manually curated and may not capture emerging or zero-day techniques
- Detection heuristics are heuristic-based and may generate false positives/negatives in real deployments

## Confidence
High: Tactical organization and alignment with ATT&CK principles
Medium: Simulation framework's completeness and framework's unique contribution to AI security taxonomies
Low: Mitigation guidance effectiveness and detection heuristics reliability

## Next Checks
1. Conduct red team exercises using InjectLab against live LLM deployments to measure detection accuracy and attack success rates
2. Perform comparative analysis with existing AI threat frameworks to quantify coverage and uniqueness
3. Develop automated integration tests for the CLI tool and YAML simulations in SOC environments to assess operational feasibility
