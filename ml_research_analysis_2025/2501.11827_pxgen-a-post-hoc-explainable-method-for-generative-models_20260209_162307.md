# PXGen: A Post-hoc Explainable Method for Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.11827
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11827
- Reference count: 40
- Method identifies representative training samples and model behaviors without training-phase access

## Executive Summary
PXGen addresses the scarcity of post-hoc explainable AI methods for generative models by proposing a framework that identifies representative training samples and model behaviors without accessing the training phase. The method uses an anchor set of samples and customizable intrinsic (latent space) and extrinsic (output appearance) criteria to calculate feature values for each anchor. These values are analyzed statistically and visualized using tractable algorithms like k-dispersion or k-center to reveal groups of anchors with distinct characteristics. Evaluation shows PXGen identifies more diverse and representative samples than state-of-the-art methods like VAE-TracIn, with significantly lower execution time (O(n²) vs. non-post-hoc approaches) and no additional model access requirements.

## Method Summary
PXGen is a three-phase post-hoc explainability framework for generative models. Phase 1 (Preparation) defines the explanation goal, selects an anchor set of samples formatted as model outputs, and chooses customizable intrinsic (e.g., KLD) and extrinsic (e.g., MSE, FID) criteria. Phase 2 (Analysis) calculates feature values for each anchor, determines statistical thresholds from model-generated samples, and classifies anchors into four groups (HIHE, HILE, LIHE, LILE) based on high/low intrinsic and extrinsic affinity. Phase 3 (Discovery) applies tractable selection algorithms (k-dispersion or k-center) to identify representative anchors within behavioral groups for visualization and interpretation.

## Key Results
- Identifies more diverse and representative samples than VAE-TracIn with significantly lower execution time
- Successfully reveals phenomena like "model delusion" (HILE) and "aligned conception" (LIHE) in VAEs
- Validates representativeness of identified training samples through model similarity experiments (FID comparisons)
- Requires no training-phase access or additional model information beyond standard forward passes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Criteria Mapping to Multi-Dimensional Feature Space
PXGen maps anchors to a multi-dimensional feature space using intrinsic (latent space) and extrinsic (output appearance) criteria, enabling simultaneous assessment of model confidence and output fidelity. Intrinsic criteria (e.g., KLD) measure divergence between the model's predicted latent distribution and its prior—indicating how "familiar" the model is with an anchor's concept. Extrinsic criteria (e.g., MSE, FID) measure perceptual similarity between the anchor and its reconstruction—indicating output quality. Together, they form a 2D feature space where anchors cluster by model behavior type.

### Mechanism 2: Statistical Threshold-Based Anchor Classification
Anchors are classified into four groups (HIHE, HILE, LIHE, LILE) using thresholds derived from the model's own generated outputs, revealing distinct behavioral patterns. Thresholds computed as average maximum criterion values from multiple generations, ensuring anchor-independence. Anchors below threshold have "high affinity." This yields interpretable categories: HIHE (model knows and reproduces), HILE (model confident but outputs wrong—"model delusion"), LIHE (model uncertain but outputs correct—"aligned conception"), LILE (model fails on both).

### Mechanism 3: Representative Sample Discovery via Tractable Selection Algorithms
k-dispersion and k-center algorithms identify representative anchors within behavioral groups with O(n²) complexity, enabling efficient visualization without training-phase access. k-dispersion maximizes pairwise distance among selected anchors (capturing diversity); k-center minimizes maximum distance from any point to its cluster center (capturing centrality). Both operate on pre-computed feature values, avoiding model re-evaluation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Latent Space Geometry**
  - Why needed here: PXGen's intrinsic criterion (KLD) requires understanding how VAEs encode inputs as distributions in latent space, and how divergence from the prior N(0,I) indicates model familiarity.
  - Quick check question: Given a VAE encoder that outputs μ, σ for an input, how would you compute KLD from the prior N(0,I)?

- **Concept: Post-hoc vs. Ante-hoc Explainability**
  - Why needed here: PXGen is explicitly post-hoc—it requires no training-phase access or gradient tracking, distinguishing it from influence-function methods like VAE-TracIn.
  - Quick check question: What information would VAE-TracIn need that PXGen explicitly avoids requiring?

- **Concept: FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) for Image Similarity**
  - Why needed here: PXGen uses FID as an extrinsic criterion for complex images (CIFAR10 experiments), requiring understanding of how FID embeds images and compares distributions.
  - Quick check question: Why might FID be preferred over MSE for comparing generated and anchor images in complex datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Preparation Phase: Model (black-box generative: VAE, GAN, Diffusion) -> Anchor Set (samples formatted as model outputs) -> Criteria (Intrinsic: KLD; Extrinsic: MSE/FID)
  Analysis Phase: Feature Value Calculation (per anchor: KLD + MSE/FID) -> Threshold Determination (average max from model generations) -> Classification → HIHE / HILE / LIHE / LILE
  Discovery Phase: Group Selection (which behavioral category to explain) -> Algorithm Application (k-dispersion OR k-center) -> Visualization (representative anchors displayed)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define explanation goal (e.g., "find representative training samples" vs. "identify model delusion")
  2. Select anchor set matching goal (training data for influence, diverse samples for behavioral analysis)
  3. Choose criteria: KLD always; MSE for simple images, FID for complex
  4. Generate threshold set: Run model N times, compute average max KLD and MSE/FID
  5. Classify all anchors into four groups
  6. Apply k-dispersion (for diversity) or k-center (for typicality) with k=6-10
  7. Visualize top anchors with original and reconstructed pairs

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Anchor set size: Larger n improves coverage but increases O(n²) compute; recommend n=1000-5000 for balance
  - Criterion selection: More criteria increase completeness but complicate interpretation; 2-3 recommended
  - Threshold method: Average max provides stability but may be conservative; alternative percentiles (e.g., 95th) can be tested
  - Algorithm choice: k-dispersion reveals behavioral diversity; k-center reveals behavioral modes—use both for comprehensive view

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Empty HIHE group: Thresholds too strict; increase percentile or check model quality
  - HILE group >50% of anchors: Model may be collapsed or overfitted; inspect reconstruction quality
  - k-dispersion returns visually similar anchors: Feature space may lack discriminative power; add or change criteria
  - FID comparison fails: Ensure Inception model available and images properly preprocessed
  - Threshold variance >20%: Model sampling is unstable; increase generation iterations for averaging

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce MNIST "0" classification: Train VAE on MNIST-0 only, use remaining digits as anchors, verify HIHE identifies "0"-like anchors and HILE shows "model delusion" (non-0 digits reconstructed as 0s)
  2. Compare against VAE-TracIn on sample removal impact: For VAE trained on MNIST-0, iteratively remove PXGen-identified "non-representative" vs. TracIn-identified "low-influence" samples, measure FID to original model at each step
  3. Test criterion sensitivity: Run PXGen with MSE-only, FID-only, and combined criteria on CIFAR10 AutoSoft-IntroVAE; compare group distributions and representative anchor quality to assess criterion contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the intrinsic criteria component of PXGen be adapted for generative models that lack an explicit encoder, such as standard GANs or Diffusion Probabilistic Models?
- Basis in paper: [Inferred] The introduction claims PXGen is applicable to "GANs, VAEs, DDPMs," but the methodology in Section 3.1 and the demonstration in Section 4 rely specifically on calculating intrinsic criteria (KLD) by feeding anchors into an *encoder* to extract latent vectors.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not describe a mechanism for mapping input anchors to a latent space for models that map noise $Z \to X$ without an inverse path $X \to Z$.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of PXGen applied to a generator-only architecture, utilizing an alternative method for defining intrinsic affinity (e.g., via latent space inversion or distinct feature spaces), would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How sensitive are the resulting explanatory groups (HIHE, HILE, etc.) to the specific heuristics used for threshold determination?
- Basis in paper: [Inferred] Section 4.2 states that thresholds for "high" vs. "low" affinity are determined by the "average of the maximum values obtained from multiple iterations," but the paper does not analyze if this specific statistical approach biases the classification of anchors.
- Why unresolved: The stability of the identified phenomena (like "model delusion") depends entirely on these thresholds, yet the paper provides no ablation study regarding the thresholding strategy.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study showing the variance in anchor classification when using different statistical thresholds (e.g., percentiles, standard deviations) would establish robustness.

### Open Question 3
What guidelines or theoretical bounds exist for selecting the "Anchor Set" to ensure the explanation is complete and faithful to the model's true data distribution?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] Section 3.1 explicitly states that the selected anchors "influence the quality of understandability, completeness, and complexity of the explanation" but leaves the selection process entirely to the user without defining constraints.
- Why unresolved: If the user-provided anchor set lacks diversity or has distributional gaps, the post-hoc analysis will fail to uncover specific model behaviors, yet the paper offers no method to validate the anchor set itself.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis or empirical test showing the degradation of explanation quality as the anchor set size decreases or its bias increases.

## Limitations
- The method's performance on highly complex datasets (e.g., ImageNet) remains unverified
- Validation relies heavily on visual inspection of generated samples rather than quantitative behavioral metrics
- The choice between k-dispersion and k-center algorithms is left to user preference without guidance on when each is more appropriate

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The O(n²) complexity claim and the basic algorithmic approach (dual-criteria mapping, threshold-based classification) are well-founded and computationally straightforward.
- **Medium Confidence**: The behavioral interpretations (HIHE, HILE, LIHE, LILE) and their relationship to model phenomena like "model delusion" are plausible but not rigorously validated across diverse scenarios.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that PXGen identifies more representative samples than state-of-the-art methods lacks direct quantitative comparison, and the claim of being "post-hoc" needs clearer distinction from influence-function methods that also operate post-training.

## Next Checks
1. **Threshold Stability Analysis**: Run PXGen with varying numbers of model generation iterations (5, 10, 20, 50) and measure variance in threshold values and resulting group classifications. If threshold variance exceeds 20% of mean value, investigate alternative thresholding methods.

2. **Criterion Sensitivity Study**: Systematically disable intrinsic criterion (KLD-only), extrinsic criterion (MSE-only), and use combined criteria on the same dataset. Quantify changes in group composition and representative sample quality using human evaluation (5-point Likert scale for representativeness).

3. **Direct Method Comparison**: Implement VAE-TracIn alongside PXGen on the MNIST-0 dataset. For identical anchor sets and removal budgets, compare the FID degradation curves of models trained on PXGen-selected vs. TracIn-selected samples to validate the "more representative" claim quantitatively.
