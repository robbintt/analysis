# A Novel Multi-layer Task-centric and Data Quality Framework for Autonomous Driving

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.17346
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17346
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces a five-layer framework integrating data quality metrics with task performance in autonomous driving systems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel five-layer framework that systematically integrates data quality (DQ) management with task performance requirements in autonomous driving (AV) systems. The framework spans from data acquisition through task execution to goal achievement, creating a comprehensive mapping between DQ metrics and AV performance objectives. The authors demonstrate that high-quality, less redundant data can enhance computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy in object detection tasks, addressing the critical challenge of balancing data quality with real-time processing constraints in AV systems.

## Method Summary
The framework introduces a hierarchical structure comprising data, DQ, task, application, and goal layers that create bidirectional mappings between data quality metrics and task requirements. The methodology involves defining DQ dimensions (completeness, redundancy, timeliness, accuracy, diversity) and establishing task-specific DQ metrics through systematic mapping. The approach is validated through a case study using the nuScenes dataset, focusing on redundancy reduction in multisource camera views and multimodal image-LiDAR data for YOLOv8 object detection. The experimental design involves controlled removal of redundant instances while monitoring performance metrics like mAP50 scores and computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- Partially removing redundant instances from multisource camera views and multimodal image-LiDAR data improved or maintained YOLOv8 object detection performance
- Pruned datasets with lower redundancy achieved comparable or better mAP50 scores compared to full datasets
- High redundancy ratios in LiDAR-image data typically occur for objects close to the ego-vehicle, suggesting targeted redundancy reduction opportunities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating explicit connections between data quality dimensions and task performance requirements, enabling systematic optimization of data processing pipelines. By mapping DQ metrics to specific task needs, the system can dynamically adjust data quality thresholds based on computational constraints and performance objectives. The redundancy reduction mechanism specifically targets unnecessary data duplication that consumes computational resources without contributing to improved task accuracy, particularly effective for objects near the vehicle where multiple sensors capture similar information.

## Foundational Learning
- Data Quality Dimensions (completeness, redundancy, timeliness, accuracy, diversity): Why needed - provides comprehensive framework for evaluating data utility; Quick check - validate each dimension against task requirements
- Task-specific DQ Metrics: Why needed - translates general DQ concepts into actionable performance indicators; Quick check - ensure metrics directly correlate with task success metrics
- Bidirectional Mapping: Why needed - enables both data-driven task optimization and task-driven data quality requirements; Quick check - verify mappings produce consistent results in both directions
- Redundancy Analysis: Why needed - identifies computational inefficiencies in multisensor data fusion; Quick check - measure redundancy ratios across different sensor combinations
- Computational Efficiency Trade-offs: Why needed - balances accuracy improvements against processing constraints; Quick check - track performance per unit of computational cost

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data Sources -> Data Quality Layer -> Task Layer -> Application Layer -> Goal Layer

**Critical Path:**
Sensor Data → DQ Assessment → Redundancy Filtering → Object Detection → Performance Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Accuracy vs. Computational Efficiency: The framework prioritizes maintaining detection accuracy while reducing computational load through redundancy removal
- Data Completeness vs. Processing Speed: Selective data pruning balances comprehensive scene understanding with real-time requirements
- Sensor Fusion Complexity vs. Information Gain: The framework evaluates whether combining multiple sensor views provides sufficient additional value to justify computational costs

**Failure Signatures:**
- Performance degradation when redundancy removal eliminates genuinely distinct information
- Computational bottlenecks when DQ assessment overhead exceeds processing savings
- Task failures when DQ metrics inadequately capture critical environmental variations

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Implement single-dimension redundancy reduction on monocular camera data for baseline performance comparison
2. Test redundancy removal thresholds across different object distance ranges to identify optimal pruning strategies
3. Compare computational efficiency gains between camera-only and multimodal (camera-LiDAR) redundancy reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Framework validation limited to object detection tasks using YOLOv8 on nuScenes dataset, may not generalize to other AV perception tasks
- Single DQ dimension (redundancy) analysis does not address complex interactions between multiple DQ dimensions
- Real-time adaptability claims lack empirical validation under varying computational resource constraints and dynamic driving conditions

## Confidence
- High confidence: The conceptual framework architecture and its logical progression from data to goals is well-structured and theoretically sound
- Medium confidence: The redundancy reduction methodology and its impact on computational efficiency for object detection
- Low confidence: The framework's scalability to diverse AV tasks and real-time adaptive capabilities

## Next Checks
1. Validate framework applicability across multiple AV perception tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, tracking) and different model architectures beyond YOLOv8
2. Conduct real-time performance validation under varying computational resource constraints and dynamic driving scenarios
3. Implement and evaluate multi-dimensional DQ metric interactions simultaneously rather than focusing on single dimensions like redundancy in isolation
