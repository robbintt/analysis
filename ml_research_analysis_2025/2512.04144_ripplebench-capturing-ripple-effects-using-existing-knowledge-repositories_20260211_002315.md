# RippleBench: Capturing Ripple Effects Using Existing Knowledge Repositories

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04144
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04144
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces RippleBench-Maker framework and applies it to create RippleBench-Bio, revealing that all tested unlearning methods exhibit significant accuracy drops on semantically related concepts beyond immediate targets.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses a critical gap in machine unlearning evaluation by introducing RippleBench-Maker, a framework for measuring how knowledge deletion interventions propagate across semantically related concepts. Built on a Wikipedia-based retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, it generates large-scale multiple-choice question datasets at varying semantic distances from target knowledge. When applied to evaluate eight state-of-the-art unlearning methods on Llama3-8b-Instruct, the study finds that all methods exhibit non-trivial accuracy degradation extending well beyond immediate forget-set targets, with distinct propagation profiles for each method. The findings suggest that current unlearning evaluations may significantly underestimate the breadth of knowledge modification, highlighting the need for more comprehensive ripple-effect assessment.

## Method Summary
The RippleBench-Maker pipeline constructs a semantic neighborhood around each target concept using WikiRAG (FAISS-based vector index over Wikipedia embeddings). For each target, it retrieves 1000 semantically related topics and uses RAG rank as an ordinal distance metric. An LLM extracts factual statements from retrieved Wikipedia articles, which another LLM converts into five multiple-choice questions per topic. This automated process generates 352,961 questions across 70,706 topics in RippleBench-Bio. The framework measures ripple effects by computing knowledge-delta (performance difference between base and edited models) as a function of semantic distance, enabling systematic evaluation of how unlearning interventions propagate through model representations.

## Key Results
- All eight tested unlearning methods show significant accuracy drops on topics increasingly distant from unlearned knowledge, with distinct propagation profiles for each method.
- Accuracy generally recovers with increasing semantic distance, though residual degradation remains visible even past distance 50.
- Reported unlearning performance on WMDP-Bio often does not generalize to semantically related concepts, suggesting current benchmarks underestimate ripple effects.
- The generated RippleBench-Bio dataset spans 70,706 topics and 352,961 questions, enabling comprehensive ripple-effect evaluation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Systematic quantification of knowledge propagation
The framework uses retrieval rank as a distance proxy to measure how model-editing interventions propagate across semantically related concepts. By constructing semantic neighborhoods and measuring knowledge-delta at each distance, it captures the systematic relationship between proximity to the intervention target and degradation patterns.

### Mechanism 2: Compositional knowledge storage
Unlearning interventions affect not only the forget set but also representations of related concepts because knowledge is stored compositionally. Removing concept A may affect building blocks B and C, which in turn affect concept D, creating predictable distance-dependent effects.

### Mechanism 3: Scalable automated evaluation
The pipeline extracts topics from source questions, retrieves semantically related Wikipedia articles, uses LLMs to extract factual statements, then generates multiple-choice questions. This produces large-scale evaluation sets without manual labeling, enabling comprehensive ripple-effect measurement.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Knowledge-Delta (∆U)**
  - Why needed: This is the core metric quantifying how much a model's performance changes on a specific concept after an intervention. Understanding this is essential to interpreting ripple-effect curves.
  - Quick check: Given a model with 75% accuracy on topic X before unlearning and 60% after, what is the knowledge-delta? (Answer: 15%)

- **Concept: Semantic Distance Functions**
  - Why needed: The framework depends on defining proximity between concepts. Different distance functions produce different neighborhood structures.
  - Quick check: Why might RAG rank not satisfy the triangle inequality, and does this matter for ripple-effect measurement? (Answer: Rank order doesn't guarantee that distance(A,C) ≤ distance(A,B) + distance(B,C); for this application, monotonicity matters more than metric properties.)

- **Concept: Forget Set vs. Retain Set**
  - Why needed: Standard unlearning evaluations use a binary framing. RippleBench reveals this overlooks the continuum between targeted and unrelated knowledge.
  - Quick check: In standard benchmarks, the retain set is often drawn from generic evaluations like MMLU. What two issues does this create for measuring ripple effects? (Answer: 1) Concepts may be semantically related to forget-set items but still in retain set, 2) Generic benchmarks don't test proximity-dependent effects.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Topic Extractor -> WikiRAG (FAISS index) -> Semantic Distance Assigner (RAG rank) -> Fact Extractor -> Question Generator -> Evaluator
- **Critical path:** Source questions → Topic extraction → WikiRAG retrieval (N=1000) → Distance assignment → Fact extraction → Question generation → Model evaluation → Ripple-effect curve computation
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Rank vs. embedding distance: Rank adapts to domain density but loses absolute similarity information
  - Duplicate handling: Average across occurrences vs. minimum distance or weighted averaging
  - Polysemy: <1% affected but no systematic filtering for terms with multiple meanings
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Flat ripple curves indicate intervention is too broad or distance metric is not discriminative
  - Unexpected spikes may indicate evaluation set artifacts rather than true model behavior
  - Refusal contamination requires filtering to avoid false degradation signals
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate semantic distance calibration by manually inspecting topics at distances 1, 50, 100, 500
  2. Establish baseline ripple-effect characterization by running evaluation on unmodified base model
  3. Apply one unlearning method at multiple checkpoints to trace how ripple-effect curves evolve during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the optimal "ripple-effect" curve (shape) for balancing knowledge suppression and utility retention in specific applications? While the framework measures the curve, defining what constitutes a "successful" or "safe" curve requires domain-specific safety standards that do not yet exist.

### Open Question 2
How can semantic distance functions be improved to account for domain density and polysemantic terms? The current WikiRAG rank function may conflate distinct meanings of homonyms and misrepresent true conceptual proximity.

### Open Question 3
Do current unlearning methods primarily suppress surface forms or erase underlying conceptual representations? The paper observes the effect (performance gap) but the mechanism—whether the model loses capability or just specific associations—remains a theoretical attribution.

## Limitations

- Semantic distance metric assumes monotonic correlation with actual model knowledge degradation, which may break down for certain knowledge types
- Automated question generation introduces potential evaluation artifacts (factual errors, ambiguous questions) that could confound measurements
- Framework evaluates only one model family (Llama3-8b-Instruct) and one domain (biology), limiting generalizability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The framework's core design for measuring ripple effects using semantic distance is methodologically sound and addresses a recognized gap in unlearning evaluation.

**Medium Confidence**: The WikiRAG-based distance metric reliably captures meaningful semantic relationships for biology knowledge, though this may not generalize to other domains.

**Low Confidence**: The absolute magnitude of ripple effects would remain consistent across different model families or scales, and that the specific patterns observed fully characterize real-world unlearning behavior beyond controlled benchmarks.

## Next Checks

1. **Semantic Distance Calibration**: Manually verify that RAG ranks 1, 10, 50, and 100 for 20 randomly selected seed concepts actually reflect meaningful semantic relatedness according to domain experts.

2. **Question Quality Audit**: Sample 100 generated questions for factual accuracy and clarity, comparing against gold-standard evaluations to quantify potential noise in the measurement.

3. **Cross-Model Generalization**: Apply the same evaluation pipeline to at least two different model architectures (e.g., Mistral or Qwen) to test whether ripple-effect patterns hold across model families.
