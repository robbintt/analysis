# Physics-Grounded Motion Forecasting via Equation Discovery for Trajectory-Guided Image-to-Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06830
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06830
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Neuro-symbolic framework combining symbolic regression with trajectory-guided video generation achieves TED score 0.87 and MSE 1.36 on spring-mass systems, outperforming baselines like LaSR (TED 0.56, MSE 1.91) and PySR (TED 0.55, MSE 2.73)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework for physics-grounded motion forecasting in trajectory-guided image-to-video generation. The approach extracts object trajectories from input videos, uses retrieval-augmented symbolic regression (ReSR) to discover governing equations of motion, and then forecasts physically accurate future trajectories to guide video generation without fine-tuning existing models. Evaluated on seven classical mechanics scenarios including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectiles, the method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and produces videos with significantly better physical alignment than baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework extracts object motion trajectories from input videos using CoTracker, then employs a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism (ReSR) to enhance symbolic regression. ReSR retrieves structurally similar equations from a curated bank using Normalized Dynamic Time Warping (N-DTW) and initializes the evolutionary search with these priors. The discovered equations forecast future trajectories, which then guide existing trajectory-conditioned I2V models (like Tora or Kling) to generate physically consistent videos. The approach is modular and model-agnostic, separating motion reasoning from rendering to ensure temporal consistency and physical validity.

## Key Results
- ReSR achieves symbolic similarity (TED) scores of 0.87 and trajectory error (MSE) of 1.36 on spring-mass systems
- Outperforms baselines: LaSR (TED 0.56, MSE 1.91) and PySR (TED 0.55, MSE 2.73)
- Successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations across 7 classical mechanics scenarios
- Improves physical alignment of generated videos without requiring fine-tuning of existing models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Retrieval-Augmented Equation Search (ReSR)
Standard symbolic regression suffers from slow convergence due to searching vast mathematical spaces from random initialization. ReSR mitigates this by constructing an equation bank and retrieving structurally similar equations using N-DTW. By seeding the evolutionary population with these priors, the search begins in a subspace closer to the optimal solution. The framework assumes the underlying physics is sufficiently approximated by known classical mechanics equations in the bank. Break condition: If the system encounters novel physical phenomena not represented in the equation bank and random exploration is suppressed, the model may fail to discover the correct governing law.

### Mechanism 2: Decoupled Trajectory Forecasting
Video generation models typically learn statistical correlations between frames, often failing to enforce physical laws. This framework decouples "motion reasoning" from "rendering" by first mapping time to position via a precise analytical function and then using the resulting trajectory as a hard control signal for the video generator. This forces the visual output to adhere to the predicted physics. The approach assumes standard trajectory-guided I2V models are capable of high-fidelity visual generation provided the control signal is physically correct. Break condition: If the I2V model has poor control faithfulness and ignores the trajectory condition in favor of training priors, even perfectly calculated physics will result in visually implausible video.

### Mechanism 3: Shape-Biased Trajectory Retrieval (N-DTW)
Raw pixel trajectories vary in amplitude and spatial location. Standard DTW fails to match trajectories with different scales or offsets. N-DTW normalizes trajectories for scale and offset before retrieval, allowing identification of functional forms independent of visual position. This ensures the SR algorithm receives the correct structural prior rather than a misleading spatial prior. The assumption is that the structural form of the motion is the primary predictor of the physical law, while absolute position is irrelevant context. Break condition: If normalization strips away essential information such as distinct boundary conditions or amplitude-dependent nonlinearities, the retrieved priors will be sub-optimal.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Symbolic Regression (SR)**
  - Why needed: Unlike neural networks which learn weights, SR learns the actual mathematical equation (e.g., y = x^2). Understanding this distinction is crucial because the paper's goal is interpretability and analytical forecasting, not just pixel prediction.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why an Evolutionary Algorithm (mutation/crossover) is used here instead of Gradient Descent to find the equation?

- **Concept: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**
  - Why needed: This is the similarity metric used to retrieve equations. You must understand that DTW aligns sequences that vary in speed or phase, which is necessary for matching observed trajectories to theoretical physics curves.
  - Quick check: Why would Euclidean distance fail to match two identical pendulum swings if one was recorded at a slightly higher frame rate or phase offset?

- **Concept: Trajectory-Guided Diffusion**
  - Why needed: The paper relies on off-the-shelf I2V models (like Tora or Kling) to do the "heavy lifting" of rendering. You need to understand how these models ingest a path (x, y) to condition the denoising process.
  - Quick check: How does the "control signal" (trajectory) interact with the "denoising" step in a diffusion model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Processor (CoTracker) -> Retrieval Engine (Equation Bank + N-DTW) -> Symbolic Optimizer (Evolutionary SR) -> Forecaster (Analytical solver) -> Renderer (Trajectory-Guided I2V Model)
- **Critical path:** The Symbolic Optimizer. If the SR step fails to converge or overfits the training trajectory, the entire future prediction is physically incorrect. Monitor the Pareto front (Accuracy vs. Complexity) here.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Initialization Weight (α): The paper finds α=0.75 optimal. Higher α speeds up convergence but risks "confirmation bias" (only finding known physics). Lower α increases search cost but allows discovering novel laws.
  - Render vs. Simulate: Using a generic I2V model (Renderer) is scalable and visually realistic but physically imperfect compared to a rigid physics simulator.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - SR Divergence: MSE plateaus high; the equation tree grows indefinitely complex without accuracy gains. Fix: Check input noise; increase population size or restrict operators.
  - Visual Drift: Generated video object diverges from the ReSR trajectory. Fix: Increase the conditioning scale (guidance) in the I2V model or switch to a more faithful I2V backbone.
  - Tracking Noise: CoTracker produces jittery input data, causing SR to fit noise. Fix: Smooth trajectories before SR or increase the variance threshold for selecting top-k tracks.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validation of ReSR vs. Random Init: Run the SR component alone on a spring-mass dataset. Compare convergence speed (iterations to reach MSE < 0.1) between ReSR (α=0.75) and standard PySR (α=0).
  2. Sensitivity to Alpha: Sweep α ∈ [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0] on a "Double Pendulum" (chaotic) system to see if high α constrains the search too much for complex dynamics.
  3. End-to-End Visual Consistency: Generate a video using a damped oscillator trajectory. Use CoTracker again to track the object in the output video and calculate the TrajErr between the intended ReSR path and the actual rendered path.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the retrieval-based symbolic regression framework scale to discover governing equations for high-dimensional, chaotic systems (e.g., turbulent fluid dynamics) where closed-form analytical solutions may not exist? The current equation bank is constructed primarily from classical mechanics which favor distinct analytical forms. Chaotic systems often lack simple closed-form representations, limiting the effectiveness of retrieval-based initialization. Successful application to high-Reynolds number flows or chaotic attractors, achieving trajectory errors comparable to those seen in simple harmonic motion systems, would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How does the framework's performance degrade when the assumption of 2D orthographic projection is violated, such as in real-world scenarios with 3D perspective distortion or camera motion? The current methodology maps 2D pixel coordinates directly to time t. Perspective distortions in 3D scenes would project complex 3D motion onto non-linear 2D trajectories, likely confusing the symbolic regression search. Evaluation on datasets like Physion or real-world video where camera intrinsics/extrinsics vary, requiring the integration of 3D pose estimation or perspective correction, would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
Can trajectory-guided video generation models be improved to synthesize fine-grained physical deformations (e.g., spring compression) rather than merely translating object positions? The guidance signal provided is a sparse trajectory of coordinates. The diffusion model lacks the physical grounding to infer structural changes that correlate with those coordinates. A quantitative metric or human evaluation study specifically assessing "deformation consistency" rather than just trajectory error, or an architecture update that explicitly conditions on physical state parameters, would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The approach assumes the underlying physics can be captured by equations present in the retrieval bank, potentially struggling with complex or novel physical phenomena not represented
- Performance on chaotic systems shows significantly higher trajectory error compared to simple harmonic motion systems, suggesting limitations with complex dynamics
- The framework depends on off-the-shelf I2V models' control faithfulness—if the renderer ignores trajectory conditions, physical accuracy fails regardless of perfect forecasting

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: ReSR outperforms random initialization baselines (TED 0.87 vs 0.55-0.56, MSE 1.36 vs 1.91-2.73) on spring-mass systems, and the modular design separating motion forecasting from rendering is sound
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about generalization across all 7 classical mechanics systems are supported, but detailed per-system breakdowns are limited; the physical alignment improvements are demonstrated but could benefit from more diverse real-world validation
- **Medium confidence**: The decoupling approach is theoretically valid, but practical dependence on off-the-shelf I2V models' control faithfulness introduces uncertainty

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization Test**: Run ReSR on a chaotic system (e.g., double pendulum) with varying initialization weights α to determine the boundary where retrieval priors help vs. constrain discovery of complex dynamics
2. **Tracking Robustness**: Add synthetic noise to CoTracker trajectories and measure degradation in TED/MSE to quantify sensitivity to input quality
3. **Renderer Fidelity Audit**: Extract trajectories from generated videos using CoTracker and compare to intended ReSR paths; calculate TrajErr to verify the I2V model faithfully follows the physics-driven control signal
