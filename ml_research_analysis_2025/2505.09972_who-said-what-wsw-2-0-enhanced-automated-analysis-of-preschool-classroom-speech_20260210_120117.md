# Who Said What WSW 2.0? Enhanced Automated Analysis of Preschool Classroom Speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.09972
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09972
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Automated framework achieves weighted F1=0.845 for speaker classification and WER=0.238 for child speech transcription in preschool classrooms

## Executive Summary
This paper presents WSW 2.0, an automated framework for analyzing preschool classroom speech using wav2vec2-based speaker classification and Whisper speech transcription. The system processes audio from worn recorders to distinguish teacher and child speech, then extracts language features including mean utterance length, lexical diversity, question asking, and responsivity. Applied to over 1,592 hours of classroom recordings, the framework demonstrates high reliability with intraclass correlations between 0.64 and 0.98 for key metrics. The approach addresses the challenge of scaling observational studies in educational settings while maintaining accuracy comparable to manual annotation.

## Method Summary
WSW 2.0 combines ESC(wav2vec2) for speaker classification with Whisper large-v2 for transcription. The pipeline processes audio from worn recorders, segments utterances using Whisper timestamps, classifies each segment as teacher or child speech, then extracts language features. The system was validated on 235 minutes of annotated audio from 12 children and 5 teachers, then scaled to 1,592 hours of classroom recordings. Runtime environment uses Python 3.10.16, PyTorch 2.5.1, CUDA 12.4, and cuDNN 9.1 on Ubuntu 22.04.

## Key Results
- Speaker classification achieves weighted F1=0.845 and accuracy=0.846
- Word error rates: 0.119 for teachers, 0.238 for children
- Language feature ICCs: 0.64-0.98 for MLU, lexical diversity, questions, and responsivity
- System successfully processed 1,592 hours of classroom audio recordings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Worn audio recorders combined with egocentric speaker classification improve child vs. teacher discrimination compared to room-level recording. Each participant wears a personal recorder, producing higher signal-to-noise ratio for that speaker. The ESC(wav2vec2) model, trained on child-adult dyadic interactions, extracts acoustic embeddings capturing developmental differences in vocal tract characteristics and prosody, then classifies each utterance segment. Core assumption: Acoustic features learned from dyadic interactions transfer to multi-speaker classroom environments with overlapping speech. Evidence: Weighted F1=0.845 and accuracy=0.846; teacher utterances classified more accurately than child utterances. Break condition: Significant overlapping speech from multiple speakers wearing recorders in close proximity may confuse egocentric classification, degrading F1 below 0.70.

### Mechanism 2
Whisper large-v2 provides more reliable classroom transcription than large-v3 for child speech features, despite both being trained on large-scale audio-text corpora. Whisper encoders process mel-spectrograms through transformer layers trained via weak supervision on diverse audio. Large-v2's training distribution appears better calibrated for high-pitched, phonologically variable child speech in noisy environments, producing transcriptions whose derived features (MLU, question rate) correlate more strongly with expert annotations. Core assumption: ICC differences reflect genuine feature extraction quality rather than annotation alignment artifacts. Evidence: Child MLU ICC dropped from 0.281 with large-v3 to 0.800 with large-v2; WER of 0.119 for teachers vs. 0.238 for children. Break condition: Domain shift to different acoustic environments (e.g., outdoor playgrounds, echoic gymnasiums) may increase child WER beyond 0.40, compromising downstream feature reliability.

### Mechanism 3
Utterance-level alignment between automated speaker classification and transcription enables reliable extraction of interaction metrics (responsivity, question patterns). WSW 2.0 uses Whisper transcription timestamps to segment audio, then applies ESC classification to each segment. Response detection operates on 2.5-second windows following partner utterance offsets, enabling measurement of contingent conversational behavior without manual turn-taking annotation. Core assumption: 2.5-second response window captures pedagogically meaningful responsivity in preschool contexts. Evidence: ICCs between 0.64 and 0.98 for metrics including responsivity; Whisper and expert transcriptions converge on similar response rates. Break condition: High background noise or multiple concurrent conversations may produce spurious "responses" to non-partner speech, inflating response rates and reducing ICCs below 0.50.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **wav2vec2 self-supervised speech representations**
  - Why needed here: ESC classifier builds on wav2vec2 embeddings; understanding what acoustic features these capture helps diagnose classification failures.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model trained on adult speech might struggle with child vocal tract acoustics?

- Concept: **Word Error Rate (WER) and Levenshtein Distance**
  - Why needed here: Primary transcription quality metric; WER differences (0.119 vs. 0.238) directly indicate where pipeline improvements are needed.
  - Quick check question: If WER is 0.238, what proportion of words are correctly transcribed on average?

- Concept: **Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) - absolute agreement**
  - Why needed here: Validates that automated feature extraction produces values comparable to expert coding; ICCs >0.75 indicate good reliability.
  - Quick check question: Why might a high F1 score for speaker classification still produce moderate ICCs for downstream features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio Files (child/teacher worn recorders) -> Whisper large-v2 → Transcription + Timestamps -> ESC(wav2vec2) → Speaker Labels (T/C) -> Alignment Module → Utterance-level (text + speaker + timing) -> Feature Extractors → MLU, Lexical Diversity, Questions, Responsivity -> Validation Layer → ICC computation vs. expert annotations

- Critical path: Whisper transcription quality → speaker classification alignment → response window detection. Errors propagate; transcription timing errors directly affect responsivity metrics.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Large-v2 vs. Large-v3: v2 chosen for better child MLU ICC (0.800 vs. 0.281), but v3 may improve raw WER in some conditions.
  - 2.5-second response window: Captures typical preschool response latency but may miss slower responders or include accidental overlaps.
  - Worn recorders vs. room microphones: Higher per-speaker SNR but increases hardware complexity and requires participant compliance.

- Failure signatures:
  - Child MLU ICC drops below 0.50: Likely Whisper model mismatch or excessive background noise.
  - Teacher F1 >> Child F1 with large gap (>0.15): Check for children with atypical speech (hearing loss cohort noted in paper).
  - Response rates >0.50 for both partners: Probable timestamp misalignment or overlapping speech contamination.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Run WSW 2.0 on 30 minutes of held-out annotated audio; compute F1, WER, and ICCs. Compare to paper benchmarks (F1=0.845, teacher WER=0.119).
  2. **Model ablation**: Swap Whisper large-v2 for large-v3; measure ICC change for child MLU specifically to reproduce the 0.800→0.281 degradation signal.
  3. **Noise robustness test**: Add synthetic classroom noise (SNR 10dB, 5dB) to clean recordings; identify WER degradation threshold where child ICC drops below 0.60.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can child speech recognition accuracy be improved through child-specific algorithmic enhancements? Basis: Performance gaps between automated processing of adult and child speech remain, suggesting the need for new child-specific algorithmic enhancements. Why unresolved: WER for children (0.238) is double that of teachers (0.119), and child MLU ICC dropped from 0.87 in WSW 1.0 to 0.74 in WSW 2.0. What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of child-specific ASR models showing reduced WER and improved ICCs for child speech features.

### Open Question 2
How can overlapping speech in preschool classrooms be accurately detected and transcribed? Basis: The conclusion identifies "handle overlapping talk" as a promising direction for refinement. Why unresolved: Current framework processes single-speaker utterances; overlapping speech in naturalistic classroom settings remains unaddressed. What evidence would resolve it: Extension of WSW 2.0 with diarization components tested on classroom segments with simultaneous speech, showing reliable speaker attribution.

### Open Question 3
Why does Whisper large-v3 underperform large-v2 on child language feature extraction, particularly child question MLU (ICC 0.281 vs. 0.800)? Basis: Table II shows an unexpected performance decline with the newer model version, which the authors do not explain. Why unresolved: The authors selected large-v2 without investigating why the theoretically superior large-v3 performed worse on child speech features. What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis of model outputs on identical child speech segments to identify architectural or training differences causing the discrepancy.

### Open Question 4
How can semantic alignment and complexity between teacher and child speech be automatically measured? Basis: The conclusion lists "measure more advanced constructs of alignment or semantic complexity" as a promising direction. Why unresolved: Current metrics (MLU, lexical diversity, questions) are structural; semantic content alignment is not captured. What evidence would resolve it: Development of semantic similarity metrics validated against expert ratings of conversational coherence and contingent responding.

## Limitations

- Transferability of ESC(wav2vec2) model trained on dyadic interactions to multi-speaker classroom environments remains uncertain
- Choice of Whisper large-v2 over large-v3 creates uncertainty about optimal trade-offs across all features
- Responsivity metric validity depends on 2.5-second response window with limited validation across different interaction styles

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Speaker classification performance metrics (F1=0.845, accuracy=0.846) and their direct comparison to manual annotations
- **Medium confidence**: WER measurements and their interpretation, though child WER of 0.238 indicates substantial recognition challenges
- **Medium confidence**: ICC values for MLU and lexical diversity, but responsivity metric validation relies on limited expert comparison
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to different classroom contexts, acoustic environments, or populations beyond the specific hearing loss cohort studied

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-population validation**: Test WSW 2.0 on classroom recordings from typically developing children to verify the child WER of 0.238 doesn't increase substantially (>0.30) in different demographic groups
2. **Alternative model comparison**: Implement ESC using i-vector or x-vector approaches on the same dataset to quantify whether wav2vec2 provides specific advantages for child speech in classroom settings
3. **Response window sensitivity analysis**: Vary the responsivity detection window from 1.5s to 4.0s in 0.5s increments and measure ICC stability to determine optimal threshold for capturing meaningful teacher-child conversational turns
