# From Arabic Text to Puzzles: LLM-Driven Development of Arabic Educational Crosswords

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.11035
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11035
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct generates 78.86% of Arabic crossword clues rated "A" quality

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an Arabic crossword puzzle generator that leverages large language models (GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Llama3-8B-Instruct) to create educational crossword clues from Arabic text. The system uses a curated dataset (Arabic-Clue-Instruct) containing over 50,000 entries of text, answers, clues, and categories across 20 educational domains. The models are fine-tuned on this dataset to generate contextually relevant crossword clues, with human evaluation showing that 67.5% of generated clues received the highest rating ("A") for quality and relevance. The fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct model achieved the best performance, with 78.86% of clues rated "A". The tool addresses the scarcity of advanced Arabic educational tools and promotes language learning through gamification. The dataset and fine-tuned models are publicly available for educational use.

## Method Summary
The Arabic crossword puzzle generator leverages large language models fine-tuned on the Arabic-Clue-Instruct dataset, which contains over 54,000 clues extracted from Arabic Wikipedia articles across 20 educational categories. The system takes Arabic text, keywords, and category labels as input and generates educational crossword clues through fine-tuned models (Llama3-8B-Instruct with LoRA, GPT-3.5-Turbo) trained with specific hyperparameters (LoRA r=32, α=64, batch_size=128, lr=3e-4, 3 epochs). Human evaluation using a 5-level rating system assessed clue quality and relevance, with the fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving 78.86% "A" ratings compared to 67.5% for the overall dataset. The methodology addresses the scarcity of Arabic educational tools through gamification while providing publicly available resources for further development.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct achieved 78.86% "A" ratings (highest quality) for generated clues
- Overall dataset achieved 67.5% "A" ratings in human evaluation
- Model successfully generated educational Arabic crossword clues from Wikipedia-based dataset across 20 categories
- Human evaluators rated clues on 5-level scale, with "A" indicating high quality and relevance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by leveraging large language models fine-tuned on a curated Arabic educational dataset to generate contextually relevant crossword clues. The Arabic-Clue-Instruct dataset provides structured examples of text-answer-clue relationships across 20 educational domains, enabling the model to learn patterns for creating meaningful clues. Fine-tuning with LoRA adapters allows efficient adaptation of the base models to the specific task while preserving general language understanding. The human evaluation process ensures quality control by rating generated clues on multiple criteria including relevance, clarity, and educational value. The use of Wikipedia as source material provides reliable, encyclopedic content that supports educational objectives while the gamification aspect through crossword puzzles enhances engagement and learning outcomes.

## Foundational Learning
- Arabic language processing: Why needed - Arabic has unique morphological and syntactic characteristics requiring specialized handling; Quick check - Verify model outputs maintain proper Arabic grammar and diacritical marks
- LLM fine-tuning techniques: Why needed - Base models require adaptation to specific clue generation task; Quick check - Compare perplexity scores before and after fine-tuning
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): Why needed - Enables efficient fine-tuning without full model retraining; Quick check - Monitor GPU memory usage during training
- Human evaluation methodology: Why needed - Automated metrics insufficient for assessing clue quality and educational value; Quick check - Calculate inter-rater reliability scores
- Educational content curation: Why needed - Quality of source material directly impacts clue quality; Quick check - Verify Wikipedia article accuracy and relevance

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Arabic text + keyword + category → LLM (fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct) → Crossword clue
- Critical path: Dataset creation (Wikipedia extraction) → Fine-tuning (LoRA on Llama3-8B) → Inference (prompt engineering) → Human evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Fine-tuned Llama3-8B vs larger models (better Arabic performance vs computational efficiency); Human evaluation vs automated metrics (quality assurance vs scalability)
- Failure signatures: English text generation (indicates Arabic prompt issues); Hallucinated clues (suggests insufficient context grounding); Answer leakage in clues (indicates training data problems)
- First experiments: 1) Generate 10 sample clues from test dataset and verify Arabic language output; 2) Run ROUGE-L similarity scores between context and generated clues; 3) Perform human evaluation on 50 sample clues to establish baseline quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the fine-tuned models be effectively adapted to generate alternative clue formats, such as "fill-in-the-blank" clues? The current prompt engineering and the Arabic-Clue-Instruct dataset are designed exclusively for descriptive clues rather than sentence-completion formats.
- To what extent does the tool's performance generalize to diverse Arabic dialects and contemporary language trends? The dataset is derived from Arabic Wikipedia, which primarily contains Modern Standard Arabic, potentially introducing bias against regional dialects or neologisms.
- Can the methodology be successfully transferred to other low-resource languages lacking extensive educational NLP tools? While successful for Arabic, it is undetermined if the pipeline (Wikipedia extraction followed by LLM generation and fine-tuning) is viable for languages with significantly less digital content.
- How can the system be modified to handle interdisciplinary topics that do not fit neatly into the pre-defined 20 categories? The current model architecture and training data rely on fixed categorization, which may fail to accurately label or generate clues for complex subjects spanning multiple domains.

## Limitations
- Human evaluation relies on only three annotators, potentially insufficient for reliable 5-level rating system
- Evaluation focuses on surface-level quality metrics without deeper assessment of actual learning outcomes
- Dataset derived from Wikipedia may not represent all Arabic dialects or recent language trends
- Exact implementation details like sequence length and prompt templates remain unspecified

## Confidence
- High confidence in claims about addressing gap in Arabic educational resources (well-documented scarcity in literature)
- Medium confidence in model performance comparisons (limited annotation pool, no statistical significance testing)
- Low confidence in educational effectiveness claims (no assessment of actual learning outcomes from puzzle engagement)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-rater reliability analysis (e.g., Fleiss' kappa) on the human evaluation scores to verify annotation consistency
2. Perform statistical significance testing between model variants' evaluation scores to confirm performance differences
3. Test the fine-tuned models on out-of-domain educational texts to evaluate generalization beyond the Wikipedia-based training data
