# Do You Trust the Process?: Modeling Institutional Trust for Community Adoption of Reinforcement Learning Policies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.22017
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22017
- Authors: Naina Balepur; Xingrui Pei; Hari Sundaram

- Primary result: Trust-aware RL policies improve fairness and trust when initial trust is high, but organization success suffers; learned-trust models yield most equitable policies via conservative estimates.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the gap between reinforcement learning (RL) policies and their real-world adoption by incorporating institutional trust dynamics. The authors propose a trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities, specifically humanitarian engineering contexts, where trust influences whether community members accept services. They compare three models: trust-unaware (ignores trust), trust-aware (uses known trust values), and learned-trust (estimates trust via Bayesian inference). Simulations show that when the organization prioritizes saving resources, trust and fairness decline. Trust-aware policies improve fairness and trust when initial trust is high, but organization success suffers. The learned-trust model yields the most equitable and trust-improving policies due to conservative trust estimates, though at the cost of organizational success. Additionally, a quota intervention imposed by an external entity can improve fairness and trust when the organization's goals are balanced.

## Method Summary
The paper simulates a humanitarian organization distributing services to a community network of 15 nodes over 25 iterations. Three RL models are compared: trust-unaware (ignores trust dynamics), trust-aware (uses exact trust values), and learned-trust (estimates trust via Bayesian inference). The environment uses a Christakis et al. network formation model with initial trust drawn from Beta distributions. Trust updates depend on received utility and neighborhood fairness (Gini coefficient). DDPG is used to learn continuous resource allocation policies. The organization parameter c balances resource conservation versus service quality, affecting organizational success, fairness, and trust outcomes.

## Key Results
- When organization prioritizes saving resources (high c), trust and fairness decline significantly
- Trust-aware policies improve fairness and trust when initial trust is high, but reduce organizational success
- Learned-trust model produces most equitable and trust-improving policies due to conservative trust estimates
- External quota interventions can improve fairness and trust when organization goals are balanced

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Trust-Gated Adoption
- **Claim:** Resource allocation policies fail if they treat adoption as deterministic rather than probabilistic based on institutional trust.
- **Mechanism:** Citizens act as stochastic agents. At each timestep $i$, a citizen $v$ accepts a service $s_v$ only if a Bernoulli trial with probability $\tau_v$ (current trust) succeeds. If trust is low ($\tau_v \to 0$), high-quality resources allocated to $v$ result in zero utility because the service is refused.
- **Core assumption:** The paper assumes that refusal to comply is the primary failure mode, rather than malicious compliance or negotiation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "without institutional trust, citizens will not follow policies put in place by governments."
  - [section 4.3, Algorithm 1] `trust_v ← True with probability τ_v`
- **Break condition:** If citizens are coerced or have no alternative but to accept, the probabilistic gate fails.

### Mechanism 2: Local Fairness Feedback Loop
- **Claim:** Trust dynamics are driven by relative perceived fairness, causing network position to dictate policy outcomes.
- **Mechanism:** Trust updates are a weighted sum of prior trust and "social influence." Influence combines personal utility ($u_v$) and neighborhood fairness (1 - Gini coefficient). If a node $v$ sees neighbors receiving higher utility, perceived fairness drops, reducing trust for the next iteration.
- **Core assumption:** Citizens have perfect visibility of their immediate neighbors' utility to calculate the Gini coefficient.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.3] "trust update is a linear combination of the utility received... and the perceived fairness of each citizen's neighborhood."
  - [section 7.4] "larger network structures form... more difficult for the RL agent to learn policies that will not erode trust."
- **Break condition:** If the network is disconnected or information flow is restricted, local fairness signals break.

### Mechanism 3: Conservative Estimation Induces Equity
- **Claim:** When exact trust is private, using Bayesian estimates creates "conservative" policies that sacrifice organizational efficiency for community fairness.
- **Mechanism:** In the "Learned-Trust" model, the agent infers trust from binary accept/reject signals. By modeling trust as Beta distributions (initialized flat), the agent avoids extreme trust estimates early on. This prevents the agent from ruthlessly exploiting high-trust nodes or abandoning low-trust nodes, effectively acting as a regularizer for fairness.
- **Core assumption:** Conservative estimates force the agent to "hedge bets," resulting in wider service distribution.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Conservative trust estimates... improve fairness and average community trust, though organizational success may suffer."
  - [section 6.2] "the learned-trust model is able to better overcome the sharp dip in fairness... due to more equitable distribution."
- **Break condition:** If the reward function penalizes inefficiency too heavily, the agent might abandon conservative estimates to maximize short-term utility.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses DDPG to handle continuous action spaces (allocating variable resource quality $s_v$ across a vector of citizens).
  - **Quick check question:** How does the "Actor" network propose a continuous action vector, and how does the "Critic" evaluate it given the state (Trust + Network)?

- **Concept: Bayesian Inference (Beta-Bernoulli)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the math behind the "Learned-Trust" model, updating probability distributions of trust based on binary observations (accept/reject).
  - **Quick check question:** If a citizen accepts a service 3 times and rejects 1 time, how do the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters change, and what is the resulting mean trust estimate?

- **Concept: Gini Coefficient**
  - **Why needed here:** This metric quantifies "perceived fairness" within a citizen's neighborhood, serving as a direct driver of trust erosion or buildup.
  - **Quick check question:** In the context of this paper, does a Gini coefficient of 0 mean perfect equality or maximum inequality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Environment (Network Graph G, Citizen Attributes, Trust Dynamics) -> Agent (DDPG Actor-Critic Neural Networks) -> State Wrapper (Concatenates Adjacency Matrix, Utility Vector, and Trust Vector or Beta parameters)
- **Critical path:**
  1. **State Construction:** Flatten network + trust/utility vectors into state $S_t$
  2. **Action Generation:** Actor network outputs continuous vector $s$ (resource allocation)
  3. **Execution:** Environment applies $s$; citizens stochastically accept/reject based on $\tau_v$
  4. **Update:** Utilities $u_v$ and Trust $\tau_v$ update via local fairness calculations
  5. **Learning:** Critic estimates Q-value; Actor updates via gradient ascent
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Exact vs. Learned Trust:** Access to exact trust (Trust-Aware) boosts organizational success but requires invasive data; Learned Trust promotes fairness but lowers org utility
  - **Resource Conservation ($c$):** High $c$ optimizes for leftover budget (high org success) but erodes community trust rapidly
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Trust Collapse:** Rapid convergence of average $\tau \to 0$, resulting in zero acceptance of services
  - **Extreme Inequality:** High organization utility $U$ but Gini coefficient $\to 1$ (isolated nodes served)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sweep Organizational Priority ($c$):** Run Trust-Aware vs. Trust-Unaware across $c \in [0,1]$ to identify the "uncertainty" tipping point where awareness matters
  2. **Ablate Fairness:** Remove the Gini term from the trust update to verify if "neighborhood observation" is the primary cause of trust erosion
  3. **Intervention Test:** Implement the quota system (Section 7.1) on a learned-trust model to see if external regulation can recover fairness without collapsing utility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the trust-aware RL framework accurately predict community trust evolution when applied to real-world networks with empirical trust data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 8 that their work relies on simulated data and random attributes, and they "plan to collect such a dataset ourselves in the future... to interrogate the assumptions made in this paper."
- Why unresolved: The current study lacks empirical datasets describing institutional trust at the node level in communities receiving services.
- Evidence to resolve: Results from applying the model to a collected dataset involving local organizations and communities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the empirically validated coefficients and factors for a realistic trust update model in this context?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section 8, the authors note a need to "conduct interviews with human subjects to better understand reasonable values for these coefficients, and interrogate whether these are the correct factors to include for a realistic trust update."
- Why unresolved: The current model uses a linear combination of utility and fairness with arbitrarily chosen weights ($\lambda=0.8, \delta=0.5$) rather than data-derived values.
- Evidence to resolve: Interview data quantifying the relative importance of service utility vs. neighborhood fairness in human trust evolution.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How effective are collective action interventions by citizens compared to external quotas in improving fairness and trust?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.1 and Section 9 mention that "future work could focus on... designing optimized interventions, including collective action by community members."
- Why unresolved: The paper only simulates a top-down quota system; it does not model bottom-up collective action.
- Evidence to resolve: Simulation results incorporating community-driven interventions compared against the quota system results.

## Limitations

- The simulation framework relies on synthetic social networks rather than real-world institutional trust data, limiting external validity
- The trust update mechanism assumes perfect local visibility of neighbors' utilities, which may not hold in real communities
- The learned-trust model's performance depends heavily on the Bayesian inference implementation details (prior distributions, update rules)

## Confidence

- **High**: The core mechanism of trust-gated adoption (Mechanism 1) is well-supported by the algorithmic specification and simulation results showing deterministic policies fail when trust is low
- **Medium**: The fairness feedback loop (Mechanism 2) is logically sound, but the empirical demonstration relies on specific network structures that may not generalize
- **Medium**: The conservative estimation claim (Mechanism 3) is supported by simulation comparisons, but the ablation studies needed to isolate the effect of Bayesian inference are not provided

## Next Checks

1. **Ablate Trust Visibility**: Remove the Gini coefficient from trust updates to verify if local fairness perception is the primary driver of trust erosion, or if utility alone suffices
2. **Cross-Network Generalization**: Run the learned-trust model on networks generated with different parameters (varying density, clustering) to test robustness of the conservative estimation effect
3. **Intervention Timing Sensitivity**: Test when the quota intervention is most effective by applying it at different timesteps (early, mid, late) to see if trust collapse can be reversed or only prevented
