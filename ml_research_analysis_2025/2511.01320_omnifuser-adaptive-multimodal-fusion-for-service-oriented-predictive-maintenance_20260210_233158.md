# OmniFuser: Adaptive Multimodal Fusion for Service-Oriented Predictive Maintenance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01320
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01320
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes OmniFuser, a multimodal learning framework for service-oriented predictive maintenance of milling tools, achieving around 8-10% lower MSE/MAE in force signal forecasting and about 2% higher accuracy in tool-state classification compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces OmniFuser, a multimodal learning framework designed for predictive maintenance in industrial milling processes. The core innovation is a contamination-free cross-modal fusion (C2F) mechanism that disentangles shared and modality-specific features from visual tool images and sensor data, enabling clean cross-modal interaction. A recursive refinement pathway stabilizes fusion dynamics and improves prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, establishing OmniFuser as a reliable component for intelligent industrial maintenance services.

## Method Summary
OmniFuser addresses the challenge of integrating heterogeneous data sources (visual and sensor) for predictive maintenance by employing a contamination-free cross-modal fusion mechanism. The method decomposes each modality into shared and private components via orthogonal projection, applies cross-modal attention on shared components (using proxy-based landmarks for efficiency), and enhances private components with modality-specific attention. A recursive refinement pathway iteratively fuses information while anchoring to original features to prevent information drift. The framework is trained for dual tasks: forecasting cutting forces and classifying tool wear states, using datasets collected from real milling operations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 8-10% lower MSE and MAE in force signal forecasting compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- Improves tool-state classification accuracy by approximately 2% over competing methods
- Demonstrates consistent performance gains across different forecasting horizons and tool conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Orthogonal Decomposition for Information Separation
The C2F module projects each modality into a shared subspace and computes the modality-private component via orthogonal projection, satisfying P_m ⊥ S_m. Theorem 1 shows I(Z_r; Z_i) ≥ I(S_r; S_i), so cross-modal information is retained in shared components while private components keep modality-unique cues. This prevents contamination during fusion. Break condition: Poor projection matrix learning (e.g., due to insufficient data) can lead to misalignment with true cross-modal structure and information loss.

### Mechanism 2: Proxy-Based Cross-Modal Attention (PCMA)
PCMA uses Adaptive Landmark Selection (ALS) to construct k << T landmarks per modality via soft-weighted aggregation. Cross-modal messages are computed using the other modality's landmarks, reducing complexity from O(T²d) to O(Tkd). Theorem 2 bounds approximation error proportionally to √(T/k). This preserves dominant cross-modal interactions while improving efficiency. Break condition: If attention is not low-rank or ALS fails to select representative tokens, approximation error grows.

### Mechanism 3: Recursive Refinement with Anchored Features
The fused representation is iteratively refined by re-injecting original modality features via projection: Ẑ^(r) = G(Z_r + P_r(Ẑ^(r-1)), Z_i + P_i(Ẑ^(r-1))). This residual-style anchoring prevents drift and retains sensitivity to long-term degradation. Break condition: If projection layers P_r, P_i are too strong or too weak, refinement may overfit noise or under-utilize fused features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Orthogonal Projection for Information Separation**
  - Why needed here: To disentangle shared and private subspaces without cross-contamination, essential for clean fusion
  - Quick check question: Given two vectors a and b, compute the component of a orthogonal to b

- **Concept: Mutual Information Lower Bound**
  - Why needed here: To theoretically justify that shared components retain necessary cross-modal dependencies
  - Quick check question: Explain why I(f(X); g(Y)) ≤ I(X; Y) for deterministic functions f, g

- **Concept: Low-Rank Attention Approximation**
  - Why needed here: To understand how PCMA reduces complexity while preserving fidelity
  - Quick check question: Describe how selecting k representative tokens approximates the full attention matrix

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Preprocessing & Feature Extraction (MRTE + EfficientNet + GAT) -> C2F Fusion (shared/private decomposition + PCMA + MHA + hybrid gating + low-rank projection) -> Recursive Refinement (multiple C2F passes with anchored features) -> Prediction Heads (regression + classification)

- **Critical path**: 1) Align sensor and image modalities via replication within cutting passes, 2) Extract temporal features via MRTE and spatial features via EfficientNet+GAT, 3) Decompose each modality into shared and private components, 4) Apply PCMA on shared components and MHA on private components, 5) Fuse via hybrid gating and low-rank projection, 6) Recursively refine by re-injecting original features, 7) Output predictions via task-specific heads

- **Design tradeoffs**: Landmark count k (higher k increases fidelity but raises complexity, k=4 optimal on Mudestreda), refinement iterations n (more iterations stabilize but increase compute, n=2 used), hybrid gate coefficient α (balances global linear and local convolution, initialized at 0.5)

- **Failure signatures**: Ablation w/o-RR shows significant MSE increase due to loss of residual anchoring, w/o-MRTE causes degradation from inability to capture multi-resolution temporal patterns, w/o-C2F results in substantial accuracy loss from missing cross-modal interaction, missing modality at inference shows graceful degradation if trained with modality dropout

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison: Run OmniFuser vs. unimodal and multimodal baselines on MATWI and Mudestreda for forecasting (MSE/MAE) and classification (Accuracy/F1), 2) Ablation study: Remove each core component (RR, MRTE, C2F sub-modules) and measure MSE impact to validate contribution, 3) Cross-modal attention analysis: Visualize PCMA heatmaps to confirm dynamic attention allocation across time and landmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can OmniFuser be effectively compressed into lightweight variants for real-time edge deployment on industrial hardware with constrained computational resources? While the paper states future work will focus on scaling OmniFuser into lightweight variants, the current evaluation uses a high-performance NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, and computational cost analysis does not explore model compression techniques or actual inference latency on edge devices.

### Open Question 2
Does the C2F mechanism generalize to other predictive maintenance domains, such as bearing monitoring or turbine inspection, without extensive architectural re-tuning? The framework claims to serve as a reusable maintenance service module for other equipment, but experiments are restricted to milling tools. The Multi-Resolution Temporal Extractor (MRTE) is tuned for cutting-force periodicities, and it's unclear if fusion dynamics hold for different signal types or visual patterns.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does the model's performance depend on the heuristic image replication strategy used to synchronize low-frequency visual data with high-frequency sensor streams? While a control experiment halving the image update frequency showed negligible change, the robustness of this static alignment against potential label noise or rapidly degrading tool states has not been fully quantified.

## Limitations
- The orthogonal projection assumption requires learned projection matrices to align with true cross-modal structure, but validation of this alignment is not provided
- The PCMA approximation error bound is theoretical; empirical verification on actual datasets is absent
- Recursive refinement anchoring relies on projection layers that are not described in detail, making their robustness unclear

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Dataset collection methodology, preprocessing synchronization, overall task formulation (forecasting + classification), reported MSE/MAE and accuracy improvements over baselines
- **Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of the C2F mechanism and PCMA for complexity reduction, as theoretical justifications exist but lack direct empirical support
- **Low Confidence**: Stability and robustness of recursive refinement under varying data conditions, due to insufficient ablation studies and no analysis of failure modes under noise or missing modalities

## Next Checks
1. **Orthogonal Decomposition Validation**: Compute and report the orthogonality metric (dot product between private and shared components) on held-out validation data to verify the C2F assumption
2. **PCMA Fidelity Assessment**: Measure the approximation error of PCMA by comparing attention weights with and without landmark selection, correlating with MSE degradation as k varies
3. **Recursive Refinement Sensitivity**: Conduct experiments varying the number of refinement iterations (n) and analyze loss trajectories and prediction stability to identify optimal n and detect overfitting or drift
