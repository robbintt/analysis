core_contribution: This paper presents the Generative Energy Arena (GEA), a platform
  designed to study how energy consumption awareness affects human evaluation of large
  language models (LLMs). The GEA addresses the challenge of incorporating energy
  awareness into LLM evaluation by presenting users with pairs of model responses
  and their relative energy consumption information.

# The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.13302
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Energy awareness changes human LLM evaluation preferences in 41-52% of cases

## Executive Summary
The Generative Energy Arena (GEA) is a platform designed to study how energy consumption awareness affects human evaluation of large language models. The study collected 694 responses from users comparing different model families (GPT-4o vs GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1 vs GPT-4.1-mini, Claude Sonnet vs Haiku, and Llama3-70b vs Llama3-8b) through a two-step evaluation process where users first select responses based on quality alone, then reconsider after being informed about energy differences. Results demonstrate that when users are aware of energy consumption, they change their votes 41-52% of the time, averaging around 46%. After accounting for energy awareness, smaller models win 75% of comparisons, suggesting that for most user interactions, the additional energy cost of larger models is not justified by perceived quality improvements.

## Method Summary
The GEA platform implements a two-step evaluation methodology where users first rate model responses based solely on quality metrics, then reassess their choices after being presented with relative energy consumption information. The study used MOOC students as participants and focused on single-turn interactions across multiple model pairs spanning different model families. Users were presented with pairs of responses and their relative energy consumption as percentage differences, making a binary choice between the responses or selecting "neither." The platform tracks how many users change their initial quality-based selection when energy information is revealed, providing insights into how energy awareness influences human evaluation decisions.

## Key Results
- Users change their LLM response preferences in 41-52% of cases when presented with energy consumption information
- After accounting for energy awareness, smaller models win 75% of comparisons
- For most user interactions, additional energy costs of larger models are not justified by perceived quality improvements
- The study collected 694 responses from MOOC students evaluating different model family pairs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's mechanism works by creating a controlled environment where human evaluators can directly experience the trade-off between response quality and energy consumption. By presenting the same response pairs twice - once without energy information and once with it - the platform isolates the impact of energy awareness on decision-making. The percentage-based energy consumption presentation provides users with a relative understanding of the trade-offs without overwhelming them with absolute technical metrics. This approach captures the cognitive process of users weighing quality improvements against energy costs in real-time, revealing how transparency about environmental impact influences user preferences and potentially shifts adoption patterns toward more energy-efficient models.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Human-AI interaction evaluation methods**
   - *Why needed*: Understanding how humans evaluate AI responses is crucial for designing systems that align with user needs and values
   - *Quick check*: Can the evaluation method distinguish between quality differences and preference shifts due to external factors like energy awareness?

2. **Energy consumption metrics for LLMs**
   - *Why needed*: Quantifiable energy metrics are essential for making informed trade-offs between model performance and environmental impact
   - *Quick check*: Are the energy consumption measurements accurate, reproducible, and comparable across different model families and hardware configurations?

3. **Behavioral economics in AI adoption**
   - *Why needed*: Understanding how information presentation affects user choices is critical for designing systems that encourage sustainable practices
   - *Quick check*: Does the framing of energy information (absolute vs relative, percentage vs absolute values) significantly impact user decision-making?

4. **Model family benchmarking**
   - *Why needed*: Comparing different model architectures requires standardized evaluation protocols to ensure meaningful comparisons
   - *Quick check*: Are the model pairs selected for comparison representative of the broader landscape of available models?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Interface -> Response Pair Generator -> Energy Consumption Database -> Evaluation Tracker -> Results Aggregator

**Critical Path:**
User receives response pair → Initial quality evaluation → Energy information display → Re-evaluation decision → Data recording → Results aggregation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Binary choice format vs. rating scales: Binary choices simplify data analysis but may miss nuanced preferences
- Single-turn vs. multi-turn interactions: Single-turn interactions are easier to control but may not reflect real-world usage patterns
- Abstract percentage vs. absolute energy values: Percentages are easier to understand but may not convey the true environmental impact

**Failure Signatures:**
- High "neither" selection rates indicating both responses are unsatisfactory
- Inconsistent re-evaluation patterns suggesting energy information confusion
- Low response diversity indicating potential bias in the response pair generation

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test the platform with a small group of domain experts to validate the evaluation methodology and identify potential biases
2. Conduct a pilot study with varying energy information presentation formats (absolute values, percentages, visual indicators) to optimize user comprehension
3. Implement A/B testing with different model pairs to validate the robustness of findings across diverse model families

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Participant pool consisted primarily of MOOC students, limiting generalizability to broader LLM user populations
- Evaluation limited to single-turn interactions without complex, multi-turn dialogues common in real-world applications
- Energy consumption data presented as abstract percentages rather than absolute values, potentially affecting user interpretation of trade-offs
- Binary choice format may oversimplify the nuanced decision-making that occurs with multiple response options

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Energy awareness changes user preferences in a significant portion of cases (41-52%)
- **Medium confidence**: Smaller models win 75% of comparisons when energy is considered, given specific model pairs tested
- **Medium confidence**: Additional energy costs are not justified by quality improvements for most interactions, limited by single-turn evaluation format

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with a more diverse participant pool including domain experts, professional users, and different demographic groups to assess how user background affects energy-aware evaluation decisions
2. Extend the experimental design to include multi-turn dialogues and task-specific evaluations across different domains (technical, creative, analytical) to validate whether findings hold for complex interaction patterns
3. Conduct A/B testing in real-world deployment scenarios where actual energy consumption data is logged alongside user satisfaction metrics to validate the relationship between perceived energy awareness and actual usage patterns
