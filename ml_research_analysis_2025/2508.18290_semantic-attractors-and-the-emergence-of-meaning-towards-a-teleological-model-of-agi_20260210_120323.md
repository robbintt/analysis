# Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.18290
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Key outcome**: Proposes a theoretical framework for semantic AGI using complex-valued meaning spaces and recursive tensorial transformation, shifting from statistical prediction to teleological meaning emergence.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a theoretical framework for semantic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that departs from transformer-based models relying on statistical next-token prediction. Instead, it proposes a model where meaning emerges through recursive tensorial transformation in complex-valued meaning spaces. The approach uses cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit to model rotational semantic structures capable of representing irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. Central to the framework is the semantic attractor—a teleological operator acting as an intentional agent that guides meaning toward stability and expressive depth through gradient flows, tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics.

## Method Summary
The method represents sentences as complex-valued matrices S ∈ ℂⁿˣⁿ, where diagonal entries represent self-reference and off-diagonals represent semantic relations. An attractor operator A is iteratively applied via the update rule S_{n+1} = A(S_n) until convergence (‖S_{n+1} - S_n‖ < ε). Semantic depth is quantified through curvature κ = Tr∇²C(S), where C(S) is a coherence functional. The framework assumes complex-valued rotations can model semantic phenomena like irony and ambiguity through 90° phase transformations, and that meaning emerges through teleological convergence rather than probabilistic inference.

## Key Results
- Proposes semantic attractors as teleological operators guiding meaning toward stability
- Introduces complex-valued rotational semantics to model irony, homonymy, and ambiguity
- Frames convergence as understanding rather than prediction
- Argues for fundamentally new cognitive architecture designed to shape language rather than predict it

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Complex-Valued Semantic Rotations
Multiplying semantic vectors by the imaginary unit *i* induces rotational transformations that model irony, ambiguity, and metaphor. A 90° rotation in complex space maps signifier → signified (i¹), signified → antonym (i²), antonym → inverse signified (i³), returning to synonym (i⁴). This creates a cyclic topology where semantic inversions become mathematically expressible.

### Mechanism 2: Iterative Attractor Convergence
Meaning crystallizes through repeated application of an attractor operator A on sentence matrices S, with convergence indicating semantic stability. When ‖S_{n+1} - S_n‖ < ε, the system has reached a stable meaning basin. This is semantic annealing, not one-pass prediction.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Curvature as Depth Metric
A coherence functional C(S) combined with a semantic Laplacian ∇² can quantify meaning depth via curvature κ = Tr∇²C(S). High positive curvature (κ ≫ 0) signals semantic unity; negative curvature (κ ≪ 0) indicates ambiguity/irony/bifurcation; near-zero curvature reflects trivial flatness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Complex-Valued Representations in ML**: Needed because the architecture presupposes that phase encodes semantic relationships beyond magnitude. Quick check: Can you explain why multiplying a complex vector by *i* rotates it 90° in the complex plane?
- **Dynamical Systems and Attractors**: Needed to model meaning as trajectory convergence toward stable states. Quick check: What is the difference between a fixed-point attractor and a limit cycle in a dynamical system?
- **Teleology vs. Causation in Systems Theory**: Needed because the paper explicitly frames attractors as "goal-directed" rather than merely causal. Quick check: Can a physical system be genuinely goal-directed without invoking backwards causation or external design?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text → complex-valued matrix S → attractor operator A → convergence monitor → curvature estimator → Microvita layer
- **Critical path**: 1) Define C(S) coherence functional, 2) Specify A(S) attractor transformation, 3) Implement complex-valued matrix operations, 4) Validate convergence correlates with semantic clarity
- **Design tradeoffs**: Expressiveness vs. tractability (quaternionic extensions increase power but computational cost), interpretability vs. teleological opacity (attractors "guide" meaning but origin is not inspectable), hardware compatibility (current GPUs optimize real-valued operations)
- **Failure signatures**: Convergence without insight (trivial output), non-convergence (oscillation/divergence), phase collapse (complex values decay to real-valued), curvature meaningless (no correlation with human judgments)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Implement S ∈ ℂ²ˣ² for simple sentences with defined A(S) = rotation + contraction, test ironic/ambiguous vs literal sentences, 2) Run A(S) iteratively on corpus, report iteration counts to convergence, 3) Train human annotators to rate semantic depth, correlate ratings with κ values

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the "Microvitum," described as a non-material, teleological agent, be formalized as a concrete mathematical operator within a computational architecture? The paper describes Microvita as "not learned or programmed" but "given—as subtle formative agents," raising the question of how they are implemented as "generative operators" without relying on statistical learning methods.

### Open Question 2
What specific hardware architectures are required to support the "phase-aware computation" necessary for the proposed iterative convergence in complex-valued spaces? The paper lists "hardware that supports phase-aware computation" as a requirement but does not address physical engineering constraints.

### Open Question 3
Can the proposed "semantic curvature" (κ) serve as a reliable, quantitative loss function for training these systems to distinguish semantic depth from triviality? It is unclear if this curvature function can be differentiated to guide the "form-shaping" process or remains only a post-hoc measure.

### Open Question 4
Does the iterative application of an attractor operator A on sentence matrices S guarantee convergence to a unique, stable meaning, or does it risk divergence into cyclical or chaotic states? The paper assumes a teleological "pull" toward stability but does not provide mathematical proofs regarding basin of attraction conditions.

## Limitations
- The attractor operator A(S) remains mathematically unspecified, making implementation impossible without significant assumptions
- The coherence functional C(S) required for curvature computation is undefined
- The proposed complex-valued semantics assumes phase information captures meaning relationships but this remains unproven
- The Microvita concept as "semantic source" lacks formal mathematical specification

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Mathematical description of complex rotation via imaginary unit multiplication
- **Medium confidence**: Convergence framework as general modeling approach
- **Low confidence**: Specific claim that curvature κ directly measures semantic depth

## Next Checks

1. **Implement a minimal working prototype**: Define A(S) as a complex-valued contraction map and C(S) as a simple coherence measure, then test convergence behavior on toy sentences with known semantic relationships.

2. **Human correlation study**: Recruit 20-30 annotators to rate semantic depth/insight for a corpus of 100 sentences, then compute correlation with curvature κ values from the model.

3. **Phase preservation audit**: During iterative convergence, measure whether phase variance remains non-trivial (σ_phase > 0.1) or collapses to near-zero, indicating loss of rotational semantics.
