# Tooth-Diffusion: Guided 3D CBCT Synthesis with Fine-Grained Tooth Conditioning

## Quick Facts

- This paper presents Tooth-Diffusion, a conditional 3D generative model for creating and editing CBCT scans with fine-grained control over individual tooth presence and configuration

## Executive Summary
Tooth-Diffusion introduces a conditional 3D generative model for synthesizing and editing cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans with precise control over individual tooth configurations. The method employs wavelet-based denoising diffusion with FiLM conditioning and a masked loss function to generate anatomically realistic dental scans. By incorporating tooth augmentation strategies, the model can simulate clinically relevant scenarios such as missing or added teeth, enabling treatment simulations and targeted data augmentation for dental AI applications.

Evaluated on a curated dataset of 98 CBCT volumes, Tooth-Diffusion achieves low Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores of 40.27 on the test set and SSIM values above 0.91 for most teeth, demonstrating high-quality reconstruction and inpainting capabilities. The model shows promising results even in cases with missing dentition, suggesting potential utility for clinical workflows and dental research. While the approach enables realistic treatment simulations, further validation on larger, more diverse datasets and clinical studies would strengthen its practical applicability.

## Method Summary
Tooth-Diffusion is a conditional 3D generative model that synthesizes and edits CBCT scans with fine-grained control over individual tooth configurations. The method combines wavelet-based denoising diffusion with FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) conditioning to guide anatomically realistic synthesis. A masked loss function ensures that the model focuses on relevant regions while preserving background consistency. Tooth augmentation strategies are employed to simulate clinically relevant scenarios such as missing or added teeth, enhancing the model's versatility for dental applications.

The model is trained on a curated dataset of 98 CBCT volumes, enabling it to learn the complex spatial relationships and anatomical variations present in dental scans. During inference, users can specify which teeth to include or exclude, allowing for targeted synthesis and editing of CBCT data. The wavelet-based diffusion approach helps capture multi-scale features essential for realistic dental anatomy, while the FiLM conditioning provides explicit control over tooth presence and configuration.

## Key Results
- Achieves FID score of 40.27 on test set, indicating high-quality synthesis
- Maintains SSIM values above 0.91 for most teeth, demonstrating strong reconstruction fidelity
- Successfully handles cases with missing dentition, showing potential for treatment simulation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of Tooth-Diffusion stems from its integration of several key mechanisms. The wavelet-based denoising diffusion process allows the model to capture multi-scale features essential for realistic dental anatomy, operating effectively across different frequency bands of the CBCT data. FiLM conditioning provides explicit control over tooth presence and configuration by modulating feature maps based on the desired output, enabling fine-grained manipulation of individual teeth. The masked loss function ensures that the model focuses on relevant regions while preserving background consistency, preventing artifacts in non-tooth areas. Tooth augmentation strategies during training expose the model to a wider variety of clinical scenarios, improving its ability to handle cases with missing or added teeth.

## Foundational Learning
- **Wavelet-based denoising diffusion**: Why needed - Captures multi-scale features essential for realistic dental anatomy. Quick check - Verify that the model can generate high-frequency details in tooth structures.
- **FiLM conditioning**: Why needed - Provides explicit control over tooth presence and configuration. Quick check - Test if specified teeth can be accurately added or removed from generated scans.
- **Masked loss function**: Why needed - Ensures focus on relevant regions while preserving background consistency. Quick check - Inspect non-tooth areas for artifacts or inconsistencies.
- **Tooth augmentation strategies**: Why needed - Improves model's ability to handle diverse clinical scenarios. Quick check - Evaluate performance on cases with unusual tooth configurations or missing dentition.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: CBCT input -> Wavelet decomposition -> Denoising UNet -> FiLM conditioning -> Masked loss -> Synthesized CBCT output

Critical path: The core of Tooth-Diffusion is the denoising UNet, which iteratively refines the CBCT scan through multiple diffusion steps. The wavelet decomposition allows the model to operate on different frequency scales simultaneously, capturing both coarse structures and fine details. FiLM conditioning layers modulate the feature maps based on the desired tooth configuration, providing explicit control over the output. The masked loss function guides the training process, focusing on tooth regions while maintaining consistency in background areas.

Design tradeoffs: The choice of wavelet-based diffusion over standard 3D convolution allows for better multi-scale feature capture but increases computational complexity. FiLM conditioning provides fine-grained control but requires additional parameters and may limit the model's ability to generate entirely novel tooth configurations. The masked loss function improves focus on relevant regions but may lead to inconsistencies at the boundaries between tooth and non-tooth areas if not carefully implemented.

Failure signatures: Potential failures include:
1. Generation of anatomically implausible tooth shapes or positions
2. Inconsistencies between synthesized teeth and surrounding anatomy
3. Artifacts in non-tooth regions due to improper masking
4. Difficulty handling extreme cases of missing or malformed dentition

First experiments:
1. Generate CBCT scans with specific tooth configurations and compare against ground truth using SSIM and FID metrics
2. Test the model's ability to inpaint missing teeth in partial CBCT scans
3. Evaluate the model's performance on CBCT volumes from different sources or with varying resolutions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relatively small curated dataset of 98 CBCT volumes, potentially limiting generalizability
- Evaluation based on a single dataset, which may not capture performance across diverse clinical scenarios
- Untested ability to handle extreme dental anomalies or rare anatomical variations
- Computational efficiency for real-time clinical applications not addressed

## Confidence
High: The model's ability to generate realistic CBCT scans with controlled tooth configurations is well-supported by low FID scores and high SSIM values.
Medium: Claims regarding clinical utility show promise but lack extensive validation through clinician studies or real-world application testing.
Low: Generalization to unseen scans is asserted but based on limited testing, requiring further evaluation on more diverse datasets.

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on a larger, more diverse CBCT dataset from multiple institutions to assess true generalization capabilities.
2. Conduct a clinician study to evaluate the perceptual quality and clinical usefulness of generated scans for treatment planning purposes.
3. Investigate the model's performance on extreme cases, such as severe dental anomalies or post-surgical CBCT scans, to determine its limitations in handling rare scenarios.
