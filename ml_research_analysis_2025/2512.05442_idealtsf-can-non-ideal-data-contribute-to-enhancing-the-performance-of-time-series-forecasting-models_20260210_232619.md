# IdealTSF: Can Non-Ideal Data Contribute to Enhancing the Performance of Time Series Forecasting Models?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.05442
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05442
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** Achieves up to 10% improvement over baseline models, especially on noisy or low-quality data

## Executive Summary
IdealTSF is a three-stage framework designed to improve time series forecasting under non-ideal conditions such as missing values and anomalies. It leverages both positive and negative samples through pretraining, training, and optimization stages. The framework demonstrates up to 10% performance gains over baseline models, particularly excelling on noisy or low-quality datasets.

## Method Summary
IdealTSF addresses time series forecasting challenges by employing a progressive three-stage framework: pretraining, training, and optimization. During pretraining, negative samples are generated using stable distributions and multi-scale noise to simulate jump processes and heavy-tailed behaviors. The training stage uses hybrid smoothing interpolation to transform sequences into positive samples, while a pre-trained attention mechanism extracts features. Optimization incorporates adversarial disturbances to enhance model robustness. The approach effectively leverages both positive and negative samples to improve forecasting performance under non-ideal data conditions.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 10% improvement over baseline models
- Demonstrates particular effectiveness on noisy or low-quality data
- Shows robust performance across synthetic and some real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its multi-stage approach that progressively refines the model's ability to handle non-ideal data. By generating negative samples that simulate real-world noise patterns during pretraining, the model learns to distinguish between signal and noise. The hybrid smoothing interpolation during training creates high-quality positive samples that help the model learn underlying patterns. The adversarial optimization stage further enhances robustness by exposing the model to challenging perturbations. This combination of synthetic noise generation, feature extraction through attention mechanisms, and adversarial training creates a comprehensive approach to handling missing values and anomalies in time series data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Stable Distributions:** Used for generating negative samples to simulate heavy-tailed behaviors; needed to create realistic noise patterns that mimic real-world data anomalies; quick check: verify generated samples match target statistical properties
- **Multi-scale Noise:** Applied during negative sample generation to capture jump processes at different time scales; needed to represent various types of temporal irregularities; quick check: test noise impact at multiple granularities
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Employed for feature extraction from transformed sequences; needed to identify relevant patterns while ignoring noise; quick check: measure attention weights on clean vs. noisy data
- **Adversarial Disturbances:** Used in optimization stage to enhance model robustness; needed to improve generalization under challenging conditions; quick check: evaluate performance degradation with increasing perturbation levels
- **Hybrid Smoothing Interpolation:** Transforms sequences into positive samples during training; needed to create high-quality training data from incomplete series; quick check: compare interpolation quality metrics across methods
- **Jump Process Simulation:** Generated through negative sampling to represent sudden changes; needed to capture abrupt transitions common in real-world data; quick check: validate simulated jumps against known event patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Preprocessing -> Negative Sample Generation -> Hybrid Smoothing Interpolation -> Attention Feature Extraction -> Adversarial Optimization -> Forecasting Model

**Critical Path:** Negative Sample Generation -> Hybrid Smoothing Interpolation -> Attention Feature Extraction -> Forecasting Model

**Design Tradeoffs:** The three-stage framework adds computational overhead but provides systematic handling of non-ideal data through progressive refinement. The use of negative sampling requires careful parameter tuning to avoid introducing unrealistic noise patterns, while the adversarial optimization stage balances between robustness enhancement and potential overfitting to perturbations.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on extremely high missingness rates (>50%), failure to generalize to non-stationary noise distributions not represented in synthetic data, excessive computational overhead during training making it impractical for real-time applications.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Compare forecasting accuracy on synthetic data with controlled missingness rates (10%, 25%, 50%) against baseline models
2. Evaluate computational efficiency by measuring training and inference times relative to standard forecasting approaches
3. Conduct ablation studies removing each framework component to quantify individual contributions to overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily on synthetic data with controlled missingness and noise patterns
- Performance metrics rely on standard benchmarks without extensive domain-specific validation
- Computational overhead and complexity of the three-stage framework not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in the effectiveness of the progressive framework structure and negative sampling utility
- **Medium** confidence in scalability and practical deployment aspects due to limited computational complexity analysis
- **Low** confidence in robustness claims for untested scenarios like extremely high missingness rates

## Next Checks
1. Test IdealTSF on additional real-world datasets with varying levels of noise and missingness to assess robustness across diverse conditions
2. Conduct a thorough computational efficiency analysis comparing training and inference times with baseline models, especially under large-scale scenarios
3. Perform ablation studies isolating the contribution of each framework component (negative sampling, attention mechanism, adversarial optimization) to quantify their individual impact on performance
