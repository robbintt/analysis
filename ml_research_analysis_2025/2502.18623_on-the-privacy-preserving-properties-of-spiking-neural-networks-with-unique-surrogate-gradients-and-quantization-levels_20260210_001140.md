# On the Privacy-Preserving Properties of Spiking Neural Networks with Unique Surrogate Gradients and Quantization Levels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.18623
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18623
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Study investigates privacy-preserving properties of SNNs and examines how quantization and surrogate gradients affect resilience against MIAs, demonstrating that quantization enhances privacy in both SNNs and ANNs with 4-bit and 8-bit precision offering optimal trade-offs

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the privacy-preserving properties of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) by examining how quantization and surrogate gradient functions affect their resilience against Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). The research demonstrates that quantization enhances privacy protection in both SNNs and traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), with 4-bit and 8-bit precision offering optimal privacy-accuracy trade-offs. Notably, the study finds that full-precision SNNs consistently exhibit stronger privacy protection than quantized ANNs, highlighting the inherent advantages of spike-based computation and stochastic encoding in SNNs.

The research evaluates five different surrogate gradient functions and identifies Spike Rate Escape as the most effective for balancing privacy and accuracy. The findings reinforce the fundamental privacy resilience of SNNs and emphasize the critical role of quantization and surrogate gradient selection in optimizing the privacy-accuracy trade-off. These results provide valuable insights for developing privacy-preserving neural network architectures, particularly for applications requiring strong data protection guarantees.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comprehensive experimental approach to evaluate the privacy-preserving properties of SNNs. The researchers conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets, systematically varying quantization levels and surrogate gradient functions. They implement both weight and activation quantization across different bit precisions (4-bit, 8-bit, and full precision) and evaluate five distinct surrogate gradient functions including Spike Rate Escape and Arctangent. The privacy resilience is assessed through Membership Inference Attack frameworks, comparing the performance of SNNs against traditional ANNs under identical conditions. The experiments measure both privacy metrics and accuracy to establish optimal trade-offs, with particular attention to how different quantization levels and gradient functions affect the vulnerability to inference attacks.

## Key Results
- Quantization at 4-bit and 8-bit precision provides optimal privacy-accuracy trade-offs for both SNNs and ANNs
- Full-precision SNNs demonstrate stronger privacy protection than quantized ANNs, highlighting inherent advantages of spike-based computation
- Spike Rate Escape surrogate gradient function achieves the best balance between privacy and accuracy among the evaluated functions
- Arctangent surrogate gradient function increases vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks compared to other functions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The privacy-preserving properties of SNNs stem from their fundamental operational characteristics. Spike-based computation introduces inherent stochasticity through temporal encoding and sparse activation patterns, which naturally obfuscates individual data patterns. This stochastic encoding makes it more difficult for attackers to infer membership information compared to traditional dense activation patterns in ANNs. The discrete nature of spiking events, combined with temporal dynamics, creates a natural form of data anonymization that enhances privacy without explicit cryptographic mechanisms.

The effectiveness of quantization in enhancing privacy relates to information reduction. By limiting the precision of weights and activations, quantization reduces the amount of information available to potential attackers. Lower bit precision creates a form of information bottleneck that preserves essential patterns for accurate inference while removing fine-grained details that could be exploited for membership inference. This trade-off between information preservation and privacy enhancement is particularly effective when combined with the inherent stochastic properties of SNNs.

Surrogate gradient selection plays a crucial role in balancing the privacy-accuracy trade-off. Different gradient functions affect how information flows through the network during training and inference. Functions like Spike Rate Escape that better approximate the true gradient while maintaining computational efficiency can preserve accuracy while the stochastic spiking dynamics continue to provide privacy benefits. Conversely, functions like Arctangent that create smoother gradients may inadvertently increase information leakage by producing more deterministic activation patterns.

## Foundational Learning

**Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**: Biological-inspired neural networks that communicate via discrete spikes rather than continuous values
- Why needed: Understanding the fundamental difference between SNNs and traditional ANNs is crucial for grasping their unique privacy properties
- Quick check: Verify that SNNs use spike timing and rate coding rather than activation magnitudes

**Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)**: Attacks that attempt to determine whether specific data samples were used in training a machine learning model
- Why needed: MIAs represent a critical privacy threat that the study aims to defend against
- Quick check: Confirm that MIAs focus on determining training set membership rather than extracting specific data values

**Surrogate Gradients**: Approximate gradient functions used to enable backpropagation through non-differentiable spiking neuron models
- Why needed: Essential for training SNNs using gradient-based optimization methods
- Quick check: Verify that surrogate gradients approximate the derivative of the spiking function while maintaining computational tractability

**Quantization**: The process of reducing numerical precision in neural network parameters and activations
- Why needed: Quantization serves dual purposes of computational efficiency and enhanced privacy protection
- Quick check: Confirm that quantization reduces information content while preserving essential pattern recognition capabilities

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Layer -> Spiking Neurons -> Quantization Layer -> Output Layer

Critical path: Data input → Spike generation → Quantization → Classification output

Design tradeoffs: The study navigates between privacy protection and model accuracy, where stronger privacy measures (lower quantization, specific gradient functions) may reduce classification performance. The architecture must balance these competing objectives while maintaining computational efficiency.

Failure signatures: Privacy degradation occurs when using gradient functions like Arctangent that create overly smooth activation patterns, or when quantization is too coarse, losing essential discriminative features. Accuracy degradation manifests when quantization removes critical information or when privacy-preserving gradient functions inadequately capture network dynamics.

First experiments:
1. Baseline evaluation of full-precision SNN and ANN performance on target datasets without privacy considerations
2. Systematic quantization sweep across 4-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit precision levels to identify optimal privacy-accuracy trade-offs
3. Comparative analysis of all five surrogate gradient functions to establish their individual impacts on privacy and accuracy

## Limitations
- The study focuses exclusively on Membership Inference Attacks, potentially overlooking other privacy threat models
- Limited transparency in experimental methodology and specific architectural details makes reproducibility challenging
- Claims about superior privacy of full-precision SNNs lack comparative analysis controlling for confounding variables
