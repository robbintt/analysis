# VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.08521
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521
- **Reference count**: 24
- **Primary result**: VISOR achieves steering comparable to activation vectors using universal adversarial images while requiring no model access at deployment

## Executive Summary
VISOR introduces a novel method for controlling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by optimizing universal adversarial images that induce activation patterns equivalent to activation-based steering vectors. Unlike traditional steering vectors that require direct model access, VISOR's images can be deployed in any VLM serving modality without runtime overhead. The method achieves comparable behavioral control (within 1-2% for positive steering) while dramatically exceeding activation vectors for negative steering (up to 25% shifts). VISOR maintains 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks, demonstrating safe manipulation without degrading core capabilities.

## Method Summary
VISOR crafts universal steering images through gradient-based optimization that target specific activation patterns in VLMs. The method computes steering vectors from contrastive prompt pairs using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), then optimizes images to induce these activation shifts when processed through the vision-language connector. The optimization aggregates loss across multiple layers with learned weights, targeting token positions where behavioral trajectories diverge. A single 150KB image achieves deployment without requiring model access, eliminating runtime overhead while exposing critical security vulnerabilities in VLM serving infrastructure.

## Key Results
- Single 150KB steering image achieves behavioral control comparable to activation vectors (1-2% difference for positive steering)
- Negative steering effectiveness dramatically exceeds activation vectors (25% shifts vs. modest changes)
- Maintains 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks across all conditions
- Eliminates runtime overhead and model access requirements for deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Modal Activation Influence
Visual inputs can induce activation patterns in VLMs that replicate steering vector effects without direct activation manipulation. The vision-language connector projects visual tokens into the language model's embedding space, and optimized images produce visual token representations that create activation shifts approximating those from steering vector addition. This assumes the vision encoder and connector preserve sufficient gradient information during backpropagation to enable meaningful optimization toward target activation patterns.

### Mechanism 2: Token Position-Targeted Optimization
Targeting activations at divergence token positions captures decision-relevant context where behavioral trajectories separate. Rather than optimizing all token positions equally, VISOR extracts activations from the last N tokens leading up to τ(p)—the position where positive and negative response prompts diverge. This focuses optimization on the "decision point" where the model commits to a behavioral direction, assuming the divergence position generalizes across prompts.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Layer Aggregation with Weighted Loss
Behavioral control requires coordinated activation shifts across multiple layers with different abstraction levels. VISOR aggregates loss across multiple layers L with learned weights {λl}, with deeper layers receiving higher weights due to their behavioral relevance. The optimization jointly minimizes activation distance at all target layers simultaneously, assuming a single image can simultaneously induce appropriate activation shifts at multiple layers without optimization conflicts.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA)**
  - Why needed here: VISOR's target activations are computed using CAA. Understanding how contrastive prompt pairs produce steering vectors is essential for reproducing and extending the method.
  - Quick check question: Given prompts "You are helpful" and "You are harmful," would you expect the difference in their layer-15 activations to steer toward helpful or harmful outputs when added?

- **Concept: Projected Gradient Descent for Images**
  - Why needed here: VISOR uses signed gradient updates with optional projection to constraint sets. Understanding PGD variants (ℓ∞-bounded, unconstrained) determines what steering images are possible.
  - Quick check question: If optimizing an ℓ∞-bounded perturbation with ε=0.1, what happens to a pixel at value 0.95 after a gradient step of +0.2?

- **Concept: Vision-Language Model Architectures (LLaVA family)**
  - Why needed here: VISOR's token position selection and layer targeting depend on how CLIP ViT outputs connect to Vicuna through the MLP connector. Architectural understanding prevents misapplying the method to incompatible models.
  - Quick check question: In LLaVA-1.5, how many visual tokens does a 336×336 image produce, and which model component processes them first?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: CLIP ViT-L/14 (fixed vision encoder) → 2-layer MLP connector → Vicuna-7B language model → Activation extraction at target layers
- **Critical path**:
  1. Compute steering vectors from contrastive prompt pairs (offline, requires model access once)
  2. Initialize baseline image (random or corpus-derived)
  3. Sample prompt batch, extract divergence positions τ(p)
  4. Forward pass with current image, extract activations at target layers and token positions
  5. Compute loss against target activations (baseline + steering vector)
  6. Backpropagate to image, apply signed gradient update
  7. Project to constraint set if specified; repeat until convergence
  8. Deploy: single 150KB image requires no model access at runtime
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Universal vs. prompt-specific images: Universal images trade some effectiveness for single-image deployment convenience
  - Layer count vs. optimization difficulty: More layers provide finer control but increase optimization complexity and risk of conflicting gradients
  - Constraint strictness vs. stealth: ℓ∞-bounded perturbations maintain visual similarity but may reduce steering effectiveness
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Loss plateau early in optimization: Check gradient flow through vision encoder; consider learning rate adjustment or layer weight rebalancing
  - Steering works on training prompts but not test prompts: Overfitting to specific prompt patterns; increase prompt diversity or reduce optimization iterations
  - Large performance drop on unrelated tasks (MMLU): Steering image affects core capabilities; reduce steering strength or add preservation regularization
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate refusal steering on LLaVA-1.5-7B with the paper's hyperparameters. Measure BAS on the 128-example refusal test set and verify 99%+ MMLU preservation.
  2. Ablate layer selection: optimize images targeting single layers (10, 15, 20) vs. multi-layer aggregation. Compare convergence speed and final BAS.
  3. Test cross-model transfer: apply the LLaVA-optimized steering image to a different VLM architecture (e.g., BLIP-2 or Qwen-VL). Expect reduced effectiveness but measure transfer degradation magnitude.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Cross-Model Transferability: Effectiveness on diverse VLM architectures remains uncertain despite success on LLaVA-1.5-7B
- Prompt Diversity Generalization: Universal image optimization uses 1,024 contrastive pairs, but full behavioral space coverage is unclear
- Security Implications Quantification: Critical vulnerability claims lack empirical validation in practical deployment contexts

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core mechanism of visual input-based steering is well-supported by experimental results (99.9% MMLU preservation, 25% negative steering shifts)
- **Medium Confidence**: Token position-targeted optimization shows reasonable theoretical grounding but needs more validation across diverse behavioral domains
- **Medium Confidence**: Multi-layer aggregation is supported by results but lacks extensive ablation studies on layer selection and weight optimization

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Architecture Transfer Study**: Apply LLaVA-optimized steering image to at least three different VLM architectures (BLIP-2, Qwen-VL, custom VLM) and measure effectiveness degradation to identify architectural factors influencing transfer success.

2. **Prompt Space Coverage Analysis**: Systematically sample prompts from diverse behavioral domains (refusal, bias, creativity, task compliance) and evaluate steering effectiveness on unseen prompt types to identify prompt characteristics correlating with successful transfer.

3. **Real-World Deployability Assessment**: Implement practical attack scenario with standard API interaction to measure feasibility of deploying steering images and evaluate detection mechanisms that could identify steering attempts.
