core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of credal prediction, where uncertainty
  about the true predictive model is represented as a set of probability distributions
  (a credal set) rather than a single distribution. The authors propose a novel approach
  based on relative likelihood, which defines a set of plausible models as those whose
  likelihood exceeds a specified threshold relative to the maximum likelihood estimator.

# Credal Prediction based on Relative Likelihood

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.22332
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22332
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Novel credal prediction method using relative likelihood achieves superior coverage-efficiency tradeoff compared to baselines on ChaosNLI, CIFAR-10, and QualityMRI datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to credal prediction that represents epistemic uncertainty as a set of plausible probability distributions rather than a single distribution. The method defines plausible models as those whose likelihood exceeds a threshold relative to the maximum likelihood estimator, controlled by parameter α. To approximate credal sets in neural networks, the authors propose ToBias initialization combined with threshold-based early stopping across an ensemble of models. Experiments show the approach achieves superior coverage and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining competitive predictive performance and excelling at downstream tasks like out-of-distribution detection.

## Method Summary
The method trains an ensemble of neural network predictors where each member is initialized with ToBias (setting specific bias parameters to large values) and trained until reaching a target relative likelihood threshold. The relative likelihood γ(h) = L(h)/L(h_ML) normalizes each model's likelihood against the MLE. Ensemble members are trained to different thresholds τ_i spaced uniformly from α to 1.0, ensuring diverse coverage of the likelihood landscape. At inference, predictions from all members form a credal set defined by class-wise lower and upper probability bounds. The α parameter controls the coverage-efficiency tradeoff, with lower α yielding higher coverage but lower efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieves superior coverage-efficiency Pareto front compared to CreRL, CreWra, and CreEns baselines on all three benchmark datasets
- On ChaosNLI, reaches coverage 0.85 at efficiency 0.74; on CIFAR-10, reaches coverage 0.80 at efficiency 0.70
- Outperforms baselines at out-of-distribution detection using epistemic uncertainty (max-entropy - min-entropy)
- ToBias initialization with β=100 and M=20 ensemble members provides stable performance across datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Relative likelihood ratio provides a principled, prior-free way to define which models are "plausible" for inclusion in the credal set.
- Mechanism: The relative likelihood γ(h) = L(h)/L(h_ML) normalizes each model's likelihood against the maximum likelihood estimator. Models with γ(h) ≥ α form the α-cut Cα, which maps to a credal set of predictions. Lower α expands the set (higher coverage, lower efficiency); higher α contracts it.
- Core assumption: The MLE h_ML is a reasonable reference point, and likelihood ratios meaningfully capture model plausibility in high-dimensional neural network spaces.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The target of prediction is the set of all (conditional) probability distributions produced by the collection of plausible models, namely those models whose relative likelihood exceeds a specified threshold." [Section 3, Figure 2] Illustrates how α=0.9 around MLE fails to cover ground-truth; lowering α increases coverage at cost of efficiency.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ToBias initialization forces ensemble members to start at diverse points in prediction space, preventing collapse toward the MLE.
- Mechanism: For each ensemble member i, set bias b_{i, i mod K} = β (large constant, e.g., 100) in the final layer. This pushes initial predictions toward vertices of the probability simplex. As training progresses, predictions converge inward, but from different directions—preserving diversity.
- Core assumption: Diversity at initialization translates to diversity at convergence when combined with threshold-based early stopping; the optimization landscape permits multiple distinct paths.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 4] "To enforce this in a finite predictor scenario, we ensure that the initial predictions of the learners correspond to degenerate probability distributions at vertices of the (K−1)-simplex." [Figure 3] Visual comparison showing standard initialization concentrates near barycenter; ToBias starts at vertices.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training ensemble members to different relative likelihood thresholds τ_i ensures the α-cut is well-approximated across its full range.
- Mechanism: Given α and M members, set τ_i = α + i·Δτ where Δτ = (1−α)/(M−1). Train each member h_i until γ̂(h_i) ≈ τ_i. This spreads hypotheses across likelihood levels rather than clustering near MLE.
- Core assumption: Early stopping at specified likelihood values is feasible and stable; the training process can reliably hit target τ_i values.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 4, Algorithm 1] Formal specification of threshold computation and training loop. [Section 4] "This guarantees a broad range of hypotheses in terms of relative likelihoods."

## Foundational Learning

- **Aleatoric vs. Epistemic Uncertainty**
  - Why needed here: The entire method is motivated by distinguishing these; aleatoric is irreducible noise, epistemic is model uncertainty reducible with more data. Credal sets target epistemic uncertainty representation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a single probability distribution captures aleatoric but not epistemic uncertainty?

- **Credal Sets (Imprecise Probability)**
  - Why needed here: The output representation is Q_x ⊆ Δ_K, a set of distributions rather than a single distribution. Understanding convex hulls, lower/upper probabilities, and interval-based representations is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a credal set defined as a convex hull vs. one defined via probability intervals?

- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation & Likelihood Ratios**
  - Why needed here: The relative likelihood γ(h) normalizes against h_ML. You need to understand why likelihood ratios avoid requiring priors (unlike Bayesian approaches).
  - Quick check question: Why does relative likelihood eliminate the need for prior specification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** MLE estimator (h_ML) -> ToBias initialization -> Threshold scheduler -> Early stopping monitor -> Credal set constructor

- **Critical path:**
  1. Train h_ML using standard hyperparameters
  2. Compute L(h_ML) on training data
  3. For each member i ∈ {0,...,M-1}: initialize with ToBias, train until relative likelihood γ̂(h_i) ≈ τ_i
  4. At inference: collect predictions from all members, compute [p̄(y_k|x), p̄(y_k|x)] per class

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - α ∈ [0,1]: Controls coverage/efficiency Pareto front position. Paper suggests practitioners rarely want coverage <0.5.
  - β (ToBias constant): Low values (5-30) reduce coverage; very high values (200-500) cause convergence issues. Default β=100 works well.
  - M (ensemble size): M≈20 sufficient; diminishing returns beyond this.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - All members cluster near MLE → insufficient coverage → check ToBias was applied correctly
  - Coverage stays at 0 for α=0 → M too small relative to K
  - Credal sets unexpectedly large → β too high causing convergence failure
  - OoD detection fails → α too low (reduces epistemic uncertainty signal)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity check on toy data:** Train on small dataset (e.g., 100 samples from known Bernoulli), verify α-cut approximately matches theoretical expectation. Check coverage/efficiency tradeoff.
  2. **Ablation on M and β:** Replicate Section C.2 experiments on ChaosNLI. Confirm M=20, β=100 produce stable Pareto fronts. Identify failure modes at extremes.
  3. **Baseline comparison on single dataset:** Implement CreRL alongside CreWra and CreEns on CIFAR-10. Verify CreRL reaches higher-coverage region of Pareto front that baselines cannot access.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the relative likelihood-based credal prediction framework be extended to model classes beyond neural networks, and what alternatives to ToBias initialization would work for non-neural learners?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 states: "Our method has so far been evaluated exclusively on neural networks... Certain aspects of our method — such as ToBias initialization — are specifically tailored to neural networks and would have to be adapted to other learners. A promising direction for future work would be to extend this framework to other model classes."
- Why unresolved: ToBias initialization exploits neural network architecture (specifically bias parameters in the final layer) to encourage initial predictions at simplex vertices, which has no direct analogue in decision trees, SVMs, or other model classes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation and evaluation of the framework on at least one fundamentally different model class (e.g., gradient boosting, kernel methods) with comparable coverage-efficiency trade-offs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would using the convex hull of sampled probability distributions instead of interval-based credal sets improve efficiency while maintaining coverage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 states: "An alternative would be to take the convex hull of the probability distributions as the credal set, which would generate more efficient sets. Future work may explore the effect of this on metrics such as coverage or OoD performance."
- Why unresolved: Interval-based credal sets are simpler computationally but may include distributions not actually produced by any plausible model, potentially overestimating uncertainty.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of both construction methods on the same benchmarks (ChaosNLI, CIFAR-10, QualityMRI) measuring coverage, efficiency, and OoD detection performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How many ensemble members are theoretically necessary to accurately approximate the ground-truth credal set for a given α threshold?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 states: "It could be interesting to explore how many probability distributions, and thus predictors, are required to accurately approximate this credal set."
- Why unresolved: The ablation study (Figure 6) empirically shows diminishing returns beyond M≈20, but no theoretical bound or principled selection criterion exists.
- What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of approximation error bounds relating ensemble size M, number of classes K, and α to the distance between the finite approximation and the true credal set.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Is there a principled or data-adaptive method for selecting the α threshold based on desired coverage guarantees or application requirements?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates α controls the coverage-efficiency trade-off but provides no guidance on selection; Section 3 notes α "has a quite intuitive meaning" and Section 5 shows performance varies with α, yet practitioners must manually tune it.
- Why unresolved: The Pareto front varies across datasets, making fixed α values suboptimal; selection currently requires trial-and-error or domain knowledge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of an automated α selection procedure (e.g., based on calibration, conformal prediction principles, or risk bounds) validated across diverse datasets.

## Limitations

- **Likelihood landscape assumptions:** The method assumes relative likelihood ratios meaningfully partition the model space, which may fail when the likelihood surface is extremely flat or multimodal.
- **Initialization-to-convergence mapping:** ToBias relies on the assumption that diverse initialization translates to diverse converged solutions, which depends on optimization landscape properties.
- **Scalability concerns:** Computing relative likelihoods across entire training sets via products may become numerically unstable or computationally prohibitive for large-scale tasks.

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The coverage-efficiency tradeoff mechanism is well-supported by theoretical arguments and experimental evidence. The relative likelihood framework provides a principled way to control this tradeoff without requiring prior specification.

**Medium confidence:** The ToBias initialization strategy is empirically validated but relies on assumptions about optimization dynamics that may not hold universally. The threshold-spreading strategy (τ_i = α + i·Δτ) is novel and shows promise but lacks extensive ablation studies.

**Low confidence:** The numerical stability of computing relative likelihoods via products of training set probabilities across large datasets is not discussed. The method's behavior when ensemble members fail to converge to target thresholds is mentioned but not deeply analyzed.

## Next Checks

1. **Landscape analysis:** For a small synthetic dataset with known multimodal likelihood structure, visualize the likelihood surface and verify that relative likelihood ratios actually partition it into meaningful plausible/implausible regions. Test whether α-cuts correspond to intuitive notions of model similarity.

2. **Robustness to initialization variance:** Replicate the ToBias experiments but introduce random perturbations to the β parameter (e.g., β ±20%). Measure sensitivity of coverage/efficiency and check whether convergence patterns remain stable across different random seeds.

3. **Numerical stability assessment:** Implement the relative likelihood computation using log-likelihoods to avoid underflow. Test on progressively larger datasets to identify at what scale the product-based likelihood computation becomes unstable or computationally prohibitive.
