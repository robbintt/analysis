# SOP-Bench: Complex Industrial SOPs for Evaluating LLM Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08119
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08119
- Reference count: 40
- LLMs achieve only 27-48% task success on realistic industrial SOPs, with near-100% tool misselection when tool registries are large.

## Executive Summary
Large language models (LLMs) currently struggle to execute complex Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that demand multi-step reasoning, tool use, and strict domain compliance. To address this, the authors introduce SOP-Bench, a benchmark generation framework that creates realistic, industry-grade SOPs using synthetic data and structured prompt pipelines. The benchmark comprises over 1,800 tasks across 10 industrial domains, each paired with APIs, tools, and human-validated test cases. Evaluations on two prominent agent architectures—Function-Calling and ReAct Agents—reveal average task success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Notably, when presented with larger-than-necessary tool registries, agents invoked incorrect tools nearly 100% of the time, underscoring significant gaps in tool selection and procedural reasoning. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific evaluation and architectural refinement before deploying LLM agents in real-world SOP automation.

## Method Summary
The authors developed SOP-Bench by generating synthetic SOPs across 10 industrial domains, including manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and energy. A structured prompt pipeline was used to create tasks that mimic real-world workflows, each accompanied by relevant APIs and tools. Human-validated test cases were integrated to ensure benchmark quality and realism. Two prominent agent architectures—Function-Calling and ReAct Agents—were evaluated on the benchmark. Success rates were measured by the agents' ability to complete tasks while adhering to domain-specific constraints and tool usage protocols. The study also investigated the impact of tool registry size on agent performance, revealing significant tool misselection when presented with large tool sets.

## Key Results
- Function-Calling and ReAct Agents achieve only 27% and 48% average task success rates on complex industrial SOPs.
- When tool registries exceed task requirements, agents misselect tools nearly 100% of the time.
- Over 1,800 tasks across 10 industrial domains were generated, validated, and benchmarked.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark reveals that current LLM agents lack the procedural reasoning and tool management capabilities required for real-world SOP execution. Synthetic data generation allows scalable, realistic task creation, while structured prompts ensure tasks mimic actual industrial workflows. The inclusion of human-validated test cases ensures benchmark fidelity. However, agents exhibit significant brittleness in tool selection, especially when presented with large tool registries, indicating a gap between LLM reasoning and practical tool use.

## Foundational Learning
- **Synthetic SOP generation**: Needed to create scalable, realistic tasks for evaluation. Quick check: Validate generated tasks with domain experts for realism.
- **Structured prompt pipelines**: Ensures consistency and realism in task creation. Quick check: Compare generated tasks to actual SOPs for fidelity.
- **Tool registry management**: Critical for accurate tool selection in multi-step workflows. Quick check: Measure tool misselection rates with varying registry sizes.
- **Human validation of test cases**: Ensures benchmark relevance and quality. Quick check: Review a sample of test cases with domain practitioners.
- **Multi-step reasoning evaluation**: Captures the complexity of real SOPs. Quick check: Verify that tasks require chaining of multiple actions.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Synthetic Data Generator -> SOP-Bench Framework -> Human Validation -> Agent Evaluation (Function-Calling/ReAct) -> Success Rate Analysis
- **Critical path**: Synthetic SOP creation → Agent execution → Success/failure logging → Tool usage analysis
- **Design tradeoffs**: Synthetic data allows scalability but may miss real-world nuances; human validation ensures quality but limits scale.
- **Failure signatures**: Low success rates indicate gaps in multi-step reasoning; 100% tool misselection with large registries reveals brittleness in tool management.
- **First experiments**:
  1. Validate synthetic tasks with domain experts.
  2. Test additional agent architectures for robustness.
  3. Compare synthetic vs. real-world SOP performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Extent to which synthetic SOPs reflect real-world complexity is uncertain.
- Reliance on human-validated test cases introduces subjectivity.
- Low success rates may be influenced by specific agent architectures rather than fundamental LLM limitations.
- Tool misselection issue may not generalize across all SOP contexts or agent designs.

## Confidence
- High confidence in observed difficulty of multi-step SOP execution by LLMs, supported by clear quantitative results.
- Medium confidence in claim that synthetic data generation can produce realistic, industry-grade SOPs, as this is asserted but not independently verified by domain experts.
- Low confidence in generalizability of tool selection issue, given only two agent architectures tested and results may vary with alternative implementations or domain-specific fine-tuning.

## Next Checks
1. Validate SOP-Bench synthetic tasks with domain experts from at least three industries to confirm realism and relevance.
2. Test additional agent architectures and tool management strategies (e.g., hierarchical or filtered tool selection) to determine if the 100% tool misselection rate persists.
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing performance on synthetic vs. real-world SOP datasets (if available) to quantify the impact of synthetic data on benchmark validity.
