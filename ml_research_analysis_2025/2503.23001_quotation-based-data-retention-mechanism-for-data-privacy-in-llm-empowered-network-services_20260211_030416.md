# Quotation-Based Data Retention Mechanism for Data Privacy in LLM-Empowered Network Services

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.23001
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23001
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: Iterative quotation mechanism maximizes social welfare without requiring prior knowledge of user privacy preferences

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of balancing data privacy rights with network performance when mobile network operators (MNOs) use LLMs trained on user data. Under GDPR/CCPA, users can demand data deletion, but machine unlearning degrades model accuracy and incurs high computational costs. To resolve this, the authors propose an iterative quotation-based price discovery mechanism where the MNO progressively quotes higher prices for data retention and users independently decide how much data to sell at each price. This approach maximizes social welfare without requiring prior knowledge of users' privacy preferences. Numerical simulations show that the quotation mechanism outperforms state-of-the-art solutions (Do-not-redeem, GDPR, and bi-stage pricing) in terms of social welfare, with the server's payoff increasing at the slight expense of user payoff due to more accurate pricing of non-linear privacy utility.

## Method Summary
The method implements an iterative quotation mechanism where the MNO sets an initial price B₀ and incrementally raises it by ΔB in discrete rounds. Users independently compute optimal data supply at each price based on their private privacy parameters (λ_i, d_i) using a concave utility function U_i(y_i) = λ_i ln(d_i - y_i + 1). The mechanism operates in two phases: (1) quotation phase where prices rise until demand reaches zero or target data retention y_max is achieved, and (2) post-quotation phase where the MNO tests whether buying all remaining data at higher prices justifies avoiding unlearning discontinuity. The oversupply allocation strategy prioritizes users with smaller marginal supplies ("minor-sellers-first") to slightly improve welfare. The approach requires no prior knowledge of user preferences and is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations comparing against baseline mechanisms.

## Key Results
- Quotation mechanism achieves social welfare of ~1841.8, outperforming Do-not-redeem, GDPR, and bi-stage pricing baselines
- Server payoff increases at slight expense of user payoff due to more accurate pricing of non-linear privacy utility
- Minor-sellers-first oversupply strategy improves user payoff by ~2% compared to major-sellers-first
- Mechanism converges efficiently without requiring prior knowledge of user privacy preferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Iterative ascending quotations enable efficient price discovery for non-linear privacy utility without requiring prior knowledge of user preferences. The server progressively raises unit price B_t in discrete steps (ΔB), while users independently compute optimal supply q_i at each round. This sequential exploration approximates the integral of each user's marginal privacy cost curve, capturing non-linearity that single-price mechanisms miss. The approach requires no prior knowledge of users' privacy preferences.

### Mechanism 2
Under incomplete information, rational users follow a greedy selling strategy—once they begin selling, they continue in all subsequent rounds. Each user i maintains a subjective probability μ_t^i that the quotation terminates after round t. The expected payoff inequality proves that if selling is optimal at t_i, it remains optimal for all t > t_i. This behavior holds as long as users are blind to server demand and other users' trade records.

### Mechanism 3
The "minor-sellers-first" oversupply allocation strategy marginally improves user payoff and social welfare by prioritizing users with smaller marginal supplies. When total supply exceeds server demand in the final round, the server allocates purchases to users in ascending order of their current supply q_i^t. Users with smaller supplies (who likely have higher marginal utility per unit) are served first, improving aggregate user utility by approximately 2%.

## Foundational Learning

- **Machine Unlearning**
  - Why needed here: The entire mechanism exists because GDPR/CCPA grant users deletion rights, and removing data from trained LLMs is costly and degrades model accuracy.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why exact unlearning (removing data as if never trained) is harder than simply deleting records from a database?

- **Privacy Utility Functions**
  - Why needed here: User willingness to sell data depends on the privacy loss U_i(y_i) = λ_i ln(d_i - y_i + 1), which is concave and decreasing. Understanding this non-linearity is essential for pricing.
  - Quick check question: Why does the marginal privacy cost increase as more data is sold (i.e., why is the utility function concave)?

- **Ascending-Price Auctions / Price Discovery**
  - Why needed here: The iterative quotation mechanism is a form of ascending-price discovery where the market clears progressively rather than at a single price.
  - Quick check question: In a traditional ascending auction, bidders observe competitors. How does this mechanism differ when bidders (users) are "blind"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Server (MNO) -> Quotation Protocol -> Users -> Data Allocation
- **Critical path**: 1) Initialize y_max from server cost model, 2) Set initial price B₀ and increment ΔB, 3) Loop: broadcast B_t → collect q_i^t → aggregate → allocate → update y → increment price, 4) Terminate when demand η_t = 0 or y_t ≥ y_max, 5) Post-quotation: continue raising B_t while B_t·(d - y^t) ≤ C(y^t) - C(d)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Price step size (ΔB) affects granularity vs. communication rounds; oversupply strategy impacts welfare but requires sorting; blind users enable greedy strategy but limit strategic behavior; discrete data units simplify implementation but may miss optimal boundaries
- **Failure signatures**: Non-terminating quotation with small ΔB and y_max → d; zero participation if B₀ below minimum acceptable prices; oversupply miscalculation violating cost constraints; post-quotation deadlock when no price satisfies B_t·(d - y^t) ≤ C(y^t) - C(d)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline validation with Table I parameters to verify social welfare matches ~1841.8, 2) Sensitivity to price step (ΔB) to measure convergence speed vs. social welfare, 3) Robustness to user heterogeneity with extreme λ_i distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the user's selling strategy be modeled to account for the tangible benefits of improved network QoS resulting from data retention? The conclusion states that future work will explore "taking into account users' benefit in their selling strategy regarding network performance improvement." The current system model assumes the user's utility function depends solely on privacy loss and payment, ignoring the positive externalities of LLM accuracy on the user's own service quality.

### Open Question 2
How does the mechanism's efficiency and stability change when users strategically share information regarding their data amounts and privacy preferences? The conclusion lists as future work "extending the model to scenarios with strategic information sharing among users regarding their data amount and privacy preferences." The current analysis assumes users are "blind" to server demand and other users' trades; the authors note that belief μ_i depends on the supply of others, but the equilibrium under information sharing is unknown.

### Open Question 3
What is the optimal trade-off between the price step size (ΔB) and the communication overhead required for convergence? The paper claims the approach is designed "for the sake of low communication overhead," yet Algorithm 1 relies on a fixed step ΔB which dictates the number of iterative rounds T. While Section V evaluates payoffs, it does not quantify the signaling cost or latency incurred by the number of rounds, which scales inversely with ΔB.

### Open Question 4
Does the "minor-seller-first" oversupply strategy maintain its superiority over other allocation strategies under non-uniform (e.g., heavy-tailed) distributions of user privacy parameters? The simulation relies on a Uniform distribution U(0.5, 29.5) for privacy parameters, and the theoretical analysis does not prove that "minor-seller-first" is globally optimal for user payoff. The slight superiority of the "minor-seller-first" strategy might be an artifact of the uniform simulation setup and may not hold if the user population contains extreme outliers in privacy sensitivity.

## Limitations
- Blind user assumption is critical but not empirically validated—strategic behavior under partial market information remains unexplored
- Oversupply handling mechanism shows marginal improvements but relies on heuristics without theoretical optimality guarantees
- Post-quotation phase logic assumes users will sell remaining data at sufficiently high prices, but this depends on privacy parameter distributions that aren't characterized in worst-case scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Social welfare improvement over baseline mechanisms (supported by simulation results)
- **Medium confidence**: Greedy selling strategy optimality (theoretical derivation present but behavioral assumptions untested)
- **Low confidence**: Minor-sellers-first strategy's superiority (empirical results show minimal improvement)

## Next Checks

1. Test mechanism robustness under extreme privacy parameter distributions (e.g., all users highly privacy-sensitive vs. all privacy-indifferent)
2. Implement and compare against alternative oversupply allocation strategies beyond the four tested (e.g., welfare-maximizing allocation if server knows λ_i)
3. Analyze convergence behavior when y_max approaches d and the discontinuity in T(y) becomes relevant
