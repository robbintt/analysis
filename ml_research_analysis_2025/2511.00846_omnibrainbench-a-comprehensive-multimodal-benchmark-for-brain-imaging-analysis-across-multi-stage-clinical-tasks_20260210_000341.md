# OmniBrainBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Benchmark for Brain Imaging Analysis Across Multi-stage Clinical Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.00846
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00846
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Evaluates 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs on brain imaging analysis, revealing significant performance gaps between models (best: 66.58%) and physicians (91.35%).

## Executive Summary
OmniBrainBench is the first comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate large language models on brain imaging analysis across the full clinical continuum. Covering 15 imaging modalities and 15 multi-stage clinical tasks, it provides 9,527 clinically verified visual question-answering pairs with 31,706 images. Evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art models, including open-source general-purpose, medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, demonstrate that while models like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro outperform others, they lag significantly behind physicians in complex clinical reasoning tasks, particularly in preoperative assessment and risk stratification.

## Method Summary
The benchmark covers 15 imaging modalities from 30 medical sources, yielding 9,527 clinically verified VQA pairs and 31,706 images across 15 multi-stage clinical tasks. Evaluation involves running 24 models (10 open-source, 7 medical-specific, 7 proprietary) on both closed-ended (multiple choice) and open-ended (descriptive) questions. Metrics include accuracy for closed-ended questions and ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore for open-ended questions, with results compared against a physician baseline achieving 91.35% accuracy.

## Key Results
- Proprietary models like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro achieve the highest performance at 66.58% accuracy, still far below physicians at 91.35%
- All models struggle significantly with complex reasoning tasks like preoperative assessment and risk stratification
- Performance improves with more images up to four, then shows diminishing returns suggesting information overload
- Models show task-dependent performance gaps, with perception tasks being easier than deep visual-clinical integration tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Comprehensive, clinically-validated multimodal benchmarks can systematically expose performance gaps between MLLMs and human experts in specialized domains like brain imaging analysis.
- **Mechanism:** OmniBrainBench covers 15 imaging modalities and 15 clinical tasks across the full diagnostic and therapeutic workflow. This breadth forces models to demonstrate not just visual perception but also deep visual-clinical integration and causal reasoning.
- **Core assumption:** The benchmark's VQA pairs, validated by a radiologist, accurately represent the complexity and distribution of real-world clinical problems.
- **Evidence anchors:** "OmniBrainBench...covers 15 imaging modalities and 15 clinical tasks...Evaluation...reveals significant performance gaps: the top model...achieves 66.58% accuracy compared to 91.35% for physicians."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Task complexity, particularly requirements for preoperative reasoning and prognostic judgment, creates a "visual-to-clinical gap" where even high-performing MLLMs fail.
- **Mechanism:** Tasks like Preoperative Assessment (PA) and Risk Stratification (RS) require synthesizing visual findings with deep, pathophysiological knowledge and causal logic to predict outcomes or plan interventions.
- **Core assumption:** The low scores on complex tasks are due to a lack of integrated medical reasoning capability, not just insufficient training data for those specific task types.
- **Evidence anchors:** "...all struggle with tasks requiring deep visual-clinical integration" and "all ones fall short in complex preoperative reasoning, revealing a critical visual-to-clinical gap."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multi-image reasoning capability shows diminishing returns beyond a small number of input images, suggesting current MLLM architectures struggle with information overload or long-context integration.
- **Mechanism:** Evaluation on VQA pairs with varying image counts shows performance peaks at four images and declines with more, suggesting models can integrate information from a few visuals effectively but may lose focus when processing larger sequences.
- **Core assumption:** The performance curve is due to architectural or attention mechanism limitations in handling multiple images, not the inherent irrelevance of additional images in the test cases.
- **Evidence anchors:** "Performance generally improves with more images, peaking at four images...Diminishing or declining returns beyond four images: it indicates potential information overload or reduced focus when too many images are provided."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire benchmark is structured as a VQA task. Understanding how models jointly process images and text to answer questions is fundamental to interpreting any results.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how a model like CLIP or BLIP aligns visual and textual embeddings, and what limitations this might have for detailed, domain-specific QA?

- **Concept: Clinical Workflow Stages (AIA → LIL → DSCR → PJRF → TCM)**
  - **Why needed here:** The benchmark is organized by clinical phase. To understand where models fail, one must grasp what each phase demands: from basic perception to complex reasoning.
  - **Quick check question:** Order the following tasks by their position in the clinical workflow and explain the reasoning leap between them: Disease Diagnosis Reasoning (DDR), Abnormal Screening (AS), and Preoperative Assessment (PA).

- **Concept: Brain Imaging Modalities & Their Clinical Utility**
  - **Why needed here:** The benchmark covers 15 modalities. Performance varies significantly by modality. Knowing why a DWI sequence is used vs. a T1CE is crucial for diagnosing model errors.
  - **Quick check question:** Which modality would be most critical for a "Risk Stratification" task involving a suspected acute intracranial hemorrhage, and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Sources (30 total) → Construction Pipeline (Question Augmentation → Data Filtering → Clinical Task Mapping) → Benchmark Structure (Closed-ended + Open-ended) → Clinical Validation → Evaluation Harness (24 models)
- **Critical path:** Data ingestion & cleaning → Clinical task definition & mapping → Physician baseline establishment
- **Design tradeoffs:** Synthetic vs. Real Data (GPT-5 augmentation), 2D Slices vs. 3D Volumes, Breadth vs. Depth
- **Failure signatures:** Perception Error, Understanding Error, Reasoning Error, Modality-Specific Failure
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run a model of interest on the full OmniBrainBench and report breakdown by clinical phase and modality
  2. Manually analyze 20-30 model errors on the worst-performing clinical task (e.g., Preoperative Assessment)
  3. Evaluate a model's performance on a core task separately for key modalities (T1W, T2W, FLAIR, DWI, CT)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question 1:** How does high performance on OmniBrainBench correlate with practical efficacy and safety in real-world clinical workflows?
- **Question 2:** What specific architectural or training modifications are required to bridge the "visual-to-clinical gap" identified in complex preoperative reasoning and risk stratification?
- **Question 3:** To what extent does the evaluation of 2D slices limit the assessment of MLLMs' capability to process 3D volumetric data essential for neurosurgical planning?

## Limitations
- The synthetic question generation pipeline, while validated by a radiologist, may not fully capture real-world clinical reasoning complexity
- Evaluation on 2D slices may underestimate model performance on tasks requiring volumetric reasoning
- The benchmark's breadth may come at the cost of depth per task/modality combination

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The performance gap findings between models and physicians are robust, based on direct comparison on the same benchmark tasks
- **Medium Confidence:** The attribution of low performance on complex tasks to reasoning limitations is reasonable but could reflect inadequate training data distribution
- **Medium Confidence:** The diminishing returns beyond four images is well-supported but may be specific to the benchmark's question structure

## Next Checks
1. Have the benchmark tasks reviewed by a panel of neuroradiologists to confirm they represent authentic clinical reasoning challenges
2. Evaluate a subset of the most challenging tasks using the original 3D volumes rather than 2D slices to determine if performance improves
3. Test whether models with explicit multi-image fusion mechanisms show different performance curves on the multi-image reasoning tasks
