core_contribution: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of agent memory research,
  addressing the growing fragmentation in the field by establishing a unified taxonomy
  across forms, functions, and dynamics. The paper categorizes memory into three forms
  (token-level, parametric, and latent), identifies three primary functions (factual,
  experiential, and working memory), and examines the dynamic lifecycle of memory
  (formation, evolution, and retrieval).

# Memory in the Age of AI Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13564
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13564
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: A unified taxonomy for agent memory across forms, functions, and dynamics to address field fragmentation.

## Executive Summary
This survey establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding LLM agent memory by disentangling it from related concepts like RAG and Context Engineering. The paper identifies three core forms of memory (token-level, parametric, latent), three primary functions (factual, experiential, working), and a three-stage lifecycle (formation, evolution, retrieval). By mapping existing systems into this "Forms-Functions-Dynamics" triangle, the survey provides a structured approach to agent memory design and highlights emerging research frontiers including multimodal memory, multi-agent systems, and trustworthy memory architectures.

## Method Summary
The survey conducts a qualitative analysis of 40 core references, extracting systems and categorizing them across three dimensions: Form (how memory is stored), Function (what memory does), and Dynamics (how memory changes over time). The methodology involves systematic literature review and classification rather than empirical experimentation, using the taxonomy to identify gaps and research opportunities in the field. The approach focuses on structuring existing knowledge to resolve terminology ambiguity and provide a conceptual framework for future research.

## Key Results
- Memory systems should be evaluated across three dimensions: Forms (token-level, parametric, latent), Functions (factual, experiential, working), and Dynamics (formation, evolution, retrieval).
- The field has shifted from retrieval-centric approaches to generative memory synthesis that creates context-specific representations.
- Integration of reinforcement learning offers potential for autonomous memory management, moving beyond human-engineered cognitive priors.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: The Memory Lifecycle Loop
Effective agent memory requires a closed loop where raw interaction data is processed into structured knowledge before storage. The system operates via three operators: Formation (extracting utility from raw traces), Evolution (consolidating and updating the knowledge base), and Retrieval (context-aware querying). This transforms static logs into a dynamic cognitive substrate. The core assumption is that agents generate information with "potential future utility" that can be algorithmically distinguished from noise.

### Mechanism 2: Functional Separation (Factual vs. Experiential)
Decoupling declarative knowledge (facts) from procedural patterns (experiences) allows agents to reuse skills across tasks while maintaining situational consistency. Factual Memory stores static user/environment states for consistency, while Experiential Memory stores trajectories, insights, and skills. This separation allows an agent to "learn how to act" independently of "knowing what is true."

### Mechanism 3: Generative Memory Synthesis
Retrieving raw memory chunks is insufficient for complex reasoning; agents must synthesize new memory representations tailored to the current task state. Moving beyond Memory Retrieval (selecting static entries), the system employs Memory Generation (synthesizing latent tokens or summaries on demand) to filter noise and align context with immediate reasoning needs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Short-term vs. Long-term vs. Working Memory**
  - Why needed here: The paper refines these coarse terms into specific functions (Working, Factual, Experiential). You must distinguish between capacity-limited workspace (Working Memory) and persistent storage (Long-term/Factual/Experiential) to design correctly.
  - Quick check question: Is your memory component clearing data after a task session (Working), or persisting it for future sessions (Long-term)?

- **Concept: Token-level vs. Latent vs. Parametric Forms**
  - Why needed here: The "Form" dictates how memory is stored and accessed. Token-level is readable/debuggable; Latent is dense and efficient; Parametric is embedded in weights.
  - Quick check question: Does your system need to explain why it remembered something (use Token-level), or does it need maximum compression for long-context windows (use Latent)?

- **Concept: The "Forms-Functions-Dynamics" Triangle**
  - Why needed here: This is the core taxonomy of the paper. You cannot select a storage "Form" (e.g., a Vector DB) without understanding the "Function" (e.g., Factual memory) it needs to serve and the "Dynamics" (e.g., Updating) required.
  - Quick check question: If you implement a graph database (Form), what Function does it serve (e.g., Structured Factual Memory) and what Dynamic operations (e.g., Graph Traversal) must be supported?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Input: Observation $o_t^i$ + Task Spec $Q$
  - Core Logic: Retrieval Operator ($R$) queries Memory Base ($M_t$), Working Memory provides bounded context, Formation Operator ($F$) processes raw trajectory $\tau$ into memory candidates, Evolution Operator ($E$) integrates candidates into Memory Base
  - Storage (Forms): Token-level (Vector/Graph DB), Latent (KV-Cache/Embeddings), Parametric (LoRA/Weights)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define the Function: Determine if the agent needs Factual (consistency), Experiential (skill acquisition), or Working (scratchpad) memory
  2. Select the Form: Choose Token-level (for explainability), Latent (for multimodal/density), or Parametric (for internalized capability)
  3. Implement Dynamics: Build the Formation (summarization/distillation), Evolution (consolidation/updating), and Retrieval (query construction) pipelines

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Transparency vs. Density: Token-level is transparent but noisy; Latent is dense but a "black box"
  - Plasticity vs. Stability: Parametric memory offers fast access but risks "catastrophic forgetting," whereas external memory is more stable but slower to access
  - Retrieval vs. Generation: Retrieval is robust but static; Generation is adaptive but prone to hallucination

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Context Suffocation: Accumulating history overwhelms the context window, degrading reasoning
  - Catastrophic Forgetting: Updating parametric memory erases previously learned knowledge
  - Hallucinated Memory: Generative retrieval creates memories unsupported by actual interaction history

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement a Baseline Token-level Store: Set up a Vector DB for Factual Memory. Implement a basic Retrieval operator (semantic search) to inject user preferences into the context window. Verify dialogue consistency improves.
  2. Build an Experiential Memory Pipeline: Add a Formation operator that summarizes failed task trajectories into "insights" (text-based rules) and stores them. Test if the agent avoids repeating the same error.
  3. Introduce Latent Compression: Replace raw token storage in Working Memory with a compression module (e.g., generating "gist tokens") to extend the effective context window for long-horizon tasks. Measure latency vs. accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can reinforcement learning frameworks enable agents to autonomously design memory architectures that outperform human-engineered cognitive priors (e.g., hippocampal analogies)? The paper posits that fully RL-driven memory systems might invent novel structures superior to handcrafted designs. This remains unresolved as current systems still rely heavily on static, human-defined schemas.

### Open Question 2
How can memory systems be designed to support "omnimodal" retrieval across heterogeneous signals (text, audio, video) within a unified representation? The paper notes that no current system provides truly omnimodal support. Integrating diverse modalities while preserving semantic alignment and temporal coherence remains an unsolved engineering challenge.

### Open Question 3
Does integrating "offline consolidation" mechanisms (analogous to biological sleep) enable better abstraction and resolution of the stability-plasticity dilemma? The paper proposes offline consolidation as a necessary future paradigm to bridge static storage and dynamic cognition. Existing agents rely on online updates, risking fragmentation or overfitting without distinct reorganization phases.

### Open Question 4
What specific architectural controls are required to enforce granular privacy and verifiable forgetting in shared, multi-agent memory systems? The paper argues that trustworthy memory requires granular permission, user-governed retention, and auditable updates. Current shared memories lack robust access control or mechanisms for guaranteed data erasure, posing security risks.

## Limitations
- The qualitative taxonomy relies heavily on authors' interpretive judgments, with boundaries between memory types not strictly defined
- The claim about "fragmentation" in the field is asserted but not empirically validated through citation network analysis
- The survey does not address computational overhead of different memory approaches, which could be critical for real-world deployment

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The foundational taxonomy structure (Forms-Functions-Dynamics) and its core definitions are well-supported by cited literature
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanisms (Memory Lifecycle Loop, Functional Separation, Generative Synthesis) are logically derived but involve some interpretive synthesis
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion of a "fragmented field" and specific prioritization of research frontiers are based on qualitative assessment without quantitative backing

## Next Checks
1. **Classification Consistency Audit**: Take 10 randomly selected agent memory papers and have two independent researchers classify them using the Forms-Functions-Dynamics framework. Calculate inter-rater reliability to identify ambiguous boundary cases.
2. **Empirical Fragmentation Analysis**: Construct a citation network from the 40 core references. Measure modularity and topic diversity to quantitatively assess whether the field is indeed "fragmented" as claimed.
3. **Overhead Benchmarking**: Implement a minimal version of each memory Form (Token-level, Latent, Parametric) for a standard task (e.g., text-based game playing). Measure and compare their storage costs, retrieval latency, and impact on task completion time.
