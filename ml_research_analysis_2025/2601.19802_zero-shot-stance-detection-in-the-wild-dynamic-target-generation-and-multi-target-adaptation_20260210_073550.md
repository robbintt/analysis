# Zero-Shot Stance Detection in the Wild: Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.19802
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19802
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Introduces zero-shot stance detection in the wild (DGTA) task with dynamic target generation, constructing a 70,931-sample Chinese dataset and achieving 66.99% target recognition and 79.26% stance detection F1 with fine-tuned LLMs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel zero-shot stance detection task in the wild (DGTA) that requires models to dynamically identify and determine stances toward multiple targets without predefined target knowledge. The authors construct a Chinese social media dataset with 70,931 annotated samples and design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for target identification and stance detection. Two fine-tuning strategies for large language models are explored: integrated (end-to-end) and two-stage (separate target extraction and stance classification). Experimental results show that fine-tuned LLMs significantly outperform pre-trained models and prompted models, with the two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieving the highest target recognition score of 66.99%, while the integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B attains a stance detection F1 score of 79.26%.

## Method Summary
The DGTA task requires models to simultaneously identify stance targets and determine stances (support/against/neutral) in text without predefined targets. The authors construct a Chinese Weibo dataset with 70,931 annotated samples and evaluate models using a composite C-Score metric for target identification and F1 for stance detection. Two fine-tuning strategies are explored: integrated (end-to-end target-stance generation) and two-stage (separate target identification then stance classification). Models include Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and reasoning-capable DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, with LoRA fine-tuning applied. Prompted baselines include DeepSeek-V3, GLM4-9B, GPT-4o, and Llama3-8B with chain-of-thought variations.

## Key Results
- Two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieves highest comprehensive target recognition score of 66.99%
- Integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B attains stance detection F1 score of 79.26%
- Chain-of-thought prompting improves prompted LLM performance, with GLM4-9B's C-Score increasing by 7 percentage points

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Task decomposition improves target identification by enabling specialized focus
- Mechanism: The two-stage strategy decouples target identification from stance determination, allowing each model to optimize independently for its subtask rather than jointly modeling competing objectives
- Core assumption: Target extraction and stance classification benefit from different attention patterns that interfere when jointly optimized
- Evidence anchors: Two-stage fine-tuning enables greater focus, with Qwen2.5-7B achieving the optimal score of 66.99%; related work on target-adaptive stance detection suggests task separation benefits cross-target generalization

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reasoning capabilities enhance stance detection through explicit attitude inference chains
- Mechanism: Models distilled with reasoning traces learn intermediate semantic relationships—identifying sentiment markers, resolving coreference, and inferring implicit attitudes—before final classification
- Core assumption: Reasoning distillation transfers generalizable inference patterns, not merely surface stylistic features
- Evidence anchors: Reasoning-capable DeepSeek-R1 model achieves F1 score of 79.26% in stance detection, outperforming the Qwen2.5-7B model overall; cognitive inductive reasoning improves zero-shot stance

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Chain-of-thought prompting improves zero-shot performance by enforcing structured decomposition at inference time
- Mechanism: CoT guides prompted LLMs through explicit intermediate steps—identifying entities, analyzing sentiment indicators, and reasoning about stance—reducing premature classification and encouraging systematic analysis
- Core assumption: Prompted LLMs possess sufficient latent reasoning capacity that explicit structure elicits
- Evidence anchors: Introducing chain-of-thought improves prompted LLM performance; GLM4-9B's C-Score increases by 7 percentage points with CoT prompting

## Foundational Learning

### Target Identification vs Stance Detection
- Why needed: The DGTA task requires simultaneous target extraction and stance classification without predefined targets
- Quick check: Models must identify "food safety" as target and determine "support" stance in "I support stricter food safety regulations"

### Multi-Stage Fine-Tuning
- Why needed: Separating target identification from stance classification allows specialized optimization for each subtask
- Quick check: Two-stage approach achieves 66.99% C-Score for target recognition versus lower scores for integrated approaches

### Reasoning Distillation
- Why needed: Transfer of intermediate reasoning capabilities from reasoning models to improve stance detection
- Quick check: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 79.26% F1 score, outperforming standard fine-tuned models

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Dataset -> Preprocessing -> Model Training (Integrated/Two-stage) -> Evaluation (C-Score, F1) -> Analysis

### Critical Path
Data preparation → LoRA fine-tuning (integrated or two-stage) → C-Score computation with threshold logic → Statistical analysis of performance differences

### Design Tradeoffs
- Integrated fine-tuning: Simpler pipeline but competing optimization objectives
- Two-stage fine-tuning: Specialized optimization but potential error propagation between stages
- Reasoning distillation: Improved stance detection but increased computational overhead

### Failure Signatures
- Semantic fragmentation: Incorrect decomposition of compound targets
- Inconsistent granularity: Varying abstraction levels for same entity
- Implicit target detection gap: ~18% performance drop for implicit vs explicit targets

### First Experiments
1. Compare integrated vs two-stage fine-tuning on target identification task alone
2. Test chain-of-thought prompting on baseline LLMs with varying target counts
3. Evaluate performance on explicit vs implicit target subsets to quantify difficulty gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can models be improved to maintain semantic integrity and consistent granularity when identifying complex or nested targets?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 4.6 identifies "semantic fragmentation" where models incorrectly decompose complex concepts and "inconsistent target granularity" where the same entity is referenced by varying levels of abstraction
- **Why unresolved:** Current evaluation focuses on overlap scores which may not penalize semantic drift or granularity mismatches as heavily as human judgment
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Introduction of granularity-consistency metric or fine-tuning objective that reduces splitting of compound concepts

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What techniques are required to close the performance gap between explicit and implicit target stance detection?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 4.5 demonstrates significant performance drop for implicit targets (C-Score drops from ~70% to ~51%)
- **Why unresolved:** While reasoning models improve performance, they still struggle with high semantic ambiguity and lack of surface cues inherent in implicit targets
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Method achieving statistical parity between F1 scores for explicit and implicit target subsets

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can a unified model architecture be developed that simultaneously maximizes target identification accuracy and stance detection F1 scores?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 4.2 concludes that integrated and two-stage strategies each have advantages, suggesting a trade-off between the two subtasks
- **Why unresolved:** Current experimental setup suggests decoupling aids target focus while coupling aids stance reasoning
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Single model fine-tuned with novel strategy surpassing current best scores for both subtasks

## Limitations

- **Dataset construction and annotation reliability:** Chinese social media dataset lacks detailed information about annotation quality control and inter-annotator agreement
- **Fine-tuning configuration transparency:** Critical LoRA hyperparameters are not specified, making exact reproduction impossible
- **Metric sensitivity and thresholding:** C-Score combines multiple metrics with fixed thresholds that may be arbitrary and not well-validated

## Confidence

**High confidence claims:**
- DGTA task definition as novel zero-shot stance detection problem is well-founded
- Fine-tuned LLMs outperform prompted models on both target identification and stance detection
- Two-stage fine-tuning strategy achieves superior target recognition (66.99% C-Score)

**Medium confidence claims:**
- Reasoning-capable models show better stance detection performance
- Chain-of-thought prompting provides consistent improvements across different model sizes
- Performance gap between explicit and implicit target detection (~18% C-Score difference)

**Low confidence claims:**
- Specific threshold values in C-Score metric selection are optimal
- LoRA fine-tuning is the best approach without comparing to full fine-tuning
- Reported standard deviations and confidence intervals are accurate without knowing exact computational infrastructure

## Next Checks

1. **Replication study with transparent hyperparameters:** Reimplement the two-stage fine-tuning pipeline using publicly available models, documenting all LoRA parameters and training configurations to verify the 66.99% target recognition and 79.26% stance detection F1 scores.

2. **Metric sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary the C-Score thresholds to assess their impact on model rankings and identify potential arbitrariness in the current configuration.

3. **Cross-linguistic generalization test:** Apply the best-performing fine-tuned models to English stance detection datasets to evaluate whether the reasoning distillation and two-stage training generalize beyond Chinese social media contexts, particularly for implicit target detection.
