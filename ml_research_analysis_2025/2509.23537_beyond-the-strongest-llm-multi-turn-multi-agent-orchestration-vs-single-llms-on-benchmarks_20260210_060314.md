# Beyond the Strongest LLM: Multi-Turn Multi-Agent Orchestration vs. Single LLMs on Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23537
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23537
- Reference count: 12
- Multi-agent orchestration matches or exceeds single strongest LLM on three benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multi-turn multi-agent orchestration framework that coordinates multiple large language models through iterative proposals and voting to achieve consensus. The system enables agents to either generate new answers or cast votes, with dynamic restarts triggered when new answers are introduced during voting, ensuring all agents reevaluate with updated information. The framework was benchmarked against strong single-LLM baselines across three datasets: GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR.

Results demonstrate that orchestration achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art single LLMs, matching or exceeding the strongest individual model across all tested benchmarks. The system achieves 87.4% accuracy on GPQA-Diamond (vs. 85.9% for best single model), 88.0% on IFEval (vs. 87.4%), and 68.3% on MuSR (vs. 69.6%). Ablation studies reveal that coordination strategies significantly impact performance, with herding behavior accelerating consensus but potentially leading to premature agreement.

## Method Summary
The orchestration framework employs a multi-turn multi-agent system where agents iteratively propose answers or cast votes until consensus is reached. Each agent can either generate a new answer proposal or vote for existing proposals in each turn. When an agent proposes a new answer during voting, the system restarts the voting process with all agents reevaluating their choices, incorporating the new information. This dynamic restart mechanism ensures that all agents have access to the latest proposals and can adjust their positions accordingly. The framework coordinates multiple LLMs to achieve consensus through this iterative process of proposal generation and voting.

## Key Results
- Orchestration achieves 87.4% accuracy on GPQA-Diamond, matching the strongest single model (85.9%)
- System reaches 88.0% on IFEval benchmark, slightly outperforming the best single model (87.4%)
- Performance on MuSR dataset shows 68.3% accuracy, competitive with the top single model (69.6%)
- Outperforms the weakest model by substantial margins across all three datasets
- Coordination strategy ablations reveal herding behavior accelerates consensus but may cause premature agreement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The orchestration framework leverages collective intelligence through structured coordination among multiple LLMs. By enabling agents to propose answers and vote iteratively, the system captures diverse perspectives and reasoning paths that individual models might miss. The dynamic restart mechanism ensures that new information is rapidly disseminated and incorporated, preventing early convergence on suboptimal answers. The voting process creates a natural selection pressure that favors higher-quality answers as agents observe and react to each other's choices. This multi-agent deliberation mimics human consensus-building processes, where exposure to alternative viewpoints can refine initial judgments and surface hidden insights.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent consensus building**: Understanding how multiple agents can coordinate to reach agreement is fundamental to distributed AI systems. Quick check: Verify that agents can reach stable consensus within reasonable turn limits.
- **Dynamic restart mechanisms**: The ability to restart voting processes when new information emerges is crucial for maintaining responsiveness. Quick check: Ensure restart triggers don't cause infinite loops or excessive computation.
- **Herding behavior in AI systems**: Understanding how agents influence each other's decisions helps predict and control collective behavior. Quick check: Monitor voting patterns to detect and mitigate excessive herding.
- **Multi-turn reasoning coordination**: Coordinating reasoning across multiple turns requires careful state management and communication protocols. Quick check: Validate that agent state is properly maintained and shared across turns.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Multi-Agent Orchestrator -> Agent Pool -> Proposal/Vote Generator -> Consensus Checker -> Restart Trigger

Critical Path:
Agent Pool generates initial proposals → Voting round begins → Consensus Checker monitors for agreement → Restart Trigger activates if new proposal → All agents re-evaluate → Repeat until consensus

Design Tradeoffs:
- Agent pool size vs. computational efficiency: Larger pools provide more diverse perspectives but increase computation time and restart overhead
- Voting transparency vs. herding: Revealing ongoing votes speeds consensus but risks premature agreement on suboptimal answers
- Restart frequency vs. convergence speed: Frequent restarts incorporate new information but may prevent stable consensus formation
- Proposal generation vs. voting focus: Balancing between creating new answers and evaluating existing ones affects exploration-exploitation tradeoff

Failure Signatures:
- Infinite restart loops when agents continuously propose new answers
- Premature consensus on incorrect answers due to excessive herding behavior
- Agent deadlock when no consensus can be reached within turn limits
- Performance degradation when agent pool contains too many low-quality models

First Experiments:
1. Test single-agent vs. multi-agent performance on simple tasks to establish baseline coordination benefits
2. Vary voting transparency levels to measure herding impact on consensus quality
3. Compare restart frequency effects on convergence speed and answer accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential for premature consensus when voting information is revealed, which may not generalize to more complex or ambiguous tasks
- Dynamic restarts could become inefficient with larger agent pools or slower models, increasing computational overhead
- Evaluation focuses on correctness rather than reasoning transparency or computational efficiency, leaving practical deployment costs unclear

## Confidence
High: Core finding that multi-agent coordination can match or exceed individual model performance
Medium: Claim that coordination strategies significantly impact outcomes due to limited ablation scope and complex interplay between herding and consensus quality

## Next Checks
1. Test orchestration performance on tasks requiring longer chains of reasoning or multi-step problem solving beyond current benchmark scope
2. Evaluate impact of different agent pool compositions (varying model capabilities, specialized domains) on consensus quality and efficiency
3. Measure computational overhead and wall-clock time compared to single-model inference, particularly under dynamic restart conditions
