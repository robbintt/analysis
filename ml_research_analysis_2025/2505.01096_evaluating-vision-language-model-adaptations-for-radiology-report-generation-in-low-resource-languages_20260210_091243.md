# Evaluating Vision Language Model Adaptations for Radiology Report Generation in Low-Resource Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.01096
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01096
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Language-specific VLMs consistently outperform general and domain-specific models for radiology report generation in Italian, German, and Spanish

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for radiology report generation across three low-resource European languages (Italian, German, Spanish). Using the LLaVA framework as a base, the authors compare general-purpose, domain-specific, and language-specific models to determine optimal adaptation strategies. The research demonstrates that language-specific fine-tuning consistently yields the best performance across all languages, while domain-specific medical terminology adaptation also provides significant benefits. The study also explores how temperature parameters affect report coherence, offering practical guidance for model deployment.

## Method Summary
The research employs a systematic comparison of VLMs adapted for radiology report generation, focusing on three low-resource languages. The study uses LLaVA as the base framework and compares general-purpose VLMs, domain-specific models with medical terminology fine-tuning, and language-specific models fine-tuned on radiology reports in each target language. Performance is evaluated using standard machine translation metrics (BLEU and ROUGE scores), and the influence of temperature parameters on report coherence is analyzed. The evaluation is conducted across three European languages (Italian, German, Spanish) to assess cross-linguistic performance patterns.

## Key Results
- Language-specific models consistently outperform general and domain-specific models across all three languages
- Domain-specific models with medical terminology fine-tuning show enhanced performance for all languages
- Temperature parameter analysis provides insights for optimizing report coherence
- Fine-tuning strategies must balance linguistic adaptation with domain-specific medical knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's findings demonstrate that successful radiology report generation in low-resource languages requires both linguistic and domain-specific adaptations. Language-specific fine-tuning enables models to handle unique grammatical structures, medical terminology, and reporting conventions in each language. Domain adaptation ensures accurate use of radiological vocabulary and clinical context. The temperature parameter analysis reveals how generation settings affect the balance between diversity and coherence in medical reporting, with lower temperatures generally producing more consistent clinical language while higher temperatures may introduce unnecessary variation in structured medical reports.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Model Architecture**: Understanding the transformer-based architectures used in VLMs (e.g., LLaVA) is essential for grasping how visual and textual information is processed and integrated. Quick check: Review the encoder-decoder structure and cross-attention mechanisms.
- **Fine-tuning Strategies**: Knowledge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, full fine-tuning) is needed to understand how models are adapted for specific languages and domains. Quick check: Compare parameter count and computational requirements across fine-tuning approaches.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Familiarity with BLEU and ROUGE metrics is required to interpret performance comparisons, though clinical validation would provide additional context. Quick check: Understand precision vs. recall trade-offs in metric calculations.
- **Temperature Scaling**: Understanding how temperature affects softmax probability distributions in text generation is crucial for interpreting the coherence analysis. Quick check: Examine how temperature values shift word probability distributions.
- **Low-Resource Language Challenges**: Awareness of the unique challenges in adapting models to languages with limited training data, including vocabulary coverage and grammatical differences. Quick check: Compare training data sizes across languages.
- **Medical Terminology Adaptation**: Understanding the importance of domain-specific vocabulary and how it differs from general language use in clinical contexts. Quick check: Identify key radiological terms and their frequency in training data.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Image Encoder -> Visual Feature Extractor -> Cross-Attention Layers -> Language Model Decoder -> Report Generation
- **Critical Path**: Visual input → Feature encoding → Cross-modal fusion → Language generation → Report output
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Language-specific vs. domain-specific fine-tuning requires balancing between linguistic accuracy and medical terminology precision; temperature settings must balance coherence with clinical accuracy
- **Failure Signatures**: Overfitting to training data manifests as repetitive phrases; insufficient domain adaptation shows in incorrect medical terminology; poor temperature settings result in incoherent or overly generic reports
- **First Experiments**: 1) Baseline performance comparison across all model variants, 2) Temperature sweep analysis for optimal coherence settings, 3) Ablation study of language vs. domain adaptation contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to three European languages, restricting generalizability to other language families
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture clinical accuracy and diagnostic utility
- Findings restricted to LLaVA framework, potentially limiting applicability to other VLM architectures

## Confidence
- Language-specific models consistently outperform others: Medium
- Domain-specific models with medical terminology show enhanced performance: Medium
- Temperature parameter insights provide actionable settings: Low

## Next Checks
1. Extend evaluation to additional low-resource languages from different language families (e.g., Asian, African, or Middle Eastern languages) to assess generalizability of language-specific model advantage
2. Conduct clinician-based evaluation of generated reports using blinded comparison studies to validate whether BLEU and ROUGE scores correlate with clinical utility and diagnostic accuracy
3. Test alternative VLM architectures beyond LLaVA (e.g., Flamingo, BLIP-2) to determine whether observed patterns in language and domain-specific performance hold across different model frameworks
