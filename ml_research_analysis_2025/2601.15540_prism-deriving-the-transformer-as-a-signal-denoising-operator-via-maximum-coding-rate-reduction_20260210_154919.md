- Result: PRISM achieves unsupervised functional disentanglement on TinyStories with better validation loss than GPT-2 baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper presents PRISM, a white-box transformer architecture derived from first-principles of maximizing coding rate reduction (MCR²). The core idea is to model attention as a gradient ascent process on a signal-noise manifold, using two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand representational phase space, and π-RoPE (irrational frequency separation) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. Experiments on TinyStories with a 50M parameter model demonstrate that PRISM achieves unsupervised functional disentanglement, with attention heads spontaneously specializing into low-frequency heads for long-range causal dependencies and high-frequency heads for local syntactic constraints. The model exhibits stable training dynamics and achieves better validation loss than baseline GPT-2 (22M parameters), suggesting that interpretability and performance can be unified through principled geometric construction rather than being a trade-off.

## Method Summary
PRISM implements attention as gradient ascent on a signal-noise manifold using MCR² optimization. The architecture uses an overcomplete dictionary (R=2 expansion) to expand representational capacity and π-RoPE with irrational frequency ratios to prevent resonance between signal and noise heads. The model consists of 8 layers with 16 physical attention heads per layer (8 signal + 8 noise pairs), trained on TinyStories with AdamW optimizer (lr=6e-4, warmup=1000 steps, 20k total steps). The differential update Z^(ℓ+1) = Z^ℓ + S - λN with λ annealed from 0.01 to 0.1 via cosine schedule, and step size η = 1/√(R·K) where R=2 and K=8 heads per group.

## Key Results
- PRISM achieves unsupervised functional disentanglement with signal heads specializing in long-range semantic dependencies and noise heads in local syntactic constraints
- Validation loss of ~1.55 surpasses GPT-2 22M parameter baseline on TinyStories
- Training exhibits stable gradient dynamics without the instability typical of denoising autoencoders
- Attention patterns show spontaneous low-frequency/high-frequency specialization without explicit supervision

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Attention as Gradient Ascent on Coding Rate Reduction
The self-attention mechanism implements a gradient ascent step optimizing signal-noise separation, with the softmax structure emerging mathematically from the derivative of log-determinant terms in the MCR² objective. Input representations Z are updated via Z^(ℓ+1) = Z^ℓ + η·∂ΔR(Z^ℓ)/∂Z^ℓ, where the gradient of the rate reduction objective yields attention-like operations. Signal is projected onto subspace U_s (compressed), while noise is projected onto U_n and subtracted with coefficient λ. This works when signal and noise subspaces are sufficiently incoherent (U_s^T U_n ≈ 0).

### Mechanism 2: Overcomplete Dictionary Expansion
Expanding the representational phase space via overcomplete dictionaries (R=2 expansion ratio) enables signal and noise to occupy distinct basis vectors without competition. Rather than forcing signal and noise to share limited basis vectors in d-dimensional space, the dictionary U = [U_s, U_n] provides expanded capacity (R·d dimensions), allowing gradient flow to partition into specialized heads without interference. This leverages real-world data distributions being non-Gaussian and requiring excess capacity for disentanglement.

### Mechanism 3: π-RoPE for Non-Resonant Spectral Decoupling
Using an irrational frequency ratio (specifically π) for rotary positional embeddings minimizes cross-correlation between signal and noise heads over long sequences, preventing resonance-induced coupling. Signal heads use θ_s = π·θ_base (low frequency), noise heads use θ_n = θ_base/π (high frequency). The irrational ratio ensures the interaction kernel K_SN → 0 as sequence length increases via Riemann-Lebesgue lemma and Weyl's Equidistribution, maintaining spectral separation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Maximum Coding Rate Reduction (MCR²)**: PRISM is derived entirely from this objective; understanding Equation 2-4 is prerequisite to grasping why attention emerges as a denoising operator. Quick check: Can you explain why maximizing ΔR(Z) = R(Z|U_s) - λR(Z|U_n) promotes signal-noise separation?

- **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)**: π-RoPE modifies standard RoPE with irrational frequency scaling; requires understanding how rotation matrices encode relative position. Quick check: What property of RoPE allows the pre-softmax logits to decompose into content and position components (Equation 9)?

- **Overcomplete Representations / Sparse Coding**: The R=2 dictionary expansion draws from compressed sensing; understanding why overcompleteness aids disentanglement is essential. Quick check: Why does an overcomplete dictionary allow signal and noise to separate without competing for the same basis vectors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Z^ℓ → Overcomplete projection via U = [U_s, U_n] → Signal stream (blue): Z·U_s → π-RoPE (θ = π·10000) → Attention → S output; Noise stream (orange): Z·U_n → π-RoPE (θ = 10000/π) → Attention → N output → Differential output: Z^(ℓ+1) = Z^ℓ + S - λN → 8 layers, 16 physical heads per layer (8 signal + 8 noise pairs)

- **Critical path**: The λ annealing schedule (cosine from 0.01 to 0.1) is critical for training stability. Without proper annealing, the differential operator (S - λN) can become unstable.

- **Design tradeoffs**: R=2 expansion doubles attention head count vs standard Transformer at same parameter budget; π-RoPE requires custom implementation; validation loss improvement (1.55 vs GPT-2 baseline) traded against architectural complexity.

- **Failure signatures**: Gradient explosion if λ scheduled too aggressively; no functional specialization if frequency ratio is approximately rational; attention collapse if signal/noise subspaces learned as coherent.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Ablate π-RoPE → standard RoPE: Verify spectral decoupling is necessary for head specialization (expect loss of low-frequency/high-frequency separation). 2) Vary expansion ratio R ∈ {1, 1.5, 2, 3}: Identify minimum overcompleteness required for disentanglement without parameter waste. 3) Visualize attention patterns per head group: Confirm signal heads attend to long-range dependencies (e.g., "key"→"door") while noise heads attend to local syntax (e.g., "for"→"door").

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Architecture details underspecified: Exact hidden dimension and head dimension needed to achieve precisely 50M parameters is not provided
- π-RoPE theoretical validation: Empirical validation of π-RoPE specifically versus standard RoPE is not provided
- Scalability untested: Results demonstrated only on TinyStories with a single 50M parameter model

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the mathematical derivation showing attention emerges from gradient ascent on MCR² objectives
- **Medium confidence** in the empirical claims about functional specialization and validation loss improvement
- **Low confidence** in the necessity of π specifically for spectral decoupling

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation of π-RoPE**: Replace π-RoPE with standard RoPE while keeping all other architectural components identical. Measure changes in functional head specialization (attention pattern visualization) and validation loss.

2. **Expansion ratio sweep**: Systematically vary R ∈ {1, 1.5, 2, 3} while holding other hyperparameters constant. Measure the minimum overcompleteness required for stable disentanglement versus parameter efficiency trade-offs.

3. **Long-sequence behavior analysis**: Train PRISM on longer sequences (e.g., 2048 tokens) and analyze whether the π-RoPE spectral decoupling properties scale as predicted by the Weyl Equidistribution Theorem.
