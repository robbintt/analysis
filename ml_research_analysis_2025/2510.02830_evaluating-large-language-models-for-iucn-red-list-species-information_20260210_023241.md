# Evaluating Large Language Models for IUCN Red List Species Information

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.02830
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02830
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Key outcome**: Large language models achieve 94.9% accuracy on taxonomic classification but only 27.2% on Red List category assessment, with systematic bias favoring vertebrates over invertebrates by 6.5 percentage points.

## Executive Summary
This systematic evaluation tested five large language models (GPT-4.1, Grok 3, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemma 3-27B, Llama 3.3-70B) across 21,955 IUCN Red List species on four assessment tasks. Models demonstrated excellent performance on taxonomic classification (94.9% accuracy) but consistently failed at ecological reasoning tasks requiring judgment, particularly Red List category assessment (27.2% accuracy). A critical finding was systematic taxonomic bias, with vertebrates outperforming invertebrates by 6.5 percentage points, and mammals achieving 50.8% accuracy versus 33.5% for amphibians in Red List assessment. Models also exhibited over-attribution of threats (1.7 false positives per species) and geographic over-prediction. These findings establish clear boundaries for LLM deployment in conservation: they are valuable for information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated five LLMs on 21,955 IUCN Red List species across four tasks: taxonomic classification, Red List category assessment, geographic distribution, and threat identification. Evaluation used zero-shot prompting for taxonomy and few-shot (2-3 examples) for other tasks, with temperature=0.0 and top-p=1.0 for deterministic outputs. Responses were scored against IUCN API reference data using binary exact-match and partial-credit metrics. Statistical analysis employed GLMMs with species random effects and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The framework used Inspect AI (v0.3.116) for standardized prompt construction, logging, and scoring across API and local models.

## Key Results
- Models achieved 94.9% accuracy on taxonomic classification but only 27.2% on Red List category assessment
- Geographic distribution prediction showed 45.6% accuracy with 77% false positive rate
- Threat identification had 46.4% accuracy with 1.7 false threats per species on average
- Vertebrates outperformed invertebrates by 6.5 percentage points, with mammals achieving 50.8% accuracy versus 33.5% for amphibians

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Quantitative Threshold Inference Failure
- Claim: LLMs fail at Red List assessment because they cannot reliably apply numerical criteria that distinguish conservation categories.
- Mechanism: Transformer models capture distributional semantics but lack symbolic reasoning capability for threshold-based inference, confusing adjacent categories (EN↔VU) in 21.2% of misclassifications.
- Core assumption: Conservation categories are defined primarily by quantitative thresholds rather than semantic patterns.
- Evidence anchors: Models confused EN and VU categories in 2,862 cases (21.2% of misclassifications).

### Mechanism 2: Probabilistic Output Defaulting Under Uncertainty
- Claim: When context-dependent reasoning is required, LLMs default to statistically probable outputs rather than ecologically accurate ones.
- Mechanism: Geographic and threat tasks require integrating spatiotemporal evidence with regional variation. Without explicit constraint satisfaction mechanisms, models generate high-frequency associations (common threats, broad ranges) regardless of species-specific validity.
- Core assumption: Training distribution over-represents generic associations, creating prior probability biases.
- Evidence anchors: Geographic over-prediction with 23.4% precision (77% incorrect countries) and 1.7 false threats per species.

### Mechanism 3: Training Data Taxonomic Bias Propagation
- Claim: Performance gradients across taxonomic groups reflect asymmetries in training corpus representation, not architectural limitations.
- Mechanism: Mammals and birds have disproportionately rich scientific literature and cultural visibility. Models learn better representations for these groups, while fungi and invertebrates suffer from sparse training signals.
- Core assumption: LLM performance scales with training data quantity and quality for specific knowledge domains.
- Evidence anchors: Vertebrates outperformed invertebrates by 6.5 percentage points; fungi showed the lowest accuracy (87.5% taxonomy vs 16.7% geography).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: IUCN Red List Criteria Structure**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that categories (CR, EN, VU, NT, LC) are defined by quantitative thresholds explains why semantic similarity alone fails.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a species with 75% population decline over 10 years qualifies as Endangered rather than Critically Endangered?

- **Concept: Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Prompting**
  - Why needed here: The study uses zero-shot for taxonomy but few-shot with 2-3 examples for Tasks 2-4. This design choice affects comparability and may confound task difficulty with prompting strategy.
  - Quick check question: Why might adding examples help Red List assessment more than taxonomic classification?

- **Concept: Information-Processing vs Judgment-Formation Framework**
  - Why needed here: The paper's theoretical contribution distinguishes tasks with stable, context-independent regularities (taxonomy) from tasks requiring evidence integration under uncertainty (conservation status).
  - Quick check question: Classify the following as information-processing or judgment-formation: extracting species names from text; predicting extinction risk from heterogeneous evidence.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Species name → Prompt construction → LLM inference → Response parsing → Scoring → GLMM analysis
- **Critical path**: Species name → Prompt construction (select task template, inject species, add approved vocabularies) → LLM inference (temperature=0.0, top-p=1.0) → Response parsing (JSON extraction for taxonomy; semicolon-split for countries/threats) → Scoring (compare against IUCN API reference data) → GLMM analysis (model × task × taxonomic group effects)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Standardization vs optimization (zero-shot/few-shot without prompt engineering ensures comparability but may underestimate achievable performance); Macro-averaging vs micro-averaging (per-species accuracy emphasizes rare groups); Grok 3 web search disabled (ensures fair comparison but removes potential benefit of real-time data access)
- **Failure signatures**: Invalid country names (~5% of geographic responses); Adjacent category confusion (EN↔VU most common, 21.2% of misclassifications); Threat over-attribution (1.7 false positives/species); Fungal knowledge collapse (87.5% taxonomy vs 16.7% geography)
- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Retrieval augmentation test: Add IUCN API context to prompts for 100 species across taxa; measure if geographic precision and threat recall improve.
  2. Threshold prompting intervention: Explicitly provide Red List criteria in system message for 50 species; test if category accuracy improves.
  3. Balanced subsample validation: Resample to equal representation across taxonomic groups (n=200 per group); confirm vertebrate-invertebrate gap persists.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can integrating multilingual data pipelines effectively mitigate the geographic and linguistic biases inherent in English-dominant LLMs?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that future evaluation frameworks "must also strengthen connections with multilingual biodiversity research infrastructures" to prevent the marginalization of non-English conservation knowledge from the Global South.
- Why unresolved: The current study relied on English-dominant corpora and standardized English prompts, leaving the performance of multilingual integration untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative benchmark evaluating models trained or augmented with non-English literature against conservation ground truth in tropical and Global South regions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does prioritizing balanced training data across the tree of life significantly reduce the observed taxonomic performance gap between vertebrates and understudied groups like fungi?
- Basis in paper: The paper concludes that "Future development should prioritize balanced training data across the tree of life rather than architectural changes alone" to address systematic bias.
- Why unresolved: While the study identifies a 6.5 percentage point bias favoring vertebrates, it does not test whether data balancing strategies actually correct this deficit.
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-tuning models on a taxonomically balanced dataset and reassessing performance specifically on currently underperforming groups (invertebrates, fungi).

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can hybrid human-AI systems be operationally designed to utilize LLMs for information extraction while strictly enforcing human authority over judgment-based decisions?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that "Future work needs to prioritize hybrid system design" to ensure LLMs scale literature triage while humans retain authority over threshold-based risk assessment.
- Why unresolved: The study delineates the boundary between information processing and judgment but does not propose or validate a specific workflow for integrating these phases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and usability testing of assessor-facing platforms that successfully isolate LLM extraction tasks from human-led Red List category calculations.

## Limitations

- The study cannot definitively attribute taxonomic bias to training data imbalance versus architectural constraints without controlled experiments varying training corpus composition.
- Geographic and threat prediction failures may stem from either LLM architecture or inadequate prompt templates that fail to constrain generation appropriately.
- Performance gradients across taxonomic groups could result from multiple factors including training data quantity, morphological complexity, or ecological literature density, making causal attribution uncertain.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Taxonomic classification accuracy (94.9%) and its clear superiority over judgment tasks, as the binary nature of species identification and stable taxonomic rules make this result robust across prompting strategies and model architectures.

**Medium confidence**: Red List category assessment failure (27.2%) as evidence of quantitative threshold reasoning limitations, though alternative explanations include prompt ambiguity or insufficient few-shot examples for complex reasoning tasks.

**Low confidence**: Taxonomic bias mechanisms, as the 6.5 percentage point vertebrate-invertebrate performance gap could result from multiple factors and the study identifies correlations but cannot establish causation.

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Prompting Intervention**: Add explicit Red List criteria definitions to prompt templates for 100 species across taxonomic groups. Measure if category accuracy improves beyond semantic similarity patterns, testing whether models can apply quantitative bounds when explicitly provided.

2. **Balanced Subsampling Validation**: Resample to 200 species per taxonomic group (equal representation). Confirm whether vertebrate-invertebrate performance gaps persist, determining if current disparities reflect sample size artifacts or fundamental architectural limitations.

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation Test**: Implement IUCN API integration for 150 species, providing authoritative context for geography and threats. Assess whether external knowledge access reduces the 77% geographic precision deficit and 1.7 false positive threat rate, isolating architectural vs knowledge limitations.
