## Executive Summary
GraphRAG-Causal is a novel framework that addresses the challenge of extracting implicit causal relationships from news headlines. Traditional NLP methods often struggle with low-data scenarios and fail to capture nuanced causal links. This framework transforms annotated news sentences into structured causal knowledge graphs and employs a hybrid retrieval system that combines semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues. The system demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and consistency for real-time applications in news reliability assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a three-stage pipeline: Data Preparation (annotating and converting news into causal graphs), Graph Retrieval (storing graphs and embeddings, retrieving via hybrid Cypher queries), and LLM Inference (using retrieved graphs in few-shot learning with XML-based prompting for classification and tagging). Causal graphs are stored in Neo4j with vector indexes, and a hybrid scoring mechanism combines semantic similarity with structural connectivity to retrieve relevant examples. The retrieved causal graphs serve as few-shot examples for an LLM to perform causal classification and tagging.

## Key Results
- F1-score of 82.1% achieved on causal classification task
- Performance improves from F1 0.777 (K=5) to 0.822 (K=20) as more examples are provided
- Outperforms traditional methods in low-data scenarios for causal reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hybrid Retrieval Scoring
- Claim: Combining semantic similarity with structural connectivity improves retrieval relevance over either signal alone.
- Mechanism: For each event node e, a hybrid score H(e) = α·sim(e,q) + β·S(e) is computed, where sim(e,q) is cosine similarity between query and event embeddings, and S(e) is a binary structural score (1 if the event has any cause/effect/trigger edges, else 0). Events are ranked by H(e) and top-k are selected as few-shot examples.
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity alone may retrieve topically related but causally irrelevant events; structural connectivity acts as a proxy for causal richness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "hybrid retrieval system that merges semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues"
  - [Section 3.3]: Mathematical formulation of H(e), S(e), and filtering threshold τ
  - [corpus]: Related work on graph-augmented RAG (e.g., CausalRAG, HyperbolicRAG) supports hybrid retrieval but does not directly validate this specific scoring formula.
- Break condition: If α and β are poorly calibrated, or if S(e) is near-constant (most events are structurally connected), the hybrid reduces to pure semantic retrieval.

### Mechanism 2: Few-Shot Learning via Retrieved Causal Graphs
- Claim: Providing retrieved causal graphs as few-shot examples enables the LLM to perform causal classification with minimal labeled data.
- Mechanism: Retrieved events include their associated cause/effect/trigger texts. These are formatted as XML few-shot examples in the prompt, giving the LLM concrete structural patterns to emulate for classification and tagging.
- Core assumption: The LLM can generalize from retrieved examples to new inputs without gradient updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LLM Inference stage utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with XML-based prompting"
  - [Section 4]: F1 improves from 0.777 (K=5) to 0.822 (K=20) as more examples are provided
  - [corpus]: Few-shot learning with retrieved context is a common RAG pattern, but effectiveness for causal tasks varies by domain.
- Break condition: Retrieved examples must be causally relevant; noisy retrievals may mislead the LLM, degrading performance.

### Mechanism 3: Structured Output via XML Prompting
- Claim: Enforcing JSON output through XML-formatted prompts improves consistency and downstream integration.
- Mechanism: The prompt specifies explicit rules and an output schema (keys: `tagged_sentence`, `label`), reducing format drift and enabling automated parsing.
- Core assumption: The LLM reliably follows structured output instructions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 1]: "instructs explicitly to output in JSON format... this overcomes the common challenge of consistency and maintainability"
  - [Section 3.4]: XML prompt includes causality tests and explicit output format rules
  - [corpus]: Structured prompting is widely used but not universally reliable; smaller models may struggle with strict formats.
- Break condition: If the LLM ignores format constraints, downstream parsing fails; this risk increases with less capable models or complex schemas.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal vs. correlational relationships in text
  - Why needed here: The framework distinguishes causal sentences from non-causal ones; understanding what constitutes a cause-effect link (including implicit triggers) is foundational to annotation and evaluation.
  - Quick check question: Given "Protests erupted after the announcement," can you identify the cause, effect, and trigger?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: GraphRAG-Causal extends RAG by storing causal graphs in Neo4j; understanding basic RAG (retrieve-then-generate) clarifies where the graph augmentation fits.
  - Quick check question: In a standard RAG pipeline, what is retrieved and how is it used by the LLM?

- Concept: Graph databases and Cypher queries
  - Why needed here: Neo4j stores nodes (Event, Cause, Effect, Trigger) and edges (CAUSES, RESULTS_IN, HAS_TRIGGER); the hybrid retrieval uses Cypher to compute structural scores and retrieve subgraphs.
  - Quick check question: Write a Cypher fragment to count outgoing RESULTS_IN edges for an event node.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Preparation -> Graph Retrieval -> LLM Inference
- Critical path:
  1. Annotation quality determines graph structure; missing or noisy tags propagate to retrieval.
  2. Embedding model choice affects semantic similarity; dimension and normalization must match Neo4j vector index.
  3. Hybrid score weights (α, β) and threshold τ directly control which examples are retrieved; tuning is empirical.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fewer examples (K=5) → faster inference but lower F1; more examples (K=20) → higher F1 but longer prompts and higher token costs.
  - Binary structural score S(e) is simple but coarse; a weighted count of edges could provide finer-grained signals.
  - XML prompting enforces structure but may be brittle with smaller or less instruction-following models.
- Failure signatures:
  - Retrieved examples are topically similar but causally irrelevant → check α/β balance; semantic similarity may dominate.
  - LLM outputs malformed JSON → inspect prompt formatting; consider fallback parsing or stronger models.
  - F1 plateaus despite increasing K → knowledge base may lack diverse causal patterns; expand annotation coverage.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline retrieval: Set β=0 (pure semantic) and compare F1 vs. hybrid (α, β tuned). Expect lower F1 if structural signal is informative.
  2. Ablate K: Run K ∈ {5, 10, 15, 20} and plot F1, precision, recall. Identify the point of diminishing returns.
  3. Structural score variants: Replace binary S(e) with normalized edge count; evaluate whether finer-grained scores improve retrieval relevance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Open Question 1: How can a standardized "Validation Layer" be developed to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of causal tagging (cause, effect, trigger extraction) rather than relying on self-evaluation?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that they plan to develop a validation layer because "there is currently no standardized accuracy measure for this component."
  - Why unresolved: The current study relies on self-evaluated tagging outputs, lacking a gold-standard comparison for the specific cause/effect spans extracted by the LLM.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis using a benchmark dataset with gold-standard span annotations (e.g., exact match F1-scores for tags).

- Open Question 2: Can the integration of AI RAG Agents enable step-by-step retrieval to overcome context window limitations and reduce token usage?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly list "integrate AI RAG Agents" as future work to enable "faster inference and fewer token constraints."
  - Why unresolved: The current implementation retrieves top-k examples in a monolithic step, potentially hitting context limits or increasing latency with large graphs.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the current retrieval method against an agent-based approach measuring token consumption, latency, and classification accuracy.

- Open Question 3: Does the hybrid scoring mechanism (semantic + structural) generalize to causal reasoning in domains other than protest-related news?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper relies on the Causal News Corpus (largely protest-focused) and criticizes prior work (like FinCausal) for being domain-specific, yet does not test its own cross-domain adaptability.
  - Why unresolved: The structural weights (alpha and beta) and graph schemas may be overfitted to the linguistic style of news headlines, failing on scientific or financial texts.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Zero-shot or few-shot evaluation results on datasets from different domains (e.g., biomedical or financial causal corpora).

## Limitations
- The framework relies heavily on manual annotation quality, with errors propagating through the pipeline.
- The hybrid retrieval scoring uses a binary structural score (S(e)), which may oversimplify causal relationships.
- The exact calibration of weights α and β, and threshold τ, are not specified, making reproduction difficult.

## Confidence
- Hybrid retrieval scoring effectiveness: **Medium** - supported by formulation and F1 improvement, but missing exact weight values and structural score calibration details.
- Few-shot learning via retrieved causal graphs: **High** - consistent with established RAG patterns; performance gains (F1 0.777→0.822) are directly measured.
- Structured output via XML prompting: **Medium** - logical for consistency, but no empirical comparison with alternative formats; effectiveness may vary by model.

## Next Checks
1. Run a baseline retrieval experiment setting β=0 (pure semantic) and compare F1 to hybrid; confirm structural signal adds value.
2. Perform an ablation study over K ∈ {5, 10, 15, 20} and plot F1, precision, recall to find the point of diminishing returns.
3. Replace the binary structural score S(e) with a normalized edge count and evaluate whether finer-grained structural signals improve retrieval relevance and downstream F1.
