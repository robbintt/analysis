# Explainable Heterogeneous Anomaly Detection in Financial Networks via Adaptive Expert Routing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17088
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17088
- Authors: Zan Li; Rui Fan
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves 92.3% detection of 13 major events with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8 percentage points

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting heterogeneous financial anomalies (price shocks, liquidity freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts) in a way that provides both high accuracy and actionable interpretability for regulatory intervention. Existing methods produce opaque scalar scores without revealing which mechanism is failing or how to intervene. The authors propose a framework combining adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks that captures multi-scale temporal dependencies, learns dynamic graphs via neural multi-source interpolation, routes anomalies to four mechanism-specific experts through stress-modulated gating, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions. On 100 US equities (2017-2024), the framework achieves 92.3% detection of 13 major events with 3.8-day lead time.

## Method Summary
The method uses a 4-module architecture: (1) BiLSTM with self-attention and GCN layers capture temporal and spatial patterns from 29 financial features; (2) Multi-source graph learning with stress-modulated fusion balances domain knowledge priors against learned correlations; (3) A 4-expert MoE with category-aligned features routes anomalies to Price-Shock, Liquidity, Systemic-Contagion, or Momentum-Reversal specialists through stress-aware gating; (4) Multi-scale GRU decoders with MPI aggregation produce final anomaly scores. The framework learns without labeled supervision, using reconstruction loss with diversity and smoothness regularization. Market stress index modulates graph fusion weights and routing sharpness, while expert routing weights provide inherent interpretability of active failure mechanisms.

## Key Results
- Achieves 92.3% detection rate for 13 major financial events with 3.8-day median lead time
- Outperforms best baseline (HyPV-LEAD) by 30.8 percentage points
- Demonstrates interpretable mechanism attribution through expert weight trajectories (SVB case: Price-Shock expert weight rose from 0.29 to 0.48)
- Ablation studies show stress modulation and MoE routing are critical (61.5% drop without them)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Stress-modulated graph fusion dynamically balances domain priors against learned correlations during regime transitions. Market stress index ψ_t aggregates volatility, correlation spikes, and liquidity stress, adjusting fusion weight α_t (clamped 0.2-0.8) to emphasize data-driven graphs during high stress and priors during normal periods. This enables adaptive response to regime shifts before anomalies become critical.

### Mechanism 2
Routing observations to mechanism-specific experts with category-aligned features enables higher detection accuracy and interpretable attribution. Four experts (Price-Shock, Liquidity, Systemic-Contagion, Momentum-Reversal) process disjoint feature subsets, with gating network computing routing weights from embeddings, category signals, and stress. This specialization prevents dilution of anomaly signatures across mechanisms.

### Mechanism 3
Architecturally-embedded routing weights provide mechanism attribution without post-hoc explanation overhead. Expert weights directly encode which mechanism dominates, with weight trajectories revealing temporal transitions. This inherent interpretability avoids the computational cost and uncertainty of separate explanation methods while maintaining consistent mappings for regulators.

## Foundational Learning

- **Graph Neural Networks (GCN/GAT)**: Module 1 spatial branch and Module 2 graph refinement use GCN/GAT to propagate information across financial networks. Quick check: Can you explain how normalized adjacency matrix Â = D^(-1/2) A D^(-1/2) affects message passing?
- **BiLSTM with Self-Attention**: Module 1 temporal branch captures multi-scale dependencies; BiLSTM handles short-term patterns while self-attention captures long-range relationships. Quick check: Why combine bidirectional LSTM with self-attention rather than using either alone?
- **Mixture of Experts with Gating**: Module 3 routes to specialized experts; understanding softmax gating, temperature scaling, and load balancing is essential. Quick check: How does temperature τ in softmax(g/τ) affect routing sharpness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Features X (T=20, F=29) → Module 1 (BiLSTM → Self-attention → GCN) → z, c, h_spat → Module 2 (Multi-source graphs → Top-k sparsification → Stress-modulated fusion) → A_fused, z_final → Module 3 (Category signals → Gating → 4 experts) → w (routing), e_MoE → Module 4 (3 GRU decoders → Combined score + MPI) → s (anomaly score)
- **Critical path**: 1) X → z, c, h_spat; 2) z, c → A_fused, z_final; 3) z_final, category signals → w, e_MoE; 4) e_MoE + multi-scale errors → s
- **Design tradeoffs**: Top-k=20 balances connection capture vs noise; 4 experts optimize specialization vs routing fragmentation; T=20 window balances regime shift detection vs signal smoothing
- **Failure signatures**: Expert collapse (uniform weights), static fusion (α_t stuck ~0.5), delayed detection (lead time <2 days)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline reproduction (single-expert variant, verify 61.5% detection); 2) Stress modulation validation (track α_t during SVB closure, verify 0.65→0.28 shift); 3) Routing interpretability check (plot SVB Price-Shock weight 0.29→0.39→0.48 trajectory)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can heterogeneous graph structures with multiple edge types (ownership networks, supply chains, credit exposures) reveal directional contagion pathways that similarity-based graphs miss? The paper notes current cosine similarity produces undirected edges and suggests Granger causality tests could reveal directional pathways critical for intervention targeting.

### Open Question 2
How can the four-expert taxonomy be dynamically expanded to handle emerging anomaly mechanisms (algorithmic trading failures, DeFi exploits) without losing interpretability? The paper proposes adaptive expert expansion through continual learning with knowledge distillation, but lacks mechanisms for expert birth/retirement while maintaining consistent weight-to-mechanism mappings for regulators.

### Open Question 3
Does multimodal integration with alternative data sources (news sentiment, regulatory filings, social media) provide early warning before anomalies manifest in price-volume microstructure? The paper proposes augmenting price-volume features to capture information asymmetries and sentiment shifts, but whether textual/behavioral signals provide incremental lead time remains untested.

## Limitations
- Proprietary financial risk indicators lack specified computational formulas, requiring implementation assumptions
- Small sample size (13 events) limits statistical robustness of performance claims
- Generalization across different market regimes and asset classes remains unverified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Architectural design combining adaptive graph learning with specialized expert routing is technically sound; interpretability mechanism validated through SVB case study; ablation studies compelling
- **Medium Confidence**: Quantitative results impressive but limited by small sample size; baseline comparisons would benefit from more diverse implementations
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization claims across market regimes based on limited temporal testing; performance during unprecedented conditions (2020 pandemic) unverified

## Next Checks
1. Reconstruct market stress indicator ψ_t using public data and verify α_t shifts from ~0.65 to ~0.28 during documented crisis periods
2. On rolling window analysis of SVB and other anomalies, verify routing weights remain stable (0.29→0.39→0.48) rather than fluctuating randomly
3. Test model on financial anomalies from different asset classes (commodities, FX) or time periods (pre-2017) to assess generalization
