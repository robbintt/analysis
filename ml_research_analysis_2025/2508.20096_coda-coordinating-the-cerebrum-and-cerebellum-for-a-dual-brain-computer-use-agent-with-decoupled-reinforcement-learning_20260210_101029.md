core_contribution: CODA introduces a trainable dual-brain agent framework that decouples
  a dynamic planner (Cerebrum) from a static executor (Cerebellum) to address long-horizon
  planning and precise execution challenges in scientific GUI domains. Using decoupled
  reinforcement learning, the planner is trained per software to specialize in strategic
  reasoning, then generalized via supervised fine-tuning from aggregated specialist
  trajectories.

# CODA: Coordinating the Cerebrum and Cerebellum for a Dual-Brain Computer Use Agent with Decoupled Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.20096
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20096
- Reference count: 27
- Major result: 39.96% pass rate on ScienceBoard applications, establishing new state-of-the-art

## Executive Summary
CODA introduces a trainable dual-brain agent framework that decouples a dynamic planner (Cerebrum) from a static executor (Cerebellum) to address long-horizon planning and precise execution challenges in scientific GUI domains. Using decoupled reinforcement learning, the planner is trained per software to specialize in strategic reasoning, then generalized via supervised fine-tuning from aggregated specialist trajectories. Evaluated on four ScienceBoard applications, CODA achieves a 39.96% pass rate (up from 15.36% baseline) and establishes a new open-source state-of-the-art, demonstrating superior cross-domain generalization and planning ability.

## Method Summary
CODA implements a dual-brain architecture where the Cerebrum handles dynamic planning and the Cerebellum manages static execution. The framework employs decoupled reinforcement learning where the Cerebrum is trained per software application to specialize in strategic reasoning, while the Cerebellum is trained on execution tasks. After individual training, the Cerebrum's knowledge is generalized through supervised fine-tuning using aggregated trajectories from specialist models. This approach separates long-horizon planning from precise execution, addressing the challenges of scientific GUI domains where both strategic reasoning and accurate interaction are critical.

## Key Results
- Achieves 39.96% pass rate on ScienceBoard applications, significantly outperforming 15.36% baseline
- Demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization capabilities compared to single-brain approaches
- Establishes new open-source state-of-the-art for scientific GUI agent frameworks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The decoupling approach works by separating cognitive functions that traditionally compete for resources and attention in single-brain models. By training the Cerebrum for strategic planning independently from the Cerebellum's execution tasks, each component can optimize its specialized function without interference. The Cerebrum learns to reason about long-term goals and plan sequences of actions, while the Cerebellum focuses on precise GUI interactions. The supervised fine-tuning phase allows the Cerebrum to generalize from specialist models, creating a more robust planning component that can handle multiple applications.

## Foundational Learning

**Decoupled Reinforcement Learning**: Separate training processes for different cognitive functions
- Why needed: Allows each component to optimize specialized tasks without interference
- Quick check: Compare training convergence rates for decoupled vs. coupled approaches

**Hierarchical Planning**: Strategic reasoning separated from execution planning
- Why needed: Long-horizon planning requires different optimization than precise execution
- Quick check: Measure planning depth and accuracy in multi-step tasks

**Supervised Fine-tuning on Aggregated Trajectories**: Generalization from specialist models
- Why needed: Transfer knowledge from application-specific experts to a general planner
- Quick check: Evaluate performance on unseen applications after fine-tuning

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Cerebrum (Planner) -> Cerebellum (Executor) -> GUI Environment

**Critical Path**: User Goal -> Cerebrum Planning -> Cerebellum Execution -> Environment Feedback -> Cerebrum Update

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Pros: Specialized optimization for planning vs. execution, better generalization potential
- Cons: Potential coordination overhead, assumes separable cognitive functions
- Design decision: Separate modules with decoupled training vs. unified approach

**Failure Signatures**:
- Planning failures: Incorrect action sequences, failure to anticipate consequences
- Execution failures: Precise interaction errors, GUI element misidentification
- Coordination failures: Mismatch between planned and executable actions

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate single-step planning vs. multi-step planning performance
2. Test Cerebrum generalization across similar applications
3. Measure execution accuracy with and without specialized training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to scientific GUI domains, generalization to other domains uncertain
- Per-software training requirement for Cerebrum may limit scalability
- No testing on more complex GUI environments beyond ScienceBoard applications

## Confidence
- Major claims regarding superior planning ability: Medium
- Claims about cross-domain generalization: Medium
- State-of-the-art establishment: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive evaluations on a wider range of GUI-based applications beyond scientific domains to assess the framework's generalization capabilities and identify potential limitations in diverse real-world scenarios.

2. Implement and compare CODA with alternative dual-brain or hierarchical agent architectures that employ different strategies for coordinating planning and execution functions, to determine the optimal approach for various types of tasks.

3. Investigate the impact of integrating the Cerebrum and Cerebellum components more tightly, potentially through shared representations or communication channels, to evaluate whether a more unified cognitive model could improve performance in tasks requiring close coordination between strategic reasoning and precise execution.
