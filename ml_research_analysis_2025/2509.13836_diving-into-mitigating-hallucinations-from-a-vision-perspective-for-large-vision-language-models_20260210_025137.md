# Diving into Mitigating Hallucinations from a Vision Perspective for Large Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13836
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13836
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Proposes VisionWeaver, a context-aware routing network that dynamically aggregates visual features from multiple visual encoders to mitigate hallucinations in large vision-language models

## Executive Summary
This work addresses object hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models describe non-existent objects or attributes. The paper hypothesizes that diverse training paradigms of visual encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, leading to varied hallucination behaviors. To analyze this, the authors introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately 10,000 samples evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination categories grouped into detection, segmentation, localization, and classification. Evaluations confirm different visual encoders exhibit unique hallucination characteristics. To mitigate hallucinations, the authors propose VisionWeaver, a context-aware routing network that dynamically aggregates visual features from multiple specialized experts using global visual features to generate routing signals. Comprehensive experiments on established hallucination benchmarks (POPE, AutoHallusion) and general LVLM benchmarks show VisionWeaver significantly reduces hallucinations and improves overall model performance.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce VisionWeaver, a context-aware routing network designed to mitigate hallucinations in large vision-language models by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple visual encoders. VisionWeaver operates through a dynamic routing mechanism where a routing network generates signals based on global visual features to select appropriate specialized visual encoders for each input. The system aggregates visual features from multiple experts, allowing the model to benefit from diverse visual representations while reducing hallucination tendencies. The approach is evaluated on both hallucination-specific benchmarks (VHBench-10, POPE, AutoHallusion) and general LVLM benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations while maintaining or improving overall model performance.

## Key Results
- Different visual encoders exhibit unique hallucination characteristics, validating the hypothesis that training paradigms create distinct inductive biases
- VisionWeaver significantly reduces hallucinations on established benchmarks (POPE, AutoHallusion) compared to baseline models
- VisionWeaver improves overall model performance on general LVLM benchmarks while mitigating hallucination issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
VisionWeaver works by exploiting the complementary strengths of multiple visual encoders, each trained with different paradigms and therefore exhibiting distinct hallucination behaviors. The routing mechanism dynamically selects appropriate visual features based on input content, effectively leveraging the strengths of different encoders while avoiding their individual hallucination weaknesses. By using global visual features to generate routing signals, the system can contextually determine which visual encoder's representations are most appropriate for a given input, creating a more robust and hallucination-resistant visual understanding pipeline.

## Foundational Learning
- Visual encoder diversity: Different visual encoders trained with distinct paradigms exhibit varied hallucination patterns due to their unique inductive biases. This diversity is essential because it provides complementary strengths that can be leveraged for hallucination mitigation.
  - Quick check: Verify that different visual encoders consistently show distinct hallucination patterns across multiple benchmark datasets

- Context-aware routing: The ability to dynamically select appropriate visual features based on input content is crucial for leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple visual encoders while avoiding their individual weaknesses.
  - Quick check: Validate that routing decisions correspond to meaningful distinctions in visual content through qualitative analysis

- Hallucination categorization: Fine-grained classification of hallucinations into detection, segmentation, localization, and classification categories provides a more nuanced understanding of model failures and targeted mitigation strategies.
  - Quick check: Ensure benchmark categories comprehensively cover the spectrum of hallucination types encountered in real-world scenarios

- Ensemble learning: Combining multiple specialized models through intelligent routing can outperform individual models by aggregating their complementary strengths while mitigating individual weaknesses.
  - Quick check: Compare performance against simple ensemble baselines to isolate the routing mechanism's contribution

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Image → Multiple Visual Encoders → Global Visual Feature Extraction → Routing Network → Expert Selection → Feature Aggregation → LVLM Backbone → Output

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves processing the input image through multiple visual encoders, extracting global visual features, routing these features to select appropriate experts, aggregating the selected features, and feeding them to the LVLM backbone for final output generation.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Multiple visual encoders increase computational cost but provide complementary strengths for hallucination mitigation
- Complex routing mechanism adds architectural overhead but enables context-aware feature selection
- Feature aggregation strategy must balance expert contributions while maintaining computational efficiency

**Failure Signatures:**
- Routing decisions that don't correspond to meaningful visual distinctions indicate the routing mechanism may be learning artifacts rather than genuine content-based selection
- Persistent hallucinations in specific categories suggest inadequate expert coverage for those hallucination types
- Performance degradation on certain tasks may indicate routing conflicts or inappropriate expert selection

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Compare hallucination patterns across different visual encoders on VHBench-10 to validate the diversity hypothesis
2. Test routing effectiveness by examining routing decisions on inputs where expert performance differences are known
3. Evaluate hallucination reduction on POPE and AutoHallusion benchmarks with ablated routing components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The routing mechanism's effectiveness relies on global visual features, but validation of whether routing decisions correspond to meaningful visual content distinctions is limited
- VHBench-10 benchmark comprehensiveness for real-world deployment scenarios requires further validation
- Evaluation focuses primarily on hallucination reduction without extensive analysis of trade-offs in other performance aspects

## Confidence
- High confidence: The identification of distinct hallucination patterns across different visual encoders is well-supported by experimental evidence
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of VisionWeaver in reducing hallucinations on benchmark datasets
- Medium confidence: The overall contribution to the LVLM hallucination mitigation literature

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the routing mechanism's contribution versus the ensemble effect of multiple visual encoders
2. Validate routing decisions through qualitative analysis, showing examples where the router correctly selects appropriate visual features based on input content
3. Test VisionWeaver on out-of-distribution images and long-tail visual concepts not well-represented in the benchmark datasets
