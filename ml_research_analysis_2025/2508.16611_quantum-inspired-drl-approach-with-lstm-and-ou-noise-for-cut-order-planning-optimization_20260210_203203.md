# Quantum-Inspired DRL Approach with LSTM and OU Noise for Cut Order Planning Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.16611
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16611
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Quantum-Inspired DRL framework achieves 13% fabric cost savings in textile COP optimization

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a Quantum-Inspired Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for optimizing Cut Order Planning (COP) in textile manufacturing. The approach combines LSTM networks for sequence modeling, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise for exploration, and quantum-inspired probabilistic representations to enhance decision-making. The framework demonstrates significant improvements in fabric utilization and cost reduction while maintaining production efficiency through adaptive planning strategies.

## Method Summary
The methodology integrates quantum-inspired probabilistic representations with LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies in fabric demand patterns. The framework employs Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise to enable smooth exploration during the reinforcement learning process, avoiding the discontinuities typical of standard noise functions. The quantum-inspired component provides enhanced exploration capabilities through probabilistic state representations, while the LSTM architecture processes sequential fabric order data to predict optimal cutting patterns. The system operates through iterative episodes, continuously refining its planning strategies based on reward feedback from the production environment.

## Key Results
- Achieves average reward of 0.81 (±0.03) over 1000 training episodes
- Reduces prediction loss to 0.15 (±0.02) in fabric demand planning
- Demonstrates up to 13% fabric cost savings compared to conventional methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from the complementary strengths of its components. Quantum-inspired representations enable richer exploration of the solution space by modeling probabilistic states that capture uncertainty in fabric demand and cutting patterns. LSTM networks excel at learning temporal dependencies in sequential order data, allowing the system to anticipate demand fluctuations and optimize cutting plans accordingly. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise provides temporally correlated exploration that prevents the agent from getting stuck in local optima while maintaining smooth transitions between exploration and exploitation phases. The integration of these elements creates a robust planning system that adapts to dynamic manufacturing environments while minimizing fabric waste.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Quantum-inspired probabilistic representations**: These enable the agent to explore solution spaces more effectively by modeling uncertainty in state transitions and actions. *Why needed*: Traditional DRL approaches struggle with exploration in complex, high-dimensional spaces like COP optimization. *Quick check*: Verify that the quantum component provides measurable improvements over standard probabilistic exploration methods.

2. **LSTM for sequential pattern learning**: Long Short-Term Memory networks capture temporal dependencies in fabric order sequences, enabling better prediction of future demand patterns. *Why needed*: COP decisions must account for historical order patterns and future demand projections. *Quick check*: Confirm that LSTM outperforms simpler sequence models (RNN, GRU) on the same task.

3. **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise process**: This provides temporally correlated exploration noise, preventing the agent from making abrupt policy changes during training. *Why needed*: Standard noise processes can lead to unstable learning and poor convergence in continuous action spaces. *Quick check*: Compare training stability and convergence speed against epsilon-greedy or standard Gaussian noise.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Fabric Demand Data -> LSTM Encoder -> Quantum-Inspired State Representation -> OU-Enhanced DRL Agent -> Cut Order Plan Output

**Critical Path**: The sequential processing pipeline begins with historical fabric order data feeding into the LSTM encoder, which generates temporal features. These features are transformed through quantum-inspired probabilistic representations that enhance exploration capabilities. The OU noise process modulates the agent's policy during training, ensuring smooth exploration. The DRL agent then outputs optimal cut order plans that minimize fabric waste while meeting production requirements.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances exploration versus exploitation through quantum-inspired representations and OU noise, trading computational complexity for improved solution quality. The LSTM architecture prioritizes temporal accuracy over computational efficiency, assuming sufficient training data availability. Quantum-inspired components add implementation complexity but potentially provide significant performance gains in exploration-limited environments.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor convergence may indicate insufficient exploration, suggesting adjustments to quantum representation parameters or OU noise characteristics. High prediction loss could signal inadequate LSTM training or insufficient historical data. Suboptimal fabric utilization might result from improperly tuned reward functions or reward shaping that doesn't adequately penalize waste.

**First Experiments**: 1) Validate individual component performance in isolation (LSTM alone, standard DRL without quantum components) 2) Test framework sensitivity to OU noise parameters across different manufacturing scenarios 3) Evaluate quantum-inspired exploration benefits through controlled ablation studies
