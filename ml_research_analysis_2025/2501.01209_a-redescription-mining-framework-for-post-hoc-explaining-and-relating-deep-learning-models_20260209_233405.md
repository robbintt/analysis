# A redescription mining framework for post-hoc explaining and relating deep learning models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.01209
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01209

- Primary result: Framework outperforms existing redescription mining approaches in describing neurons and creating accurate redescriptions for deep learning model explanations

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel redescription mining framework for post-hoc explaining and relating deep learning models (DLMs). The approach identifies statistically significant redescriptions of neuron activations, allowing coupling of neurons to target labels or descriptive attributes, and relating layers within or across DLMs. The framework operates independently of DLM architecture and can handle complex target labels.

The framework demonstrates significant improvements over existing redescription mining approaches, creating more accurate redescriptions and describing more neurons individually and in interactions. It shows comparable performance to state-of-the-art rule extraction methods for explaining DLM predictions. The method is validated through various experiments including randomization tests, rule extraction on ADNI and WDBC datasets, and layer relationship analysis on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and AGNews datasets.

## Method Summary
The framework uses redescriptions - tuples of rules in equivalence relations - to analyze DLMs by identifying statistically significant redescriptions of neuron activations. It operates by sampling neurons and data points, generating redescriptions that couple neurons to target labels or descriptive attributes, and evaluating these redescriptions for statistical significance. The approach is architecture-agnostic and can work with complex target labels, making it applicable to various types of DLMs.

The method employs different sampling strategies including random sampling and layer-wise sampling, where each layer contributes approximately the same number of neurons. Redescriptions are generated by finding overlapping support between neuron activations and features, then filtering for statistical significance. The framework provides interpretable explanations by creating rules that describe when neurons activate and how these activations relate to model predictions or domain attributes.

## Key Results
- Significantly outperforms existing redescription mining approaches in number of individually described neurons and neurons described in interactions
- Creates larger number of accurate redescriptions than competitor methods
- Demonstrates comparable performance to state-of-the-art rule extraction methods for explaining DLM predictions
- Successfully applies framework across multiple datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, AGNews, ADNI, and WDBC

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by exploiting the statistical relationships between neuron activations and both model predictions and domain-specific attributes. By identifying overlapping support between different data representations, it creates interpretable rules that capture when and why neurons activate. The use of equivalence relations ensures that redescriptions provide consistent, meaningful interpretations of model behavior across different data views.

The approach's effectiveness stems from its ability to work with any DLM architecture and handle complex target labels, making it broadly applicable. The statistical significance testing ensures that only meaningful redescriptions are retained, while the sampling strategies enable efficient exploration of large model spaces. The framework's ability to relate different DLMs or layers within the same model provides valuable insights into model behavior and decision-making processes.

## Foundational Learning

- Deep learning activation patterns: Why needed - core to understanding what the framework analyzes; Quick check - understand neuron activation distributions and their interpretation

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data sampling -> Redescription generation -> Statistical filtering -> Rule extraction -> Model relationship analysis

Critical path: The framework follows a sequential process starting with data sampling (neurons and data points), generating candidate redescriptions by finding overlapping support between neuron activations and features, applying statistical filters to retain only significant redescriptions, extracting interpretable rules from the remaining redescriptions, and finally analyzing relationships between different model components or between models.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational complexity for interpretability, focusing on pairs of redescriptions rather than more complex interactions. This limitation ensures tractability but may miss higher-order relationships. The architecture-agnostic design enables broad applicability but may not capture architecture-specific insights available to more specialized methods.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may manifest as few statistically significant redescriptions, indicating weak relationships between neuron activations and target attributes. High computational cost with diminishing returns in redescription quality suggests the need for better sampling strategies or dimensionality reduction techniques.

Three first experiments:
1. Apply framework to a simple CNN on MNIST to verify basic functionality and interpretability
2. Test statistical significance filtering by comparing results with and without p-value thresholds
3. Evaluate layer-wise sampling strategy by comparing redescription quality across different sampling approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity restricts the method to pairs of redescriptions, potentially missing higher-order interactions
- Scalability concerns for very large models with hundreds of layers
- Interpretability depends heavily on quality and relevance of auxiliary data attributes provided

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on transformer-based models (BERT, GPT) to evaluate its effectiveness with attention mechanisms and contextual embeddings
2. Conduct systematic scalability analysis measuring runtime performance and memory usage across varying network sizes (from small CNNs to large models with 100+ layers)
3. Implement ablation studies to quantify the impact of different sampling strategies (random vs. layer-wise) on redescription quality and model coverage
