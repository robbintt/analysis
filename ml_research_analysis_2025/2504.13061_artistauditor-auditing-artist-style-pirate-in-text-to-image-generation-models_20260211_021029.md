# ArtistAuditor: Auditing Artist Style Pirate in Text-to-Image Generation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.13061
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13061
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: High AUC values (>0.937) across three popular diffusion models for detecting unauthorized fine-tuning on artist styles

## Executive Summary
ArtistAuditor introduces a novel black-box auditing method to detect unauthorized fine-tuning of text-to-image diffusion models using an artist's unique style as an intrinsic fingerprint. The approach extracts multi-granularity style representations from artworks using a CNN-based style extractor and trains a discriminator to identify style piracy without requiring access to model weights or training data. The method demonstrates strong performance across multiple diffusion models (Stable Diffusion v2.1, Stable Diffusion XL, Kandinsky) and artistic datasets, maintaining accuracy above 85% even in challenging disjoint dataset scenarios.

## Method Summary
ArtistAuditor operates through a three-step process: (1) dataset preparation where public artworks are collected and used to generate captions that query suspicious models to obtain mimicked artworks, (2) discriminator construction using a VGG-based style extractor to obtain multi-layer feature representations concatenated as style fingerprints, and (3) auditing via trained discriminator that outputs confidence scores used in either threshold-based or hypothesis testing decision mechanisms. The discriminator is trained with both classification and distortion loss to account for differences between original and generated artworks.

## Key Results
- Achieves AUC values >0.937 across three diffusion models (Stable Diffusion v2.1, Stable Diffusion XL, Kandinsky)
- Demonstrates strong transferability between disjoint datasets with accuracy remaining above 85%
- Successfully validated on real-world platform Scenario, identifying style piracy in all tested cases
- Efficient memory usage requiring under 13.18 GB of GPU memory per artist

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Granularity Style Representation as Fingerprint
An artist's style can be intrinsically fingerprinted using multi-layer CNN features, enabling detection of unauthorized fine-tuning without requiring model modifications or access to training data. The approach extracts style representations from four evenly spaced layers of a VGG network, concatenating them to form a comprehensive style fingerprint. Early layers capture low-level features (edges, colors, textures), while deeper layers capture abstract compositional elements. This multi-granularity approach distinguishes style from content, allowing detection even when generated images differ in subject matter from original artworks.

### Mechanism 2: Discriminator Training with Distortion Calibration
A regression-based discriminator trained with both classification loss and distortion loss can robustly distinguish whether generated images originated from a model fine-tuned on a target artist's work. The discriminator is trained on public artworks, generated artworks from querying suspicious models, and augmented artworks through random cropping, flipping, cutouts, noise injection, and color jittering. The combined loss function accounts for inevitable differences between original and generated artworks while maintaining discrimination capability.

### Mechanism 3: Dual Auditing Decision Strategies
Combining threshold-based and hypothesis testing-based decision mechanisms provides flexible auditing with controllable false positive rates. After extracting style representations from generated images, the discriminator outputs confidence scores in [-1, 1]. Two decision strategies are available: (1) threshold-based comparing average confidence score to threshold (default 0), and (2) hypothesis testing using one-sided t-test to determine if mean score is significantly greater than 0.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Diffusion Model Fine-Tuning (DreamBooth/LoRA)**
- **Why needed here:** The threat model assumes adversaries fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models on artist artworks. Understanding how LoRA adapters or full fine-tuning modifies model behavior is essential for interpreting why style traces remain detectable.
- **Quick check question:** Explain how fine-tuning differs from training from scratch, and why it requires fewer images to impart stylistic characteristics.

**Concept: CNN Feature Hierarchies and Style Transfer**
- **Why needed here:** The style extractor relies on the principle that different CNN layers encode different levels of visual abstraction. This foundation distinguishes ArtistAuditor from content-based membership inference.
- **Quick check question:** Describe what features are captured in early vs. late layers of VGG, and why concatenating multi-layer features better represents artistic style than using a single layer.

**Concept: Black-Box Membership Inference vs. Data-Use Auditing**
- **Why needed here:** ArtistAuditor differs from prior MI methods (which require model weights or focus on sample-level inference). Understanding this distinction clarifies the design constraints and threat model.
- **Quick check question:** Compare sample-level membership inference (determining if specific images were in training data) with artist-level data-use auditing (determining if any images from an artist were used).

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Public artworks → CLIP interrogator → prompts → suspicious model → generated images → style extractor (VGG) → discriminator → confidence scores → decision mechanism

**Critical path:**
The auditing process flows from public artworks through CLIP-based caption generation to querying the suspicious model, extracting style features at multiple VGG layers, passing through the discriminator, and making final decisions based on confidence scores.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Threshold vs. t-test:** Threshold is simpler and faster but more sensitive to outliers; t-test provides statistical rigor with lower FPR but requires more samples.
- **VGG layer selection:** Four evenly-spaced layers balance granularity with computational cost; the paper does not ablate this choice.
- **Data augmentation vs. distortion calibration:** Augmentation expands training data; distortion calibration accounts for generation artifacts. Both improve performance but add complexity.

**Failure signatures:**
- High FPR (> 0.2): Likely insufficient negative samples or discriminator overfitting to style-irrelevant features.
- Low accuracy on disjoint datasets (< 0.7): Artist's work may lack consistent style, or fine-tuning used too few images.
- Performance drop under image compression: Adversarial robustness issue; consider adversarial training.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Reproduce baseline on WikiArt/SD-V2:** Train discriminator for one artist, query fine-tuned model with 20 prompts, verify AUC > 0.96 using threshold-based decision. Compare t-test FPR against threshold FPR.
2. **Dataset transferability test:** Train discriminator on Artist A's artworks #1-10, fine-tune model on #11-20, audit with disjoint setup. Target accuracy > 0.72.
3. **Model transferability test:** Fine-tune suspicious model with BLIP captions, audit with CLIP interrogator. Verify accuracy remains > 0.85.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** How can ArtistAuditor be enhanced to maintain high auditing accuracy when the suspicious model is fine-tuned using a mixture of works from multiple artists, rather than a single target artist? The current method struggles with feature interaction when multiple artistic styles are combined in the fine-tuning dataset.

**Open Question 2:** To what extent does adversarial training mitigate the degradation of auditing performance caused by image compression or differential privacy perturbations applied to the artworks? The paper only provides preliminary results on JPEG compression.

**Open Question 3:** Can the auditing methodology be adapted to maintain reliability in "disjoint" scenarios where the auditor's available artworks have zero overlap with the specific works used to fine-tune the suspicious model? Table 3 shows significant accuracy drops in disjoint settings.

## Limitations
- Accuracy decreases when fine-tuning involves multiple artists' works simultaneously due to feature interference
- Sensitivity to image compression and adversarial perturbations, though preliminary adversarial training shows promise
- Performance degrades in disjoint dataset scenarios where auditor's artworks don't overlap with fine-tuning data

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The fundamental mechanism of using CNN multi-layer features as style fingerprints is well-established in neural style transfer literature. The high AUC values (>0.937) across multiple models and datasets provide strong empirical support.

**Medium Confidence:** The distortion calibration approach shows measurable improvement but lacks direct corpus support for this specific implementation. The real-world validation on Scenario provides external credibility but covers only 3 artists.

**Low Confidence:** The method's scalability to hundreds of artists and its performance in the presence of multiple simultaneous style fine-tuning remain untested. The paper doesn't address computational costs at scale or provide runtime benchmarks.

## Next Checks

1. **Adversarial Robustness Test:** Apply adversarial perturbations (PGD, FGSM) to generated artworks and measure AUC degradation. Compare baseline performance (0.921 AUC under JPEG compression) against adversarially trained discriminators.

2. **Multi-Artist Fine-Tuning Experiment:** Fine-tune models simultaneously on 2-5 artists' works and evaluate ArtistAuditor's ability to detect individual style piracy. This directly tests the stated limitation about "feature interference" between multiple styles.

3. **Scalability Benchmark:** Evaluate memory usage and inference time when auditing 50+ artists sequentially. The paper claims <13.18 GB per artist, but doesn't address total memory requirements or whether discriminators can be shared across artists to reduce redundancy.
