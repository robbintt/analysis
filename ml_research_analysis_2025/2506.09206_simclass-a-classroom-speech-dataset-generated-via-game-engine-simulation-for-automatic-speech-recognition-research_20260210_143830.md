- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09206

- Introduces SimClass, a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom noise using Unity Game Engine, producing a dataset that outperforms off-the-shelf datasets for classroom ASR tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the scarcity of large-scale classroom speech datasets, which has hindered the development of robust AI-driven speech recognition models for educational environments. The authors propose a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom noise using the Unity Game Engine, which accurately simulates the acoustic characteristics of real classrooms. They introduce SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus (MyST) with YouTube lecture videos (MIT OCW and Khan Academy) to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.

Experiments demonstrate that SimClass closely approximates real classroom speech, with ASR models trained on SimClass outperforming those trained on off-the-shelf datasets like Librispeech and TEDLIUM. The model fine-tuned on SimClass noisy and real classroom data (NCTE) achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 19.63% on the NCTE test set and 28.52% on the MPT test set. Additionally, SimClass shows promise for speech enhancement tasks, with significant improvements in metrics like PESQ, ESTOI, and SI-SDR when fine-tuning a speech enhancement model. The dataset is publicly available and opens new avenues for research in classroom speech recognition and enhancement.

## Method Summary
The authors developed SimClass by leveraging the Unity Game Engine to simulate realistic classroom acoustic environments. They created a 3D classroom model with movable chairs, adjustable noise sources, and configurable reverberation properties. The simulation includes ambient noise from HVAC systems, student chatter, and movement sounds. For speech data, they combined the MyST children's speech corpus with YouTube lecture videos from MIT OCW and Khan Academy to create realistic teacher-student interaction scenarios. The clean speech is then mixed with the synthesized classroom noise at various Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) to generate the final dataset. The entire pipeline is designed to be scalable and reproducible, allowing for easy generation of additional data with different classroom configurations.

## Key Results
- SimClass-trained ASR models achieved 19.63% WER on NCTE test set and 28.52% WER on MPT test set, outperforming Librispeech and TEDLIUM baselines
- Speech enhancement models fine-tuned on SimClass showed significant improvements in PESQ, ESTOI, and SI-SDR metrics
- The dataset demonstrates high fidelity to real classroom acoustics, with perceptual similarity confirmed through listening tests

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Unity Game Engine simulation captures complex acoustic interactions in classrooms by modeling sound propagation, reverberation, and noise sources with high fidelity. By combining this with realistic speech sources (children's voices and teacher lectures), the dataset generates training data that closely matches the acoustic characteristics of actual classroom environments. The scalable nature of the simulation allows for diverse acoustic scenarios, including different room sizes, noise levels, and speaker positions, which helps models generalize better to real-world classroom conditions.

## Foundational Learning

**Game Engine Acoustic Simulation**
- Why needed: Traditional synthetic data generation lacks realistic spatial audio modeling
- Quick check: Can the simulation reproduce known acoustic phenomena like early reflections and late reverberation?

**Classroom Noise Modeling**
- Why needed: Classroom environments have unique noise profiles (student chatter, movement, HVAC) that differ from typical office or outdoor environments
- Quick check: Does the noise spectrum match measured classroom noise profiles from literature?

**Multi-Source Speech Mixing**
- Why needed: Real classrooms involve overlapping speech from multiple speakers at varying distances
- Quick check: Can the mixing process preserve speech intelligibility while maintaining realistic SNR distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Unity Engine -> Acoustic Simulation -> Noise Corpus -> MyST + Lecture Videos -> Clean Speech -> SNR Mixing -> SimClass Dataset

**Critical Path**
The most critical path is the acoustic simulation in Unity, which must accurately model room acoustics, sound propagation, and noise sources. Any inaccuracies here will propagate through the entire dataset and degrade model performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The authors prioritized scalability and reproducibility over absolute acoustic perfection. While the Unity simulation is sophisticated, it cannot capture every nuance of real classroom acoustics. However, the ability to rapidly generate diverse training data outweighs this limitation.

**Failure Signatures**
Poor model performance on real classroom data despite good SimClass results would indicate simulation inaccuracies. Specifically, failure to handle overlapping speech or distant speakers suggests the acoustic modeling needs refinement.

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Train an ASR model on SimClass and evaluate on a held-out portion of the real classroom test set to establish baseline performance
2. Compare WER improvements when fine-tuning a pre-trained model on SimClass versus traditional datasets
3. Evaluate speech enhancement performance by measuring objective metrics (PESQ, ESTOI, SI-SDR) on enhanced versus clean speech

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation primarily relies on Word Error Rate (WER), which may not fully capture nuanced challenges of classroom speech recognition
- The comparison is limited to a small set of existing datasets (Librispeech, TEDLIUM), lacking broader benchmarking
- The acoustic simulation may not capture all real-world variables such as varying room acoustics, microphone placement, or dynamic student movement patterns

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The dataset generation methodology is sound and produces effective training data for classroom ASR tasks. The results show clear improvements over baseline models.

**Medium confidence**: The generalizability of results across different classroom environments and the long-term utility of the dataset for diverse speech recognition tasks beyond tested scenarios. The speech enhancement results are promising but need further validation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive real-world testing across diverse classroom environments (different sizes, materials, and noise conditions) to validate the generalizability of the SimClass dataset.

2. Perform a comprehensive comparison with other synthetic classroom datasets and real classroom recordings to benchmark the relative performance and utility of SimClass.

3. Evaluate the dataset's effectiveness for downstream tasks such as speaker diarization, speech separation, and child-specific ASR to assess its broader applicability.
