# Large Language Models Meet Stance Detection: A Survey of Tasks, Methods, Applications, Challenges and Future Directions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.08464
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08464
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Survey presents taxonomy of LLM-based stance detection approaches across learning methods, data modalities, and target relationships

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines how large language models have transformed stance detection in natural language processing. The authors present a novel three-dimensional taxonomy categorizing LLM-based approaches by learning methods (supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, zero-shot), data modalities (unimodal, multimodal, hybrid), and target relationships (in-target, cross-target, multi-target). The paper analyzes over 40 benchmark datasets, reviews performance trends, and identifies key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, and social media moderation. Critical challenges include handling implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, with proposed future directions including explainable stance reasoning and real-time deployment frameworks.

## Method Summary
The survey conducts a systematic review of LLM-based stance detection methods through a three-dimensional taxonomy framework. Methods are categorized by learning paradigm (fine-tuning, prompting, knowledge injection), data modality (text-only, multimodal, hybrid), and target relationship (same target, different target, multiple targets). The analysis draws on benchmark performance data from 40+ datasets spanning Twitter, Reddit, news articles, and online debates. The paper evaluates encoder-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) against decoder-based models (GPT-4) across zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised settings, with particular attention to cross-domain generalization and multimodal challenges.

## Key Results
- LLM-based methods achieve 53.1% to 89.5% F1-Macro across benchmark datasets, with significant variance based on prompt design and domain specificity
- Cross-target generalization remains challenging, with performance gaps exceeding 10% when models encounter unseen targets
- Multimodal stance detection requires specialized architectures combining vision and language models for effective handling of memes and cultural content
- Zero-shot approaches show promise but are sensitive to prompt engineering and inherited biases from pre-training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: LLMs improve stance detection through contextualized embeddings that capture target-text relationships implicitly.
- **Mechanism**: Pre-trained transformers encode semantic relationships between input text and target stance during self-supervised pre-training. Fine-tuning or prompting aligns these representations with stance-specific signals, enabling detection even without explicit indicators.
- **Core assumption**: Semantic patterns learned during pre-training transfer meaningfully to stance-relevant relationships.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "LLMs have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding"; [section 1] "LLM models can implicitly capture relationships between the input statement and the target stance"; Related paper "Is External Information Useful for Stance Detection with LLMs?"
- **Break condition**: Performance degrades with domain-specific targets, cultural references absent from training data, or reasoning beyond linguistic patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Zero-shot and few-shot stance detection work by reformulating classification as natural language inference.
- **Mechanism**: Stance detection is framed as "Does text T support/oppose target X?" The LLM leverages pre-trained semantic relationship understanding (entailment, contradiction) to predict stance without gradient updates.
- **Core assumption**: Pre-training included sufficient NLI-like reasoning patterns that generalize to stance inference.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot"; [section 3.3] "researchers frame stance detection as a natural language inference (NLI)"; [section 2.3] "In-Context Learning (ICL) enables models to perform new tasks by conditioning on examples within the prompt"; Related paper "Are Stereotypes Leading LLMs' Zero-Shot Stance Detection?"
- **Break condition**: Zero-shot fails with novel target concepts, cultural context requiring commonsense, or conflicting prompt design.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Knowledge injection enhances stance detection for implicit or cross-target scenarios.
- **Mechanism**: External knowledge (Wikipedia, ConceptNet, or LLM-generated context) is retrieved or generated to bridge semantic gaps between text and target. This knowledge is fused via attention mechanisms, graph neural networks, or prompt augmentation.
- **Core assumption**: Injected knowledge is accurate, relevant, and properly aligned with the stance detection task.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section 3.3] "Zhu et al. improve generalization by injecting Wikipedia-based knowledge into BERT"; [section 3.3] "Guo et al. use role-playing LLM agents to generate topic explanations"; [section 4.1] "Li et al. leverages ChatGPT to augment stance detection"; Related paper "Is External Information Useful for Stance Detection with LLMs?"
- **Break condition**: Knowledge injection fails with irrelevant/noisy knowledge, contradictory context, or fusion architecture unable to weight knowledge vs. original text signals.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transformer Self-Attention**
  - **Why needed here**: Stance detection requires modeling relationships between text tokens and target entities. Self-attention enables dynamic weighting of relevant context.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why BERT's bidirectional attention might capture stance signals differently than GPT's unidirectional attention?

- **Concept: Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning Paradigms**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper contrasts encoder-based models (fine-tuned) vs. decoder-based models (prompted). Understanding when to fine-tune vs. prompt is critical for architecture selection.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the difference between full fine-tuning, LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), and prefix-tuning, and when would you choose each for stance detection?

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering & In-Context Learning**
  - **Why needed here**: Zero-shot and few-shot stance detection rely on prompt design. Poor prompts lead to inconsistent or biased predictions.
  - **Quick check question**: How would you design a prompt for zero-shot stance detection that minimizes position bias (the model preferring the first option presented)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input layer (Text + Target [+ Image, Metadata]) -> Encoder backbone (BERT/RoBERTa fine-tuned OR GPT/LLaMA frozen with prompts) -> Knowledge module (optional: External KB retrieval OR LLM-generated context) -> Fusion layer (Attention-based fusion, GNN, or prompt concatenation) -> Classification head (Softmax over [favor, against, none] OR generative output)

- **Critical path**: 1. Define target relationship (in-target, cross-target, multi-target) → determines need for domain adaptation/knowledge injection. 2. Assess data availability: labeled data → fine-tune encoder; no labeled data → prompt-based decoder with ICL. 3. If stance is implicit or cultural → add knowledge injection module. 4. If multimodal → add visual encoder with cross-modal attention.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Encoder vs. Decoder: Encoders achieve higher F1 on benchmarks with fine-tuning but require labeled data. Decoders offer flexibility in zero-shot but show inconsistent performance (53.1% vs 89.5% F1 across datasets). Fine-tuning vs. Prompting: Fine-tuning is more reliable but costly. Prompting is fast but sensitive to phrasing. Unimodal vs. Multimodal: Multimodal improves performance on memes/videos but adds complexity and compute.

- **Failure signatures**: Implicit stance not detected: Model predicts "none" when stance is expressed through sarcasm or cultural reference → low recall on implicit-labeled test sets. Cross-target generalization fails: Model trained on "climate change" performs poorly on "vaccines" → high performance gap between in-target and cross-target benchmarks. Bias amplification: Model systematically favors certain demographics or political positions → check corpus paper on stereotypes in zero-shot stance detection.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate BERT (fine-tuned) vs. GPT-4 (zero-shot) on P-STANCE dataset to establish encoder vs. decoder tradeoffs. 2. Prompt sensitivity analysis: Test 3-5 prompt variations for zero-shot stance detection and measure F1 score variance. 3. Knowledge injection ablation: Add Wikipedia-based context for cross-target scenarios and compare F1 with vs. without knowledge.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How can stance detection models be evolved from classification tasks into "reasoning-centric" systems that provide faithful explanations and grounded evidence for their predictions? Basis: Section 10 discusses the shift toward "reasoning-centric and verifiable stance modeling." Why unresolved: Current models lack transparency in sensitive contexts like misinformation detection. Evidence needed: Agentic frameworks that output intermediate reasoning steps and evidence retrieval chains.

- **Open Question 2**: What specific fine-tuning methods are required for vision-language models to accurately detect stance in complex multimodal content involving sarcasm, memes, and cultural humor? Basis: Section 10.1 notes current models "struggle with interpreting sarcasm, memes, and contextual humour." Why unresolved: Semantic misalignment occurs between textual and visual cues in ironic or culturally specific multimedia. Evidence needed: Benchmarks showing superior performance on multimodal sarcasm datasets using fine-tuned architectures like CLIP or Flamingo.

- **Open Question 3**: Can retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or language-specific adapters effectively bridge the performance gap for stance detection in low-resource languages? Basis: Section 10.3 identifies "Cross-Cultural and Multilingual Adaptation" as a key future direction. Why unresolved: Annotated datasets are scarce for non-English languages, and cultural nuances complicate direct transfer learning. Evidence needed: Studies demonstrating comparable performance between resource-rich English and low-resource languages using these augmentation techniques.

## Limitations
- Performance comparisons lack standardization in evaluation protocols and implementation details across different methods
- Critical implementation details (prompt templates, hyperparameters, data preprocessing) are not provided for most reviewed methods
- Claims about real-world deployment readiness and practical superiority lack empirical validation in production settings

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The three-dimensional taxonomy framework is methodologically sound and provides useful organization for existing research
- **Medium confidence**: Performance comparisons across datasets are informative but lack standardization in evaluation protocols
- **Low confidence**: Claims about real-world deployment readiness and practical superiority of LLM-based approaches over traditional methods lack empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Replication study**: Select 3-5 representative methods from different taxonomy categories and replicate their performance on standardized datasets using the same evaluation protocol. Compare results to reported benchmarks to assess reliability of published claims.

2. **Cross-target generalization experiment**: Train models on single targets (e.g., climate change) and evaluate performance across multiple unseen targets (e.g., vaccines, immigration). Measure performance degradation to validate claims about cross-target challenges.

3. **Real-world deployment simulation**: Implement a multimodal stance detection pipeline using recommended architectures. Test inference latency, computational costs, and accuracy on streaming social media data to assess practical deployment feasibility beyond benchmark performance.
