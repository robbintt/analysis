# Where Do the Joules Go? Diagnosing Inference Energy Consumption

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22076
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22076
- Reference count: 30
- Large-scale empirical study of AI inference energy consumption reveals order-of-magnitude variations across tasks, models, and hardware utilization

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study measuring energy consumption patterns in AI inference workloads, with a focus on generative AI models. The authors analyze 46 models across 7 tasks and 1,858 configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs, revealing significant variations in energy efficiency. They develop a systematic framework for understanding and optimizing inference energy consumption by identifying latent factors that mediate between configuration choices and observed metrics. The study provides actionable insights for datacenter operators managing power-constrained environments and offers a foundation for future research in sustainable AI deployment.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a large-scale empirical study measuring time and energy consumption across diverse AI inference workloads. They tested 46 models spanning 7 different tasks including image generation, video generation, language modeling, and multimodal applications. Measurements were performed on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs across 1,858 different configuration settings. The study systematically varied parameters such as batch size, precision, and model architecture to understand their impact on energy consumption. Energy measurements were collected at the system level using hardware monitoring tools, and throughput-per-watt analysis was performed for power-constrained datacenter scenarios.

## Key Results
- Task type causes up to 25× variation in energy consumption, with video generation consuming 100× more energy than image generation
- GPU utilization differences alone can cause 3-5× energy consumption gaps for the same workload
- The developed framework successfully explains energy variations through three latent factors: memory utilization, computational utilization, and resource constraints
- Throughput-per-watt analysis provides practical guidance for optimizing deployments in power-constrained datacenters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works by systematically measuring and analyzing energy consumption across a diverse set of AI inference workloads, then developing a framework that identifies the key latent factors mediating between configuration choices and energy outcomes. By collecting empirical data across multiple dimensions (tasks, models, configurations) and hardware platforms, the authors can isolate the effects of different variables and establish causal relationships between system parameters and energy consumption patterns.

## Foundational Learning

**GPU Architecture Fundamentals**: Understanding how modern GPUs execute parallel workloads and manage memory hierarchies is essential for interpreting energy consumption patterns. Quick check: Verify that the GPU's streaming multiprocessors and memory subsystems are properly understood in relation to utilization metrics.

**Power Measurement Methodologies**: System-level power monitoring techniques and their limitations must be understood to properly interpret the results. Quick check: Confirm that power measurements capture both active computation and idle state consumption.

**AI Model Characteristics**: Different model architectures (transformers, diffusion models, etc.) have distinct computational and memory access patterns affecting energy efficiency. Quick check: Map each model's computational characteristics to its measured energy profile.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Models -> GPU Hardware -> Power Monitoring System -> Energy/Throughput Metrics -> Framework Analysis

**Critical Path**: Model Selection → Hardware Configuration → Workload Execution → Power Measurement → Data Analysis → Framework Application

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes comprehensive empirical coverage over microarchitectural detail, measuring at system level rather than chip level. This provides broader insights but may miss fine-grained optimization opportunities.

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent energy measurements may indicate GPU thermal throttling, memory bandwidth saturation, or I/O bottlenecks. Unexpected utilization patterns could signal suboptimal kernel launches or memory access patterns.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate baseline measurements by running identical workloads across different GPU models to establish hardware-specific baselines
2. Test the framework's explanatory power by applying it to a new model family not included in the original study
3. Conduct controlled experiments varying single parameters (e.g., batch size) while holding others constant to isolate causal effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Results are based on specific NVIDIA GPU architectures and may not generalize to other hardware platforms
- The study covers only 46 models and 7 tasks, potentially missing important workload variations
- System-level energy measurements may mask important microarchitectural differences
- Framework validation is limited to the studied workload types and may require further testing in diverse deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Empirical measurements and observation of significant energy variation across tasks and models
- **Medium confidence**: Framework's ability to explain energy variations through latent factors
- **Medium confidence**: Throughput-per-watt analysis for power-constrained datacenters
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to other hardware platforms and workload types

## Next Checks
1. Replicate key findings on alternative GPU architectures (AMD, Intel) and CPU inference to test hardware portability
2. Validate the framework's explanatory power by applying it to additional model families and tasks not in the original study
3. Conduct controlled experiments isolating specific latent factors (e.g., varying batch size while holding utilization constant) to test causal relationships proposed by the framework
