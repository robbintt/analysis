# Procrustes Wasserstein Metric: A Modified Benamou-Brenier Approach with Applications to Latent Gaussian Distributions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16580
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16580
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: Introduces a modified Benamou-Brenier formulation that incorporates global invariance to isometries, leading to a closed-form expression for Gaussian distributions equal to the Euclidean distance between ordered eigenvalue vectors

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a modified Benamou-Brenier formulation of optimal transport that incorporates global invariance to isometries (rotations and translations). The key innovation is to penalize the transport action with a costless movement that preserves trajectory direction and speed. For Gaussian distributions, this leads to a closed-form expression: the distance equals the Euclidean distance between ordered vectors of eigenvalues. The method is applied to recovering latent Gaussian distributions from observed data transformed by unknown orthogonal matrices, providing an asymptotically unbiased estimator for the latent distribution's covariance structure up to an orthogonal transformation.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a Procrustes-Wasserstein metric that extends the classical Benamou-Brenier formulation by incorporating global invariance to isometries. This is achieved by introducing a modified transport cost that allows for costless movements preserving trajectory direction and speed. The key insight is that for Gaussian distributions, this modification leads to a computationally tractable closed-form expression. The method involves reformulating the optimal transport problem with additional constraints that account for rotational and translational invariance, enabling the recovery of latent Gaussian distributions from observed data that has been transformed by unknown orthogonal matrices.

## Key Results
- For Gaussian distributions, the Procrustes-Wasserstein distance equals the Euclidean distance between ordered vectors of eigenvalues
- Provides an asymptotically unbiased estimator for latent Gaussian distribution covariance structure up to orthogonal transformation
- Successfully bridges theoretical advancements in optimal transport with practical applications in data recovery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Procrustes-Wasserstein metric works by modifying the classical Benamou-Brenier formulation to account for global invariances to isometries. By penalizing transport actions with costless movements that preserve trajectory direction and speed, the metric effectively captures meaningful data similarities while accounting for geometric invariances. For Gaussian distributions, this modification simplifies to a closed-form expression based on eigenvalue ordering, making it computationally tractable and theoretically sound.

## Foundational Learning
- Benamou-Brenier formulation: The dynamic formulation of optimal transport that describes mass transport as a fluid flow - needed to understand the baseline approach being modified
- Procrustes analysis: Statistical shape analysis technique for comparing shapes while accounting for rotation, translation, and scaling - needed to understand the geometric invariances being incorporated
- Gaussian distribution properties: Specifically eigenvalue decomposition and its role in characterizing covariance structure - needed to derive the closed-form expression for Gaussian cases

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Gaussian distribution properties -> Eigenvalue decomposition -> Ordered eigenvalue vectors -> Euclidean distance
- Critical path: Modified Benamou-Brenier formulation -> Incorporation of isometries -> Closed-form solution for Gaussians -> Application to latent distribution recovery
- Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency (closed-form solution) vs. applicability (limited to Gaussian distributions)
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation with non-Gaussian distributions, computational complexity in high dimensions
- First experiments:
  1. Validate closed-form expression on synthetic Gaussian distributions with known eigenvalues
  2. Test latent distribution recovery on simulated data with known orthogonal transformations
  3. Assess scalability by applying to increasingly high-dimensional Gaussian distributions

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation on high-dimensional datasets (e.g., images or genomics data) to assess scalability and performance in practical scenarios
2. Extension of the method to non-Gaussian distributions, particularly mixture models or heavy-tailed distributions
3. Comprehensive robustness analysis including sensitivity to noise, outliers, and sample size variations
