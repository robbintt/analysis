- One-line primary result: Achieved +3.7 BB/100 net win rate vs field average -13.0 BB/100

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the prevailing "solver" orthodoxy in poker AI by introducing Patrick, an AI designed to exploit human weaknesses rather than play unexploitably. The core method is a heuristic framework that models opponent behavior and psychological tendencies through adaptive modules like Search and Destroy (exploits player archetypes), Ranges (refines opponent hand probability), and The Lawnmower (models opponent perception). In a 64,267-hand trial against 7,159 players at 1¢/2¢ stakes, Patrick achieved a +3.7 BB/100 net win rate, outperforming the field average of -13.0 BB/100 by 16.0 BB/100. Qualitative analysis showed targeted exploitation, strategic adaptability, and disciplined risk management. The work demonstrates that modeling and attacking human imperfection can be more effective than perfect theoretical play in real-world poker.

## Method Summary
The system uses a three-tier architecture: World Interface (OCR + control), Game and Translation Engine (rules + state parsing), and Brain (decision modules). The Brain contains supporting modules (HAA for style randomization, RSM for hand strength abstraction, Memory for perfect recall) and decision modules (GA for baseline strategy, Ranges for opponent modeling, SAD for exploitation, Lawnmower for deception). Learning anchors on prediction accuracy rather than financial outcomes—after showdowns, hands are re-run with perfect information and reinforcement/corrective deltas update the RSM based on prediction accuracy. Continuous statistical profiling enables non-showdown exploitation through archetype classification and targeted recommendations.

## Key Results
- +3.7 BB/100 net win rate in 64,267-hand trial against 7,159 players
- Outperformed field average of -13.0 BB/100 by 16.0 BB/100
- Demonstrated targeted exploitation through case studies: thin value bets against "Calling Stations," pre-flop blind stealing from tight players, and accurate hand reading using Range Reshaping Templates
- Qualitative analysis showed adaptability to opponent types and disciplined risk management

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Range Reshaping via Action-Conditioned Probabilistic Templates
Opponent hand distributions are systematically narrowed by applying pre-defined probabilistic models (RETs) after each observed action. The Ranges module assigns initial hand distribution based on archetype and pre-flop action, then applies RETs after each subsequent action. Each RET re-weights probability of different hand strength categories, producing an updated "Chance I'm Beat" (ChiB) metric. Core assumption: opponent actions correlate reliably with hand strength categories in predictable, archetype-specific ways.

### Mechanism 2: Archetype-Based Targeted Exploitation
Classifying opponents into behavioral archetypes enables high-conviction exploitative plays that deviate from baseline strategy. The Search and Destroy (SAD) module plots opponents on a VPiP × Aggression Factor matrix, classifies them (Rock, Fish, Whale, etc.), then weaponizes identified vulnerabilities (e.g., "folds to turn barrels 80%" → recommend double-barrel bluff regardless of hand strength). Core assumption: player statistics stabilize quickly enough and remain consistent within an archetype; opponents do not adapt to being exploited.

### Mechanism 3: Prediction-Anchored Learning (Not Outcome-Anchored)
Anchoring ML updates on prediction accuracy rather than financial results enables learning despite extreme variance in poker outcomes. After showdowns, the system re-runs hands with perfect information, comparing predictions at each decision point to ground truth. Correct predictions receive small reinforcement deltas; incorrect predictions receive larger corrective deltas to the Relative Strengths Matrix (RSM). Core assumption: prediction accuracy is a stable proxy for decision quality; the RSM is the correct locus for improvement.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Nash Equilibrium / GTO Play**
  - Why needed here: The paper positions Patrick explicitly against solver-based GTO approaches; understanding what "unexploitable" means is prerequisite to understanding the exploitative alternative.
  - Quick check question: If an opponent plays a perfect Nash Equilibrium strategy, can Patrick's exploitative approach still profit?

- **Concept: Range and Range Narrowing**
  - Why needed here: The core technical apparatus (RETs, rS distributions, ChiB) all depend on understanding hand ranges as probability distributions over possible holdings.
  - Quick check question: If an opponent calls a pre-flop raise, then calls a flop c-bet on a dry board, how should their range change compared to pre-flop?

- **Concept: Variance and Statistical Significance in Poker**
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes that 10,000-hand samples are insufficient for conclusions; interpreting the +3.7 BB/100 result requires understanding confidence intervals.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper claim the "All-in Adjusted" metric captures only ~2% of total variance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Screen data → GTE (parse game state) → RSM (compute relative strength) → Ranges/SAD (model opponent) → MA (resolve conflicting recommendations) → GTE → WI (execute action)

- **Critical path:** Screen data → GTE (parse game state) → RSM (compute relative strength) → Ranges/SAD (model opponent) → MA (resolve conflicting recommendations) → GTE → WI (execute action)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - RSM as abstraction layer: Reduces combinatorial explosion but may lose granular hand-reading nuance
  - Modular decision architecture: Enables targeted exploitation but adds complexity in conflict resolution (MA must weight conflicting module advice)
  - Prediction-anchored learning: Robust to variance but requires showdown data (limited in real play)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - System crashes from UI changes (paper documents one failure from poker site interface alteration)
  - Incorrect archetype classification for small-sample opponents
  - RET misapplication if opponent action semantics differ from training assumptions

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate RSM outputs: Run RSM on historical hands with known outcomes; measure correlation between predicted relative strength and actual showdown strength
  2. Test RET accuracy in isolation: For hands with showdowns, measure whether RET-weighted ranges correctly capture actual holdings (compute calibration metrics)
  3. A/B test prediction-anchored vs. outcome-anchored learning: Run parallel RSM versions; compare prediction accuracy and win rate drift over 50,000+ hands

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would Patrick's exploitative "sword" approach remain effective at higher stakes against more technically proficient opponents?
- Basis in paper: Limitations section states the trial was "conducted exclusively in the 1¢/2¢ micro-stakes environment" and notes this player pool "is not representative of the more strategically uniform and technically proficient opponents found at higher stakes."
- Why unresolved: The architecture was purpose-built for exploiting human weaknesses prevalent at micro-stakes; whether the same heuristic framework succeeds against stronger, less exploitable player pools is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled trial at mid-stakes (e.g., $1/$2 or higher) against a more skilled player pool over a statistically significant sample.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Patrick's heuristic framework generalize to broader, less-structured environments requiring human-machine collaboration?
- Basis in paper: Future Work section states: "Future work will seek to generalise this 'sword-based' philosophy beyond a single game, focusing on the development of a framework for modelling the complex heuristics that underpin human decision-making in broader, less-structured environments."
- Why unresolved: The architecture was designed for poker's closed system with defined rules and actions; real-world environments lack such structure and have far more variables.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of a modified framework to domains like decision-support systems or adaptive training tools, demonstrating cross-domain transfer.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the long-term sustainability of Patrick's win rate over a sample of 200,000+ hands?
- Basis in paper: Limitations section states: "A larger sample, potentially 200,000 hands or more, would be required to achieve a higher degree of confidence in the long-term sustainability of this win rate."
- Why unresolved: The 64,267-hand sample, while statistically significant, may still be subject to variance distortions; confidence intervals remain at approximately ±2 BB/100.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extended trial data exceeding 200,000 hands demonstrating consistent win rate within narrower confidence bounds.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How would Patrick perform in direct competition against solver-based AI systems like Libratus or Pluribus?
- Basis in paper: The paper critiques solver-based approaches as theoretically defensive but not optimized for exploiting human patterns, yet provides no head-to-head empirical comparison between the two philosophies.
- Why unresolved: The paper compares results across different contexts (micro-stakes cash vs. tournament exhibition), making direct philosophical comparison impossible.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled match between Patrick and a solver-based AI under identical conditions, with hand histories made publicly available.

## Limitations
- Technical opacity: Exact numerical formulations for RETs, RSM update rules, and MA weighting schemes are not fully specified
- Sample size concerns: 64,267 hands may be insufficient to validate long-term robustness against adaptive opponents
- Archetype stability assumption: Reliance on opponent behavior remaining consistent within classified archetypes represents a fundamental vulnerability

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The architectural framework and conceptual approach are well-documented. The modular design with specialized exploitation components represents a coherent alternative to GTO orthodoxy.
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported +3.7 BB/100 win rate and 16.0 BB/100 improvement over field average appear technically feasible given the exploitation targets, but verification requires access to raw hand data and independent replication.
- **Low Confidence**: The precise numerical implementations of RETs, RSM update rules, and MA weighting schemes are insufficiently specified.

## Next Checks
1. **RSM Output Validation**: Run the Relative Strengths Matrix on a benchmark dataset of historical hands with known outcomes. Measure correlation between RSM-predicted hand strength categories and actual showdown hand strengths across different board textures and stack depths.

2. **RET Calibration Testing**: For hands with showdowns where Patrick applied Range Reshaping Templates, compute calibration metrics comparing predicted hand distributions (weighted by RETs) against actual opponent holdings. Test whether strong hands are correctly weighted as likely when opponent takes passive lines, and vice versa.

3. **Prediction-Anchored vs Outcome-Anchored Learning A/B Test**: Implement parallel RSM versions—one updated via prediction-anchored learning (current approach) and one updated via traditional outcome-anchored reinforcement learning. Run both versions for 50,000+ hands each, measuring prediction accuracy drift and win rate convergence to determine which learning signal produces superior long-term performance.
