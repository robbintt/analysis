## Executive Summary
This study developed machine learning models to predict pathological complete response (PCR) and 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The key innovation was using longitudinal contrast-enhanced MRI with advanced image registration to extract features from the original tumor site across multiple timepoints, rather than just the residual tumor. Four feature extractors (one radiomics-based, three deep learning-based) were combined with three feature selection methods and four ML models. The best performance was achieved with radiomic features and logistic regression, yielding AUC of 0.88 and accuracy of 0.85 for PCR prediction, and AUC of 0.78 and accuracy of 0.72 for RFS prediction. The image registration approach significantly improved predictive performance compared to using baseline MRI alone, demonstrating the value of monitoring tumor changes throughout treatment.

## Method Summary
The study utilized a dataset of 665 patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy at Nottingham University Hospital, focusing on 61 patients with longitudinal MRI data. The methodology employed a novel longitudinal registration framework (MrRegNet) to align MRI scans across treatment timepoints, enabling feature extraction from the original tumor site. Four feature extractors were used: radiomics features, and deep learning-based features from pre-trained ResNet-50, VGG-16, and DenseNet-121 models. Three feature selection methods (RFE, RFE-SVM, RFE-XGB) were applied to reduce dimensionality. Four machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, SVM, XGBoost) were trained to predict PCR and RFS outcomes. The best-performing combination was radiomic features with logistic regression, achieving superior interpretability and performance.

## Key Results
- Radiomic features with logistic regression achieved AUC of 0.88 and accuracy of 0.85 for PCR prediction
- The same combination achieved AUC of 0.78 and accuracy of 0.72 for 5-year RFS prediction
- Image registration significantly improved predictive performance compared to baseline MRI alone
- Radiomic features outperformed deep learning-based features in this dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The longitudinal registration framework captures tumor evolution throughout treatment rather than just residual changes, providing more comprehensive information about treatment response. By aligning images across timepoints, the method can track specific tumor characteristics that may indicate early response or resistance to therapy. The combination of radiomic features with logistic regression provides both high predictive performance and clinical interpretability, making the model more actionable for treatment planning decisions.

## Foundational Learning
**Contrast-Enhanced MRI in Oncology**
Why needed: Provides vascular information and tumor enhancement patterns that correlate with treatment response
Quick check: Understand T1-weighted pre- and post-contrast sequences and their role in assessing tumor vascularity

**Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response Assessment**
Why needed: Differentiates between complete pathological response and residual disease, critical for treatment planning
Quick check: Know the criteria for pathological complete response (absence of invasive cancer in breast and lymph nodes)

**Radiomics Feature Extraction**
Why needed: Converts medical images into quantitative descriptors that capture tumor heterogeneity and texture
Quick check: Understand first-order (statistical), shape, and texture (GLCM, GLRLM) features and their clinical relevance

**Image Registration in Longitudinal Studies**
Why needed: Enables consistent feature extraction from the same anatomical region across multiple timepoints
Quick check: Understand affine and deformable registration and their importance in tracking tumor changes over time

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Patient Data -> Image Registration (MrRegNet) -> Feature Extraction (Radiomics/Deep Learning) -> Feature Selection (RFE/RFE-SVM/RFE-XGB) -> ML Model (Logistic Regression/Random Forest/SVM/XGBoost) -> Prediction Output

**Critical Path**
The critical path is: Image Registration -> Feature Extraction (Radiomics) -> Feature Selection (RFE) -> Logistic Regression, as this combination yielded the best performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Radiomics vs Deep Learning: Radiomics offered better interpretability and performance with limited data, while deep learning has potential for larger datasets
- Feature Selection Methods: Multiple methods tested but RFE provided optimal balance of performance and simplicity
- ML Models: Logistic regression chosen for interpretability despite potential performance gains from more complex models

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor registration quality would lead to feature extraction from incorrect anatomical locations
- Overfitting in deep learning features due to high dimensionality relative to sample size
- Feature selection failure could result in noisy or irrelevant features degrading model performance

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Test registration accuracy by visual inspection and overlap metrics on a subset of patient images
2. Compare radiomic feature distributions between PCR and non-PCR patients to validate biological relevance
3. Perform ablation study removing clinical features to assess their contribution to model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would end-to-end fine-tuning of deep learning feature extractors outperform handcrafted radiomics if applied to larger, multi-center datasets?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly state that deep learning extractors underperformed compared to radiomics, potentially because "the dimensionality of the deep learning features is much higher... given this relatively small dataset."
- Why unresolved: The study used pre-trained extractors without fine-tuning on the target dataset, leaving the potential of domain-adapted deep learning features unexplored relative to sample size.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison study on a dataset with n > 1000 showing fine-tuned deep learning features significantly outperforming the static radiomic baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the proposed longitudinal registration framework robust to external validation cohorts with differing MRI acquisition protocols and scanner manufacturers?
- Basis in paper: The study utilizes a "large local dataset" (n=665) from a single institution (Nottingham University Hospital), but does not report results on external test sets.
- Why unresolved: While the method improved performance internally, the generalizability of the MrRegNet registration and feature extraction pipeline remains unproven across different clinical environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: AUC and accuracy metrics reported on a hold-out validation cohort from a separate hospital or clinical trial.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the predictive accuracy of the aligned longitudinal model vary significantly across specific molecular subtypes (e.g., Triple Negative vs. HR+/HER2-)?
- Basis in paper: The paper cites related work (Kim et al. [8]) showing accuracy varies by subtype and includes ER/HER2 status as features, but reports aggregate performance rather than subtype-specific stratification.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the "texture information at the original tumour site" provides equal predictive value for all subtypes, or if the 0.88 AUC is skewed by specific biological behaviors.
- What evidence would resolve it: A breakdown of PCR and RFS prediction accuracy (AUC) stratified by the four major molecular subtypes.

## Limitations
- Small sample size for deep learning feature extraction (61 patients) may have limited performance
- Single-institution dataset raises concerns about generalizability to diverse populations
- Focus on HER2-negative tumors limits applicability to all breast cancer subtypes
- Limited follow-up period for some patients may affect RFS prediction accuracy

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Longitudinal MRI analysis with image registration improves prediction accuracy compared to baseline-only approaches (supported by clear methodology and interpretable results)
- Radiomic features with logistic regression provides superior interpretability for clinical use

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Radiomic features are superior to deep learning approaches for this specific dataset and task
- The 5-year RFS prediction performance (AUC 0.78) is reliable despite some patients having shorter follow-up periods

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The optimal feature selection method has been definitively identified
- Results are directly generalizable to all breast cancer subtypes and treatment regimens

## Next Checks
1. External validation on independent datasets with diverse patient demographics and tumor subtypes to assess generalizability
2. Prospective clinical trial comparing radiomic-based prediction models against standard clinical assessment for treatment planning decisions
3. Analysis of model performance across different chemotherapy regimens and patient subgroups to identify potential confounding factors
