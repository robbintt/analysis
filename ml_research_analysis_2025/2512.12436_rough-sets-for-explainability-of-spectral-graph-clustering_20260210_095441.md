# Rough Sets for Explainability of Spectral Graph Clustering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.12436
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12436
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Novel rough set-inspired method removes "boundary" documents from graph spectral clustering to improve accuracy and explainability, increasing F1 scores from 42% to 0% error in some cases.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the explainability challenge in graph spectral clustering (GSC) for text documents by filtering out "boundary" documents before clustering. The method identifies documents with low discernibility between within-cluster and between-cluster similarities using rough set theory concepts, removing them to create a cleaner block-diagonal similarity structure. Experiments show significant improvements in clustering accuracy across multiple GSC algorithms (L-based, K-based, N-based, B-based) and enhanced explainability through centroid-based textual explanations.

## Method Summary
The approach filters text documents based on their cosine similarity discernibility before applying spectral clustering. For each document, it calculates the difference between the average of the top 5% and bottom 5% similarities to other documents. Documents where this difference falls below a threshold (t=0.1 or 0.2) are classified as "boundary" elements and removed. The remaining "core" documents are then clustered using various GSC algorithms, and cluster explanations are generated by computing centroids in the original Term Vector Space.

## Key Results
- Filtering improves L-based clustering accuracy from 58.3% error to 0% error on TWT.3 dataset with t=0.2
- Multiple GSC algorithms (L, K, N, B-based) converge to similar solutions after filtering boundary elements
- Centroid-based explanations in Term Vector Space align perfectly with true hashtags after filtering
- Method demonstrates effectiveness on both synthetic block-diagonal matrices and real tweet datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Removing documents with low similarity discernibility improves spectral clustering accuracy on text data
- **Mechanism:** The system calculates the difference between average top 5% and bottom 5% cosine similarities for each document. Documents below threshold t are classified as "boundary" elements and removed, isolating "core" documents that exhibit strong within-cluster similarity and weak between-cluster similarity
- **Core assumption:** Documents without a clear gap between nearest and furthest neighbors do not belong to distinct conceptual clusters and distort the embedding space
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.4 specifies the filtering method; Section 4.3 shows L-based clustering error dropping from 58.3% to 0% after filtering with t=0.2
- **Break condition:** Fails when dataset lacks distinct semantic clusters (uniform "sea of objects")

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Filtering boundary elements enables multiple spectral clustering algorithms to converge on similar solutions
- **Mechanism:** Real-world noise causes relaxation-based approximations to diverge because they get stuck in local optima or are skewed by outliers. Removing noise creates core data structure satisfying theoretical requirements where distinct optimization criteria converge to same solution
- **Core assumption:** True clusters exist and are detectable by standard graph cut criteria if noise is eliminated
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 4.1 notes convergence under ideal settings; Section 4.2 derives mathematical conditions for similar results
- **Break condition:** Convergence fails with heavily unbalanced cluster volumes or non-linear embeddings not addressed by specific embeddings

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Method preserves explainability in textual domain by restricting cluster definition to core documents
- **Mechanism:** Unlike standard GSC operating in opaque spectral space, this approach uses filtered core documents to compute centroids in original Term Vector Space. Excluding boundary documents prevents centroid from being "dragged" away from semantic center
- **Core assumption:** Semantic meaning of cluster is best represented by most typical (core) members rather than average of all members
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 4.4 shows top words of L-based clusters align perfectly with true hashtags after filtering; Abstract highlights centroid-based explanations
- **Break condition:** Fails when remaining core documents are too few to form statistically significant centroid or when term vectors are high-dimensional/sparse

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Graph Spectral Clustering (GSC) & Laplacians**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper compares four GSC variants (L, K, N, B-based) defined by specific Laplacian matrices. Understanding that eigenvectors define clustering space is essential
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why eigenvectors corresponding to smallest non-zero eigenvalues of Graph Laplacian are used for clustering?

- **Concept: Rough Set Theory (Lower vs. Upper Approximation)**
  - **Why needed here:** Method adapts rough set concept of separating set into "core" (lower approximation—certain members) and "boundary" (uncertain members) to filter dataset
  - **Quick check question:** In Rough Sets, what is the difference between "lower approximation" and "upper approximation" of a set?

- **Concept: Term Vector Space & Cosine Similarity**
  - **Why needed here:** Explainability relies on mapping spectral clusters back to original text domain. Filtering metric depends entirely on cosine similarity distributions of document vectors
  - **Quick check question:** How does cosine similarity measure relationship between two document vectors, and what does value of 0.0 imply versus 1.0?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Vectorizer -> Similarity Engine -> Discernibility Filter -> Embedder -> Clusterer -> Explainer
- **Critical path:** Filtering step (Component 3) is novel critical path. Must occur before Laplacian calculation to ensure "block-diagonal" structure required for convergence
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Recall vs. Precision:** Aggressive filtering creates pure, explainable clusters but may discard valid data points on periphery of topic
  - **Stability:** Threshold t selection is currently heuristic (visual inspection of sorted avg_diff curve), requiring manual tuning per dataset
  - **Algorithm Choice:** While paper shows L, K, N, B converge on filtered data, some methods respond better to filtering than others
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **The "Vanishing Cluster" Effect:** Aggressive filtering can reduce certain hashtag clusters to zero elements, deleting categories from analysis
  - **Plateaued Similarities:** If input data is entirely noisy, avg_diff visualization shows no "elbow" or gap, making threshold selection impossible
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Visual Threshold Calibration:** Load TWT.3 dataset, compute similarity matrix, plot sorted avg_diff vector. Identify point where curve flattens to set threshold t
  2. **Convergence Validation:** Run both L-based and N-based clustering on filtered data. Calculate error rate (F1 score) against known hashtags to verify convergence claim
  3. **Ablation on "Boundary" Size:** Run pipeline with thresholds t=0.1 and t=0.2. Compare "top words" of resulting centroids to see if semantic explanation stabilizes as boundary documents are removed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Is fixed 5% threshold for top/bottom similarities optimal, and does using mean versus median of these intervals significantly impact stability of boundary detection? The authors state "Further research is clearly necessary... One can still ask whether to take an average or the median of those intervals." This remains unresolved as paper arbitrarily chose 5% and mean based on common outlier heuristics without verifying sensitivity or theoretical optimality.

- **Open Question 2:** Can threshold t for distinguishing core documents be derived automatically rather than determined through visual inspection? The methodology lists "By visual inspection choose the threshold t" as required step. This introduces subjectivity and limits scalability. A parametric or heuristic method correlating strongly with visually identified optimal points across benchmarks would resolve this.

- **Open Question 3:** How does choice of similarity interval boundaries (e.g., top/bottom 5%) depend on number of clusters k or cluster imbalance? The authors ask "whether or not the interval boundaries should depend on the number of envisaged clusters." If number of clusters is large or clusters are very small, top 5% of similarities might span multiple clusters, blurring discernability required for core extraction.

## Limitations
- Manual threshold tuning through visual inspection makes method less automated and potentially sensitive to dataset characteristics
- Aggressive filtering can eliminate entire clusters when cluster sizes are unbalanced, raising concerns about appropriateness for sparse boundary elements
- Method assumes documents naturally form distinct semantic clusters in cosine similarity space, which may not hold for overlapping topics or gradual transitions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Mathematical foundation connecting rough set theory to filtering mechanism and experimental demonstration that filtering improves convergence across multiple GSC algorithms
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that centroid-based explanations become more accurate after filtering, depending on sufficient core documents remaining
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability of specific threshold values (0.1, 0.2) across different text domains and method's robustness with significant cluster overlap

## Next Checks
1. **Threshold stability analysis:** Test method across multiple datasets with varying cluster densities and document counts to determine if optimal threshold consistently falls within 0.1-0.2 range or requires dataset-specific tuning
2. **Overlap scenario evaluation:** Apply method to datasets with known cluster overlap (e.g., documents containing multiple hashtags) to assess whether filtering mechanism appropriately handles boundary cases versus discarding valid data
3. **Core size impact study:** Systematically vary filtering threshold and measure minimum number of remaining documents per cluster required to maintain statistically meaningful centroid-based explanations, establishing practical limits for approach
