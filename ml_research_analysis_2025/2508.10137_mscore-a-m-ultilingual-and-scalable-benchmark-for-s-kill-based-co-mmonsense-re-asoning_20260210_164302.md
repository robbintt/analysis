core_contribution: mSCoRe introduces a multilingual and scalable benchmark for skill-based
  commonsense reasoning, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks that focus
  on single languages and lack fine-grained reasoning skill analysis. The benchmark
  employs a novel taxonomy of reasoning skills and a complexity scaling framework
  to systematically evaluate LLM reasoning processes across multiple languages and
  cultural contexts.

# mSCoRe: a $M$ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for $S$kill-based $Co$mmonsense $Re$asoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.10137
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10137
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces a multilingual benchmark with fine-grained reasoning skill analysis and dynamic complexity scaling, revealing current models' limitations in multilingual and cultural commonsense reasoning.

## Executive Summary
mSCoRe addresses the gap in existing commonsense reasoning benchmarks by introducing a multilingual and scalable evaluation framework. It combines a novel 10-skill taxonomy for fine-grained reasoning analysis with a complexity scaling mechanism that dynamically increases task difficulty. The benchmark evaluates models across multiple languages and cultural contexts, revealing significant performance gaps in non-English reasoning and cultural commonsense tasks.

## Method Summary
mSCoRe employs a 4-step pipeline: (1) Filtering seed data using Flow Judge for commonsense-ness and expandability, (2) Structured reasoning generation with skill-labeled atomic steps, (3) Complexity scaling by adding distractors and reasoning steps, and (4) Commonsense implicitation merging context into questions. The benchmark evaluates 8 state-of-the-art models using prompts requiring JSON-formatted reasoning steps before answering multiple-choice questions.

## Key Results
- Models show significant performance drops as complexity increases from L0 to L3, with limited improvement at higher levels
- GPT-4o achieves highest accuracy (53.2% on General, 54.2% on Social) while reasoning-specialized o1 underperforms in multilingual settings
- Skill analysis reveals models over-rely on deductive reasoning, particularly in social and cultural contexts where contextual or social reasoning would be more appropriate

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Skill-labeled atomic reasoning steps enable fine-grained diagnosis of where reasoning fails.
- **Mechanism**: Each reasoning step is classified into one of 10 skills, forcing explicit attribution of which skill the model should use at each elimination step.
- **Core assumption**: Models that perform well should distribute skill usage similarly to reference reasoning paths.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "a novel taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis"; [section 3.1.1] "each reasoning step...consists of three attributes: (1) Reasoning Skill"
- **Break condition**: If models achieve high accuracy using only a subset of skills, the taxonomy may not be predictive.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Complexity scaling by adding distractor options and context reveals depth limitations in model reasoning.
- **Mechanism**: At each complexity level, the pipeline adds one new plausible-but-incorrect option and requires one additional atomic reasoning step to eliminate it.
- **Core assumption**: Tasks requiring more elimination steps are genuinely harder, not merely longer.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "a complexity scaling framework allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically"; [section 3.2.1] "introduce an additional plausible but incorrect option"
- **Break condition**: If performance plateaus early across all models, the scaling may saturate the multiple-choice format.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Cultural commonsense tests expose reasoning-reinforced training overfit to logical tasks.
- **Mechanism**: Social/commonsense tasks require context-specific skills, but models like o1 are optimized on math/coding and default to deductive reasoning.
- **Core assumption**: High performance on formal tasks does not transfer to everyday, culturally grounded inference.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section 5.2] "o1 remains heavily dependent on deductive reasoning across all complexity levels"
- **Break condition**: If fine-tuning with balanced skill distributions closes the gap, the issue is data coverage not architecture.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Atomic Reasoning Step**
  - **Why needed here**: All analysis hinges on decomposing reasoning into minimal units that can be labeled by skill.
  - **Quick check question**: Given a reasoning chain, can you segment it such that removing any sub-step makes the logic incomplete?

- **Concept: Skill Taxonomy**
  - **Why needed here**: The 10-skill taxonomy provides the vocabulary for skill utilization analysis.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you classify "If I had left earlier, I would have caught the bus" as counterfactual reasoning?

- **Concept: Complexity Scaling via Option Expansion**
  - **Why needed here**: The benchmark's difficulty progression is a controlled increase in required reasoning steps via structured distractor addition.
  - **Quick check question**: If adding a distractor does not require a new skill to eliminate, does complexity actually increase?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Seed Data Filtering -> Structured Reasoning Generation -> Complexity Scaling -> Commonsense Implicitation
- **Critical path**: Filtering → Reasoning Generation → Complexity Scaling → Implicitation. Errors in early filtering compound, yielding low-differentiation benchmarks at higher levels.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Uses human-annotated seeds but LLM-scaling to reduce cost; risk of annotation bias from generator model
  - Multiple-choice format enables controlled scaling but may cap discriminative power
  - Fine-grained 10-skill taxonomy yields better performance than coarse 3-category but increases prompt complexity
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Models maintain ~3 reasoning steps regardless of task complexity
  - Accuracy drops sharply from L0→L2, then plateaus
  - Over-reliance on deductive reasoning in social contexts
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce L0–L3 accuracy curves for a new model; confirm step-count vs. complexity slope matches reference
  2. Ablate skill taxonomy: run same model with no-skill CoT, 3-category, and 10-skill prompts; compare accuracy and step distribution
  3. Leakage test: evaluate whether GPT-4o's advantage persists when using a different generator model for data synthesis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does the multiple-choice question-answer format impose a ceiling on the ability to discriminate model capabilities at very high levels of complexity?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Performance degradation slows significantly between Levels 3 and 6, suggesting "the multiple-choice question-answer format itself imposes certain limitations"
- **Why unresolved**: Unclear if the observed performance plateau is a failure of the models' reasoning capacity or a saturation effect of the static evaluation format
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluating the same high-complexity scenarios using generative or open-ended evaluation metrics

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Does reinforcement learning for specialized reasoning (e.g., coding/math) degrade general multilingual commonsense capabilities?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Reasoning-reinforced o1 model lags behind general GPT-4o model in non-English languages
- **Why unresolved**: The paper identifies the performance gap but does not isolate the specific mechanism causing the degradation
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Ablation studies comparing general-purpose models against reasoning-specialized variants on isolated multilingual commonsense tasks

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can models be trained to dynamically adapt their "reasoning skill" distribution rather than over-relying on deductive logic?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Analysis reveals that while the benchmark's reference reasoning diversifies skills at higher complexity, models like o1 remain "heavily dependent on deductive reasoning"
- **Why unresolved**: Current training methodologies do not explicitly incentivize models to switch reasoning paradigms based on the problem domain
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Training models with loss functions that reward matching a target distribution of reasoning skills

## Limitations

- Synthetic data generation via GPT-4o may introduce contamination effects, as GPT-4o performs best on its own benchmark
- Cultural commonsense evaluation depends on TikTok/Reddit seed data, which may not represent broader cultural contexts
- Performance plateaus at L2–L3 across models suggest the multiple-choice format may saturate before fully testing reasoning depth

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Complexity scaling mechanism and its effect on performance (accuracy drops with complexity, step counts plateau)
- **Medium confidence**: Skill taxonomy's diagnostic value (models over-rely on deductive reasoning, but whether this reflects genuine architectural bias versus training data distribution is unclear)
- **Medium confidence**: Cultural commonsense challenges (models struggle with social/moral reasoning, but TikTok/Reddit seed data may not generalize)

## Next Checks

1. **Leakage Test**: Re-run the benchmark using a different generator model (e.g., Claude-3.5 or Llama-3.1) for data synthesis and compare performance gaps between GPT-4o and other models.

2. **Skill Granularity Ablation**: Compare diagnostic power of the 10-skill taxonomy against 3-category and no-skill prompts using the same models.

3. **Step Count Validation**: For tasks at L2–L3, manually verify whether required reasoning steps genuinely increase versus models skipping elimination logic.
