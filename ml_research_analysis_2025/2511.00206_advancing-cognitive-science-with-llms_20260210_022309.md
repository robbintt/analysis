  enduring challenges in cognitive science, such as fragmented knowledge, vague theories,
  and inconsistent measurement. LLMs are shown to assist in constructing research
  maps that reveal cross-disciplinary connections, translating verbal theories into

# Advancing Cognitive Science with LLMs

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00206

- Large language models can address fragmentation, formalization, and measurement challenges in cognitive science

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates how large language models can address five key challenges in cognitive science: fragmented knowledge across subfields, verbal theories lacking precision, inconsistent measurement practices, limited generalizability of models, and context-dependent findings. LLMs can create research maps revealing cross-disciplinary connections, translate verbal theories into formal models, consolidate measurement taxonomies to reduce redundancy, serve as integrated frameworks for generalizable prediction, and provide contextualized representations of human behavior. The authors emphasize that LLMs should complement rather than replace human expertise, offering tools to make cognitive science more cumulative and coherent while acknowledging risks including interpretability issues, bias, and overreliance on closed models.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing research demonstrating LLM applications across cognitive science domains. Methods include semantic embedding of research artifacts (articles, constructs, measures) to create navigable knowledge maps; code generation from verbal theories to produce formal computational models; semantic clustering of measurement items to identify and consolidate redundant constructs; multitask training of foundation models on diverse behavioral datasets to create generalizable cognitive architectures; and simulation of human-like reasoning through persona-based prompting. Validation approaches include expert review, out-of-sample testing, benchmark comparison, and analysis of internal representations against neural activity patterns.

## Key Results
- LLM-generated semantic embeddings can identify overlapping constructs and reduce redundancy in psychological measures by ~75%
- Foundation models like Centaur can predict diverse cognitive tasks across domains while generalizing to unseen tasks
- Research maps reveal hidden linkages across siloed subfields through proximity-based clustering of semantic embeddings
- Measurement consolidation addresses jingle-jangle fallacies where same-named constructs differ or different-named constructs are identical
- LLMs enable formalization of verbal theories into executable code, facilitating precise predictions and systematic testing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can reveal cross-disciplinary connections by embedding research artifacts into shared semantic spaces where proximity reflects conceptual similarity.
- Mechanism: Text embedding models map titles, abstracts, and constructs into high-dimensional vectors; dimensionality reduction (e.g., PaCMAP) projects these into navigable 2D maps; clustering and keyword analysis then surface thematic structure and hidden linkages across siloed subfields.
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity in the embedding space corresponds to meaningful theoretical or methodological overlap, not merely lexical coincidence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "creating research maps to reveal cross-disciplinary links"
  - [section 2.1]: Thoma et al. mapped 15,043 theory-of-mind articles, revealing clusters (autism, child development, neuroscience) and tracing temporal evolution; "proximity indicates conceptual similarity"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers address LLMs in science broadly but not semantic mapping specifically
- Break condition: Embeddings conflate superficial lexical overlap with deep conceptual relations; maps reveal structure but require human interpretation to yield theoretical insight.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs can reduce measurement redundancy by aligning items and constructs within shared embedding spaces, enabling systematic consolidation of taxonomies.
- Mechanism: Items and construct labels are encoded as vectors; proximity in the shared space reveals semantic overlap; clustering supports reassignment or elimination of redundant constructs; this addresses jingle-jangle fallacies where same-named constructs differ or different-named constructs are identical.
- Core assumption: The semantic content captured by LLM embeddings reflects the psychological meaning of items and constructs as they function in measurement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "developing measurement taxonomies to reduce redundancy"
  - [section 2.3]: Wulff & Mata (2025) modeled thousands of personality items and hundreds of constructs; reproduced empirical item-scale relationships; demonstrated ~75% reduction in construct set through semantic reallocation
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence on measurement taxonomy consolidation
- Break condition: Semantic similarity does not guarantee functional equivalence; constructs may be semantically proximate but theoretically distinct; consolidation risks oversimplification.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Foundation models trained on diverse behavioral datasets can serve as unified cognitive architectures that generalize across tasks without task-specific redesign.
- Mechanism: Task instructions, stimuli, and trial histories are tokenized as text; transformer architecture (embedding, multi-head attention, feed-forward blocks) produces context-sensitive hidden representations; softmax output predicts behavioral responses; training across multiple tasks induces shared latent representations that transfer to unseen tasks.
- Core assumption: Cognitive tasks share underlying computational structure that can be captured in a single representational system; behavioral prediction generalization implies meaningful cognitive modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "building integrated frameworks for generalizable prediction"
  - [section 2.4]: Centaur (Binz et al., 2025) trained on behavioral datasets spanning decision-making, learning, memory, cognitive control; "explains substantial variance" and "generalizes to unseen tasks"; internal representations align with neural activity patterns
  - [corpus]: Neighbor paper "Bridging Minds and Machines" discusses AI-cognitive science integration but does not provide independent validation
- Break condition: Models may learn task-specific shortcuts rather than generalizable cognitive principles; good prediction does not guarantee explanatory or mechanistic validity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semantic embeddings
  - Why needed here: Core to research maps, measurement taxonomies, and contextualized representations; understanding how LLMs encode meaning into vector spaces is prerequisite for all five applications.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why two documents with similar embeddings might still represent theoretically distinct concepts?

- Concept: Formal vs. verbal theories
  - Why needed here: The paper's formalization mechanism depends on understanding what makes a theory "formal" (mathematical/computational precision) versus "verbal" (natural language ambiguity).
  - Quick check question: What information is lost when translating a verbal theory into executable code, and what is gained?

- Concept: Jingle-jangle fallacies
  - Why needed here: Central to measurement taxonomy work; "jingle" = same name, different construct; "jangle" = different name, same construct.
  - Quick check question: If two scales named "resilience" and "grit" have highly correlated item embeddings, which fallacy might be occurring?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer: Articles, verbal theories, measures, behavioral data, naturalistic text
  - Processing layer: Embedding models, fine-tuned foundation models, prompting pipelines
  - Output layer: Research maps, formal models, consolidated taxonomies, behavioral predictions, contextualized representations
  - Validation layer: Human expert review, out-of-sample testing, benchmark comparison

- Critical path:
  1. Define the cognitive science challenge (silos, formalization, measurement, generalization, or context)
  2. Select appropriate LLM approach (embedding-based mapping, code generation, semantic clustering, multitask training, or persona-based simulation)
  3. Prepare input data (corpus curation, task formalization, measure collection)
  4. Apply LLM processing with documented prompts/fine-tuning
  5. Validate outputs against expert judgment and empirical benchmarks
  6. Iterate with human oversight

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Open vs. closed models: Open-weight enables inspection, fine-tuning, reproducibility; closed APIs offer convenience but prevent verification of training data contamination
  - Prediction vs. explanation: High predictive accuracy may come at cost of interpretability; mechanistic insight requires additional interpretability methods
  - Consolidation vs. pluralism: Reducing redundancy may flatten theoretically important distinctions

- Failure signatures:
  - Brittle predictions: Small input variations cause large output changes (Centaur sensitivity)
  - Contamination: Model has seen evaluation benchmarks during training; apparent reasoning reflects memorization
  - Bias amplification: Training data skew toward WEIRD populations produces non-representative outputs
  - Opacity: Strong performance with no mechanistic interpretability

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate a research map on a small subfield (e.g., 500 articles) using open-weight embedding model; validate cluster assignments against expert categorization.
  2. Translate one verbal theory from your domain into executable code using LLM assistance; compare predictions against existing empirical data.
  3. Test measurement redundancy in a construct family (e.g., 3-5 related scales) using semantic embeddings; identify potential jingle-jangle cases for expert review.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Semantic embeddings may conflate lexical overlap with deep conceptual relations, requiring human interpretation
- Measurement consolidation risks oversimplifying theoretically important distinctions between semantically proximate constructs
- Good prediction does not guarantee valid cognitive modeling; models may exploit task-specific shortcuts rather than capturing general principles

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The identification of fragmentation, formalization, and measurement challenges in cognitive science is well-established
- **Medium Confidence**: Specific mechanisms (semantic mapping, measurement consolidation, foundation models) show promise but require broader validation
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about truly generalizable cognitive architectures capturing fundamental principles remain speculative

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the semantic mapping approach on a new subfield (e.g., 500 articles from social cognition) using an open-weight embedding model; have domain experts evaluate whether identified clusters and connections reflect genuine theoretical relationships or merely surface-level patterns.

2. Apply the semantic clustering approach to a well-studied construct family (e.g., working memory measures) where expert consensus exists; compare LLM-identified redundancies against established theoretical distinctions to assess whether consolidation preserves or erases important conceptual boundaries.

3. Systematically test Centaur-like models on structurally similar but previously unseen cognitive tasks; examine whether performance generalizes through shared representations or task-specific memorization by introducing minimal variations in task structure and stimuli.
