# Hypernym Mercury: Token Optimization Through Semantic Field Constriction And Reconstruction From Hypernyms. A New Text Compression Method

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.08058
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08058
- Authors: Chris Forrester; Octavia Sulea
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Over 90% token reduction while maintaining high semantic similarity to original text

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Mercury, a novel word-level semantic text compression method achieving over 90% token reduction while preserving high semantic similarity. The approach uses a structured "dart" representation that separates generalized core statements from detailed metadata, guided by game-theoretic importance scoring and multi-model verification. Experiments demonstrate consistent performance across diverse texts including Dracula and complex scientific passages, with the method being lossless and controllable in granularity.

## Method Summary
The Mercury method implements a five-stage pipeline: (1) Dart structuring, which splits text into a hypernym-abstracted core statement and key-value detail metadata; (2) Shapley value-based importance scoring to rank detail significance; (3) iterative detail swapping with hypernym replacement to achieve target compression; (4) multi-model verification where multiple LLMs independently reconstruct and validate semantic fidelity; and (5) dart-to-text reconstruction. The approach is tested on Dracula and five diverse passages from scientific, technical, and business genres, measuring token reduction and semantic similarity through ROUGE-L scores.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 90% token reduction while maintaining high semantic similarity
- Demonstrates consistent performance across different LLM models (dolphin-llama3, llama4-maverick, gpt4.1, gemini1.5-pro)
- Shows effectiveness on diverse text genres including narrative (Dracula) and technical passages
- Uses Shapley values for principled detail importance ranking and multi-model verification for quality assurance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Field Constriction via Hypernym Substitution
- Claim: Replacing specific entities with generalized terms (hypernyms) while preserving details in structured metadata reduces token count without semantic loss.
- Mechanism: The system parses input text, identifies specific entities, and replaces them with broader category terms in the "core statement." The original specifics are preserved in a compact key-value detail structure.
- Core assumption: Semantic "field" of meaning can be compressed by abstracting instances to categories, and reconstruction models can later expand hypernyms back to contextually appropriate specifics when needed.
- Break condition: If hypernym choice is too abstract or ambiguous, reconstruction may generate plausible but incorrect specifics.

### Mechanism 2: Game-Theoretic Importance Scoring (Shapley Values)
- Claim: Shapley value calculations from cooperative game theory provide a principled method for ranking detail importance during compression.
- Mechanism: Each detail is treated as a "player" in a cooperative game where the "payoff" is semantic fidelity. Shapley values compute the marginal contribution of each detail across all possible coalitions.
- Core assumption: Semantic contribution is compositional and can be modeled through cooperative game theory.
- Break condition: If the value function (semantic similarity measurement) is noisy or inconsistent, Shapley rankings become unreliable.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Model Verification for Fidelity Assurance
- Claim: Running compressed representations through multiple independent LLMs for verification catches semantic drift before final output.
- Mechanism: After compression, the dart is decoded by multiple LLMs. Each model's reconstruction is compared to the original for semantic similarity. If any model detects significant deviation, the system can reinstate dropped details.
- Core assumption: Inter-model agreement on reconstruction quality indicates true semantic preservation.
- Break condition: If all verification models share similar biases or blind spots, systematic errors may go undetected.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Hypernymy and Semantic Hierarchies**
  - Why needed here: The entire compression method depends on understanding IS-A relationships (e.g., "German Shepherd" IS-A "dog" IS-A "animal").
  - Quick check question: Given "Tesla Model 3," what are three valid hypernyms at different abstraction levels? Which would you choose if the context were "electric vehicles" vs. "luxury purchases"?

- **Concept: Shapley Values in Cooperative Game Theory**
  - Why needed here: The paper treats details as players contributing to a shared payoff (semantic fidelity).
  - Quick check question: If detail A contributes 0.3 to semantic fidelity alone, but contributes 0.7 when combined with detail B, what does this tell you about their interaction? How would Shapley account for this?

- **Concept: Semantic Similarity Metrics (ROUGE, Embedding Cosine)**
  - Why needed here: The paper claims "high semantic similarity" and shows ROUGE-L scores.
  - Quick check question: Why might a reconstruction score high on ROUGE-L but low on factual accuracy? What metric would you add to catch this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Text -> Parser/Linguistic Analyzer -> Dart Structurer -> Importance Scorer -> Compression Optimizer -> Multi-Model Verifier -> Output Generator

- **Critical path:** The Shapley value calculation is the computational bottleneck—exponential in detail count without approximation. The verification step is the quality gate; do not skip or reduce model count without benchmarking fidelity loss.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Compression ratio vs. fidelity: Higher abstraction = more tokens saved but greater reconstruction ambiguity. Tune per use case.
  - Verification cost vs. safety: More verification models = higher latency and cost but fewer silent failures.
  - Detail granularity vs. index overhead: Over-indexing saves tokens but requires full lookup at reconstruction.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Over-abstraction cascade: Core statement becomes so generic ("A thing happened") that reconstruction hallucinates wildly different specifics.
  - Shapley approximation error: If using approximate Shapley, low-importance details may be incorrectly ranked.
  - Cross-model inconsistency: Verification models disagree frequently → indicates compression is at the edge of recoverability.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline compression sweep: Run full pipeline on 50 paragraphs from different genres. Measure token reduction % and ROUGE-L at each compression level.
  2. Ablation on verification: Run same paragraphs with 1, 2, and 4 verification models. Measure false negative and false positive rates.
  3. Cross-model reconstruction: Compress with one LLM, reconstruct with a different LLM. Measure semantic drift vs. same-model reconstruction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why are specific technical genres (e.g., Neuroscience, String Theory) consistently harder to compress while retaining semantic similarity compared to narrative texts?
- Basis in paper: The authors observe that the third and fourth passages are consistently harder to compress while retaining the same level of semantic similarity with the original, noting the trend persists across all models tested.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the correlation between genre and compression difficulty but does not isolate the linguistic variables causing this degradation.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study correlating linguistic features with the "compatibility metric" or semantic similarity scores.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the "potential well" of semantic matches guarantee factual correctness versus merely high vector similarity?
- Basis in paper: The Discussion mentions the ability to find "arbitrarily higher numbers" in "potential wells" and acknowledges "glitches in any embedding," while simultaneously claiming the process is "lossless."
- Why unresolved: High semantic similarity scores in LLM embeddings do not always entail factual identity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A human-evaluated factual consistency check comparing the "Dart" reconstructions against the original source text.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the computational latency and cost overhead of the Shapley value calculations relative to the inference savings?
- Basis in paper: The method includes "Detail Importance Evaluation" using "Shapley value calculations derived from cooperative game theory," a method typically associated with high computational complexity.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on token reduction but does not benchmark the computational cost of the pre-inference "constriction" phase.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of the FLOPs or wall-clock time required for the Mercury compression API call versus the token-generation time saved during the LLM inference.

## Limitations

- **Shapley Value Implementation**: The paper claims to use cooperative game-theoretic Shapley values but does not specify the exact value function formulation for semantic fidelity, blocking exact reproduction.
- **Verification Model Selection**: While the approach mentions "multiple independent models," it does not specify which models, how many, or the exact verification protocol.
- **Hypernym Extraction Quality**: The paper assumes reliable hypernym identification and substitution but does not validate the accuracy of this step.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Token reduction >90% is technically achievable through aggressive abstraction and detail removal. The dart representation format is clearly specified and implementable.
- **Medium Confidence**: Semantic similarity preservation claims are plausible given the verification step, but the evaluation metrics (ROUGE-L, compatibility scores) are insufficient to guarantee true semantic fidelity.
- **Low Confidence**: The Shapley value-based importance scoring is the least validated component. Without knowing the value function formulation or seeing ablation studies, it's unclear whether this adds meaningful improvement over simpler heuristics.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Verification Models**: Run the compression pipeline on 100 diverse text passages with 1, 2, and 4 verification models. Measure false negative rate (semantic drift that passed verification) and false positive rate (good compression rejected). Identify the minimum verification model count that maintains acceptable quality while controlling computational cost.

2. **Cross-Model Reconstruction Portability**: Compress the same 50 paragraphs using four different LLMs (dolphin-llama3, llama4-maverick, gpt4.1, gemini1.5-pro). Then reconstruct each compressed dart using all four models. Measure semantic drift (via ROUGE-L and embedding similarity) when reconstruction uses a different model than compression.

3. **Human Evaluation of Semantic Fidelity**: Select 20 compressed-reconstructed pairs that achieved >90% token reduction. Have three human annotators independently rate semantic similarity (1-5 scale) and factual accuracy compared to originals. Compare human scores against automated metrics to identify systematic gaps where ROUGE-L overstates quality.
