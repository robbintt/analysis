# Bio-Inspired Classification: Combining Information Theory and Spiking Neural Networks -- Influence of the Learning Rules

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.06750
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06750
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Zofia Rudnicka; Janusz Szczepanski; Agnieszka Pregowska
- Primary result: Bioinspired learning algorithms achieve 97-99% classification accuracy with 10-100× faster processing than backpropagation

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the influence of different learning algorithms on spiking neural network (SNN) performance for classification tasks. The authors propose a bioinspired classifier combining SNNs with Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) to classify spatiotemporal neural data. They compare classical backpropagation with bioinspired methods like tempotron and SpikeProp across Bernoulli, Markov, and Poisson processes. Backpropagation achieves perfect classification accuracy but requires extremely high computational cost, making it impractical for real-time applications. Bioinspired algorithms provide increased computational efficiency while maintaining competitive performance, with some achieving 97-99% accuracy with significantly faster processing times.

## Method Summary
The study uses a three-layer LIF-based SNN architecture trained for 10 epochs on binary sequences converted to spike trains (Δt = 1ms). Classification is performed using normalized Lempel-Ziv complexity on output sequences. Seven learning algorithms are evaluated across three categories: unsupervised (Hebbian, STDP, SDSP), supervised (backpropagation, STBP, tempotron, SpikeProp, Chronotron, ReSuMe), and hybrid (ANN-SNN conversion, Reward-based STDP, BAL). Network configurations range from 16 to 1024 neurons per layer with thresholds {1.00, 0.50, 0.40, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05}, decline values {0.100, 0.05, 0.03, 0.01}, and learning rates {0.0500, 0.0100, 0.0010, 0.0098, 0.0001}.

## Key Results
- Backpropagation achieves perfect 100% accuracy but requires 866-12,916 seconds of computation time
- Tempotron achieves 96-100% accuracy in 7-40.5 seconds, providing 10-100× speedup
- SpikeProp achieves 91.5-100% accuracy in 20-64 seconds with similar efficiency gains
- Poisson process presents greatest challenge, with accuracy dropping below 50% for some algorithms and neuron configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Combining Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) with SNN outputs enables interpretable classification of spatiotemporal spike patterns without requiring differentiable loss functions. The SNN processes binary sequences through a three-layer LIF architecture, producing output spike trains that are converted back to binary sequences. LZC then quantifies structural complexity by counting distinct substrings, with normalized values approaching 0 for deterministic patterns and 1 for random sequences, enabling entropy-approximating classification.

### Mechanism 2
Bioinspired learning rules (tempotron, SpikeProp) achieve competitive accuracy (97-99%) with orders-of-magnitude lower computational cost than gradient-based backpropagation by leveraging event-driven synaptic updates. Unlike backpropagation requiring full gradient computation across all layers and timesteps, bioinspired algorithms use local spike-timing information. Tempotron adjusts weights based on membrane potential at spike times; SpikeProp minimizes spike timing errors through sparse, event-triggered updates rather than dense gradient propagation.

### Mechanism 3
Hybrid learning algorithms (ANN-SNN conversion, Reward-based STDP, BAL) offer improved adaptability to stochastic inputs like Poisson processes by combining structured pre-training with biologically plausible fine-tuning. ANN-SNN conversion leverages pre-trained ANN weights mapped to SNN synapses (w_SNN = w_ANN × τ_syn), providing stable initialization. BAL actively selects informative training samples based on uncertainty estimation, reducing sensitivity to noise. Reward-based STDP modulates synaptic plasticity with global signals, enabling adaptation without precise target spike times.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Model**
  - Why needed here: The entire SNN architecture is built on LIF dynamics (τ_m × dU/dt = -U + z(t)), governing how membrane potential integrates inputs and generates spikes.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how membrane time constant τ_m affects the temporal integration window of an LIF neuron?

- **Concept: Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**
  - Why needed here: STDP forms the basis for multiple learning algorithms evaluated (STDP, SDSP, Reward-based STDP) and represents a core bioinspired learning mechanism.
  - Quick check question: What determines whether a synapse strengthens or weakens under STDP, and how do time constants τ+ and τ- affect this process?

- **Concept: Lempel-Ziv Complexity**
  - Why needed here: LZC is the classification mechanism; understanding how it quantifies sequence complexity (C_α(x) counting distinct substrings, normalized to c_α ∈ [0,1]) is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Given a binary sequence, would you expect higher or lower normalized LZC for a Poisson process versus a Markov process, and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Layer (n neurons) -> LIF Hidden Layer (n neurons) -> Output Layer (n neurons) -> LZC Classifier
- **Critical path**: Binary sequence generation → Spike train encoding (Δt = 1ms) → LIF layer processing → Output spike decoding → LZC computation → Classification decision
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Accuracy vs. Speed: BP achieves 100% accuracy but requires 48,000+ seconds; tempotron achieves 96-100% in ~7-40 seconds
  - Neuron count vs. Generalization: Higher n improves accuracy for structured data but degrades performance for Poisson inputs
  - Biological plausibility vs. Performance: Pure bioinspired methods sacrifice 1-3% accuracy for 10-100× speed improvements
  - Threshold selection (0.05-1.00): Lower thresholds increase firing rates but may amplify noise sensitivity
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poisson process accuracy < 90%: Expected baseline difficulty; consider BAL or SDSP for improved adaptability
  - Computation time > 10,000s: Likely using BP/STBP on large networks; switch to bioinspired rules for time-sensitive applications
  - Accuracy decreases with neuron count: Indicates overfitting to noise (common in Poisson); reduce n or use regularization
  - MSE/MAE > 0.1: Significant prediction errors; verify threshold and learning rate tuning
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Implement Hebbian learning on Bernoulli process with n=128, threshold=1.00, η=0.01 over 10 epochs. Expected: ~99% accuracy in ~52s.
  2. Speed-accuracy tradeoff: Compare tempotron vs. backpropagation on Markov process with identical architecture (n=128). Expected: Tempotron ~90% in 40s vs. BP 100% in 6000s.
  3. Stochastic robustness test: Evaluate SDSP and BAL on Poisson process with reduced neuron count (n=64) and lower threshold (0.40). Expected: SDSP ~92.5%, BAL ~94.5%.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can a hybrid learning system dynamically select or switch between algorithms (e.g., Hebbian for structured data, BAL for stochastic inputs) based on real-time input characteristics to optimize the accuracy-computation trade-off? The conclusion states flexible hybrid architectures hold promise for enhancing performance under diverse conditions, but no adaptive switching mechanism is implemented or tested.

### Open Question 2
What is the theoretical and empirical role of individual spike contributions in learning when gradients cannot be computed, and how can this understanding improve bio-inspired learning rule design? The conclusion identifies advancing understanding of spike contributions in non-differentiable contexts as a key limitation, with no analysis of what information individual spikes contribute.

### Open Question 3
Do the relative performance rankings and accuracy-computation trade-offs observed for synthetic Bernoulli, Markov, and Poisson processes persist when classifying real-world neural or physiological signals? All experiments use artificially generated binary sequences, but the paper claims high precision for physiological patterns without validation on actual recorded neural data.

## Limitations

- LZC-based classification mechanism lacks detailed explanation of how complexity values map to specific class labels
- Parameters for stochastic process generation (Markov transition matrices, Poisson rates) are not fully specified
- Binary-to-spike conversion mechanism described only as "digitalization" without technical details
- Computational time comparisons may be hardware-dependent and not normalized across different implementations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Bioinspired algorithms achieve 97-99% accuracy with 10-100× speed improvements over backpropagation
- **Medium Confidence**: Poisson process presents greatest challenge due to high randomness
- **Medium Confidence**: ANN-SNN conversion and BAL demonstrate improved adaptability to stochastic inputs

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce the accuracy-speed tradeoff by implementing tempotron vs. backpropagation on Markov process with identical architecture (n=128), measuring both accuracy and computational time across multiple runs
2. Verify LZC classification mechanism by testing on synthetic sequences with known complexity patterns (deterministic vs. random) to confirm the classification decision boundary
3. Test bioinspired algorithm robustness by varying Poisson process parameters (rate λ from 0.1 to 10) and measuring accuracy degradation across tempotron, SpikeProp, and BAL algorithms
