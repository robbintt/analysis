# Benchmarking Information Retrieval Models on Complex Retrieval Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.07253
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07253
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CRUMB benchmark reveals state-of-the-art neural retrieval models achieve only nDCG@10 of 0.346 on complex multi-aspect queries

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CRUMB, a complex retrieval benchmark comprising eight diverse tasks designed to evaluate information retrieval models on multi-aspect, reasoning-intensive queries. The authors benchmark nine state-of-the-art neural retrieval models on CRUMB, finding that even the best models struggle with an average nDCG@10 of only 0.346 and R@100 of 0.587. Instruction-tuned models like Promptriever and GTE Qwen show superior performance, while query rewriting techniques help weaker models but hurt stronger ones. The study highlights that current retrieval models struggle with complex tasks due to limited semantic understanding, difficulty handling set-based logic, and inadequate reasoning capabilities. CRUMB aims to spur innovation by providing a challenging, realistic testbed for next-generation retrieval systems.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces CRUMB (Complex Retrieval Benchmark), a new evaluation framework consisting of eight diverse information retrieval tasks designed to test models on multi-aspect, reasoning-intensive queries. The benchmark includes tasks requiring logical reasoning, multi-hop inference, and set-based operations. Nine state-of-the-art neural retrieval models were evaluated, including both traditional and instruction-tuned architectures. The authors employed standard IR metrics (nDCG@10 and R@100) and tested various query processing techniques including rewriting strategies. The experimental setup systematically compared model performance across all task types to identify specific weaknesses in handling complex retrieval scenarios.

## Key Results
- Current neural retrieval models achieve only nDCG@10 of 0.346 on CRUMB's complex queries
- Instruction-tuned models (Promptriever, GTE Qwen) outperform traditional models significantly
- Query rewriting techniques improve performance for weaker models but degrade results for stronger models
- Models struggle particularly with set-based logic and multi-hop reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CRUMB works by presenting information retrieval models with realistic, complex queries that require multiple reasoning steps and semantic understanding. The benchmark's design forces models to handle tasks that go beyond simple keyword matching, exposing limitations in current neural architectures' ability to process multi-aspect queries. The inclusion of diverse task types ensures comprehensive evaluation of different reasoning capabilities. The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its ability to differentiate between model capabilities, showing that instruction-tuning and query processing techniques can significantly impact performance on complex retrieval tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-aspect query processing**: Understanding queries with multiple requirements simultaneously; needed for handling complex user information needs; quick check: can the model satisfy all constraints in a single retrieval pass?
- **Neural retrieval model architectures**: Familiarity with dense retrievers, cross-encoders, and instruction-tuned variants; needed to understand model performance differences; quick check: does the model use dual-encoder architecture or more complex cross-attention?
- **Information retrieval evaluation metrics**: Understanding nDCG, recall, and their appropriate use cases; needed to interpret benchmark results; quick check: are metrics appropriate for the task type and ranking depth?
- **Query rewriting techniques**: Methods to transform complex queries into simpler forms; needed to understand why rewriting helps weaker models; quick check: does rewriting preserve all semantic aspects of the original query?
- **Instruction-tuning in retrieval**: Process of fine-tuning models on instruction-following datasets; needed to explain performance differences; quick check: was the instruction-tuning done on relevant retrieval datasets?
- **Set-based logical operations**: Handling queries involving logical set operations like union, intersection, and complement; needed for multi-aspect query satisfaction; quick check: can the model correctly retrieve items satisfying complex logical constraints?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Query -> Query Processor (optional rewriting) -> Neural Retriever -> Document Ranking -> Evaluation Metrics
**Critical Path**: The critical path involves query understanding, semantic matching between query and documents, and ranking relevance. Instruction-tuned models show improved performance by better handling complex query formulations.
**Design Tradeoffs**: The benchmark reveals tradeoffs between model complexity and performance on different task types. Simpler models benefit from query rewriting, while more sophisticated models may overfit to original query formulations. Dense retrievers trade computational efficiency for semantic understanding capabilities.
**Failure Signatures**: Models consistently fail on queries requiring set-based logic and multi-hop reasoning. Weak models show improved performance with query rewriting, suggesting they struggle with query complexity rather than semantic understanding. Strong models degrade with rewriting, indicating sensitivity to query formulation changes.
**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Run each model on CRUMB without any query processing to establish baseline performance. 2) Apply systematic query simplification and measure performance degradation at each step. 3) Compare neural models against symbolic reasoning approaches on the same benchmark tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but the findings raise several implicit questions: How can neural retrieval models be improved to better handle set-based logic and multi-hop reasoning? What specific architectural changes would help models better understand complex query semantics? Can hybrid approaches combining neural and symbolic reasoning overcome current limitations? How do different query processing techniques affect various model architectures?

## Limitations
- The benchmark's inherent difficulty may partly explain low model performance rather than purely reflecting model limitations
- Limited error analysis prevents distinguishing between model failures and task design issues
- Excludes traditional symbolic or hybrid approaches that might perform differently on complex tasks
- Doesn't investigate whether instruction-tuned models' advantage stems from better reasoning or query format handling

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Current neural retrieval models struggle with complex multi-aspect queries is well-supported by empirical results across nine different models.
**Medium Confidence**: Query rewriting helps weaker models but hurts stronger ones needs further validation to explain underlying mechanisms.
**Low Confidence**: Failures are primarily due to "limited semantic understanding, difficulty handling set-based logic, and inadequate reasoning capabilities" is somewhat speculative without granular error analysis.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct detailed error analysis categorizing failures by query type (logical reasoning, multi-hop, set operations) to determine systematically problematic operations.
2. Benchmark symbolic reasoning models or hybrid neural-symbolic approaches on CRUMB to test whether neural architectures are fundamentally limited.
3. Systematically simplify complex CRUMB queries to constituent parts and measure retrieval performance at each simplification step to quantify complexity versus model limitations.
