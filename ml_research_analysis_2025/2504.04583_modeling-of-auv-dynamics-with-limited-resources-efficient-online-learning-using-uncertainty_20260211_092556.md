# Modeling of AUV Dynamics with Limited Resources: Efficient Online Learning Using Uncertainty

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.04583
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04583
- **Reference count:** 37
- **Primary result:** Threshold-based uncertainty selection achieves lowest cumulative testing loss while storing only 9.3% of data compared to baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of online learning for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) dynamics models under limited storage constraints. The authors propose using uncertainty quantification to select the most informative data points for rehearsal in incremental learning, reducing storage needs while maintaining model performance. They evaluate three novel uncertainty-based methods (Threshold, Greedy, and Threshold-Greedy) against baseline approaches (FIFO, FIRO, and RIRO) on real AUV data collected by the Dagon vehicle.

The Threshold method, which stores samples with uncertainty above a specified threshold, demonstrated the most stable performance and achieved the lowest cumulative testing loss among all methods. The ensemble uncertainty estimation method outperformed Monte Carlo Dropout and Flipout techniques. Experiments showed that the Threshold method required only 9.3% of the data while maintaining strong performance, though computational overhead from using 10 ensemble models should be considered. The study also found that model performance improved with larger storage buffers, with diminishing returns as buffer size increased.

## Method Summary
The approach uses an ensemble of 10 MLPs to estimate epistemic uncertainty (model ignorance) for each new data sample during online learning. The Threshold method stores a sample only if its uncertainty exceeds a pre-tuned threshold (0.0156 for the ensemble model), replacing a random point if the buffer is full. The model is fine-tuned on the buffer content plus the new sample at each step. The Greedy method adds all samples but ejects the lowest-uncertainty point when full, while Threshold-Greedy combines both approaches. The ensemble uncertainty estimation outperformed Dropout and Flipout techniques in regression tasks. The buffer size was fixed at 100 samples, and random search was used for hyperparameter optimization.

## Key Results
- The Threshold method achieved the lowest cumulative testing loss among all methods tested
- Ensemble uncertainty estimation outperformed both Monte Carlo Dropout and Flipout techniques
- The method required only 9.3% of the data while maintaining strong performance
- Model performance improved with larger storage buffers, showing diminishing returns beyond certain sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Filtering data based on epistemic uncertainty reduces redundancy and stabilizes online learning in resource-constrained environments.
- **Mechanism:** The system calculates prediction variance across an ensemble; samples with variance below a threshold are discarded, ensuring the limited rehearsal buffer contains only high-information state transitions.
- **Core assumption:** High epistemic uncertainty correlates with data points that significantly reduce model error, while low uncertainty implies redundancy.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...use of uncertainty in the selection of data points to rehearse in online learning when storage capacity is constrained."
  - [section III.B.2] "The Threshold method... excludes samples with uncertainty below a specified threshold."
  - [corpus] Weak direct link; neighbor "NemeSys" discusses adaptive autonomy but lacks specific UQ-thresholding details.
- **Break condition:** If the model is over-confident in unexplored regions (predictive variance is near zero), the mechanism fails to select novel data.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Ensembling provides superior uncertainty estimation for regression compared to single-model approximations like Monte Carlo Dropout.
- **Mechanism:** Independent training trajectories of multiple MLPs capture diverse hypotheses; their prediction variance robustly quantifies "lack of knowledge" (epistemic uncertainty) better than weight perturbations in a single network.
- **Core assumption:** The diversity of the ensemble members accurately reflects the space of plausible models.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section V.D] "Ensembles outperform Dropout in all metrics... Flipout does not show good capability in modelling epistemic uncertainty."
  - [table I] Comparison of Minimum MSE and Cumulative MSE favors Ensembles significantly over Dropout/Flipout.
  - [corpus] "Reflect-then-Plan" supports the difficulty of handling epistemic uncertainty in offline/online RL settings.
- **Break condition:** If the ensemble is not sufficiently diverse (e.g., random seed initialization fails), variance estimates collapse.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Managing the rehearsal buffer to maximize retained uncertainty mitigates catastrophic forgetting better than "random-out" strategies.
- **Mechanism:** By ejecting low-uncertainty points (Threshold-Greedy) or random points (Threshold), the buffer maintains a distribution of "hard" examples, preventing the model from overwriting weights learned for rare maneuvers.
- **Core assumption:** The buffer size is large enough to hold a representative set of high-uncertainty samples across the state space.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section VI] "Baseline methods... suffer from catastrophic forgetting constantly... uncertainty-based methods all manage to regularize for local overfitting."
  - [figure 7] Shows MSE oscillation (instability) in FIFO/FIRO compared to the stability of the Threshold method.
  - [corpus] "Conformalized Gaussian processes" discusses online UQ, supporting the necessity of robust uncertainty in streaming data.
- **Break condition:** If the environment changes drastically (concept drift), retaining old high-uncertainty points may hinder adaptation to new dynamics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on "Epistemic Uncertainty" (model ignorance) to select data; confusing this with "Aleatoric Uncertainty" (sensor noise) would lead to learning noisy, useless data.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the proposed method try to learn the noise in the sensors or the gaps in the model's knowledge?

- **Concept:** **Catastrophic Forgetting**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the failure mode the buffer management seeks to solve; understanding it explains why FIFO baselines fail (they overwrite past knowledge with recent redundant data).
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the FIFO method show high oscillation in loss compared to the Threshold method?

- **Concept:** **Rehearsal / Experience Replay**
  - **Why needed here:** The core constraint is a fixed-size storage buffer; understanding rehearsal is necessary to see why selecting *what* to keep is critical.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the "Threshold" method modify the standard rehearsal pipeline?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Stream -> Uncertainty Engine -> Selection Policy -> Rehearsal Buffer -> Trainer
- **Critical path:** The linkage between the **Uncertainty Engine** and the **Selection Policy**. If the variance calculation is not calibrated, the Threshold method becomes a random selector.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Accuracy vs. Compute:** Ensembles provide the best UQ (lowest loss) but require 10x the inference compute of a single model.
  - **Stability vs. Adaptability:** A high threshold (t) creates a very stable model but may reject useful borderline data; a low threshold acts closer to random selection.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Flipout Instability:** High cumulative MSE (Table I) and negative R2 scores indicate this UQ method is unsuitable for this regression task.
  - **FIFO Oscillation:** Rapid spikes in MSE indicate the model is forgetting previous dynamics to fit the immediate last sample.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Baseline):** Run FIFO vs. Offline to establish the performance gap due to storage constraints.
  2. **UQ Method Validation:** Compare Ensemble vs. Dropout variance predictions against known out-of-distribution data to verify the uncertainty signal is meaningful.
  3. **Threshold Sweep:** Run the Threshold method with buffer size 100, sweeping t (e.g., 0.01 to 0.02) to find the stability sweet spot (Figure 6).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can an adaptive approach (e.g., using percentiles) replace the pre-tuned threshold parameter t to remove the dependency on specific tuning procedures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "It would be great to investigate an adaptive approach, for example, using percentiles... Such a technique would remove dependence from the tuning procedure."
- Why unresolved: The current Threshold method relies on a static hyperparameter t, which must be tuned upfront and may not be practical in dynamic real-world operations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of an adaptive threshold mechanism that maintains stability and performance without requiring manual hyperparameter optimization.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do uncertainty-based selection methods perform compared to spatial and temporal heuristic approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note, "It would be useful to compare the results also with some spatial and temporal heuristic approaches," suggesting that such methods might incur smaller computational costs.
- Why unresolved: The study only compared the proposed methods against statistical baselines (FIFO, FIRO, RIRO) and did not evaluate them against spatial sampling techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative benchmarks showing the trade-offs in model accuracy and computational overhead between uncertainty-based methods and spatial heuristics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the proposed online learning methods maintain stability and performance during real-world deployment on a physical autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "The ultimate proof of the usefulness of the suggested methods will be the deployment of the methods in the real environment on an autonomous underwater vehicle."
- Why unresolved: The experiments were conducted on recorded data ("offline" dataset), which may not fully capture the latency, noise, and real-time constraints of a live marine environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Field trials demonstrating that the method reduces data storage and maintains model fidelity while the AUV performs active missions.

## Limitations
- Reliance on data from a single AUV platform (Dagon) constrains generalizability to different vehicle dynamics
- Computational overhead of ensemble methods (10× inference cost) presents practical deployment challenges in resource-constrained AUV systems
- Fixed buffer size approach assumes stationary or slowly-changing environments, potentially limiting adaptation to rapid environmental changes

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The comparative performance advantage of the Threshold method over baseline approaches (FIFO, FIRO, RIRO) is well-supported by quantitative metrics (Cumulative MSE) and qualitative observations (stability plots). The ensemble uncertainty estimation outperforming Dropout and Flipout techniques is also strongly evidenced.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that 9.3% data retention achieves strong performance is supported but depends on the specific threshold value and may vary with different data distributions or dynamics.

**Low Confidence:** Generalizability to other AUV platforms and the scalability of ensemble methods to real-time deployment without optimization remain uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Platform Validation:** Test the Threshold method on data from different AUV platforms to assess generalizability beyond the Dagon vehicle.
2. **Computational Efficiency Analysis:** Benchmark the real-time inference overhead of ensemble methods versus single-model approaches on typical AUV hardware to quantify deployment feasibility.
3. **Threshold Sensitivity Study:** Systematically vary the uncertainty threshold parameter to determine the optimal balance between stability and adaptability across different dynamic regimes.
