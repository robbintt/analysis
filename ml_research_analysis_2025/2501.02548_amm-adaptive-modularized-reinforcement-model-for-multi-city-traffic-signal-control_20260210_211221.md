# AMM: Adaptive Modularized Reinforcement Model for Multi-city Traffic Signal Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.02548
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02548
- Reference count: 28
- This paper proposes a modularized reinforcement learning approach for multi-city traffic signal control, achieving state-of-the-art performance with limited interactions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of adapting traffic signal control (TSC) models across different cities, where varying observations and data requirements hinder performance. The authors propose an Adaptive Modularized Model (AMM) that decouples TSC deep neural networks into three modules: representation transition, internal dynamics, and value-evaluating. This modular design enables replacing only relevant components when observations change, reducing training data needs. The internal dynamics module is trained using meta-learning (MAML) on multi-city data to capture common traffic logic, improving generalization. Experiments on three real-world datasets show AMM achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited interactions, outperforming baselines in average travel time and queue length.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a modularized approach to multi-city traffic signal control adaptation. The core idea is to decouple the deep neural network into three modules: Representation Transition (converts observations to states), Internal Dynamics (predicts future states), and Value-Evaluating (estimates state values). The Internal Dynamics module is trained using MAML on source cities to learn common traffic logic. When adapting to a target city, only the Representation Transition module needs retraining while the pre-trained Internal Dynamics module provides a strong initialization. This reduces the amount of target domain data needed for adaptation.

## Key Results
- AMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three real-world datasets with limited interactions
- Outperforms baselines in average travel time and queue length metrics
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of modularization and MAML
- Demonstrates strong generalizability and adaptability to varying observations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The modular design enables efficient adaptation by isolating city-specific observation processing (Representation Transition) from city-agnostic traffic dynamics (Internal Dynamics). MAML pre-training on multiple source cities allows the Internal Dynamics module to learn general traffic patterns that transfer across cities. This separation means only the observation encoder needs retraining when moving to a new city, drastically reducing adaptation cost.

## Foundational Learning
- **MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning)**: A meta-learning algorithm that finds good initialization parameters for fast adaptation. Needed to pre-train the Internal Dynamics module on source cities before adapting to target cities. Quick check: Verify that MAML finds parameters that improve quickly on new tasks with few gradient steps.
- **Modular Neural Networks**: Networks decomposed into specialized modules with distinct functions. Needed to separate city-specific observation processing from city-agnostic traffic dynamics. Quick check: Ensure each module performs its designated function independently.
- **Value-based Reinforcement Learning**: Learning to estimate the value of states to guide action selection. Needed for the Value-Evaluating module to predict future rewards. Quick check: Verify value predictions correlate with actual rewards.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Representation Transition -> Internal Dynamics -> Value-Evaluating

**Critical Path**: Observation → Representation Transition → Internal Dynamics → Value-Evaluating → Action Selection

**Design Tradeoffs**: Modularization trades some end-to-end optimization for adaptability and data efficiency. The explicit value function provides interpretability but adds complexity compared to policy-based methods.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor adaptation when the Internal Dynamics module overfits to source city patterns, or when the Representation Transition fails to extract meaningful features from target city observations.

**First Experiments**: 1) Train Internal Dynamics on single source city and test transfer to another city. 2) Train end-to-end model on target city from scratch for baseline comparison. 3) Test adaptation with different amounts of target city data to measure data efficiency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Limited diversity in traffic patterns across tested cities (no arterial vs. grid comparisons)
- Hyperparameters like grid blur factor and discount factors not fully explored
- Effectiveness of explicit value function vs. policy-based alternatives not compared

## Confidence

**High**: The modular design and its role in enabling efficient domain adaptation.

**Medium**: The effectiveness of MAML in learning transferable traffic dynamics.

**Medium**: Outperformance over baselines in average travel time and queue length.

## Next Checks
1. Verify the grid state normalization and indexing to ensure consistent representation across cities.
2. Test the sensitivity of results to the grid blur factor and horizon in the value function.
3. Compare AMM's performance using different MAML variants to confirm robustness.
