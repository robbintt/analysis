# Efficient Spectral Control of Partially Observed Linear Dynamical Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20943
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20943
- Reference count: 40
- Proposed a new algorithm achieving $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}/\gamma^{11})$ regret with polylogarithmic runtime

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Double Spectral Control (DSC), a novel algorithm for controlling partially observed linear dynamical systems under adversarial disturbances. The method uses a two-level spectral representation to approximate optimal controllers efficiently while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees. The approach achieves improved regret bounds and computational efficiency compared to existing methods, with empirical validation demonstrating superior performance across various disturbance types.

## Method Summary
DSC works by first lifting the observation history through spectral filters derived from Hankel matrix eigenvectors, then applying a second spectral filtering stage to produce control actions. This double spectral approximation enables convex optimization while preserving expressiveness. The algorithm leverages the Fredholm alternative and polynomial approximation theory to ensure stability and performance guarantees. The method operates in the frequency domain to avoid direct system identification, using past observations to construct approximations of the optimal controller.

## Key Results
- Achieves regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}/\gamma^{11})$ where $\gamma$ is the stability margin
- Improves runtime complexity to polylogarithmic in $T/\gamma$ compared to polynomial-time prior methods
- Outperforms existing approaches under both Gaussian and sinusoidal perturbations in empirical evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm's effectiveness stems from its double spectral approximation framework, which enables efficient representation of the optimal controller through two successive spectral filtering stages. The first stage projects the observation history into a spectral domain using Hankel matrix eigenvectors, while the second stage applies additional spectral filtering to generate control actions. This decomposition allows the problem to be reformulated as convex optimization while maintaining sufficient expressiveness to approximate the true optimal controller.

## Foundational Learning

### Spectral Filtering
**Why needed:** Enables projection of observation history into a basis that captures system dynamics efficiently
**Quick check:** Verify that the first few spectral components capture most variance in typical system trajectories

### Hankel Matrix Eigenvectors
**Why needed:** Provide the spectral basis for lifting observation history to higher-dimensional representation
**Quick check:** Confirm that eigenvectors correspond to dominant system modes under various initial conditions

### Fredholm Alternative
**Why needed:** Guarantees existence and uniqueness of solutions to the integral equations arising in the spectral formulation
**Quick check:** Validate that the spectral approximation satisfies the Fredholm conditions for typical system parameters

### Polynomial Approximation Theory
**Why needed:** Ensures the spectral approximation can accurately represent the optimal controller
**Quick check:** Measure approximation error as a function of polynomial degree for representative system dynamics

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Observation History -> Spectral Lifting (Hankel Eigenvectors) -> First Spectral Filtering -> Second Spectral Filtering -> Control Action

### Critical Path
The bottleneck is the computation of Hankel matrix eigenvectors, which determines both accuracy and computational cost. The spectral filtering stages must be carefully tuned to balance approximation quality against computational efficiency.

### Design Tradeoffs
- Higher spectral dimension improves approximation quality but increases computational cost
- Tradeoff between stability margin $\gamma$ and regret bound (exponential dependence on $\gamma^{11}$)
- Balance between expressiveness of double spectral representation and tractability of convex optimization

### Failure Signatures
- Poor performance when system stability margin $\gamma$ approaches zero
- Degradation in high-dimensional systems where spectral approximation becomes less effective
- Suboptimal results when loss functions deviate significantly from convexity assumptions

### First Experiments
1. Test regret scaling with increasing system dimension (2x, 5x, 10x baseline)
2. Evaluate sensitivity to stability margin by varying $\gamma$ across orders of magnitude
3. Compare performance against baseline controllers under non-stationary disturbances

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges uncertainties regarding the robustness of the double spectral approximation when system dynamics deviate from assumed linear frameworks, particularly under time-varying or non-stationary disturbances. The exponential dependence of the regret bound on the stability margin $\gamma$ raises questions about performance in systems with marginal stability. Additionally, the assumption of convex loss functions, while enabling efficient optimization, may not hold in many practical control scenarios.

## Limitations
- Performance degrades significantly when stability margin approaches zero due to exponential dependence in regret bound
- Limited empirical validation on high-dimensional systems (>50 state dimensions)
- Assumes convex loss functions, which may not reflect practical control scenarios
