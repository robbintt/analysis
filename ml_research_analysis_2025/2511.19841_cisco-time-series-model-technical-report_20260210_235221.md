# Cisco Time Series Model Technical Report

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.19841
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19841
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Zero-shot univariate forecaster with multiresolution architecture achieving superior performance on observability datasets

## Executive Summary
The Cisco Time Series Model is a zero-shot forecaster trained on over 300B data points, with more than half from observability domains. It introduces a multiresolution architecture that fuses information from multiple timescales, balancing global temporal patterns from coarse resolution with fine-grained details from high resolution. This enables accurate forecasting even with limited high-resolution context by leveraging precomputed rollups. The model achieves superior performance on observability datasets while maintaining comparable performance on general benchmarks like GIFT-Eval.

## Method Summary
The model employs a multiresolution architecture that accepts and fuses information from multiple timescales. This design allows the model to capture both global temporal patterns from coarse resolutions and fine-grained details from high resolutions. The architecture leverages precomputed rollups to provide historical context, enabling accurate forecasting even when high-resolution context is limited. The training process utilized over 300B data points, with significant representation from observability domains.

## Key Results
- Superior performance on observability datasets compared to competing models
- Enhanced accuracy in long-context scenarios
- Better adaptation to long-term structures and resilience to short-term noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multiresolution architecture enables the model to capture temporal patterns across different scales simultaneously. By fusing coarse-resolution global patterns with fine-resolution local details, the model can maintain context over longer time horizons while preserving important short-term variations. The use of precomputed rollups provides additional historical context that would otherwise be unavailable in limited high-resolution data scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time series forecasting fundamentals**: Understanding sequential data patterns and prediction techniques
  - Why needed: Core to the model's purpose and evaluation
  - Quick check: Compare forecasting accuracy against baseline methods
- **Multiscale analysis**: Processing information at different temporal resolutions
  - Why needed: Enables capture of both short-term and long-term patterns
  - Quick check: Validate performance improvement with multiple resolutions vs single resolution
- **Zero-shot learning**: Making predictions without task-specific fine-tuning
  - Why needed: Demonstrates model's general capability across domains
  - Quick check: Test on unseen datasets without additional training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input data -> Multiresolution encoder -> Fusion layer -> Prediction head

**Critical Path**
Raw time series → Multiresolution processing → Information fusion → Forecast generation

**Design Tradeoffs**
The multiresolution approach trades computational complexity for improved accuracy and context awareness. Precomputed rollups provide historical context but create dependencies that may impact real-time deployment scenarios.

**Failure Signatures**
- Performance degradation when precomputed rollups are unavailable or inaccurate
- Reduced effectiveness when temporal patterns don't align well across resolutions
- Potential overfitting to observability-specific patterns given training data composition

**First 3 Experiments to Run**
1. Compare performance with and without multiresolution architecture on observability datasets
2. Test forecasting accuracy across varying context lengths to validate long-context benefits
3. Evaluate performance on non-observability time series to assess generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential domain-specific overfitting due to training data composition (majority from observability domains)
- Model complexity may impact interpretability and computational efficiency
- Dependencies on precomputed rollups could affect real-time forecasting scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence: The model's core architecture and training scale
- Medium confidence: Performance claims relative to specific competitors
- Low confidence: Generalizability claims beyond observability domains

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain validation testing on time series datasets from non-observability domains to assess generalization capabilities
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of the multiresolution architecture versus other model components
3. Implement real-time forecasting tests to evaluate the practical impact of precomputed rollup dependencies on latency and resource usage
