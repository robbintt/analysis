# Analyzing and Fine-Tuning Whisper Models for Multilingual Pilot Speech Transcription in the Cockpit

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.21990
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21990
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: LoRA fine-tuning with text normalization reduces WER from 68.49% to 26.26% on Whisper Large for multilingual cockpit speech

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of transcribing multilingual pilot speech in cockpit environments, where standard ASR models struggle due to domain-specific vocabulary, noise, and language mixing. The authors propose combining text normalization strategies—including handling ICAO alphabets, removing filler words, and standardizing compound words—with LoRA-based fine-tuning of Whisper models. Using 215 minutes of cockpit and pilot interview recordings in German and English, they demonstrate that fine-tuning with normalization reduces Word Error Rate from 68.49% (baseline) to 26.26% on the Whisper Large model, with similar gains across other model sizes. The results highlight the importance of domain adaptation and tailored preprocessing for effective ASR in specialized settings.

## Method Summary
The authors combine text normalization strategies with LoRA-based fine-tuning of Whisper models to improve multilingual pilot speech transcription. Text normalization includes handling ICAO alphabets, removing filler words, and standardizing compound words. LoRA fine-tuning is applied to Whisper models using 215 minutes of cockpit and pilot interview recordings in German and English. The approach is evaluated across different Whisper model sizes, with a focus on reducing Word Error Rate (WER) in the specialized cockpit domain.

## Key Results
- WER reduced from 68.49% (baseline) to 26.26% on Whisper Large with fine-tuning and normalization
- Similar WER improvements observed across other Whisper model sizes
- Text normalization combined with LoRA fine-tuning proves critical for domain-specific ASR performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The combination of domain-specific text normalization and LoRA fine-tuning addresses two key challenges in cockpit speech transcription: the specialized vocabulary (ICAO alphabets, technical terms) and the multilingual, noisy nature of pilot communication. Normalization standardizes the input to match training expectations, while LoRA fine-tuning adapts the model weights efficiently to the target domain without full retraining. This dual approach mitigates both acoustic and linguistic domain shifts.

## Foundational Learning
- **ICAO Alphabet Handling**: Critical for converting phonetic callsigns into standard text; without it, models misinterpret pilot identifiers.
  - *Quick check*: Verify normalization correctly maps all ICAO codes (e.g., "Alpha Bravo Charlie" → "ABC").
- **Filler Word Removal**: Reduces noise in transcripts and improves WER by eliminating non-content speech.
  - *Quick check*: Ensure common fillers ("uh", "um") are consistently filtered without removing valid words.
- **Compound Word Standardization**: Essential for German; prevents splitting or misreading of concatenated terms.
  - *Quick check*: Test normalization on compound nouns to confirm correct segmentation or retention.
- **LoRA Fine-Tuning**: Enables efficient domain adaptation with minimal parameter updates, preserving general ASR capability.
  - *Quick check*: Compare LoRA-adapted vs. fully fine-tuned models for performance and parameter efficiency.
- **Multilingual Training Data**: Necessary to handle code-switching between German and English in cockpit speech.
  - *Quick check*: Evaluate model on mixed-language utterances to confirm balanced performance.
- **Cockpit Noise Simulation**: Important for robustness; real-world environments are far noisier than clean speech.
  - *Quick check*: Introduce synthetic cockpit noise at various SNRs and measure WER degradation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Audio Input → Text Normalization → Whisper Encoder → Whisper Decoder → LoRA Adaptation → Normalized Transcript Output

**Critical Path**: Audio → Normalization → LoRA-Fine-Tuned Whisper → Transcript
The most sensitive step is normalization, as errors here propagate directly to ASR output. LoRA fine-tuning is the efficiency bottleneck but not the accuracy bottleneck.

**Design Tradeoffs**:
- **Normalization vs. Model Capacity**: Heavy normalization reduces burden on the ASR model but may over-constrain input; lighter normalization requires more model adaptation.
- **LoRA Rank vs. Performance**: Higher LoRA ranks improve fine-tuning accuracy but increase parameter count and training cost.
- **Dataset Size vs. Generalization**: 215 minutes is modest; more data could improve robustness but increases labeling cost.

**Failure Signatures**:
- High WER on ICAO alphabet words → normalization misses or misclassifies phonetic codes.
- WER spikes on German compound words → normalization incorrectly splits or merges terms.
- Model fails on unseen accents → training data lacks speaker diversity.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Run baseline Whisper (no fine-tuning, no normalization) on test set and record WER per language.
2. Apply only text normalization (no fine-tuning) and measure WER change.
3. Fine-tune Whisper with LoRA but skip normalization; compare WER to combined approach.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited language coverage: Only German and English evaluated; generalizability to other languages unclear.
- Dataset size: 215 minutes is modest; may not capture full cockpit speech variability.
- No noise robustness testing: Performance under realistic cockpit noise conditions not reported.
- No ablation on normalization steps: Cannot isolate impact of individual normalization components.

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in reported WER reductions for the specific models and dataset used.
- **Medium** confidence in broader applicability due to limited linguistic and environmental diversity.
- **Low** confidence in claims about relative performance across model sizes without further testing.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the normalized and fine-tuned models on a multilingual aviation speech dataset including non-European languages and diverse accents.
2. Test model robustness by introducing synthetic cockpit noise at varying SNR levels and measuring WER degradation.
3. Conduct an ablation study to quantify the independent contribution of each text normalization step versus LoRA fine-tuning.
