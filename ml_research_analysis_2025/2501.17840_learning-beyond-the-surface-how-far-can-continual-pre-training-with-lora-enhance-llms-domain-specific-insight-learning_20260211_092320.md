# Learning Beyond the Surface: How Far Can Continual Pre-Training with LoRA Enhance LLMs' Domain-Specific Insight Learning?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.17840
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17840
- Reference count: 18
- Continual pre-training with LoRA improves declarative and statistical insight extraction when using simplified triple-format training data, but yields minimal gains on full documents and struggles with probabilistic insights.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether continual pre-training with LoRA adapters can enhance LLMs' ability to extract three types of domain-specific insights—declarative, statistical, and probabilistic—from medicine and finance datasets. Using LLaMA models of varying sizes and two datasets (Hallmarks of Cancer and Buster), the authors find that training on simplified triple-format documents significantly outperforms training on full documents, particularly for declarative and statistical insights. However, probabilistic insight extraction remains challenging regardless of approach, with limited improvements observed. The results suggest that data format and model size are critical factors in achieving domain-specific insight learning through continual pre-training.

## Method Summary
The study employs LoRA continual pre-training on LLaMA models (1B, 3B, and 8B) using two domain-specific datasets: Hallmarks of Cancer (medicine) and Buster (finance). Triples are extracted from documents using GPT-4o mini, and models are trained on three formats: original documents, simplified documents containing only essential triples, and individual triples as separate inputs. Evaluation covers three insight types with specific metrics: declarative (EM and F1), statistical (Recall@K), and probabilistic (MAE and Pearson correlation). Hyperparameters are tuned via grid search, and training runs for up to 30 epochs.

## Key Results
- Training on simplified triple-format documents significantly improves declarative and statistical insight extraction compared to original documents
- Larger models (8B) consistently outperform smaller ones across all insight types
- Probabilistic insight extraction shows minimal improvement regardless of training approach or model size
- Individual triple training yields near-perfect declarative performance but limited benefits for other insight types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Continual pre-training with LoRA adapters allows efficient adaptation of LLMs to domain-specific patterns without full fine-tuning. By training on simplified triple-format data, models focus on essential relational information, improving their ability to extract declarative facts and statistical patterns. The parameter-efficient nature of LoRA enables rapid adaptation while preserving general knowledge from pre-training.

## Foundational Learning
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Reduces parameter count for efficient fine-tuning by decomposing weight updates into low-rank matrices. Needed for cost-effective domain adaptation; quick check: verify rank parameter (4,8,16) matches computational budget.
- **Insight Types**: Declarative (factual statements), Statistical (aggregated patterns), Probabilistic (reasoning under uncertainty). Needed to comprehensively evaluate model understanding; quick check: ensure evaluation samples cover all three types uniformly.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: EM/F1 for facts, Recall@K for patterns, MAE/correlation for probabilities. Needed to measure different cognitive capabilities; quick check: validate metric implementations match paper specifications.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Document → Triple Extraction → LoRA Adapter → Model (LLaMA variant) → Insight Extraction → Evaluation
- **Critical Path**: Triple extraction → LoRA continual pre-training → insight extraction evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Simplified triples improve declarative/statistical performance but may lose contextual nuance; probabilistic insights remain challenging regardless of approach.
- **Failure Signatures**: Marginal gains from original document training indicate format sensitivity; consistent probabilistic performance suggests architectural limitations for uncertainty reasoning.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Compare vanilla vs. CPT-Orig after 30 epochs on declarative metrics; 2) Test 3B vs 8B on simplified triple training; 3) Validate probabilistic probability estimation methodology.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Probabilistic insight extraction shows minimal improvement across all conditions, suggesting fundamental architectural limitations
- Simplified triple format may lose important contextual information present in full documents
- Limited exploration of alternative architectures or training strategies for probabilistic reasoning

## Confidence
- Declarative insight improvements: Medium-High (consistent results across datasets and model sizes)
- Statistical insight improvements: Medium-High (significant gains with simplified training)
- Probabilistic insight results: Medium-Low (simplistic evaluation methodology may underestimate true capabilities)

## Next Checks
1. Implement alternative probability estimation methods (e.g., temperature scaling) to validate probabilistic insight evaluation methodology
2. Test trained models on additional domain-specific datasets to verify generalization beyond medicine and finance
3. Compare LoRA-based continual pre-training against full fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient methods for insight extraction performance
