# Leakage-Aware Bandgap Prediction on the JARVIS-DFT Dataset: A Phase-Wise Feature Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19732
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19732
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Leakage-controlled models achieve R² ≈ 0.88-0.90 for bandgap prediction

## Executive Summary
This study systematically analyzes the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset to identify and remove leakage-prone descriptors, yielding a curated subset of 2,280 materials. A three-phase modeling framework incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. Results show tree-based models achieve R² values of approximately 0.88-0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. The work provides a leakage-free dataset and baseline performance metrics for future bandgap prediction studies, demonstrating that careful data curation and leakage detection are essential for reliable materials informatics applications.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic leakage detection approach using Pearson correlation analysis to identify and remove descriptors that could cause information leakage in bandgap prediction. The curated dataset of 2,280 materials is then used with a three-phase modeling framework that progressively incorporates different feature sets: Phase 1 uses basic physical descriptors, Phase 2 adds engineered features, and Phase 3 includes compositional attributes. Tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM) are evaluated across all phases, with SHAP analysis used to determine feature importance. The methodology emphasizes rigorous data curation to ensure model performance reflects genuine predictive capability rather than dataset artifacts.

## Key Results
- Tree-based models achieve R² values of approximately 0.88-0.90 across all three modeling phases
- Dielectric tensor components consistently emerge as the most important features in SHAP analysis
- Expanding descriptor space from Phase 1 to Phase 3 does not substantially improve predictive accuracy
- The leakage-controlled approach yields reliable baseline metrics for bandgap prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's success stems from addressing a fundamental challenge in materials informatics: information leakage from descriptors that indirectly encode target properties. By systematically identifying and removing leakage-prone features through correlation analysis, the models are forced to learn genuine relationships between descriptors and bandgaps rather than exploiting spurious correlations. The three-phase framework allows for controlled evaluation of how different descriptor types contribute to predictive performance, while SHAP analysis provides interpretable insights into the physical mechanisms driving predictions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Leakage detection**: Why needed - prevents models from learning indirect correlations rather than true relationships; Quick check - verify that removed features show high correlation with target before removal
- **Feature engineering**: Why needed - creates physically meaningful descriptors that capture material properties; Quick check - ensure engineered features pass leakage screening
- **SHAP analysis**: Why needed - provides interpretable feature importance rankings; Quick check - validate that top features align with physical expectations for bandgap behavior

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: JARVIS-DFT dataset -> Leakage detection -> Phase 1 (basic descriptors) -> Phase 2 (engineered features) -> Phase 3 (compositional attributes) -> Tree-based models -> SHAP analysis

**Critical path**: Dataset curation → Leakage detection → Model training → Performance evaluation → Feature importance analysis

**Design tradeoffs**: Smaller curated dataset (2,280 materials) vs. larger but potentially leaky dataset; Tree-based models vs. neural networks for interpretability; Computational efficiency vs. prediction accuracy

**Failure signatures**: Poor cross-validation performance indicates remaining leakage; Inconsistent SHAP rankings suggest model instability; Low R² values may indicate insufficient descriptor space or model capacity

**3 first experiments**:
1. Replicate leakage detection on a different computational materials dataset to test generalizability
2. Compare tree-based models with neural network approaches on the same leakage-controlled dataset
3. Apply the three-phase framework to a different target property (e.g., formation energy) to validate methodology

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset curation relies on computational descriptors that may still contain subtle indirect leakage pathways
- Focus on 2,280 materials creates smaller sample size that may limit generalizability
- Exclusive use of tree-based models constrains assessment to specific algorithm families

## Confidence

- Leakage detection methodology: **High** - The systematic correlation-based filtering approach is well-established and reproducible
- Model performance claims (R² ~0.88-0.90): **Medium** - Results are consistent within the curated dataset but may not generalize to larger or different material classes
- SHAP-based feature importance: **High** - The dielectric tensor consistently emerging as dominant aligns with physical expectations for bandgap behavior

## Next Checks

1. Test the curated model on an independent experimental bandgap dataset to assess real-world transferability
2. Expand leakage detection to include higher-order correlation metrics and causal inference methods to identify subtler leakage pathways
3. Evaluate alternative model architectures (e.g., neural networks, kernel methods) on the same leakage-controlled dataset to determine if tree-based models are truly optimal
