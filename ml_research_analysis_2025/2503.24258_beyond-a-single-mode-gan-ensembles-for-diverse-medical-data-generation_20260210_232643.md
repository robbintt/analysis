# Beyond a Single Mode: GAN Ensembles for Diverse Medical Data Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.24258
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24258
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Multi-objective optimization selects GAN ensembles that improve downstream task performance on medical datasets by balancing fidelity and diversity.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of generating high-quality, diverse synthetic medical images using GANs, which often suffer from mode collapse and limited coverage. It proposes a multi-objective optimization method to select an optimal ensemble of GANs, balancing fidelity and diversity while minimizing redundancy. The method leverages a diverse set of 22 GAN architectures and evaluates their performance using different backbone feature extractors. Experiments across three medical datasets show that the proposed ensemble method significantly improves downstream task performance compared to single GANs or naive ensemble approaches. Specifically, it achieves higher geometric mean scores, reduces the performance gap between real and synthetic data, and enhances mode coverage. The study also highlights the importance of backbone selection, with self-supervised models like SwAV outperforming supervised ones. Overall, the approach provides a robust solution for generating diverse and high-fidelity synthetic medical images, advancing applications in diagnostic modeling and clinical research.

## Method Summary
The method involves training 22 conditional GAN architectures (e.g., StyleGAN2, BigGAN, ReACGAN) for 100k iterations, saving checkpoints every 20k iterations to create 110 candidate models. A multi-objective optimization (e.g., NSGA-II) selects an ensemble from these candidates, maximizing Intra-$d$ (fidelity) and minimizing Inter-$d$ (diversity) using embeddings from a pre-trained SwAV backbone. The selected ensemble is evaluated by training a downstream classifier (ResNet18) on synthetic data and measuring geometric mean scores on real test sets. The approach is tested on three medical datasets (PneumoniaMNIST, BreastMNIST, AIforCOVID) with preprocessing steps like resizing to 224x224 and lung segmentation for AIforCOVID.

## Key Results
- The proposed ensemble method achieves higher geometric mean scores compared to single GANs or naive ensemble approaches.
- It reduces the performance gap between real and synthetic data, demonstrating improved synthetic data utility.
- Self-supervised embeddings (SwAV) outperform supervised ones for diversity assessment, enhancing mode coverage.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-objective optimization balances fidelity and diversity by selecting GANs that generate high-quality samples while minimizing redundancy. The use of self-supervised embeddings (SwAV) for diversity assessment captures semantic differences better than supervised models, leading to more diverse ensembles. The ensemble approach leverages the strengths of multiple GANs, mitigating individual model weaknesses and improving overall synthetic data quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **GAN Training Dynamics:** Understanding how different GAN architectures behave during training is crucial for selecting snapshots and ensuring stability. *Quick check:* Monitor FID and Intra-$d$ during training to identify mode collapse or instability.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization:** The Pareto optimization balances conflicting objectives (fidelity vs. diversity) to select optimal ensembles. *Quick check:* Verify that the selected ensemble achieves high Intra-$d$ and low Inter-$d$.
- **Feature Extractors for Diversity:** Self-supervised models like SwAV capture semantic differences better than supervised ones, improving diversity assessment. *Quick check:* Compare coverage scores using SwAV vs. supervised backbones.
- **Downstream Task Evaluation:** Geometric mean scores measure the utility of synthetic data for classification tasks. *Quick check:* Train ResNet18 on synthetic data and evaluate on real test sets.
- **Mode Coverage:** Ensuring diverse synthetic samples cover the real data distribution is critical for downstream performance. *Quick check:* Verify that coverage $\approx$ 1.0 for successful ensembles.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Preprocessing -> GAN Training (22 architectures) -> Embedding Extraction (SwAV) -> Multi-Objective Optimization -> Ensemble Selection -> Downstream Training (ResNet18) -> Evaluation

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves generating synthetic samples, extracting embeddings, running the Pareto optimization, and training the downstream classifier. Any failure in these steps (e.g., unstable GAN training, poor diversity assessment) directly impacts the final performance.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The choice of GAN architectures, snapshot intervals, and backbone feature extractors significantly affects the ensemble quality. Self-supervised embeddings (SwAV) improve diversity assessment but may require additional computational resources.

**Failure Signatures:** Unstable GAN training leads to mode collapse, resulting in low Intra-$d$ and poor downstream performance. Low diversity ensembles show high Inter-$d$ and redundant samples. Poor lung segmentation in AIforCOVID affects input quality and downstream results.

**First Experiments:**
1. Train a subset of GANs (e.g., StyleGAN2, BigGAN) and monitor FID and Intra-$d$ to ensure stability.
2. Extract embeddings using SwAV and compute Density and Coverage to verify diversity assessment.
3. Run a small-scale Pareto optimization (e.g., top-5 candidates) and evaluate downstream performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exact hyperparameters for the 22 GAN architectures and the multi-objective optimization algorithm are not provided, affecting reproducibility.
- The study relies on a pre-trained U-Net for lung segmentation in AIforCOVID without specifying its source or training details.
- The generalizability of the 22 GAN architecture set to other domains or the optimal selection of snapshots (every 20k iterations) lacks theoretical justification.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core finding that GAN ensembles outperform single models and naive ensembling approaches is strongly supported by the reported downstream task performance (g-mean scores) across three medical datasets. The empirical demonstration that self-supervised embeddings (SwAV) outperform supervised ones for diversity assessment is convincing given the reported results.

**Medium Confidence:** The specific multi-objective optimization procedure for selecting GAN ensembles is well-justified theoretically, but the lack of detailed algorithmic parameters introduces some uncertainty about the exact methodology. The claim that the approach reduces the performance gap between real and synthetic data is supported, but the magnitude of improvement may be sensitive to implementation details.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the 22 GAN architecture set to other domains or the optimal selection of snapshots (every 20k iterations) lacks theoretical justification. The study does not explore alternative diversity metrics or optimization frameworks that might yield different results.

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary the snapshot interval (e.g., test 10k, 20k, 30k iterations) and document the impact on ensemble selection and downstream performance to assess robustness to this design choice.
2. **Alternative Diversity Metrics:** Replace SwAV embeddings with other feature extractors (e.g., supervised ResNet, BYOL) or diversity metrics (e.g., Coverage, Density only) to verify that the reported superiority of SwAV is consistent and not architecture-dependent.
3. **Ensemble Size Impact:** Evaluate the performance of ensembles with different cardinalities (e.g., top-3, top-5, top-10 models from the Pareto front) to determine whether the reported gains scale with ensemble size or if a smaller subset achieves comparable results.
