core_contribution: Radial Compensation (RC) is an information-geometric method that
  pre-warps the tangent-space base distribution in generative models on Riemannian
  manifolds so that the resulting manifold density depends only on geodesic distance
  from a pole. Within isotropic bases and scalar-Jacobian azimuthal charts, RC is
  essentially the only construction that simultaneously yields geodesic-radial likelihoods
  and chart- and curvature-invariant Fisher information in radial parameters.

# Radial Compensation: Stable and Semantically Decoupled Generative Models on Riemannian Manifolds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.14056
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14056
- Authors: Marios Papamichals; Regina Ruane
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: A geometric method to decouple radial semantics from curvature in generative models on manifolds.

## Executive Summary
Radial Compensation (RC) is an information-geometric technique that pre-warps the tangent-space base distribution in generative models on Riemannian manifolds so that the resulting manifold density depends only on geodesic distance from a pole. By working within isotropic bases and scalar-Jacobian azimuthal charts, RC ensures geodesic-radial likelihoods and chart- and curvature-invariant Fisher information in radial parameters. This decoupling lets radial parameters retain their Euclidean meaning while allowing the chart to be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. The method extends to any manifold with known geodesic polar volume via a balanced polar pushforward theorem.

## Method Summary
RC operates by modifying the base density in the tangent space before mapping it to the manifold via exponential map. This pre-warping ensures that the induced density on the manifold depends only on geodesic distance from a chosen pole, regardless of curvature or chart choice. The method relies on the isotropy of the base measure and the scalar-Jacobian property of the azimuthal chart, guaranteeing geodesic-radial likelihoods and invariant Fisher information in radial parameters. The approach is broadly applicable to any manifold where geodesic polar volume is known, enabling robust and semantically clean generative modeling.

## Key Results
- RC restores parameter-clean geodesic radii and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional latent flows.
- Improves likelihoods in hyperspherical and mixed-curvature VAEs, with equivalent performance across charts and reduced gradient variance.
- Yields likelihood-equivalent performance across charts with reduced gradient variance and CNF solver cost.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RC achieves its invariance by pre-warping the base density in the tangent space so that, after the exponential map, the resulting manifold density is a function only of geodesic distance from a pole. This construction ensures that radial parameters have a consistent Euclidean interpretation regardless of the underlying manifold's curvature. The method leverages the isotropy of the base measure and the scalar-Jacobian property of the azimuthal chart to maintain geodesic-radial likelihoods and Fisher information invariance. This decoupling allows the chart to be chosen purely for numerical stability or preconditioning, without affecting the semantics of radial parameters.

## Foundational Learning
- **Riemannian manifolds**: Need for modeling data on curved spaces; check: understand geodesic distance and exponential map.
- **Isotropic bases**: Ensures rotational symmetry for geodesic-radial likelihoods; check: verify base measure is invariant under rotations.
- **Scalar-Jacobian azimuthal charts**: Guarantees chart-invariance of Fisher information; check: confirm Jacobian depends only on radial coordinate.
- **Geodesic polar coordinates**: Local coordinate system around a pole; check: know how volume element is computed.
- **Exponential map**: Maps tangent vectors to manifold points; check: understand domain restrictions and injectivity.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Base density → Exponential map → Manifold density; Radial compensation modifies base density.
- **Critical path**: Pre-warp base density → exponential map to manifold → compute geodesic distance for likelihood.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Isotropy vs. flexibility in base distribution; scalar-Jacobian charts vs. computational cost of Jacobians.
- **Failure signatures**: Curvature-dependent radial semantics; radius blow-ups in high dimensions; inconsistent likelihoods across charts.
- **First experiments**:
  1. Apply RC to a hyperspherical VAE and compare likelihoods across different azimuthal charts.
  2. Test RC in a high-dimensional latent flow on a sphere and monitor radial parameter stability.
  3. Implement RC on a mixed-curvature product manifold and evaluate performance vs. standard flows.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None.

## Limitations
- Guarantees rely on isotropy of base measure and scalar-Jacobian property; violations reintroduce curvature-dependent semantics.
- Numerical evaluation of geodesic distances and Jacobians is expensive in high dimensions, especially without closed-form geodesics.
- Experiments focus on low-dimensional spherical/hyperbolic geometries; scalability to higher-dimensional or complex product manifolds is unproven.

## Confidence
- Theoretical uniqueness and invariance claims: **Medium** (tight assumptions)
- Empirical performance improvements: **High** (consistent across experiments)
- Scalability and high-dimensional robustness: **Low** (limited testing)

## Next Checks
1. Test RC on high-dimensional mixed-curvature product manifolds with complex data geometries to assess scalability and robustness.
2. Evaluate the impact of relaxing isotropy or scalar-Jacobian conditions on the invariance guarantees and empirical performance.
3. Benchmark computational overhead and solver cost of RC-based flows against standard methods on manifolds without closed-form geodesics.
