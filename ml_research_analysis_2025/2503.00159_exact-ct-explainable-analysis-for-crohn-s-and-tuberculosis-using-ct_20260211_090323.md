# EXACT-CT: EXplainable Analysis for Crohn's and Tuberculosis using CT

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.00159
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00159
- Reference count: 34
- Key result: Feature-based explainable AI framework differentiates CD from ITB with 74.18% balanced accuracy, outperforming deep learning baselines.

## Executive Summary
EXACT-CT is a novel explainable AI framework for differentiating Crohn's Disease (CD) from Intestinal Tuberculosis (ITB) using CT enterography. The system automatically detects five key radiological biomarkers—visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio, Comb's sign, calcified and necrotic lymph nodes, and pulmonary TB indicators—using a hybrid approach combining classical image processing and deep learning. A radiologist-designed 3D visualization tool highlights these features, enabling interpretation and clinical validation. The framework achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models while providing transparent, feature-level explanations.

## Method Summary
The EXACT-CT framework uses TotalSegmentator for anatomical isolation followed by parallel biomarker extraction modules. Key modules include Comb's sign detection using Hessian-based vesselness filtering and GMM refinement, fat ratio calculation via intensity thresholding and polar boundary detection, and pulmonary TB classification using ViPTT-Net. These features are fed into classical ML classifiers (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) rather than end-to-end deep learning. The system includes a 3D visualization tool for biomarker display and SHAP analysis for feature importance interpretation.

## Key Results
- Logistic Regression achieves 74.18% balanced accuracy, outperforming ResNet3D (56.73%) and CTFoundation baselines
- Comb's sign detection shows best diagnostic performance at ileocecal junction (AUC 0.6329)
- Fat ratio threshold of 0.2969 effectively discriminates CD from ITB across both hospitals
- XGBoost with SHAP provides interpretable feature importance while maintaining competitive accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Explicit radiological biomarkers provide superior generalization on limited datasets compared to end-to-end deep learning features. The system bypasses latent feature learning by explicitly engineering detectors for known clinical markers (Comb's sign, fat ratio). This reduces the hypothesis space, preventing overfitting on small sample sizes (n=158). Core assumption: Selected biomarkers are causally sufficient to distinguish CD from ITB and are detectable via intensity/geometric heuristics.

### Mechanism 2
Localized vascular geometry (Comb's sign) acts as a high-specificity proxy for Crohn's Disease. A vesselness filter based on Hessian eigenvalues identifies tubular structures near enhanced intestinal walls. Core assumption: Vascular structures near the intestinal wall can be mathematically separated from other tubular structures purely by intensity and spatial proximity.

### Mechanism 3
SHAP-based explainability validates feature relevance and identifies failure modes in classification logic. XGBoost classifier ingests the biomarker vector, and SHAP decomposes predictions into feature contributions. Core assumption: Feature independence assumptions in SHAP do not severely distort explanations of spatially correlated biomarkers.

## Foundational Learning

- **Hessian-based Vesselness (Frangi Filter)**: Essential for detecting Comb's sign. Uses eigenvalues of Hessian matrix to distinguish tubular structures from blob-like structures in 3D CT. Quick check: How does the sign of eigenvalues differentiate a blood vessel from a sphere?

- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with BIC**: Segments intestinal wall by modeling intensity histograms. BIC selects optimal number of components to separate wall, content, and fat. Quick check: Why would minimizing BIC prevent overfitting compared to maximizing likelihood?

- **Youden's J Statistic**: Optimizes thresholds by maximizing (Sensitivity + Specificity - 1), balancing false positives and negatives. Quick check: If specificity is 0.9 and sensitivity is 0.5, what is the Youden Index?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (3D CT) -> TotalSegmentator (segmentation) -> Parallel Feature Extractors (Comb's, Fat, PTB, Calcified/Necrotic) -> Feature Vector -> Classifier (Logistic Regression/XGBoost) -> Output + SHAP + 3D Visualization

- **Critical path**: Fat Ratio and Comb's Sign detectors are primary performance drivers. TotalSegmentator segmentation quality is the most critical dependency.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Explicit feature engineering over end-to-end DL sacrifices potential latent feature discovery for interpretability and data efficiency. Proxy detectors for nodes were faster to implement but resulted in high false positives.

- **Failure signatures**: Necrotic nodes produce significant false positives; PTB detection has high specificity but near-zero recall; GradCAM ambiguity compared to explicit rendering.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Module ablation: Run Logistic Regression with only Fat Ratio, then only Comb's sign to confirm individual AUC contributions
  2. Segmentation sensitivity: Perturb TotalSegmentator output and measure variance in Comb's sign probability
  3. Threshold generalization: Validate fixed Fat Ratio threshold (0.2969) from Hospital A on Hospital B data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can biomarkers maintain accuracy across geographically diverse populations? The study uses data from only two South Asian hospitals, limiting generalizability. Consistent performance on external validation cohorts from different continents would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Does integrating multimodal clinical data with radiological features improve performance? Current framework uses only CT imaging, potentially missing diagnostic information in clinical history and lab values. Comparative study showing improvement with clinical feature fusion would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does the 3D visualization tool improve radiologist efficiency and confidence? While tool detects features missed by radiologists, its impact on workflow and inter-observer variability hasn't been quantified. Prospective reader study measuring diagnostic accuracy and time with/without tool would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Dataset size (158 total scans) and lack of demographic balance limit generalization
- Private hospital data prevents independent validation without institutional partnerships
- Performance sensitive to scanner-specific intensity thresholds and segmentation accuracy
- PTB module reliability compromised by extreme data imbalance (8 positive cases)

## Confidence
- **High**: Logistic Regression achieving 74.18% balanced accuracy; explicit feature engineering advantage on small datasets
- **Medium**: Comb's sign as reliable CD biomarker; Fat Ratio threshold generalization across hospitals
- **Low**: SHAP explanations for spatially correlated features; clinical sufficiency of five biomarkers without external validation

## Next Checks
1. External dataset test: Validate fixed Fat Ratio threshold (0.2969) and Comb's sign detection on third hospital's CT scans
2. Feature ablation robustness: Systematically remove each biomarker module to quantify marginal contribution and identify overfitting
3. Artifact simulation: Inject synthetic noise into test scans and measure degradation in Fat Ratio and Comb's sign detection
