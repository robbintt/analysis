# Stable-SCore: A Stable Registration-based Framework for 3D Shape Correspondence

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.21766
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21766
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** State-of-the-art non-isometric shape correspondence with mean geodesic errors of 2.61 (FAUST), 2.57 (CharW RGB), and 4.12 (DT4D-H hard)

## Executive Summary
Stable-SCore introduces a novel registration-based framework for 3D shape correspondence that leverages 2D foundation models to extract robust semantic features for guiding mesh deformations. The method repurposes Stable Diffusion and DINO features via a lightweight adapter to generate semantic flow maps, which are then used to optimize deformations through a Neural Jacobian Fields model. This approach significantly improves stability and accuracy compared to traditional functional map methods, particularly in non-isometric settings where geometric topology varies. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-isometric benchmarks and introduces CharW, a new benchmark for character correspondence in-the-wild featuring diverse shapes with significant geometric and topological variations.

## Method Summary
Stable-SCore addresses 3D shape correspondence by combining 2D semantic features with 3D registration optimization. The method renders source and target meshes from multiple views, extracts features using DINO and Stable Diffusion models, and processes them through an adapter network to generate semantic flow maps. These maps guide a Neural Jacobian Fields model that optimizes per-face transformations while preserving mesh topology. The optimization uses a Poisson solver to convert Jacobian gradients into final mesh positions, with regularization losses preventing shear deformation and self-similarity confusion. The framework assumes roughly aligned input rotations and operates through a differentiable rendering loop that updates the semantic flow until convergence.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-isometric benchmarks: 2.61 mean geodesic error on FAUST, 2.57 on CharW (RGB), and 4.12 on DT4D-H hard
- Outperforms traditional functional map methods by significant margins in non-isometric settings
- Demonstrates effectiveness across diverse datasets including FAUST, DT4D-H, and the newly introduced CharW benchmark
- Shows robust performance on shape re-topology, texture transfer, and shape interpolation applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Replacing explicit 3D geometric features with 2D semantic features from foundation models enables robust matching under non-isometric shape variance. The method repurposes Stable Diffusion and DINO features via a lightweight adapter to generate a "semantic flow" map that is less sensitive to geometric topology changes than traditional 3D descriptors.

### Mechanism 2
Optimizing deformation in the local tangent space (Neural Jacobian Fields) prevents mesh distortion artifacts common in vertex-displacement methods. Instead of optimizing vertex positions directly, the framework predicts per-face transformation matrices that are projected onto the tangent space and solved via a Poisson system, enforcing intrinsic smoothness.

### Mechanism 3
Shear-resistant regularization decouples necessary rotation/scale changes from undesirable skew, stabilizing iterative convergence. The optimization includes a specific loss term that penalizes the difference between the predicted Jacobian and its nearest rotational component, forcing the deformation to prioritize rigid transformations locally.

## Foundational Learning

- **Functional Maps vs. Registration**
  - *Why needed:* The paper positions itself against Functional Map methods that fail on non-isometric data due to reliance on shared spectral bases
  - *Quick check:* Why does changing geometry (non-isometry) break the spectral basis used in Functional Maps?

- **Poisson Reconstruction on Meshes**
  - *Why needed:* Neural Jacobian Fields outputs gradients, not positions, requiring a Poisson equation to convert back to global vertex positions
  - *Quick check:* If you have per-face Jacobians, what mathematical operation converts them back to global vertex positions?

- **Differentiable Rendering (NVDiff)**
  - *Why needed:* The core loop bridges 3D and 2D by rendering the deformed mesh to compute flow loss
  - *Quick check:* How does the resolution of the rendered 2D flow map (512x512) limit the precision of the 3D correspondence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Source Mesh → Multi-view Renderer → DINO/SD Feature Extractors → Adapter Network → Semantic Flow Map → NJF Deformation Model → Poisson Solver → Deformed Mesh → Differentiable Renderer → Flow Loss

- **Critical path:** The "Semantic Flow" generation is the brittle part. If the adapter network fails to find a correspondence in the 2D renderings, the optimization has no gradient signal.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - *Adapter vs. Zero-shot:* Using a trained adapter drastically improves performance but requires datasets (3DBiCar)
  - *RGB vs. Normal:* RGB is more robust to topology changes but requires texture; Normal maps work on textureless shapes but rely purely on geometry

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Self-similarity collapse:** "Left hand matches right hand" addressed with Geometry-grounded negative loss
  - **Jacobian Collapse:** If identity loss decays too fast, the mesh may collapse into a singularity
  - **Mesh distortion:** Monitor flow loss and shear loss to detect optimization instability

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate 2D Flow: Render aligned meshes, run 2D branch only, visualize flow map to ensure semantic parts align
  2. Deformation Stress Test: Take a unit cube and deform to stretched rectangular prism, tune identity and shear losses
  3. CharW Baseline: Run full pipeline on CharW with "Zero-shot" configuration to establish lower bound

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can native 3D generative models effectively replace 2D foundation models to resolve low-resolution limitations in complex structures? The authors note that 2D features struggle with fine details like fingers due to resolution constraints.

### Open Question 2
How can the framework be made robust to significant initial rotation misalignment without requiring manual pre-alignment? The method relies on roughly aligned input rotations to establish valid 2D mappings.

### Open Question 3
Can the registration process be adapted to handle topological noise, such as self-intersecting limbs, without manual cleanup? The current deformation model assumes clean topology to calculate stable Jacobians.

## Limitations

- Assumes roughly aligned input rotations, failing with significant rotational misalignment
- Struggles with occluded shapes where 2D projections lose critical information
- Cannot handle severe topological noise (e.g., merged limbs) without manual cleanup
- Limited by 2D feature resolution when dealing with fine geometric details

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Registration-based approach with Neural Jacobian Fields improves stability over vertex-displacement methods
- **Medium confidence:** Semantic flow guided registration significantly improves non-isometric correspondence accuracy
- **Low confidence:** Generalizability to arbitrary 3D shapes beyond tested character-focused benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. **Adapter Architecture Validation:** Implement and test multiple adapter network architectures to identify the configuration that most reliably produces accurate semantic flow maps across diverse shape pairs

2. **Rotation Robustness Test:** Systematically evaluate performance when initial rotation alignment is perturbed by increasing degrees (30°, 60°, 90°) to quantify sensitivity to rotational misalignment

3. **Occlusion Stress Test:** Create synthetic test cases with controlled occlusion levels (25%, 50%, 75% surface area hidden) to assess semantic flow's resilience to missing data
