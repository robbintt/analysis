# An Explainable Reconfiguration-Based Optimization Algorithm for Industrial and Reliability-Redundancy Allocation Problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.01331
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01331
- Authors: Dikshit Chauhan; Nitin Gupta; Anupam Yadav
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: AI-AEFA outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques across 28 CEC 2017 benchmark problems, 15 industrial problems, and 7 reliability-redundancy allocation problems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents AI-AEFA, a parameter reconfiguration-based metaheuristic algorithm that enhances the Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA) for constrained optimization problems. The algorithm introduces a novel chaotic sigmoid-based Coulomb's constant adaptation mechanism and parameter-free constraint handling to improve exploration, exploitation, and feasibility. AI-AEFA is validated across three distinct problem sets: IEEE CEC 2017 constrained benchmarks, large-scale industrial optimization problems, and reliability-redundancy allocation problems. The algorithm demonstrates superior performance in terms of feasibility rates, computational efficiency, and convergence speed compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
AI-AEFA extends the basic AEFA by incorporating a chaotic sine map-based Coulomb's constant (Kh) that decays sigmoidally over iterations, providing enhanced exploration in early stages and exploitation in later stages. The algorithm uses a parameter-free constraint handling mechanism that sorts agents based on feasibility and constraint violation without requiring penalty coefficients. Key parameters include: K0=500 (initial Coulomb constant), β=6 (sigmoid decay rate), δ=300 (chaotic parameter), N=30 (population size), and lmax=500 (10D) or 1000 (30D) (max iterations). The algorithm is tested with 20 independent runs per problem, using mean fitness, standard deviation, feasibility rate, and computational time as evaluation metrics, with statistical validation via T-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

## Key Results
- AI-AEFA achieves lower infeasibility rates than baseline AEFA and AEFA-C on all 28 CEC 2017 constrained benchmark problems
- The algorithm demonstrates superior computational efficiency and faster convergence on 15 large-scale industrial optimization problems
- AI-AEFA shows significant improvements in Mean Performance Index Improvement (MPII) for 7 reliability-redundancy allocation problems compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Statistical validation confirms AI-AEFA's superiority with p-values < 0.05 across multiple problem sets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm's effectiveness stems from the chaotic sigmoid-based Coulomb's constant that provides dynamic exploration-exploitation balance. By starting with high Kh values (enhanced exploration) and decaying through a sigmoid function with chaotic perturbations, the algorithm avoids premature convergence while maintaining search efficiency. The parameter-free constraint handling eliminates the need for penalty coefficient tuning, making the algorithm more robust and easier to apply to different problem domains. The combination of these mechanisms allows AI-AEFA to maintain population diversity longer while still converging to high-quality feasible solutions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Chaotic Sine Map**: A deterministic sequence generator that produces pseudo-random values using the sine function. Why needed: Provides irregular perturbations to the Coulomb's constant, preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima. Quick check: Verify the chaotic sequence shows aperiodic behavior over iterations.
- **Sigmoid Function for Parameter Decay**: Maps iteration count to [0,1] range with S-shaped curve. Why needed: Controls the gradual transition from exploration to exploitation phases. Quick check: Plot K vs iteration - should show high initial values decaying sigmoidally.
- **Parameter-Free Constraint Handling**: Sorts solutions based on feasibility and violation without penalty coefficients. Why needed: Eliminates manual tuning of penalty parameters that can be problem-dependent. Quick check: Verify feasible solutions always rank higher than infeasible ones regardless of objective value.
- **Velocity and Position Bounds**: Limits the search space movement in each iteration. Why needed: Prevents agents from leaving the feasible search space and ensures numerical stability. Quick check: Monitor position updates to ensure they stay within [lb, ub].
- **Population Diversity Maintenance**: Uses chaotic perturbations to maintain exploration capability. Why needed: Prevents premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. Quick check: Track best fitness values over iterations - should show consistent improvement without plateaus.
- **Multi-modal Search Strategy**: Combines global exploration with local exploitation through dynamic parameter adaptation. Why needed: Balances between finding new regions and refining current solutions. Quick check: Compare convergence curves with and without chaotic perturbations.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Initial Population -> Chaotic Coulomb's Constant (K) -> Force Calculation -> Velocity Update -> Position Update -> Constraint Handling -> Fitness Evaluation -> Population Update

**Critical Path**: The core optimization loop follows: K calculation (Eq. 9-13) → Force computation using K → Velocity update (Eq. 7) → Position update (Eq. 8) → Constraint handling (Eq. 14) → Fitness evaluation → Population sorting

**Design Tradeoffs**: Chaotic parameter adaptation increases computational overhead but provides better exploration; parameter-free constraint handling simplifies implementation but may be less precise than weighted approaches; larger population sizes improve diversity but increase computational cost.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Stagnation in fitness improvement → insufficient exploration (K decaying too fast)
- High infeasibility rates → constraint handling not working correctly
- Oscillation in best fitness → chaotic perturbations too strong

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement base AEFA (Algorithm 1, Eqs. 1-8) and validate on a simple constrained problem (e.g., g01) to establish baseline performance
2. Add chaotic Coulomb's constant (Eqs. 9-13) and verify K shows proper decay pattern with chaotic fluctuations over iterations
3. Implement parameter-free constraint handling (Eq. 14) and test sorting mechanism on a problem with mixed feasible/infeasible solutions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Several critical parameters (chaotic map range, equality constraint tolerance, velocity bounds calculation) are not explicitly specified, requiring assumptions for implementation
- The algorithm's performance on extremely high-dimensional problems (>100D) is not evaluated
- Computational overhead of chaotic parameter adaptation may be significant for real-time applications

## Confidence
- High: Core algorithm structure, validation methodology, and claimed improvements are clearly described
- Medium: Exact parameter values and implementation details for chaotic map parameters and constraint handling
- Low: Not applicable

## Next Checks
1. Implement AI-AEFA with assumed parameter values (r=0.8, ε=1e-4, velocity bounds=0.1×position bounds) and verify it reduces infeasibility rates compared to baseline AEFA on CEC 2017 problems
2. Test chaotic parameter adaptation by plotting Coulomb's constant K over iterations - should show high initial values (exploration) decaying to low values (exploitation) with chaotic fluctuations
3. Validate constraint handling by running on a simple constrained problem (e.g., g01) and confirming feasible solutions are prioritized and sorted correctly
