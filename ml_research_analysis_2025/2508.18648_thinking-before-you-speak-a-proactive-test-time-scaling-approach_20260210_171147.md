# Thinking Before You Speak: A Proactive Test-time Scaling Approach

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.18648
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18648
- **Reference count**: 24
- **Primary result**: Introduces TBYS method achieving comparable performance to self-consistency with fewer reasoning samples on mathematical datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving large language models' reasoning abilities for complex tasks, particularly in mathematics, by introducing a novel proactive prompting paradigm called "Thinking Before You Speak" (TBYS). The method inserts insights between consecutive reasoning steps to guide the model's reasoning process, mirroring human inner-thought patterns. These insights are generated proactively to define the status and goal of each reasoning step, rather than relying on static prompts. The approach constructs a library of high-quality insights using in-context learning and filtering, and demonstrates effectiveness on challenging mathematical datasets (MATH-500 and AIME).

## Method Summary
TBYS works by inserting proactive insights between reasoning steps during the inference process. These insights define the current status and goal for each step, helping the model maintain reasoning coherence. The method constructs a library of high-quality insights using in-context learning and filtering mechanisms. During inference, the model generates multiple reasoning paths with insights, then applies self-consistency to select the most coherent solution. This approach reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, as fewer reasoning samples are needed compared to traditional self-consistency methods.

## Key Results
- TBYS achieves comparable performance to self-consistency with fewer reasoning samples on MATH-500 and AIME datasets
- Integration of TBYS with self-consistency further improves accuracy on mathematical reasoning tasks
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the insight library and coding capabilities in enhancing reasoning accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The TBYS approach works by mimicking human reasoning patterns through proactive insight insertion. By defining the status and goal of each reasoning step, the model maintains better coherence throughout complex problem-solving processes. The insight library provides high-quality contextual guidance that helps the model stay on track during multi-step reasoning. The proactive nature of insight generation allows for more efficient exploration of the solution space compared to reactive approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **In-context learning**: Why needed - to construct high-quality insight library from limited examples; Quick check - verify quality of generated insights through human evaluation
- **Self-consistency**: Why needed - to select most coherent reasoning path from multiple samples; Quick check - measure accuracy improvement when combining with TBYS
- **Prompt engineering**: Why needed - to effectively incorporate insights into reasoning process; Quick check - test different prompt formats for insight insertion
- **Mathematical reasoning**: Why needed - to evaluate method on domain-specific tasks; Quick check - measure performance on standard math benchmarks
- **Inference optimization**: Why needed - to reduce computational overhead; Quick check - compare inference time and sample efficiency with baselines

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM -> Insight Generator -> Insight Library -> Reasoning Steps -> Self-Consistency Filter -> Final Answer

**Critical Path**: Insight Library Construction -> Insight Insertion During Inference -> Multiple Reasoning Samples -> Self-Consistency Selection -> Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: Fewer samples needed vs. insight generation overhead; proactive vs. reactive insight incorporation; library quality vs. construction cost

**Failure Signatures**: Poor insight quality leading to reasoning derailment; excessive computation from insight generation; library mismatch with task domain

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test insight insertion with simple arithmetic problems before scaling to complex mathematics
2. Compare performance with and without insight library on basic reasoning tasks
3. Evaluate insight quality through human assessment before full integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method relies heavily on insight library quality, which may not generalize well beyond mathematics
- Limited evaluation on reasoning domains other than mathematics
- Computational overhead of generating and filtering insights could be prohibitive for larger models or real-time applications

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core finding that TBYS achieves comparable performance to self-consistency with fewer reasoning samples on mathematical datasets; ablation studies supporting insight library effectiveness

**Medium Confidence**: Claims about mirroring human inner-thought patterns; integration benefits with self-consistency across different architectures

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability to non-mathematical reasoning tasks; performance scaling with increasingly complex problems

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TBYS on diverse reasoning tasks beyond mathematics, including logical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and multi-step decision-making problems
2. Conduct computational overhead analysis comparing TBYS against baseline methods across different model sizes
3. Perform human evaluation study to assess whether generated insights align with human reasoning patterns and improve interpretability
