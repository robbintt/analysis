# TabKAN: Advancing Tabular Data Analysis using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.06559
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06559
- Reference count: 40
- TabKAN variants achieve state-of-the-art tabular classification performance, outperforming XGBoost, MLP, and Transformer baselines

## Executive Summary
TabKAN introduces a family of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) variants designed for tabular data analysis, addressing challenges like heterogeneous features, missing values, and complex interactions. By placing learnable activation functions on network edges rather than fixed nonlinearities at neurons, KANs offer improved interpretability and training efficiency compared to traditional MLPs and Transformers. The framework includes specialized variants optimized via neural architecture search and fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for effective knowledge transfer across domains.

## Method Summary
TabKAN implements KAN variants (ChebyKAN, FourierKAN, FastKAN, etc.) where each edge connection is parameterized by a learnable univariate function (Chebyshev polynomial, Fourier series, RBF, etc.) and summed at each node. The method uses EM-KNN for missing value imputation, one-hot encoding for categorical features, and neural architecture search with Bayesian optimization to find optimal depth, width, and basis function parameters. Models are trained using L-BFGS optimizer with cross-entropy loss and evaluated on AUC, F1, and accuracy metrics across multiple benchmark datasets.

## Key Results
- ChebyKAN achieved highest supervised performance across evaluated datasets, outperforming XGBoost, MLP, and Transformer baselines
- FourierKAN demonstrated superior performance in transfer learning settings with 30-70% feature overlap
- FastKAN provided the most computationally efficient training while maintaining competitive accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Learnable Activation Functions on Network Edges
Placing learnable activation functions on edges rather than fixed nonlinearities at neurons enables more flexible and parameter-efficient modeling of feature relationships. KANs parameterize each connection as a univariate function learned during training, allowing the network to adapt the transformation shape to data characteristics rather than applying a fixed nonlinearity like ReLU.

### Mechanism 2: Orthogonal Basis Function Approximation
Using orthogonal polynomial bases (Chebyshev, Jacobi) or Fourier series for edge functions provides faster convergence and better approximation properties than raw B-splines or fixed activations. Orthogonal bases have mathematical properties that reduce coefficient correlation and enable efficient representation of smooth or periodic patterns.

### Mechanism 3: Neural Architecture Search with Bayesian Optimization
Systematic hyperparameter search using Bayesian optimization improves over manual architecture design for KAN variants. Gaussian Process-based BO constructs a surrogate model of validation performance and uses acquisition functions to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space.

## Foundational Learning

- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**: The theoretical foundation for KANs—states any multivariate continuous function can be decomposed into compositions of univariate functions. Why needed: Explains why edge-based activation design is theoretically justified. Quick check: Can you explain why expressing f(x₁, x₂) as φ₁(x₁) + φ₂(x₂) + ... is fundamentally different from MLP's node-based activation approach?

- **Orthogonal Polynomial Bases (Chebyshev, Jacobi, Fourier)**: Each KAN variant uses different basis functions with distinct approximation properties. Why needed: Understanding orthogonality helps predict which variant suits your data. Quick check: Why might Chebyshev polynomials approximate a monotonic credit score-to-default-probability function more efficiently than raw B-splines?

- **Transfer Learning and Catastrophic Forgetting**: The paper uses GRPO for fine-tuning across domains with partial feature overlap. Why needed: Understanding how pretrained representations degrade during fine-tuning is necessary to interpret the GRPO ablation. Quick check: When fine-tuning on Set2 with 50% feature overlap, what could cause the model to "forget" patterns learned from Set1?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input → Preprocessing (EM-KNN imputation, class balancing) → One-hot encoding → KAN Layer(s) → Output
- **Critical path**: 1) Preprocess: Impute missing values, one-hot encode categoricals, standardize/quantile-transform numericals 2) NAS: Run Optuna with 50-100 trials, optimizing (depth, width, order/grid) for validation F1 3) Train: Use L-BFGS optimizer with cross-entropy loss on combined train+val 4) Evaluate: AUC, F1, accuracy on held-out test
- **Design tradeoffs**: ChebyKAN: Highest supervised performance, requires polynomial order tuning; FourierKAN: Best transfer learning, handles periodic patterns; FastKAN: Most computationally efficient; Baseline KAN: Simplest but underperforms variants
- **Failure signatures**: NaN outputs on raw unscaled data; overfitting on small datasets without regularization; poor transfer when feature overlap is very low (<30%); slow convergence if polynomial order or grid size is too high
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run ChebyKAN on your dataset with default hyperparameters (depth=2, neurons=50, order=4) and standardized inputs vs. XGBoost 2) Test raw vs. standardized vs. quantile-transformed inputs on a small subset 3) Run 30 Optuna trials on ChebyKAN and FourierKAN separately, plotting validation AUC vs. trial number

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Can TabKAN architectures be effectively adapted for self-supervised pre-training on unlabeled tabular data?
2. How does the incorporation of formal sensitivity analysis techniques complement or improve upon TabKAN's built-in interpretability?
3. Can TabKAN maintain its performance advantages on massive-scale datasets using stochastic optimizers, given its current reliance on full-batch L-BFGS?

## Limitations
- Performance claims rely heavily on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem without empirical validation that tabular functions satisfy its smoothness requirements
- Limited domain diversity in transfer learning experiments (only IMDb → Amazon direction tested)
- Scalability concerns due to reliance on full-batch L-BFGS optimizer for training

## Confidence
- **High**: Supervised classification results with extensive ablation and strong baseline comparisons
- **Medium**: Transfer learning claims due to limited domain diversity and unexplained superiority of FourierKAN
- **Low**: Fundamental claim that edge-based activations are superior to node-based activations without empirical verification

## Next Checks
1. Test KAN variants on tabular datasets with known discontinuities (e.g., step functions) to verify the smoothness assumption
2. Compare L-BFGS vs. Adam training curves for each KAN variant to assess whether optimization choice drives performance
3. Run ablation on polynomial order vs. grid size vs. width to determine which hyperparameter most affects convergence and generalization
