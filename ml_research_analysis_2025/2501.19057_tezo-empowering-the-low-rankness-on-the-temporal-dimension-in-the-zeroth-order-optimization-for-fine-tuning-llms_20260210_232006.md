# TeZO: Empowering the Low-Rankness on the Temporal Dimension in the Zeroth-Order Optimization for Fine-tuning LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.19057
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19057
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes TeZO, a novel low-rank zeroth-order optimization method for efficient fine-tuning of large language models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TeZO, a novel approach to zeroth-order optimization for fine-tuning large language models that leverages low-rankness across both model and temporal dimensions. By representing ZO perturbations as 3D tensors and applying Canonical Polyadic Decomposition, TeZO significantly reduces training costs compared to existing methods while maintaining theoretical guarantees. The method achieves state-of-the-art comparable results with lower time and memory overhead on various fine-tuning tasks.

## Method Summary
TeZO captures low-rankness across model and temporal dimensions by representing ZO perturbations as a 3D tensor and applying Canonical Polyadic Decomposition. This decomposition enables significant reduction in computational complexity and memory usage during fine-tuning. The method can be extended to momentum-based and Adam variants while consuming less memory than traditional approaches. Theoretically, TeZO is proven to be an unbiased estimator with comparable variance and convergence rate to existing methods, making it both efficient and reliable for LLM fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art comparable results with lower time and memory overhead on various fine-tuning tasks
- Provides theoretical guarantees including unbiasedness, comparable variance, and convergence rate
- Reduces training costs significantly compared to existing zeroth-order optimization methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TeZO works by exploiting the inherent low-rank structure in both the model parameters and the temporal evolution of updates during fine-tuning. By representing perturbations as 3D tensors and applying low-rank decomposition, the method captures essential information while discarding redundant components, leading to more efficient optimization. This approach reduces the effective dimensionality of the optimization problem without sacrificing convergence properties.

## Foundational Learning
- Zeroth-order optimization: Optimization methods that only require function evaluations without gradients, essential for scenarios where gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute
- Low-rank approximation: Mathematical technique to represent high-dimensional data with lower-dimensional structures, needed to reduce computational complexity
- Canonical Polyadic Decomposition: Tensor factorization method that decomposes multi-dimensional arrays into component matrices, critical for TeZO's tensor-based approach
- Fine-tuning LLMs: Process of adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks, the primary application context for TeZO
- Computational complexity analysis: Framework for evaluating algorithm efficiency, used to demonstrate TeZO's advantages
- Memory overhead measurement: Metrics for tracking resource usage, important for validating TeZO's efficiency claims

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input data -> Tensor representation -> CP Decomposition -> Low-rank perturbation -> Model update -> Output
- Critical path: The decomposition and perturbation steps are critical as they determine the efficiency gains and theoretical properties
- Design tradeoffs: Lower rank provides better efficiency but may reduce approximation accuracy; temporal dimension adds complexity but captures dynamics
- Failure signatures: Poor convergence if rank is too low; high memory usage if rank is too high; numerical instability in decomposition
- First experiments: 1) Verify unbiasedness property on simple convex functions, 2) Compare convergence rates with standard ZO methods, 3) Benchmark memory usage against baseline fine-tuning approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical validation limited to three datasets and three model sizes, constraining generalizability
- Memory efficiency claims rely on assumptions about hardware configurations that may not universally hold
- Extensions to momentum-based and Adam variants described but not extensively validated

## Confidence
- Theoretical properties (unbiasedness, variance, convergence rate): High
- Empirical performance claims: Medium
- Memory efficiency improvements: Medium
- Extension to momentum/Adam variants: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test on additional diverse fine-tuning tasks including multi-task and few-shot learning scenarios
2. Benchmark memory usage across different hardware configurations and compare against alternative low-rank methods
3. Evaluate performance degradation when extending to larger model sizes (e.g., 70B+ parameters) and different architectures
