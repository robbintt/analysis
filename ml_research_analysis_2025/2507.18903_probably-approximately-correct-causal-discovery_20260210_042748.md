# Probably Approximately Correct Causal Discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.18903
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18903
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC) Discovery framework, which extends PAC learning to causal discovery under finite-sample and resource constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC) Discovery framework, which extends Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning principles to the domain of causal discovery under finite-sample and resource constraints. The framework provides theoretical guarantees for causal discovery methods like Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS), propensity scores, and instrumental variables, establishing sample complexity bounds that are polynomial in the desired error and confidence parameters. This work offers a principled approach to causal inference when data is limited, providing formal guarantees for methods that were previously used without theoretical validation.

## Method Summary
The PACC framework adapts the PAC learning paradigm to causal discovery by focusing on achieving high, though not perfect, accuracy in identifying causal relationships under finite-sample conditions. It provides sample complexity bounds for causal discovery methods, demonstrating that these methods can distinguish between causal models with polynomial sample complexity in terms of the error tolerance (ϵ) and confidence level (δ). The framework is applied to validate SCCS with formal causal discovery guarantees, showing it can identify causal effects with high probability and bounded error. The authors also demonstrate how PACC can model sample complexity for other causal methods like propensity scores and instrumental variables, providing theoretical justifications for these approaches under resource-constrained conditions.

## Key Results
- PACC provides the first formal causal discovery guarantees for the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) method
- The framework establishes sample complexity bounds polynomial in 1/ϵ and 1/δ for causal discovery methods
- PACC enables principled testing of causal effects with high probability and small error under limited data conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The PACC framework works by extending PAC learning principles to the causal discovery domain, adapting the sample complexity analysis to account for the unique challenges of causal inference. By focusing on probably approximately correct causal discovery rather than exact identification, the framework can provide meaningful guarantees under realistic finite-sample conditions. The polynomial sample complexity bounds ensure that causal effects can be identified with high probability and bounded error, even when data is limited. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical causal discovery guarantees and practical resource-constrained applications.

## Foundational Learning

### PAC Learning Theory
- **Why needed**: Provides the theoretical foundation for understanding learnability and sample complexity under finite resources
- **Quick check**: Verify understanding of PAC bounds and their application to classification problems

### Causal Discovery Methods
- **Why needed**: Understanding existing causal discovery approaches is crucial for extending PAC principles to causal inference
- **Quick check**: Review sample complexity analysis for SCCS, propensity scores, and instrumental variables

### Finite-Sample Guarantees
- **Why needed**: Traditional causal discovery often assumes asymptotic conditions; PACC focuses on finite-sample validity
- **Quick check**: Compare asymptotic vs finite-sample guarantees in causal inference literature

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Data -> PACC Framework -> Sample Complexity Analysis -> Causal Discovery Guarantees

### Critical Path
The critical path involves applying PACC to a specific causal discovery method (starting with SCCS), deriving sample complexity bounds, and validating these bounds through theoretical analysis. This path establishes the formal guarantees for the method under finite-sample conditions.

### Design Tradeoffs
The framework trades perfect causal identification for practical guarantees under finite resources. This represents a shift from traditional causal discovery approaches that often assume infinite data or focus on asymptotic guarantees. The tradeoff enables application in real-world scenarios where data is limited but causal inference is still needed.

### Failure Signatures
The PACC framework may fail when underlying causal assumptions are violated (e.g., presence of hidden confounders not accounted for in the model). Additionally, the polynomial sample complexity bounds, while theoretically sound, may still be impractical for high-dimensional data or extremely resource-constrained settings.

### First Experiments
1. Apply PACC to a simple causal discovery benchmark dataset to validate sample complexity bounds
2. Compare PACC-guaranteed causal discovery performance against traditional methods under varying sample sizes
3. Test the framework's robustness to violations of underlying causal assumptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas for future research are implied by the work, including extending PACC to more complex causal discovery methods and testing the framework's performance in high-dimensional settings with multiple confounders.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees are primarily asymptotic and rely on assumptions about causal structure that may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Polynomial sample complexity bounds may be prohibitive for practical applications in high-dimensional data or limited sample availability
- The application to SCCS is demonstrated in relatively constrained settings, limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- High confidence in the theoretical framework construction and basic PAC learning extension
- Medium confidence in the sample complexity bounds and their practical applicability
- Low confidence in the generalizability of results across diverse real-world causal discovery scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation across multiple benchmark causal discovery datasets to test the practical performance of PACC guarantees beyond the SCCS case study
2. Systematic analysis of how violations of underlying assumptions (e.g., hidden confounders, measurement error) affect the PACC bounds and discovery accuracy
3. Comparative evaluation of PACC's sample complexity requirements against existing causal discovery methods under varying data constraints and dimensionality
