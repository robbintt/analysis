# Just Add Geometry: Gradient-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection Without Human-in-the-Loop

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.13363
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13363
- Authors: Atharv Goel; Mehar Khurana
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Training-free open-vocabulary 3D detection using 2D vision-language models, achieving 29.94% mAP on nuScenes (LiDAR) and 16.14% mAP on fog-augmented Pseudo-nuScenes (pseudo-depth)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a training-free approach for open-vocabulary 3D object detection that leverages pre-trained 2D vision-language models to generate 3D bounding boxes without requiring human-annotated 3D labels. The method uses a 2D grounding detector to generate text-conditioned proposals, refines them with SAM for instance segmentation, and lifts them to 3D space using camera geometry and depth information (LiDAR or pseudo-depth). A geometric inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers infers 3D bounding boxes without learned shape priors. The approach demonstrates competitive localization performance while enabling detection of novel object categories through natural language prompts.

## Method Summary
The method operates by first generating 2D detections and masks using a vision-language detector (GroundingDINO) and instance segmenter (SAM), then lifting these to 3D through geometric back-projection using camera intrinsics and depth maps. DBSCAN clustering filters outlier points, while the medoid provides robust center estimation. A minimum-area oriented bounding box is fitted in the ground plane using the Rotating Calipers algorithm, with height derived from point cloud vertical extent. The system can operate with either LiDAR depth or pseudo-depth from monocular estimators like UniDepth, and includes fog augmentation for evaluating performance under adverse conditions. All components are frozen models or classical algorithms, requiring no training on the target dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves 29.94% mAP on nuScenes validation using LiDAR depth with geometric inflation strategy
- Maintains 16.14% mAP on Pseudo-nuScenes using pseudo-depth from UniDepth, demonstrating RGB-only viability
- DBSCAN clustering improves mAP from 1.30% to 21.94% by filtering outlier points
- Medoid+Rotating Calipers strategy yields improved orientation estimates (lower mAOE) compared to shape priors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Vision-Language Transfer via Geometric Lifting
Pre-trained 2D vision-language models serve as zero-shot supervisors for 3D object detection through geometric back-projection, eliminating the need for 3D annotations. A text-conditioned 2D detector generates class proposals and bounding boxes, which are refined by SAM into instance masks and lifted to 3D by back-projecting depth values through camera intrinsics/extrinsics. The 2D semantic label transfers directly to the resulting 3D box.

### Mechanism 2: Segmentation-Guided Point Filtering
Instance segmentation masks constrain back-projection to object-relevant points, reducing noise from background and occlusion boundaries. SAM generates precise instance masks conditioned on 2D detector boxes. During back-projection, only pixels within the mask contribute 3D points. DBSCAN further filters outliers by retaining only the densest spatial cluster.

### Mechanism 3: Classical Geometry for Box Inference
DBSCAN clustering combined with Rotating Calipers produces competitive 3D bounding boxes without learned shape priors. DBSCAN removes outlier points. The medoid provides robust center estimation. Rotating Calipers computes the minimum-area oriented bounding box in the ground plane; height derives from point cloud vertical extent.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Camera Projection Models (Pinhole + Extrinsics)**
  - Why needed here: Back-projection requires inverting the 2D→3D mapping using depth, intrinsics K, and camera-to-world extrinsics. Without this, 2D detections cannot be grounded in 3D space.
  - Quick check question: Given pixel coordinates (u, v), depth d, and camera intrinsics matrix K, compute the 3D point in camera coordinates. How do you transform it to world coordinates?

- **Concept: Open-Vocabulary Detection via Vision-Language Alignment**
  - Why needed here: GroundingDINO grounds text prompts to image regions via contrastive vision-language pretraining. Understanding this clarifies why the method generalizes to novel categories without retraining.
  - Quick check question: How does a vision-language detector differ from a standard object detector trained on fixed class labels? What role does the text encoder play?

- **Concept: DBSCAN Clustering Parameters (ε, min_samples)**
  - Why needed here: The paper reports a 20% mAP improvement from DBSCAN filtering. Proper tuning is critical—too aggressive filtering discards valid points; too permissive retains noise.
  - Quick check question: If DBSCAN returns zero core points for a mask's back-projected cluster, which parameter should you adjust first: ε or min_samples? Why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text prompt → GroundingDINO detection → SAM mask → depth back-projection → DBSCAN clustering → medoid center + Rotating Calipers box → 3D output

- **Critical path**: Text prompt → GroundingDINO detection → SAM mask → depth back-projection → DBSCAN clustering → medoid center + Rotating Calipers box → 3D output. Each stage is sequential; failure at any point cascades.

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Medoid + shape priors vs. Rotating Calipers: Shape priors give better scale (lower mASE); Rotating Calipers gives better orientation (lower mAOE). Table 1 shows mASE degrades by 0.2 with Rotating Calipers but mAOE improves.
  - LiDAR vs. pseudo-depth: Real LiDAR achieves 29.94% mAP; pseudo-depth drops to 16.14% (Table 2). Trade-off is sensor cost vs. accuracy.
  - DBSCAN aggressiveness: Too strict → empty clusters; too loose → noisy boxes. Paper does not report tuned hyperparameters.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - mAP near 0% with non-empty detections: Check DBSCAN parameters; clusters may be discarded (Table 1 shows 1.30% mAP without DBSCAN vs. 21.94% with it).
  - Correct center but wrong orientation: Rotating Calipers alone is insufficient; combine with medoid centering (Table 1: Rotating Calipers alone = 1.30% mAP vs. medoid + Rotating Calipers = 29.30%).
  - Systematic scale errors: Shape priors may be needed; pseudo-depth introduces additional scale noise.
  - No detections on known objects: Check GroundingDINO prompt engineering; text must match expected vocabulary.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Single-class LiDAR validation**: Run pipeline on "car" class only with LiDAR depth. Verify 2D detection accuracy first, then check back-projection alignment. Target: >25% mAP.
  2. **DBSCAN ablation**: Systematically vary ε and min_samples. Plot mAP vs. parameter values. Identify the regime where mAP degrades due to over/under-filtering.
  3. **Inflation strategy comparison**: Run medoid+shape-priors, Rotating Calipers alone, and medoid+Rotating-Calipers on same data subset. Compare mAP, mASE, mAOE to reproduce Table 1 tradeoffs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a unified geometric inflation strategy be developed that retains the improved orientation accuracy of Rotating Calipers without sacrificing the localization recall provided by medoid-based centering?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.1 notes that while Rotating Calipers improves orientation error (mAOE), it significantly hurts mAP and recall unless combined with medoid centering, highlighting a trade-off between precise shape estimation and robust center inference.
- Why unresolved: The current method treats these as distinct ablation strategies; the authors observe the conflict but do not propose a mechanism to resolve the tension between orientation precision and localization stability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new training-free geometric module that achieves lower mAOE than the shape priors baseline while maintaining or exceeding the 29.94% mAP of the medoid baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the geometric pipeline be made robust to the systematic noise of monocular depth estimation to prevent the loss of detection recall observed in RGB-only modes?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.3 reports "significantly less recall" when using pseudo-depth, noting that predicted depth labels create "noisier/more confusing model predictions" compared to real LiDAR.
- Why unresolved: The method currently processes depth maps as fixed inputs without correcting for the noise inherent in zero-shot estimators like UniDepth, causing valid detections to be filtered out.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified depth-handling strategy that closes the mAR (Mean Average Recall) gap between the LiDAR and Pseudo-depth variants on the Pseudo-nuScenes benchmark.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the performance of this training-free approach degrade on "long-tail" object categories compared to the "common classes" evaluated?
- Basis in paper: The Introduction claims the method targets "diverse, fine-grained" categories to solve 3D dataset limitations, but Section 5.1 and Table 1 restrict evaluation to the "5 most common classes."
- Why unresolved: The authors validate the system on high-frequency classes (e.g., cars) where 2D detectors are reliable, but the method's effectiveness on the rare/novel objects central to the "open-vocabulary" claim remains unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: A breakdown of mAP performance across the full nuScenes validation set, specifically stratified by object class frequency.

## Limitations
- Performance significantly degrades when using pseudo-depth instead of LiDAR (29.94% to 16.14% mAP), highlighting sensitivity to depth quality
- The method assumes objects rest on ground plane, limiting applicability to aerial or elevated objects
- Specific DBSCAN parameters, GroundingDINO configuration details, and fog augmentation parameters are not specified, making exact reproduction challenging

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The geometric back-projection mechanism (2D→3D via camera calibration and depth) is well-established and correctly implemented. The DBSCAN filtering's impact on mAP (21.94% vs 1.30%) is clearly demonstrated and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence**: The Rotating Calipers approach for 3D box inference is sound but requires careful parameter tuning. The trade-offs between medoid+shape-priors vs. medoid+Rotating Calipers are demonstrated but the optimal configuration for different object types needs further exploration.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific DBSCAN parameters, GroundingDINO configuration details, and the exact fog augmentation parameters are not specified, making exact reproduction challenging. The performance on Pseudo-nuScenes (16.14% mAP) suggests significant limitations with pseudo-depth that need further investigation.

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary DBSCAN parameters (ε from 0.1-1.0m, min_samples from 5-20) and quantify the impact on mAP, mATE, and mAOE. This will establish the robustness of the clustering stage and identify the optimal operating regime.

2. **Depth Quality Impact Study**: Compare performance using LiDAR, high-quality pseudo-depth (UniDepth), and degraded depth (quantization, noise injection). Measure mAP degradation patterns to understand the depth quality threshold for viable performance.

3. **Generalization to Novel Categories**: Test the method on classes not present in nuScenes training (e.g., "construction vehicle", "emergency vehicle") using only text prompts. Evaluate whether the 2D vision-language model's zero-shot capability transfers effectively to the 3D domain.
