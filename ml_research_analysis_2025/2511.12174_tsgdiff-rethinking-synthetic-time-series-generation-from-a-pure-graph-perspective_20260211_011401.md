# TSGDiff: Rethinking Synthetic Time Series Generation from a Pure Graph Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12174
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12174
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces graph-based synthetic time series generation with diffusion in latent graph space

## Executive Summary
TSGDiff presents a novel approach to synthetic time series generation by representing time series as dynamic graphs constructed from Fourier spectrum characteristics. The framework integrates a graph neural network-based encoder-decoder architecture with a diffusion-based generative process operating in the latent graph space. This design effectively captures temporal dependencies and structural relationships while generating high-quality synthetic time series data. The authors also propose Topological Structure Fidelity (Topo-FID), a graph-aware metric combining Graph Edit Similarity and Structural Entropy Similarity to evaluate structural fidelity.

## Method Summary
TSGDiff represents multivariate time series as dynamic graphs where nodes are consecutive time points and edges encode both local temporal connections and periodic relationships derived from Fourier analysis. The framework uses a graph encoder with GraphConvBlocks to extract structural features, which are encoded into a latent space via a VAE. A diffusion model with multiple denoising blocks operates in this latent space, and a decoder reconstructs synthetic time series from the generated latent representations. The training combines reconstruction loss, KL divergence, denoising loss, and Fourier consistency loss. The method is evaluated on six real-world datasets using both traditional metrics and the proposed Topo-FID score.

## Key Results
- TSGDiff achieves Topo-FID scores consistently above 0.85, indicating strong structural fidelity
- Context-FID scores remain below 0.4, demonstrating high quality synthetic generation
- Outperforms strong baselines including Diffusion-TS, TimeGAN, Cot-GAN, and TimeVAE across multiple evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TSGDiff's success stems from its novel graph-based representation that captures both local temporal dependencies and global periodic patterns through Fourier analysis. By encoding time series into dynamic graphs and applying diffusion models in the latent graph space, the method can generate synthetic sequences that preserve structural characteristics while maintaining high statistical fidelity. The integration of VAE regularization with denoising diffusion ensures stable training and diverse generation.

## Foundational Learning
- Fourier Transform for periodicity detection: Why needed - identifies dominant frequencies for periodic edge construction; Quick check - verify peak frequency detection accuracy on test signals
- Graph Neural Networks for temporal modeling: Why needed - captures complex structural relationships beyond simple sequences; Quick check - compare GNN vs. CNN performance on synthetic generation
- Diffusion probabilistic models: Why needed - enables stable high-quality generation through iterative denoising; Quick check - evaluate generation quality at different diffusion timesteps
- Dynamic graph construction: Why needed - represents evolving temporal relationships in time series; Quick check - visualize generated vs. real adjacency matrices

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Time Series -> FFT -> Graph Construction -> Graph Encoder -> VAE Latent -> Diffusion Model -> Decoder -> Synthetic Time Series

**Critical path**: Sliding windows → FFT peak detection → dynamic graph building → GraphConv encoder → latent diffusion → FC decoder → synthetic generation

**Design tradeoffs**: Graph representation adds structural expressiveness but increases computational complexity compared to sequence-based approaches. The diffusion process enables high-quality generation but requires careful hyperparameter tuning and longer training times.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Low Topo-FID scores indicate poor structural preservation, often due to incorrect periodic edge construction or inadequate graph representation
- KL divergence collapse suggests latent space underutilization, potentially requiring adjustment of VAE weight or architecture
- Training instability may arise from improper noise schedule or insufficient graph expressiveness

**3 first experiments**:
1. Visualize generated adjacency matrices against real data to verify periodic edge construction accuracy
2. Test generation quality with different window sizes to assess temporal resolution sensitivity
3. Compare performance using only consecutive edges vs. full periodic+consecutive graph structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the paper.

## Limitations
- The exact construction of periodic edges from detected Fourier periods lacks complete specification, creating uncertainty in graph representation
- The DiffusionBlock internal architecture is only broadly described as "3-layer MLP" without detailed specifications
- The noise schedule parameters (βₜ values) for the diffusion process are not provided, limiting exact reproduction

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core methodology combining graph neural networks with diffusion-based generation
- Medium confidence in the experimental results due to the proprietary Topo-FID metric and limited dataset evaluation
- Low confidence in exact reproducibility without complete implementation details for edge construction and diffusion network specifications

## Next Checks
1. Verify periodic edge construction by visualizing generated adjacency matrices and confirming periodic patterns match detected Fourier periods
2. Test alternative noise schedules (linear vs. cosine) to assess sensitivity of generation quality to diffusion hyperparameters
3. Implement ablation study removing the graph structure to quantify the contribution of the graph perspective to performance improvements
