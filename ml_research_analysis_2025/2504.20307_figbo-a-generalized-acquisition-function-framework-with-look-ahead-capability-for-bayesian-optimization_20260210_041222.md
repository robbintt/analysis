# FigBO: A Generalized Acquisition Function Framework with Look-Ahead Capability for Bayesian Optimization

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20307
- Reference count: 38
- Introduces FigBO, a generalized acquisition function framework that addresses the limitations of myopic acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization by incorporating look-ahead capability through global information gain.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FigBO, a generalized acquisition function framework that addresses the limitations of myopic acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization by incorporating look-ahead capability through global information gain. The key innovation is combining existing myopic acquisition functions with a global uncertainty term, Γ(x), which measures the prospective influence of candidate points on reducing uncertainty across the entire input space. The method uses Monte Carlo sampling and efficient matrix updates to maintain computational feasibility while balancing exploration and exploitation through a decaying coefficient λ. Theoretically, the authors prove that FigBO retains the convergence properties of standard myopic acquisition functions. Empirically, FigBO outperforms state-of-the-art methods including PES, MES, and JES across diverse tasks: synthetic test functions (Branin, Levy, Hartmann), GP prior samples in dimensions 2D-12D, and MLP classification tasks on OpenML datasets. The framework demonstrates faster convergence and superior optimization performance while maintaining practical implementation simplicity.

## Method Summary
FigBO is a generalized acquisition function framework that enhances myopic acquisition functions (like Expected Improvement) by adding a look-ahead term based on global information gain. The core algorithm maximizes a modified acquisition function that combines the base myopic function with Γ(x), a global uncertainty term measuring how much a candidate point reduces overall uncertainty across the input space. Γ(x) is approximated using Monte Carlo integration with L=100 uniform samples, and computational efficiency is maintained through Sherman-Morrison rank-1 updates for matrix inversions. A decaying coefficient λ = η/n (where η = N/10) balances exploration and exploitation over iterations. The method is theoretically proven to retain convergence properties of standard myopic functions while empirically outperforming state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world optimization tasks.

## Key Results
- FigBO outperforms state-of-the-art methods including PES, MES, and JES across diverse tasks
- Demonstrates faster convergence and superior optimization performance on synthetic test functions (Branin, Levy, Hartmann)
- Shows improved results on GP prior samples in dimensions 2D-12D and MLP classification tasks on OpenML datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FigBO works by addressing the fundamental limitation of myopic acquisition functions, which focus only on immediate utility without considering how candidate points might reduce uncertainty in unexplored regions. The global uncertainty term Γ(x) captures the prospective influence of candidate points on reducing uncertainty across the entire input space, providing a look-ahead capability that balances exploration and exploitation more effectively. By using Monte Carlo sampling to approximate this term and Sherman-Morrison updates for computational efficiency, FigBO maintains practical feasibility while improving optimization performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Optimization (BO)**: Sequential optimization framework using surrogate models to guide search for global optima. Needed to understand the problem context and how FigBO fits into the broader BO landscape. Quick check: Verify understanding by explaining how BO differs from grid search.
- **Myopic vs Non-myopic Acquisition Functions**: Myopic functions optimize immediate expected utility while non-myopic functions consider future utility. Needed to understand why FigBO bridges this gap. Quick check: Compare EI (myopic) with MES (non-myopic) to identify key differences.
- **Gaussian Process (GP) Surrogates**: Probabilistic models that provide uncertainty estimates for BO. Needed because FigBO relies on GP-specific properties for efficient computation. Quick check: Confirm ability to derive GP predictive mean and variance for new points.
- **Sherman-Morrison Formula**: Efficient rank-1 update for matrix inversions. Needed for computational efficiency in calculating Γ(x). Quick check: Verify ability to implement Sherman-Morrison updates correctly.
- **Monte Carlo Integration**: Numerical approximation method using random sampling. Needed for approximating the global uncertainty term Γ(x). Quick check: Confirm understanding of Monte Carlo error bounds and convergence.
- **Convergence Analysis in BO**: Theoretical framework for proving optimization guarantees. Needed to understand FigBO's theoretical contributions. Quick check: Review standard BO convergence proofs to identify key techniques.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Base Acquisition Function (e.g., EI) -> Global Uncertainty Term Γ(x) -> Modified Acquisition α(x) + λΓ(x) -> Optimization Loop -> GP Update

**Critical Path**: The critical path is the acquisition optimization loop where Γ(x) is computed for each candidate point. This involves Monte Carlo sampling, variance reduction calculations, and Sherman-Morrison updates. The efficiency of this path determines overall computational feasibility.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades off between exploration (via Γ(x)) and exploitation (via base acquisition function) through the decaying coefficient λ. A slower decay provides more exploration but may delay convergence; faster decay may miss important regions. The choice of L=100 samples for Monte Carlo approximation balances accuracy against computational cost.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- High computational cost indicates inefficient Γ(x) computation or missing Sherman-Morrison updates
- Exploration dominance suggests λ decays too slowly or Γ(x) scale is too large
- Convergence to suboptimal solutions may indicate poor sampling strategy for Γ(x) or insufficient Monte Carlo samples
- Runtime discrepancies from benchmarks suggest implementation issues with matrix updates

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Implement baseline BO with EI on Branin function (2D, N=200) to establish reference performance
2. Add Γ(x) term to EI to create FigBO-EI and verify improved performance on Branin
3. Scale to 4D-6D synthetic functions to test performance improvements and computational overhead

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: Can FigBO maintain its theoretical convergence guarantees and empirical efficiency when applied to non-Gaussian Process surrogate models, such as Bayesian Neural Networks or Random Forests? The derivation of Γ(x) and computational efficiency gains rely specifically on GP kernel structure.

**Open Question 2**: Does the global uncertainty term Γ(x) provide additive benefits when combined with existing non-myopic acquisition functions (e.g., PES, MES), or does it result in redundant computational overhead? The paper suggests future work could explore this combination.

**Open Question 3**: Do the regret bounds and asymptotic convergence rates proven for FigBO with Expected Improvement (EI) extend to other myopic base acquisition functions like Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) or Probability of Improvement (PI)? The theoretical analysis is restricted to EI despite empirical results suggesting effectiveness with other functions.

## Limitations
- Theoretical convergence guarantees are proven only for Expected Improvement, not for other myopic base functions
- Implementation relies on Gaussian Process surrogates, with unclear applicability to other surrogate models
- Computational efficiency claims depend on correct implementation of Sherman-Morrison updates, which is non-trivial for high-dimensional problems

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical framework and proof of convergence preservation are well-established
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical performance claims, due to missing implementation details and unclear hyperparameter settings
- **Medium confidence**: Computational efficiency claims, as Sherman-Morrison updates require careful implementation verification

## Next Checks
1. **Baseline Implementation**: Reproduce standard BO with EI on Branin function (2D, N=200) to establish reference performance
2. **Γ(x) Term Verification**: Implement Monte Carlo sampling for Γ(x) with L=100 samples and validate variance reduction calculations using Sherman-Morrison updates
3. **Scaling Analysis**: Test FigBO on 4D-6D synthetic functions to verify claimed performance improvements and assess computational overhead compared to benchmarks
