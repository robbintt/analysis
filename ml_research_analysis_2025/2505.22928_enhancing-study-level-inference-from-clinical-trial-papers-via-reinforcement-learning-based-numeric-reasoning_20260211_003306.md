# Enhancing Study-Level Inference from Clinical Trial Papers via Reinforcement Learning-Based Numeric Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.22928
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22928
- Reference count: 34
- Outperforms 400B+ LLMs by up to 9% on RCTs benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of extracting numeric evidence and determining study-level conclusions for systematic reviews in medicine. The authors propose a novel pipeline that reframes the problem as one of quantitative reasoning rather than textual inference, extracting structured numerical evidence and applying domain-informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. They develop a numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an effect estimate component, trained using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a custom value-based reward model. Evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, their best-performing approach using reinforcement learning yields up to a 21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9% on the RCTs benchmark, demonstrating the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating systematic evidence synthesis.

## Method Summary
The method extracts structured numeric evidence (event counts, means, SDs) from clinical trial papers using a Qwen2.5-7B model trained via supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The model outputs YAML-structured outcome data with optional reasoning traces. A rule-based effect estimate component computes risk ratios for binary outcomes or mean differences for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Study conclusions are derived from whether CIs cross the null value. Training uses a weighted reward combining correctness (0.8), format (0.1), and thought format (0.1) to optimize extraction quality. The pipeline is evaluated on COCHRANEFOREST and RCTs benchmarks.

## Key Results
- RL-trained Qwen2.5-7B achieves 81.6 F1 vs 74.5 for SFT on COCHRANEFOREST benchmark
- 21% absolute improvement in F1 over retrieval-based systems
- Outperforms 400B+ LLMs by up to 9% on RCTs benchmark
- Error Impact Rate (EIR) of 24-28% indicates extraction errors frequently flip conclusions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Numeric Extraction Replaces Textual Retrieval
- Claim: Extracting explicit numerical values and computing effect estimates produces more accurate study conclusions than retrieving and reasoning over text fragments.
- Mechanism: The pipeline parses full-text papers into YAML-structured outcome data, then applies domain rules (risk ratio or mean difference calculations with 95% CIs) to derive conclusions based on whether CIs cross the null.
- Core assumption: The relevant numerical evidence is explicitly reported in the paper (in tables or text) and is correctly extractable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "we extract structured numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions"
  - Figure 2 shows that even at 100% retrieval precision, F1 plateaus at ~68%, suggesting textual cues alone are insufficient
- Break condition: When studies report outcomes implicitly (e.g., percentages requiring derivation from totals) or have missing values, extraction accuracy degrades.

### Mechanism 2: Reinforcement Learning with Fine-Grained Rewards Aligns Extraction Behavior
- Claim: RL training with dense, rule-based rewards produces better numerical extraction than SFT alone.
- Mechanism: GRPO samples multiple completions per input, scores them with weighted rewards (0.8 correctness, 0.1 format, 0.1 thought format), and optimizes policy via clipped, KL-regularized objectives.
- Core assumption: The reward functions accurately capture what constitutes correct extraction and reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "The final reward is a weighted combination... R = 0.8·RCR + 0.1·RFR + 0.1·RTFR"
  - Qwen2.5-7B-RL achieves 81.6 F1 vs 74.5 for SFT on COCHRANEFOREST
- Break condition: Sparse rewards (EX-only) underperform dense rewards—the paper's ablation shows RL-EX achieves 79.7 F1 vs 80.1 for the dense formulation.

### Mechanism 3: Domain-Specific Effect Estimation Provides Interpretable Conclusions
- Claim: Rule-based effect size computation with CI-based decision rules yields conclusions aligned with expert systematic review methodology.
- Mechanism: After extraction, the effect estimate component computes point estimates and 95% CIs using standard meta-analytic formulas. Conclusions follow from CI position relative to null (1 for ratios, 0 for differences).
- Core assumption: Outcome type (binary vs. continuous) is correctly classified, and extracted values are accurate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Study conclusions are determined directly from the 95% confidence interval of the effect estimate"
  - Tables-only ablation achieves 73.1 F1 (RL), confirming structured numeric content drives performance
- Break condition: Incorrect outcome type classification or extraction errors propagate through effect calculations—EIR metric shows 24-28% of errors flip conclusions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Forest plots and effect size estimation (risk ratios, mean differences, confidence intervals)
  - Why needed here: The entire pipeline assumes understanding how meta-analytic conclusions derive from numerical study data.
  - Quick check question: Given intervention events=8/23 and comparator events=2/22, can you compute the risk ratio and interpret whether the CI supports the intervention?

- Concept: Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for RLHF
  - Why needed here: The paper uses GRPO rather than PPO; understanding normalized advantages and KL regularization is essential for reproducing training.
  - Quick check question: How does GRPO's group-based reward normalization differ from PPO's advantage estimation?

- Concept: YAML-structured output generation with LLMs
  - Why needed here: The extraction model must produce parseable YAML conforming to binary or continuous outcome schemas.
  - Quick check question: What parsing failures would cause RCR=0 in the correctness reward?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Full-text paper → Numeric Data Extraction Model → YAML parsing → Effect Estimate Component → Conclusion label
- Critical path: Paper text → Extraction model → YAML parsing → Effect calculation → CI interpretation → Conclusion label
- Design tradeoffs:
  - SFT with CoT vs. RL: SFT is simpler but RL achieves +7 F1; RL requires more compute and reward engineering
  - Dense vs. sparse rewards: Dense rewards (partial credit) outperform exact-match-only rewards
  - Model size: 7B RL-trained matches/exceeds 400B+ pretrained, but requires domain-specific training data
- Failure signatures:
  - High EIR (>30%): Extraction errors frequently flip conclusions—indicates brittleness in downstream logic
  - Hallucinated reasoning: SFT shows 15% hallucination rate vs. 4% for RL (Table 5)
  - Format parse failures: Cause RFR=0, blocking correctness signal
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate zero-shot baseline: Run Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on 20 COCHRANEFOREST examples to establish F1 floor (~65%)
  2. Ablate input modality: Test extraction on tables-only vs. text-only to confirm structured data contribution
  3. Validate effect computation: Manually verify CI calculations match paper formulas on 5 binary and 5 continuous examples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the numeric extraction model be adapted to explicitly detect and flag missing or uncertain values?
- Basis in paper: The authors note the model currently "does not attempt to identify or flag missing information," which limits its utility in incomplete or noisy real-world settings.
- Why unresolved: The current system assumes all relevant numerical evidence is cleanly extractable, leading to potential failure when data is absent.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model variant capable of outputting a "missing data" label or confidence scores for unextractable values without hallucinating numbers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can this quantitative reasoning framework generalize to scientific domains beyond biomedicine?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states that "Future research may extend this framework to other scientific domains where quantitative reasoning is core."
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation is restricted to biomedical systematic reviews (Cochrane) and RCTs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the pipeline to systematic reviews in fields such as social sciences or environmental studies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the use of predefined logical rules constrain the system's ability to handle complex or heterogeneous clinical data?
- Basis in paper: The limitations section mentions that focusing on a "limited set of outcome types and uses predefined logical rules" may hinder generalization to diverse scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The effect estimate component relies on fixed logic (e.g., fixed-effect models) which may not capture the nuance of all study designs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on studies requiring random-effects models or complex meta-analytic syntheses not covered by the current rule set.

## Limitations
- High Error Impact Rate (24-28%) indicates extraction errors frequently flip conclusions
- Training data creation requires proprietary Cochrane Database access and custom SVG parsing
- Performance depends on accurate numerical extraction from papers with inconsistent reporting

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The superiority of reinforcement learning over supervised fine-tuning for this task is well-supported (81.6 vs 74.5 F1), with clear ablation results and reasonable reward engineering.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that structured numeric extraction outperforms text retrieval is supported by performance gains, but the 21% F1 improvement should be interpreted cautiously given the high EIR suggesting fundamental fragility in the extraction component.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the domain rules for effect estimation across diverse clinical trial reporting standards remains uncertain, as the evaluation corpus (COCHRANEFOREST) may not capture the full heterogeneity of clinical literature.

## Next Checks

1. Test the inference pipeline on papers with missing or inconsistently reported numerical data to quantify performance degradation beyond the reported EIR.
2. Compare the system's effect estimates against independent manual calculations on a random sample of Cochrane forest plots to verify the rule-based calculations are correctly implemented.
3. Replicate the SFT vs. RL ablation using the published framework to confirm that the reported 7-point F1 improvement is reproducible with the specified hyperparameters.
