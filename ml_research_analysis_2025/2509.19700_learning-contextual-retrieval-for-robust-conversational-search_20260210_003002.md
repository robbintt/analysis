# Learning Contextual Retrieval for Robust Conversational Search

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.19700
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19700
- Authors: Seunghan Yang; Juntae Lee; Jihwan Bang; Kyuhong Shim; Minsoo Kim; Simyung Chang
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Achieved 42.2% MRR and 81.7% Hit@20 on TopiOCQA without additional inference overhead

## Executive Summary
ContextualRetriever introduces a novel method for improving conversational search by directly incorporating conversational context into retrieval through a context-aware embedding mechanism. The approach emphasizes the current query within dialogue history while using intent-guided supervision with rewritten queries, combined with a training strategy that preserves the generative capabilities of the base LLM. Evaluated across four conversational search benchmarks, the method demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results on TopiOCQA and TREC-CAsT while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The method employs a context-aware embedding mechanism that emphasizes the current query within dialogue history, combined with intent-guided supervision using rewritten queries and a training strategy that preserves the generative capabilities of the base LLM. The approach integrates conversational context directly into the retrieval process rather than relying on separate query rewriting steps, allowing the model to better track evolving user intent across conversation turns while maintaining efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieved 42.2% MRR and 81.7% Hit@20 on TopiOCQA benchmark
- Achieved 62.3% nDCG@3 and 46.8% Hit@20 on TREC-CAsT benchmark
- Outperformed models that rely on explicit query rewriting without additional inference overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by integrating conversational context directly into the retrieval embedding process through a context-aware mechanism that emphasizes the current query within dialogue history. The intent-guided supervision using rewritten queries provides additional training signals that help the model better understand user intent evolution. The training strategy preserves the generative capabilities of the base LLM, allowing it to maintain strong performance across different conversational contexts while avoiding the computational overhead typically associated with explicit query rewriting approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Conversational search context modeling** - Understanding how user intent evolves across conversation turns is critical for effective retrieval. Quick check: Can the model maintain relevant retrieval accuracy when user queries shift topics mid-conversation?

**Context-aware embeddings** - The mechanism for incorporating dialogue history into query representations without losing focus on the current query. Quick check: Does the model properly balance between current query emphasis and historical context integration?

**Intent-guided supervision** - Using rewritten queries as training signals to improve understanding of user intent. Quick check: Are rewritten queries consistently improving retrieval performance across different conversation types?

**Retrieval metrics evaluation** - Understanding the relationship between retrieval metrics (MRR, Hit@20, nDCG@3) and actual conversational QA performance. Quick check: Do improvements in retrieval metrics translate to better final answer accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Context-aware embedding module -> Intent-guided supervision module -> Base LLM preservation training -> Retrieval output

**Critical path:** Query input → Context integration → Embedding generation → Intent supervision → Final retrieval scores

**Design tradeoffs:** The method prioritizes maintaining generative capabilities while incorporating context, which means sacrificing some potential gains from more aggressive context integration techniques that might harm the base model's versatility.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance on topic shifts where historical context becomes irrelevant, or degradation when conversation history becomes too long and overwhelms the current query emphasis.

**First experiment:** Ablation study to isolate contributions of context-aware embedding vs intent-guided supervision

**Second experiment:** Runtime efficiency comparison under identical hardware configurations

**Third experiment:** Downstream QA accuracy evaluation using human annotation to verify retrieval improvements translate to better answers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on retrieval metrics without addressing downstream QA accuracy
- Comparisons include older models from 2021-2022, missing more recent state-of-the-art approaches
- Unclear whether performance advantages come from context-aware embedding or training strategy preservation

## Confidence

**Retrieval performance improvements on TopiOCQA:** High confidence - Specific metrics (42.2% MRR, 81.7% Hit@20) with substantial improvements over baselines

**Retrieval performance on TREC-CAsT:** Medium confidence - nDCG@3 and Hit@20 show improvement, but lack of MRR improvement suggests nuanced results

**No additional inference overhead:** Low confidence - Claim made without concrete runtime measurements or memory usage analysis

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a comprehensive ablation study isolating contributions of context-aware embedding, intent-guided supervision, and training strategy preservation

2. Evaluate downstream QA accuracy of retrieved passages using human annotation to verify retrieval metrics translate to better conversational QA performance

3. Perform runtime and memory efficiency analysis comparing ContextualRetriever against baselines under identical hardware configurations to validate "no additional inference overhead" claim
