# EHRSummarizer: A Privacy-Aware, FHIR-Native Architecture for Structured Clinical Summarization of Electronic Health Records

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01668
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01668
- Reference count: 8
- One-line primary result: EHRSummarizer is a privacy-aware, FHIR-native reference architecture for structured clinical summarization of electronic health records that minimizes data retention and supports both hosted and local deployment patterns.

## Executive Summary
EHRSummarizer presents a reference architecture designed to address privacy and safety concerns in clinical summarization of electronic health records (EHRs). The system retrieves and normalizes high-yield FHIR R4 resources into a clinical context package, generating structured summaries to support chart review while minimizing data retention. It emphasizes deployment flexibility, offering both hosted and local patterns to align with organizational trust boundaries. The architecture includes built-in guardrails to avoid unsupported inference or clinical recommendations, prioritizing safety over clinical outcome claims. Prototype demonstrations validated end-to-end behavior using synthetic/test FHIR environments, though no clinical validation in live production settings has been conducted.

## Method Summary
The EHRSummarizer architecture retrieves high-yield FHIR R4 resources, normalizes them into a clinical context package, and generates structured summaries for chart review. It supports both hosted and local deployment patterns to accommodate organizational trust boundaries and includes safety guardrails to avoid unsupported inference or clinical recommendations. The system is designed for privacy-aware operation, minimizing data retention by avoiding persistent storage of sensitive clinical data. Prototype demonstrations were conducted in synthetic/test FHIR environments to validate end-to-end behavior, though no clinical validation in live production settings has been performed.

## Key Results
- EHRSummarizer is a privacy-aware, FHIR-native reference architecture for structured clinical summarization of electronic health records.
- The system minimizes data retention by avoiding persistent storage of sensitive clinical data and supports both hosted and local deployment patterns.
- Prototype demonstrations validated end-to-end behavior using synthetic/test FHIR environments, emphasizing privacy, deployment flexibility, and safety over clinical outcome claims.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The EHRSummarizer architecture works by leveraging FHIR R4 as a standardized data model to retrieve and normalize clinical information into a structured context package. This approach ensures interoperability and consistency across diverse EHR systems. The system's design prioritizes privacy through minimal data retention and offers deployment flexibility to align with organizational trust boundaries. Safety guardrails prevent unsupported inference or clinical recommendations, reducing risk in automated summarization. By focusing on structured summaries rather than free-text generation, the system supports efficient chart review while maintaining control over the scope and accuracy of the output.

## Foundational Learning
- **FHIR R4 Standard**: Why needed - Provides a standardized data model for EHR interoperability; Quick check - Verify FHIR resource types and profiles used align with your EHR vendor's implementation.
- **Privacy-Aware Design**: Why needed - Minimizes data retention and exposure of sensitive clinical information; Quick check - Audit data flow to confirm no persistent storage of raw clinical data.
- **Safety Guardrails**: Why needed - Prevents unsupported clinical inference or recommendations; Quick check - Test system responses to edge cases and ambiguous clinical data.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Why needed - Supports both hosted and local deployment to match organizational trust boundaries; Quick check - Validate deployment options align with your IT and compliance requirements.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: FHIR Server -> EHRSummarizer Core -> Summarization Engine -> Output Interface
- **Critical Path**: Retrieve FHIR resources -> Normalize to clinical context package -> Generate structured summary -> Present to user
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritizes privacy and safety over advanced clinical inference capabilities; avoids persistent storage to minimize data retention risk
- **Failure Signatures**: Incomplete or inconsistent FHIR data may lead to missing or inaccurate summaries; unsupported inference attempts are blocked by safety guardrails
- **3 First Experiments**:
  1. Deploy EHRSummarizer in a synthetic FHIR environment and validate retrieval and normalization of core resource types.
  2. Test the system's safety guardrails by attempting to generate unsupported clinical inferences or recommendations.
  3. Benchmark performance (latency, throughput) under realistic clinical chart review workloads using synthetic data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- EHRSummarizer has been demonstrated only in synthetic/test FHIR environments, with no clinical validation in live production settings.
- The system's performance on real-world, heterogeneous FHIR data with incomplete or inconsistent resource usage is unknown.
- Key uncertainties include summarization accuracy, omission risk, and clinical usefulness, as these have not been empirically assessed.

## Confidence
- Reference architecture design and deployment patterns: High
- Privacy and safety guardrails: Medium (untested in practice)
- Clinical summarization utility: Low (no real-world validation)
- Evaluation framework completeness: Low (plan only, no results)

## Next Checks
1. Deploy EHRSummarizer in a live clinical environment with real patient data and assess summarization accuracy against clinician-reviewed ground truth.
2. Benchmark system performance (latency, throughput, resource usage) under realistic clinical chart review workloads.
3. Conduct adversarial testing to evaluate robustness of safety guardrails against prompt injection and unsupported clinical inferences.
