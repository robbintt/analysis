# ATHENA: Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.03476
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03476
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Super-human performance with validation errors as low as 10⁻¹⁴ for canonical benchmarks

## Executive Summary
ATHENA is a multi-agent framework designed to bridge the gap between foundation model text generation and the rigorous demands of scientific computing and machine learning. By interpreting the research lifecycle as a Contextual Bandit problem, ATHENA uses a hierarchical agentic loop to iteratively plan, implement, and evaluate numerical methods, constrained by expert-derived blueprints to guide search efficiently and prevent hallucination. This structured approach allows the system to autonomously diagnose physical failures, enforce mathematical constraints, and refine methods beyond standard automation. The framework achieves super-human performance, with validation errors as low as 10⁻¹⁴ for canonical benchmarks, and successfully orchestrates hybrid workflows that combine PINNs and classical solvers for multiphysics problems.

## Method Summary
ATHENA implements a hierarchical agentic loop (HENA) that frames the iterative research process as a Contextual Bandit problem, where a policy π selects structural actions An (combinations of models, constraints, optimizers) to minimize regret. The system decomposes into Conceptualization Teams (Strategy, Advisor) that plan and evaluate, and Implementation Teams (Code Retrieval, Implementation, Debugging) that translate plans into executable code. Expert-derived Conceptual Scaffolding provides five blueprints (Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed ML, Operator Learning, Optimization, Numerical Methods) that constrain the search space while enabling innovation. The framework uses a composite reward Rn = R_integrity (35pts) + R_accuracy (35pts) + R_details (15pts) + R_optimality (15pts) and aims to induce a submartingale property E[R_{n+1}|History_n] ≥ R_n. Supported by GPT-5.1, Gemini 3.0, Claude 4.5, and Grok 4.1.

## Key Results
- Achieved validation errors as low as 10⁻¹⁴ for canonical PINN benchmarks
- Successfully orchestrated hybrid workflows combining PINNs and classical solvers for multiphysics problems
- Demonstrated human-in-the-loop collaboration that improved results by an order of magnitude by bridging stability gaps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Contextual Bandit Formulation Constrain the Search Space
Framing the research lifecycle as a Contextual Bandit problem with a fixed, sample-efficient policy constrains the combinatorial search space of numerical algorithms, aiming to make the search more efficient than random guessing. The system defines a finite action space $\mathcal{A}$ (combinations of models, constraints, optimizers). At step $n$, a policy $\pi$ selects an action $A_n$ based on prior history. This action is implemented as code $S_n$, which produces observations $O_n$ and a reward $R_n$. The goal is to minimize regret. The policy is designed to induce a submartingale on the expected reward: $E[R_{n+1} | \text{History}_n] \ge R_n$. Core assumption: The expert-designed policy, combined with Conceptual Scaffolding, can effectively bias the search toward higher-reward states, making the no-regret objective tractable for complex SciML problems.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Agent Teams Decompose Cognitive Load
Separating the system into Conceptualization Teams (Policy $\pi$) and Implementation Teams (Operator $I$) addresses the cognitive bottlenecks of foundation models, specifically "Lost in the Middle" phenomena and conceptual drift. Instead of a monolithic LLM, specialized agent teams handle different stages. The Implementation Teams (Code Retrieval, Implementation, Debugging) manage the translation of a high-level plan into code ($A_n \to S_n$). The Conceptualization Teams (Strategy and Advisor) analyze results and formulate the next plan. This is enforced through a strict "cell-by-cell refactoring" protocol to prevent error accumulation in long code. Core assumption: The benefits of specialized, constrained agents outweigh the overhead of inter-agent communication and potential loss of global context.

### Mechanism 3: Conceptual Scaffolding Grounds Generative Reasoning
Constraining the action space and agent reasoning with expert-derived blueprints ("Conceptual Scaffolding") enables the system to perform generative innovation within a mathematically grounded framework, preventing hallucination. The scaffolding acts as a prior, encoded in system prompts and base code templates. It provides five key blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed Machine Learning). Agents use these blueprints to diagnose failures from observations (e.g., plots, loss curves) and map them to principled "cures" (e.g., "apply adaptive sampling") from the relevant blueprint. This guides the policy update. Core assumption: The provided blueprints are sufficiently comprehensive to guide the agents toward optimal or near-optimal solutions for the targeted problem domains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contextual Bandit Problem**
  - Why needed here: This is the core theoretical framework used to model the iterative research process. Understanding it is essential to grasp how the system balances exploration and exploitation to minimize regret over time.
  - Quick check question: How does the system's approach to a contextual bandit differ from standard reinforcement learning with a state space?

- **Concept: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework is designed to solve problems in SciC and SciML. Familiarity with PINNs, neural operators, and the unique challenges of training them (e.g., spectral bias, stability) is crucial for understanding the problem domain and the agents' diagnostic reasoning.
  - Quick check question: What is "spectral bias" in the context of PINNs, and what kind of architectural change might an agent propose to mitigate it?

- **Concept: Multi-Agent System Architecture (Orchestrator, Specialists)**
  - Why needed here: ATHENA is not a single model but a coordinated team. Understanding the roles (e.g., Coordinator, Strategist, Planner, Inspector) and the flow of information between them is necessary to debug the system's behavior.
  - Quick check question: Which agent is responsible for translating the high-level strategy into a concrete executable code state ($S_n$)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  User Request -> Coordinator/Gatekeeper -> Strategy Team (creates plan $A_n$) -> Code Retrieval Team (gets base code/modules) -> Implementation Team (builds $S_n$) -> Execution (runs code, produces $O_n$) -> Advisor Team (analyzes $O_n$, computes $R_n$) -> Storage (logs results) -> Strategy Team (next iteration)

- **Critical path:** `User Request` -> `Coordinator/Gatekeeper` -> `Strategy Team` (creates plan $A_n$) -> `Code Retrieval Team` (gets base code/modules) -> `Implementation Team` (builds $S_n$) -> `Execution` (runs code, produces $O_n$) -> `Advisor Team` (analyzes $O_n$, computes $R_n$) -> `Storage` (logs results) -> `Strategy Team` (next iteration)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Autonomy vs. Grounding:** The framework trades the broad flexibility of an unconstrained LLM for the reliability of a scaffolded search. The `Critic` and `Inspector` agents enforce this constraint, potentially rejecting novel but risky ideas.
  - **Modularity vs. Complexity:** The multi-team architecture adds significant system complexity but is intended to manage context length and error propagation. The `cell-by-cell refactoring` is a key technique to manage this.
  - **Sample Efficiency vs. Global Optimality:** The bandit formulation and scaffolding aim for sample efficiency (finding a good solution quickly), which may come at the cost of exploring more exotic solutions that a slower, deeper search might find.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Stuck in Loop:** System keeps proposing similar actions without improving reward. Cause: Policy may be in a local optimum; scaffolding may lack a needed blueprint.
  - **Hallucinated Code:** Generated code doesn't run or solves the wrong problem. Cause: `Inspector` or `Validator` agents failed to catch a misalignment between plan $A_n$ and code $S_n$.
  - **Silent Physics Failure:** Code runs and reports a low error, but the solution is physically wrong. Cause: `Advisor` agent's diagnostic reasoning failed to spot the issue in the plots/observations.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce a Canonical PINN Benchmark:** (e.g., Viscous Burgers). Provide the exact `User Request` from Appendix C.2.2. Goal: Verify the full HENA loop executes, agents communicate correctly, and the system can achieve the stated $10^{-14}$ MSE performance.
  2. **Introduce a "Silent Failure" Case:** Run the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability problem (Appendix C.1.2). Goal: Observe if the `Advisor` agent correctly diagnoses the numerical diffusion issue and if the `Strategy Team` successfully implements the corrective action (e.g., switching AMR indicators).
  3. **Test Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration:** Start the Inviscid Burgers (PIML Stress Test) from Appendix C.2.5. After the system hits its autonomous performance bottleneck, intervene with the `User Request` directive to switch to a Periodic Wavelet basis (as in Section 3.6). Goal: Verify the system accepts the high-level human constraint and the implementation team can synthesize the novel architecture from scratch.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the proposed HENA policy formally guarantee a submartingale property ($E[R_{n+1} | \text{History}_n] \geq R_n$), or is this strictly an empirical observation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the scaffolding design "aims to induce a submartingale on the scientific reward" (p. 4) to ensure the search is more efficient than random guessing, but stop short of proving this mathematically.
- Why unresolved: Proving this property requires theoretical guarantees that LLM-based stochastic policies effectively navigate non-convex optimization landscapes without drift, which remains a significant theoretical challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal theoretical proof or a large-scale statistical analysis demonstrating consistent monotonically increasing expected rewards across diverse problem classes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can ATHENA maintain sample efficiency when scaling to high-dimensional, multiphysics problems requiring deep search trees (thousands of iterations) rather than the shallow trees demonstrated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper contrasts its "shallow tree" efficiency against "brute-force" search methods (p. 3), but validates the framework primarily on canonical 1D/2D benchmarks where the solution space is relatively constrained.
- Why unresolved: The "Contextual Bandit" formulation may struggle with combinatorial explosion or context window limits ("Lost in the Middle") as the history of trials grows into the thousands for complex 3D simulations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the framework to large-scale 3D turbulence or complex geometry simulations requiring extensive evolutionary iterations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent can the "Valley of Death" in stability be automated without human intervention?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "human-in-the-loop" intervention was required to bridge stability gaps (Abstract, p. 21), specifically citing the need for human intuition to propose a Periodic Wavelet basis when the agent stalled.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the agent's inability to spontaneously propose the optimal basis was a failure of the "Conceptual Scaffolding" or an intrinsic limitation of the LLM's capacity for novel reasoning under uncertainty.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of the autonomous discovery of novel, non-standard architectural components (like the Wavelet-KAN) in problems where standard blueprints fail.

## Limitations
- The paper provides a detailed conceptual framework but leaves critical implementation details underspecified, limiting reproducibility.
- The claimed super-human performance (10⁻¹⁴ validation error) is benchmarked on canonical problems, but the framework's ability to handle truly novel or out-of-distribution scientific challenges remains untested.
- The human-in-the-loop intervention described in Section 3.6 is promising but lacks systematic evaluation of when and how human guidance is most effective.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The Contextual Bandit formulation as a theoretical framework for autonomous scientific discovery; the identification of "Lost in the Middle" and conceptual drift as key failure modes for LLM-based scientific computing.
- **Medium confidence:** The hierarchical agent decomposition effectively addresses cognitive bottlenecks; the Conceptual Scaffolding prevents hallucination while enabling innovation.
- **Low confidence:** The system achieves consistent super-human performance across diverse, novel problems; the human-in-the-loop mechanism reliably bridges stability gaps without expert intervention.

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the Viscous Burgers benchmark with exact problem specification and verify the claimed 10⁻¹⁴ MSE performance.
2. Systematically test the framework on problems requiring innovations outside the provided blueprints to assess hallucination risk and scaffolding limitations.
3. Evaluate the human-in-the-loop mechanism across multiple failure modes to determine when human guidance is necessary versus when autonomous recovery is possible.
