# Debiasing Diffusion Model: Enhancing Fairness through Latent Representation Learning in Stable Diffusion Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.12536
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12536
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** DDM reduces fairness discrepancies (FD) and statistical parity differences (SPD) across demographic groups in diffusion-based image generation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Debiasing Diffusion Model (DDM) to address bias in image generation by Stable Diffusion models, which inherit and amplify societal biases from training data. DDM employs a novel latent representation learning indicator that operates independently of predefined sensitive attributes, aiming to produce fairer outputs by decoupling these attributes from learned representations. Unlike prior methods relying on external classifiers or predefined attributes, DDM integrates this indicator into the training process, reducing reliance on biased features while maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on gender-balanced face generation and digit generation tasks show DDM effectively reduces fairness discrepancies (FD) and statistical parity differences (SPD) across demographic groups. However, a trade-off between fairness and image quality is observed, with increased debiasing sometimes reducing generation fidelity. Evaluations using metrics like FD, SPD, FID, and Inception Score validate DDM's ability to enhance fairness, though challenges remain in balancing fairness gains with output quality and in tuning the debiasing strength. Overall, DDM provides a flexible, attribute-independent approach to mitigating bias in diffusion-based image generation.

## Method Summary
DDM addresses bias in Stable Diffusion by introducing a latent representation learning indicator that operates independently of predefined sensitive attributes. The method trains a denoising U-Net alongside an auxiliary indicator network that classifies denoised latents as target/non-target. By assigning identical labels to images with varying sensitive attributes, the model learns attribute-invariant representations. The training loss combines the standard diffusion loss with the indicator loss, weighted by hyperparameter α to balance fairness and quality. Experiments demonstrate reduced FD and SPD scores across demographic groups while maintaining generation quality, though a trade-off exists between fairness gains and image fidelity.

## Key Results
- DDM effectively reduces Fairness Discrepancy (FD) and Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) across demographic groups
- The method shows improved fairness metrics while maintaining generation quality, though some trade-off exists
- Experimental validation demonstrates effectiveness on both gender-balanced face generation and digit generation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: An auxiliary "indicator" classifier, trained on a binary target/non-target task orthogonal to sensitive attributes, forces the main diffusion model's U-Net to learn less biased latent representations.
- Mechanism: The indicator is trained alongside the U-Net to classify denoised latent features. Because this task is independent of sensitive attributes (e.g., gender), the U-Net is pressured to develop representations that serve this orthogonal task, thereby de-emphasizing features highly correlated with sensitive attributes.
- Core assumption: Features useful for the target/non-target classification are largely independent of the sensitive attributes the model is meant to avoid.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...DDM employs a novel latent representation learning indicator that operates independently of predefined sensitive attributes..."
  - [section 4.3] "...indicator then guides the model to learn robust features, minimizing the influence of biases associated with sensitive attributes."
  - [corpus] The problem is well-recognized (FairImagen [arXiv:2510.21363], LightFair [arXiv:2509.23639]), though solutions vary; DDM's use of an orthogonal indicator is a specific architectural choice.
- Break condition: The indicator's classification task is poorly defined, causing it to fail to provide a meaningful learning signal. The learned representations then fail to disentangle sensitive attributes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Assigning identical labels to images with varying sensitive attributes encourages the model to learn a shared, attribute-invariant representation.
- Mechanism: By providing a single, attribute-neutral prompt for the target class (e.g., "A human face"), the model's reconstruction objective is forced to align all diverse examples to the same semantic target. This makes sensitive attributes poor predictors of the shared label, discouraging the model from using them as primary features.
- Core assumption: The model's primary goal is accurate reconstruction, and it will drop features that do not contribute to this goal under the given constraints.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "By assigning identical labels to images with varying sensitive attributes, the indicator is encouraged to prioritize features that are independent of these attributes."
  - [abstract] "...promoting fairness through balanced representations without requiring predefined sensitive attributes."
  - [corpus] Fairness-Aware Grouping [arXiv:2507.11247] highlights challenges with continuous attributes, which DDM attempts to side-step by not using them as conditions.
- Break condition: The training data is so overwhelmingly biased that the model learns a spurious correlation between the shared label and the majority group's sensitive attributes, a correlation the indicator fails to break.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The trade-off between fairness and image quality is managed by a hyperparameter (α) that weights the indicator's loss against the main diffusion reconstruction loss.
- Mechanism: The total loss is a weighted sum: `L_DDM = (1 - α)L_SDM + αL_indicator`. A higher α prioritizes the debiasing signal from the indicator, potentially at the cost of reconstruction fidelity (image quality).
- Core assumption: There is an inherent, non-zero cost to debiasing in this framework, manifesting as reduced precision in reconstructing fine-grained details.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "...where the hyperparameter α to regulate the balance between ℒ𝒮𝒟ℳ and ℒ𝒾𝓃𝒹𝒾𝒸𝒶𝓉ℴ𝓇."
  - [section 5.3] "For FID, as demonstrated in Table 2, DDM generally exhibits a worsening trend across configurations...".
- Break condition: The chosen α is so high that the model fails to converge or produces non-recognizable images, or so low that it has no measurable effect on fairness.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)**
  - Why needed here: DDM is built on Stable Diffusion, an LDM. The entire debiasing process happens in a compressed "latent space," not on full-resolution pixels.
  - Quick check question: In an LDM, does the denoising U-Net operate on raw pixels or on a compressed representation?

- Concept: **Fairness Metrics (FD, SPD)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's success is measured by Fairness Discrepancy (FD) and Statistical Parity Difference (SPD). FD measures deviation from a uniform distribution, while SPD measures differences in likelihood between groups.
  - Quick check question: For a generative model, a high Fairness Discrepancy (FD) value signifies what kind of problem in the outputs?

- Concept: **Representation Disentanglement**
  - Why needed here: The core goal is to "disentangle" sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) from other semantic features (e.g., "is a human") in the model's latent space.
  - Quick check question: If a model's representation for a profession is perfectly disentangled from gender, what should be true about a set of images generated from that representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Pre-trained (Frozen)**: Text Encoder (CLIP), VAE Encoder
  - **Trainable**: Denoising U-Net (fine-tuned with LoRA), Indicator (small classifier, 3 FC layers)
  - **Data Flow**: Image -> VAE Encoder -> Noisy Latent -> U-Net -> Denoised Latent -> Indicator. The Indicator's loss provides gradients to the U-Net

- Critical path:
  1.  **Data Preparation**: Curate a biased `D_target` (e.g., 80% male faces) and a generic `D_non_target`
  2.  **Joint Training**: The U-Net learns to denoise while the Indicator learns to classify denoised latents as target/non-target. Gradients from the Indicator's loss push the U-Net's representations away from bias
  3.  **Inference**: The trained Indicator is **discarded**. Only the fine-tuned U-Net is used for generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **α (Alpha)**: Controls the fairness vs. quality trade-off. Requires careful tuning; too high leads to quality collapse
  - **Dataset Splits**: The need for a `D_non_target` doubles the data requirement, though LoRA mitigates training cost
  - **Indicator Complexity**: A simple 3-layer MLP is used. A more complex indicator might overfit; a simpler one might lack signal strength

- Failure signatures:
  - **No Effect**: Indicator accuracy is high, but FD/SPD scores don't improve (α may be too low or indicator task is not orthogonal to bias)
  - **Quality Collapse**: Generated images become blurry or unrecognizable as α increases
  - **New Bias**: The model overcompensates, reversing the original bias

- First 3 experiments:
  1.  **Alpha Sweep**: Train on a biased face dataset with α=0, 0.01, 0.05. Measure FD and FID to quantify the trade-off curve
  2.  **Indicator Ablation**: Remove the indicator and train with the same data to confirm the indicator is the active component for debiasing
  3.  **Entropy Analysis**: Evaluate the trained indicator's mean entropy on a balanced test set to verify it performs consistently across demographic groups, as shown in the paper's tables

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can adaptive techniques be developed to dynamically adjust the debiasing strength (α) during training to optimize the trade-off between fairness and image fidelity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "deriving a precise formula for an optimal α remains elusive" and suggest that future research should investigate "adaptive techniques that dynamically adjust debiasing strength to optimize performance."
- Why unresolved: Currently, α is a static hyperparameter; setting it too high forces the model to prioritize the fairness indicator at the expense of learning structural precision, leading to "noisy, low-quality images."
- What evidence would resolve it: A training mechanism that automatically modulates α per epoch or batch, achieving optimal Fairness Discrepancy (FD) scores while maintaining or improving Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) compared to static-α models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the architectural requirement for a distinct non-target dataset (D_nt) be relaxed or synthesized to improve data efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper identifies "Challenges in dataset preparation" as a limitation, noting that the method necessitates a dataset "effectively double in size" (target + non-target), which demands "more extensive training efforts."
- Why unresolved: While the authors note that LoRA mitigates training time, the fundamental data overhead of curating a specific non-target set remains a bottleneck for applying DDM to new domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating that DDM maintains high fairness performance when using generic negative data (e.g., random noise or standard datasets like ImageNet without specific curation) instead of a domain-specific D_nt.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the degradation of image quality an unavoidable consequence of reducing the model's reliance on sensitive attributes in the latent space?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the "fundamental tension" of the fairness-quality trade-off, noting that the method "inherently reduces the model's learning of sensitive attributes," which can impair its ability to "restore certain details during inference."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the observed "unrecognizable proportions" and lower FID scores are strictly due to the loss of bias information or if the "latent representation learning indicator" simply requires better optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis or empirical study showing that the latent space contains sufficient information to reconstruct high-fidelity images even when sensitive attributes are disentangled, perhaps through a more sophisticated indicator architecture.

## Limitations
- The exact architecture and input processing of the Indicator network is underspecified, creating ambiguity in faithful reproduction
- Training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, steps) are not explicitly provided, affecting the ability to replicate results
- The claim that the method works "without requiring predefined sensitive attributes" is somewhat misleading; while it doesn't use them as model inputs, it still requires curating datasets where sensitive attribute distributions are known
- The fairness vs. quality trade-off is presented as inherent, but the paper doesn't explore whether alternative indicator tasks or architectures could achieve better balance

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The general mechanism of using an auxiliary indicator to de-emphasize sensitive attributes in latent representations is sound and well-explained
- **Medium confidence:** The experimental results showing reduced FD and SPD are credible, but the lack of precise hyperparameter details and potential reproducibility issues temper confidence in exact performance
- **Low confidence:** The claim of attribute-independence is overstated; the method still requires knowledge of sensitive attribute distributions for dataset curation, even if not used as model inputs

## Next Checks
1. **Indicator Architecture Reproduction:** Implement the Indicator network with the stated "three fully connected layers" and verify its input dimensionality matches the processed latent space. Test its accuracy on a balanced validation set to ensure it learns a meaningful, non-trivial task
2. **Alpha Parameter Sweep:** Systematically train models with α values of 0.005, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 on the biased face dataset. Measure FD and FID at each point to precisely quantify the fairness-quality trade-off curve
3. **Baseline Comparison:** Implement a simple baseline (e.g., standard Stable Diffusion fine-tuning without the Indicator) on the same biased dataset. Compare FD/SPD scores to demonstrate the Indicator is the active debiasing component and not just a byproduct of fine-tuning on a balanced prompt
