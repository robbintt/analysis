# Evaluation of the Automated Labeling Method for Taxonomic Nomenclature Through Prompt-Optimized Large Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.10662
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10662
- Authors: Keito Inoshita; Kota Nojiri; Haruto Sugeno; Takumi Taga
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 93.2% average accuracy using prompt-engineered LLM for spider epithet etymology classification

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates prompt engineering techniques for improving LLM-based classification of spider species epithets into six etymology categories. The authors combine role-playing, few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and temporal context to achieve 93.2% average accuracy across 1,000 samples. Performance varies significantly by category, with high accuracy for Morphology, Geography, and People (85.9-89.5% F1) but low performance for Ecology & Behavior and Modern & Past Culture (40.5% and 32.2% F1 respectively).

## Method Summary
The authors use GPT-4o-mini to classify spider species epithets from the JAFList dataset into six etymology categories. The prompt engineering approach combines role-playing (establishing domain expertise), few-shot learning (4 examples), chain-of-thought reasoning, and temporal context (discovery year). The model outputs structured responses that are parsed into binary labels, evaluated against human-annotated ground truth using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 metrics.

## Key Results
- Full prompt (RP + FS-L + CoT + Year) achieved 93.2% average accuracy vs. 91.6% for RP alone and 89.3% for CoT alone
- Category-specific performance: Morphology (89.5% F1), Geography (87.8% F1), People (85.9% F1), Ecology & Behavior (40.5% F1), Modern & Past Culture (32.2% F1)
- Temporal context improved Modern & Past Culture accuracy from 92.0% to 95.7%
- Pearson correlation analysis showed consistent labeling across temporal and spatial dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Combining multiple prompt engineering techniques (RP + FS-L + CoT + temporal context) improves etymology classification accuracy compared to individual techniques alone. Role-playing establishes domain expertise framing, few-shot examples provide pattern recognition anchors, chain-of-thought elicits explicit reasoning steps, and temporal information contextualizes historical/cultural references. These techniques work synergistically by reducing ambiguity in Latin/Greek epithet interpretation.

### Mechanism 2
Inclusion of temporal context (year of species description) selectively improves classification accuracy for categories requiring historical-cultural interpretation. The year anchor allows the model to constrain its inference space—older names more likely reference classical mythology or historical figures; newer names may reference contemporary pop culture. This temporal grounding reduces false positives in the Modern & Past Culture category.

### Mechanism 3
LLM-based classification exhibits category-dependent performance variation tied to training data coverage and semantic ambiguity. Morphology, Geography, and People categories achieve high accuracy because they rely on concrete, well-documented descriptors. Ecology & Behavior and Modern & Past Culture underperform due to sparser ecological terminology in training corpora and difficulty capturing historical cultural contexts not well-represented in modern web data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: Core technique for eliciting explicit reasoning from LLMs on classification tasks where the model must infer etymology from partial information. Quick check: Can you explain why "Let's think step by step" improves zero-shot classification accuracy?

- **Few-Shot Learning in Low-Resource Domains**: Taxonomy has limited explicit etymological data; few-shot examples provide pattern anchors without fine-tuning. Understanding the tradeoff between example count and token costs is essential. Quick check: How does increasing few-shot examples from 1 to 4 typically affect accuracy vs. API cost?

- **Multi-Label Classification Metrics (Precision/Recall/F1)**: Species can belong to multiple etymology categories simultaneously. High accuracy alone can mask poor recall—the paper shows 94.6% accuracy but only 29.7% recall for Ecology & Behavior due to class imbalance. Quick check: Why might a classifier achieve 94% accuracy but only 30% recall on a specific category?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Species epithet extraction -> Prompt assembly (RP + FS-L + CoT + Year) -> LLM inference (GPT-4o-mini) -> Binary label extraction -> Evaluation metrics
- **Critical path**: Validate epithet extraction, ensure structured output format, temperature=0 for reproducibility, binary conversion logic handles edge cases
- **Design tradeoffs**: GPT-4o-mini chosen for cost/speed over accuracy; 4 few-shot examples balance coverage vs. token limits; ground truth quality may contain errors
- **Failure signatures**: Ecology & Behavior misclassification (over-assignment to Morphology), Modern & Past Culture under-detection (older references missed), year dependency failures
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline replication on 100 samples, 2) Ablation study removing one technique at a time, 3) Error analysis on low-recall categories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and expanded few-shot learning significantly improve LLM classification accuracy for the Ecology & Behavior and Modern & Past Culture categories? Current approaches still yield low recall for these categories, indicating fundamental limitations in LLM training data for ecological and historical contexts.

### Open Question 2
How well does LLM-based labeling generalize to other biological taxa (vertebrates, fossil taxa, microorganisms) beyond spiders? The study only evaluated spider taxonomy; different taxa have distinct etymological patterns and naming conventions.

### Open Question 3
How do potential errors in the human-annotated ground truth dataset affect the validity of LLM performance assessment? Without knowing the error rate in human annotations, LLM "errors" may actually be correct classifications, leading to underestimation of model accuracy.

### Open Question 4
Does incorporating human feedback into the LLM labeling pipeline improve accuracy for challenging categories? The study only evaluated static prompt engineering approaches; iterative refinement based on expert feedback has not been tested.

## Limitations
- Few-shot example variability: Only one of four examples provided, significantly impacting reproducibility
- Ground truth label reliability: Manual labeling from literature review may contain errors, creating ambiguity in performance metrics
- Temporal context dependency: Performance impact of missing or incorrect year information not tested

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Mechanism 1 (multi-technique prompt optimization) - Clear quantitative evidence shows Full prompt (93.2%) outperforming individual techniques
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanism 2 (temporal context benefits) - Supported by within-category improvement but lacks ablation testing with incorrect/missing years
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanism 3 (category-dependent performance) - Consistent with observed F1 ranges but ground truth quality uncertainty limits conclusions

## Next Checks

1. **Prompt reconstruction validation**: Implement visible prompt structure and create three additional few-shot examples; test on 100 randomly sampled species to verify category-wise performance matches Table III baselines.

2. **Temporal robustness testing**: Run identical classification tasks with year information randomly removed or altered by ±50 years to quantify performance degradation in Modern & Past Culture category specifically.

3. **Error pattern analysis**: Extract and manually review all false negatives in Ecology & Behavior and Modern & Past Culture categories to determine whether failures stem from prompt engineering, training data limitations, or ground truth labeling errors.
