# VideoScore2: Think before You Score in Generative Video Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.22799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22799
- Reference count: 40
- Multi-dimensional evaluator achieving 50.37% average accuracy across four out-of-domain benchmarks

## Executive Summary
VideoScore2 is a multi-dimensional evaluator for AI-generated videos that explicitly assesses visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical consistency while providing interpretable chain-of-thought rationales. Unlike existing evaluators that produce single opaque scores, VideoScore2 generates detailed reasoning traces before scoring, bridging the gap between evaluation and controllable generation. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of 27,168 human-annotated videos and achieves significant improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmark performance.

## Method Summary
VideoScore2 uses a two-stage training pipeline: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) cold-start on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with 2 fps sampling, max resolution 960×720, LR 5e-5, 2 epochs; (2) Reinforcement Learning with GRPO (Video-R1 framework), LR 2e-6, G=8 generations, 300 steps. The model generates chain-of-thought rationales before outputting JSON scores across three dimensions. Training data comes from VideoFeedback2 dataset containing 27,168 videos from 20+ T2V models with human annotations. Inference uses 2 fps sampling, temperature 0.7, and normalized float scores via token probability aggregation.

## Key Results
- Achieves 44.35% accuracy on in-domain benchmark (+5.94% improvement)
- Scores 50.37% average performance across four out-of-domain benchmarks (+4.32% improvement)
- Outperforms existing evaluators on VideoScore-Bench-v2, VideoGenReward-Bench, T2VQA-DB, MJ-Bench-Video, and VideoPhy2-test
- Best-of-N sampling with VideoScore2 consistently outperforms random sampling on VBench dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales improve evaluation generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks
- **Mechanism:** Forcing the model to generate detailed reasoning grounds its judgment in specific visual evidence and semantic rules rather than shallow statistical correlations
- **Core assumption:** Intermediate reasoning steps act as a regularizer, forcing the VLM to verify constraints that hold true across different video generators
- **Evidence anchors:** Table 7 shows SFT w/ CoT significantly outperforms SFT w/o CoT on OOD benchmarks (66.88 vs 59.06); GRADEO supports multi-step reasoning enhances consistency
- **Break condition:** If rationales become template-like or hallucinate visual features, the reasoning chain decouples from visual input

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A "cold-start" Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase is necessary for effective Reinforcement Learning (RL) in this evaluation task
- **Mechanism:** SFT instills complex output format and basic task understanding; RL refines this capability but fails to converge effectively from base model
- **Core assumption:** Reward landscape in RL is too sparse for base model to discover specific "thought-score" formatting from scratch
- **Evidence anchors:** Table 7 compares "RL w/o SFT" (36.70 In-Domain) vs "RL w/ SFT" (44.53 In-Domain); Section 4.1 states format reward required for RL from base model
- **Break condition:** If SFT dataset contains systematic biases, RL phase will amplify these errors

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multi-dimensional scoring creates more robust reward signal for Best-of-N sampling than single opaque score
- **Mechanism:** Decomposing quality into orthogonal dimensions prevents "reward hacking" where generator optimizes for one dimension at expense of others
- **Core assumption:** Dimensions are sufficiently independent; physical consistency failure is not perfectly correlated with visual quality
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract highlights multi-dimensional framework; Figure 7 shows Best-of-N sampling with VideoScore2 outperforms random sampling
- **Break condition:** If application prioritizes one dimension over others, simple averaging may misalign with user utility

## Foundational Learning

- **Vision Language Models (VLMs) as Evaluators**
  - Why needed: VideoScore2 is fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct); understanding VLM video processing is essential for debugging
  - Quick check question: Does the model evaluate video as continuous stream or sequence of discrete sampled frames?

- **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - Why needed: Specific RL algorithm used to align model with human preferences; differs from standard PPO by optimizing relative group rewards
  - Quick check question: In GRPO, how is baseline for advantage estimation calculated within group of generated outputs?

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - Why needed: Core innovation is "Think before You Score"; CoT forces model to attend to specific visual features before committing to scalar score
  - Quick check question: Does removing CoT output during inference degrade final score's accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video + Text Prompt -> Vision Encoder + LLM -> Chain-of-Thought Generation -> JSON Scores (Visual, Alignment, Physical)
- **Critical path:** Connection between Rationale Generation and Final Score Prediction; model trained to produce rationale first, interrupting this flow likely produces unanchored scores
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Integer vs. Float Scores: Uses normalized float scores for better preference resolution; raw integers degrade preference benchmark performance
  - FPS Sampling: Training at 2 fps is sufficient and computationally efficient; increasing to 8 fps adds noise and cost without accuracy gains
  - SFT Duration: Stopping early (1 epoch) risks underfitting; too long (3 epochs) risks overfitting and degrades OOD performance
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Repetitive Rationales: Model repeats generic comments for distinct videos, indicating backbone collapse or overfitting
  - Score Compression: Model predicts only 3s or 4s, failing to distinguish high-quality from low-quality videos
  - Format Loss: Model outputs score before rationale or fails to output valid JSON, indicating insufficient SFT or low format reward
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check (SFT Only): Run inference on VideoScore-Bench-v2 test set using only SFT checkpoint to ensure basic format and scoring capability
  2. Ablation on Frame Rate: Verify Appendix D.4 claims on specific hardware; run inference at 2 fps vs 4 fps to confirm sufficiency for motion complexity
  3. Reward Sensitivity: Analyze "Accuracy Reward" curve during first 100 steps of RL training; if reward doesn't rise steadily, check data alignment between prompt and ground-truth scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset size of 27,168 videos from 20+ T2V models creates inherent sampling bias toward specific prompt distributions and model capabilities
- RL fine-tuning shows sensitivity to hyperparameter choices with accuracy degrading beyond 300 steps, but unclear if this represents true overfitting
- Claims about bridging evaluation and controllable generation are forward-looking and not empirically validated

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Multi-dimensional evaluation framework is well-justified by existing literature; SFT cold-start requirement is clearly demonstrated through ablation
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalization benefits of chain-of-thought rationales are supported but could reflect increased model capacity; optimal FPS of 2 is supported but may vary with video content complexity
- **Low Confidence**: Claim that VideoScore2 bridges evaluation and controllable generation is not empirically validated; Best-of-N sampling improvements don't demonstrate direct generation guidance

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate VideoScore2 on videos from emerging T2V models (e.g., Sora, Veo) not represented in training distribution to quantify actual generalization limits
2. Conduct human studies comparing evaluator agreement when rationales are included versus only scores to validate whether "thinking" component improves evaluation consistency
3. Measure inference latency and computational requirements on consumer hardware to assess real-time video generation feedback loop feasibility
