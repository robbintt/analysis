# Punctuation and Predicates in Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.14067
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14067
- **Reference count:** 21
- **Primary result:** Punctuation tokens function as information aggregation points in specific model layers, with distinct processing schedules for different reasoning rules.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the computational role of punctuation tokens in large language models (LLMs) and how models process different reasoning rules. Using zeroing-out and interchange intervention techniques across GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma, the authors find that punctuation tokens like periods and question marks serve as necessary and sufficient information carriers in certain layers of GPT-2, particularly in later layers. However, DeepSeek and Gemma show markedly different patterns, with punctuation being necessary in only early layers for DeepSeek and sufficient in only a few layers for Gemma. Beyond punctuation, the study examines reasoning rules such as conditional statements ("if-then") and universal quantification ("for all"). Conditional statements are processed compositionally in early layers and become fixed thereafter, while universal quantification is revisited throughout the network. Layer-swapping experiments reveal that conditional rules are less swappable than universal quantification, suggesting they are more difficult for the model to process.

## Method Summary
The study uses RuleTaker dataset with facts, rules, and true/false/unknown questions. Models (GPT-2 Small, DeepSeek 1.3B, Gemma 2B) are fine-tuned on RuleTaker with GPT-2 using full parameter training while DeepSeek and Gemma use LoRA. The authors employ zeroing-out interventions to test punctuation token necessity/sufficiency and interchange intervention accuracy (IIA) to measure reasoning rule processing across layers. Layer-swapping experiments test functional redundancy. NNsight library manipulates residual stream activations during inference.

## Key Results
- Punctuation tokens (periods, question marks) serve as information carriers in GPT-2 but show model-specific patterns in DeepSeek and Gemma
- Conditional reasoning is processed early and becomes fixed, while universal quantification is revisited throughout the network
- Conditional rules are less swappable than universal quantification, indicating higher functional specificity
- Gemma shows negligible punctuation sensitivity, potentially due to knowledge distillation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Punctuation tokens function as information aggregation points in the residual stream, but this role is highly architecture-dependent.
- Mechanism: In specific layers, the model compresses contextual information into punctuation activation. In GPT-2, information transfers from period (early layers) to question mark (later layers), serving as a "summary" sufficient for prediction.
- Core assumption: The model utilizes specific token positions as "scratchpads" or "memory buffers" rather than treating all token positions uniformly.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract showing punctuation as necessary/sufficient in GPT-2 layers; section 5.1 hypothesizing information transfer from period to question mark in layer 7.
- Break condition: This mechanism appears to fail in models with larger context windows or those trained via distillation (e.g., Gemma).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Logical reasoning rules are processed via distinct layer-wise schedules, with conditional statements fixed early while universal quantification remains dynamically sensitive.
- Mechanism: Conditional consequent processing occurs primarily in first few layers (high IIA), becoming "fixed" thereafter. Universal quantification maintains high IIA across all layers, implying continuous re-computation.
- Core assumption: Drop in IIA implies "computed and stored" representation; consistent IIA implies "live" or re-computed representation.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract describing compositional processing of conditionals in early layers; section 5.2 interpreting low IIA in later layers as early fixing of conditional representations.
- Break condition: Advanced Chain-of-Thought prompting might disrupt early fixing by forcing later layers to re-evaluate premises.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Layers possess functional specificity correlated with reasoning rule type.
- Mechanism: Layer-swapping experiments show lower swappability for conditionals versus universal quantification, suggesting conditionals require specific operation sequences while universal quantification relies on distributed processing.
- Core assumption: Low correlation in layer-swaps implies functional specialization; high correlation implies redundancy.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract noting conditional rules are less swappable than universal quantification; section 5.2 Figure 5 showing conditional layers have specific functions versus replaceable universal quantification layers.
- Break condition: In architectures with highly uniform blocks, this specificity might diminish, leading to higher swapability for all tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Causal Tracing / Interchange Intervention**
  - Why needed here: Distinguishes correlation from causation by measuring if swapping activations changes outcomes
  - Quick check question: If I swap Layer 4 from Prompt A into Prompt B, does the model output the answer for Prompt A or Prompt B?

- **Concept: Necessity vs. Sufficiency**
  - Why needed here: Distinguishes tokens the model cannot work without (necessity) versus tokens containing all required information (sufficiency)
  - Quick check question: If I zero out the period token, does accuracy crash (necessary)? If I zero out everything but the period, does accuracy remain high (sufficient)?

- **Concept: Residual Stream Architecture**
  - Why needed here: Understanding information accumulation and passing explains why Layer L interventions affect Layer L+1 outputs
  - Quick check question: Does an intervention at Layer 4 affect attention calculation at Layer 4, or Layer 5?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Fine-tuning -> Zeroing-out interventions -> Interchange interventions -> Layer-swapping experiments -> Accuracy/Logit difference analysis

- **Critical path:**
  1. Fine-tune models on RuleTaker (GPT-2: full training; DeepSeek/Gemma: LoRA)
  2. Implement zeroing-out interventions on period and question mark tokens across layers
  3. Construct interchange intervention pairs for conditional and universal quantification rules
  4. Replace consequent/predicate activations and compute IIA across layers
  5. Perform layer swaps and compute logit differences

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Coarse-grained Interventions: Intervene on macro block outputs rather than individual heads or subspaces, capturing combined effects but obscuring specific Attention vs. MLP roles
  - Fine-tuning Confound: GPT-2 fully fine-tuned versus LoRA for larger models makes it difficult to isolate whether architectural differences or training differences drive divergent punctuation mechanisms

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Gemma's Negligible Sensitivity: No accuracy drop when zeroing punctuation likely indicates different aggregation mechanism (distributed vs. localized)
  - High IIA in Late Layers: If IIA remains high for conditionals in late layers, the "early fixing" hypothesis is broken; model is likely re-reading the prompt

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate "Dilution" Test: For GPT-2, keep question mark non-zero and gradually increase non-zero distractor tokens to validate dilution hypothesis
  2. Conditional Layer Swap: Swap Layer 4 (early) with Layer 8 (late) for conditional rule task; verify performance drops more than for universal quantification
  3. Architecture Cross-Check: Apply "Necessity of Period" test to RoPE model (DeepSeek) versus absolute positional embeddings (GPT-2) to verify positional encoding correlation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Do non-punctuation tokens (e.g., subjects, verbs) exhibit the same necessity and sufficiency in later layers as periods and question marks do in GPT-2?
  - Basis in paper: Authors state in Limitations section: "We only do necessity and sufficiency investigations for punctuation. Future work could expand this investigation to other tokens."
  - Why unresolved: Study focused exclusively on punctuation, leaving open whether information aggregation behavior is unique to structural tokens or general feature
  - What evidence would resolve it: Repeating zeroing-out (necessity) and non-zeroing (sufficiency) experiments on semantic tokens like nouns and adjectives across same model layers

- **Open Question 2:** Does knowledge distillation (as used in Gemma) degrade punctuation tokens' ability to act as information carriers or attention sinks?
  - Basis in paper: Authors hypothesize Gemma's "negligible sensitivity" compared to GPT-2 "is related to... Gemma being a distilled model," but don't isolate this variable
  - Why unresolved: Comparison confounded by architecture (GQA vs MHA) and training data differences
  - What evidence would resolve it: Controlled comparison between base model and distilled counterpart (e.g., Llama 3 vs. Llama 3 Distilled) using same interchange intervention metrics

- **Open Question 3:** Are biconditional logical rules ("if and only if") processed with same early fixation as standard conditional statements ("if-then")?
  - Basis in paper: In Limitations, authors note: "Future work could investigate swapping entire rules (for example 'if then' statements, with 'if and only if then' statements)"
  - Why unresolved: Paper established standard conditionals are processed early and fixed, but unknown if complex logical symmetries require distributed processing
  - What evidence would resolve it: Performing interchange interventions on biconditional prompts to see if IIA drops sharply in early layers or remains high throughout network

## Limitations

- Architecture-specific confounds: Divergent punctuation mechanisms may reflect training differences (full fine-tuning vs. LoRA) as much as architectural differences
- Generalization across domains: All experiments use RuleTaker reasoning tasks; findings may not extend to open-domain text generation
- Intervention granularity: Zeroing-out and layer-swapping operate at residual block level rather than isolating attention heads or subspaces, limiting mechanistic specificity

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Necessity and sufficiency patterns for punctuation in GPT-2 are robust with clear statistical separation
- **Medium confidence:** Layer-wise IIA patterns for conditional vs. universal quantification are interpretable and internally consistent, though interpretation could have alternatives
- **Low confidence:** Claims about model-specific differences in punctuation processing (DeepSeek/Gemma) are suggestive but underpowered due to small absolute differences and limited architectural diversity

## Next Checks

1. **Fine-tuning ablation study:** Replicate punctuation necessity/sufficiency experiments using GPT-2 with LoRA fine-tuning versus full fine-tuning to isolate whether training method or architecture drives observed differences from DeepSeek/Gemma

2. **Cross-task generalization:** Apply same intervention methodology to natural text completion tasks (e.g., story continuation with punctuation boundaries) to test whether punctuation as information sinks generalizes beyond RuleTaker reasoning

3. **Mechanistic decomposition:** Perform head-level or subspace-level interventions within residual stream to identify whether punctuation effects localize to specific attention heads or MLP components rather than attributing effects to entire layers
