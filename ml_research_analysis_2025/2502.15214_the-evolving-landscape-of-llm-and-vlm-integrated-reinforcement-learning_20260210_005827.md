- Presents comprehensive taxonomy of LLM/VLM integration with RL across three roles: Agent, Planner, and Reward

## Executive Summary
This survey paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrated with Reinforcement Learning (RL), categorizing them into three distinct roles: Agent, Planner, and Reward. The paper systematically reviews representative works in each category, addressing fundamental challenges in RL such as lack of prior knowledge, long-horizon planning, and reward design. By organizing the landscape of FM-RL integration methods, the survey aims to clarify current advancements and identify key challenges that need to be addressed for future progress in the field.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a systematic survey methodology to analyze and categorize LLM and VLM integration approaches with reinforcement learning. The authors organize the literature into three primary roles that FMs can play in RL systems: as agents for decision-making (parametric and non-parametric approaches), as planners for task decomposition and strategy development (comprehensive and incremental planning methods), and as reward designers (including reward function design and reward model development). The survey identifies and reviews representative works within each category, providing a structured framework for understanding how these technologies can complement and enhance traditional RL approaches.

## Key Results
- Proposes a three-role taxonomy (Agent, Planner, Reward) for categorizing LLM/VLM integration with RL
- Identifies key challenges in RL that FMs can address: lack of prior knowledge, long-horizon planning, and reward design
- Highlights future research directions including grounding, bias mitigation, improved representations, and action advice
- Provides comprehensive review of representative works across different integration approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of LLMs and VLMs with reinforcement learning works by leveraging the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of foundation models to address key limitations in traditional RL approaches. LLMs provide access to vast amounts of prior knowledge and language understanding that can guide decision-making and planning processes. VLMs extend these capabilities to multimodal environments by processing both visual and language information. The three-role taxonomy (Agent, Planner, Reward) represents different ways these models can be integrated: as agents to make decisions using learned policies, as planners to decompose complex tasks and create strategies, and as reward designers to provide more nuanced feedback signals beyond traditional reward functions.

## Foundational Learning

**Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals** - Understanding of RL concepts like states, actions, rewards, policies, and value functions is essential for grasping how FMs integrate with RL systems. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between model-based and model-free RL?

**Foundation Model Capabilities** - Knowledge of LLM/VLM architectures, training objectives, and strengths/limitations is needed to understand their integration potential. Quick check: What are the key differences between parametric and non-parametric LLM agents?

**Multimodal Learning** - Understanding how VLMs process and integrate visual and language information is crucial for applications requiring perception. Quick check: How do VLMs differ from standard image models in their approach to visual understanding?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Environment -> Observation Processing -> LLM/VLM Module (Agent/Planner/Reward) -> Action Selection -> Environment Interaction

**Critical Path**: The flow from environment observation through the FM module to action selection represents the core integration, with the choice of role (Agent, Planner, Reward) determining the specific processing pipeline.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Agent role: Direct decision-making vs. computational overhead
- Planner role: Comprehensive vs. incremental planning approaches
- Reward role: Function design vs. model-based reward learning

**Failure Signatures**:
- Agent failures: Poor generalization, hallucination, out-of-distribution inputs
- Planner failures: Incomplete task decomposition, sub-optimal strategies
- Reward failures: Sparse or misleading reward signals, bias in reward design

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement a parametric LLM agent for a simple grid-world environment to validate basic integration
2. Test VLM-based reward design in a visual navigation task to assess multimodal integration
3. Compare comprehensive vs. incremental planning approaches on a hierarchical task to evaluate planning strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions for future research, including: how to effectively ground LLMs and VLMs in real-world environments to ensure their outputs align with physical reality; methods for mitigating biases that may be present in the training data of foundation models; techniques for developing improved representations that can better capture the complexities of RL tasks; and approaches for providing more effective action advice that can guide learning agents without overwhelming them with information.

## Limitations
- The taxonomy may not capture all emerging integration approaches given the rapid pace of research in this field
- Limited quantitative comparisons between different integration methods to assess their relative effectiveness
- The treatment of VLMs appears somewhat limited compared to LLMs, potentially missing key multimodal integration approaches
- Does not address potential conflicts or incompatibilities between different integration methods

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Claims about categorization and methodology coverage are well-supported by systematic organization and citation of representative works
**Medium confidence**: Assessment of future directions and challenges depends on rapidly evolving research trends that may shift
**Low confidence**: Predictions about specific technical solutions for identified challenges lack validation criteria

## Next Checks
1. Verify the completeness of the taxonomy by checking if any major integration approaches or recent works have been omitted
2. Assess the quantitative impact of different LLM/VLM roles (Agent, Planner, Reward) through experimental comparisons where available
3. Evaluate the practical feasibility of proposed future directions by examining current technical constraints and resource requirements
