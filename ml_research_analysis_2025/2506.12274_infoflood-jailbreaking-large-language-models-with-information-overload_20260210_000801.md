# InfoFlood: Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Information Overload

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12274
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12274
- Reference count: 26
- Achieved near-perfect jailbreak success rates (up to 96%) on standard benchmarks

## Executive Summary
InfoFlood introduces a novel jailbreaking technique that exploits linguistic complexity to bypass LLM safety filters. By transforming harmful prompts into verbose, technically sophisticated queries through iterative refinement, the method achieves exceptional success rates against major models including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, and LLaMA 3.1. The approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by up to 3× without requiring adversarial prefixes or suffixes. Critically, InfoFlood queries successfully evade current safety mechanisms including OpenAI Moderation API and Perspective API, demonstrating a fundamental vulnerability in LLM safety frameworks against information overload attacks.

## Method Summary
InfoFlood employs an iterative refinement process to transform malicious prompts into linguistically complex queries that evade detection. The method operates through three key phases: linguistic saturation (adding technical vocabulary and complexity), rejection analysis (identifying which modifications evade filters), and saturation refinement (optimizing the transformation for maximum evasion). This process systematically masks harmful intent while maintaining semantic coherence, allowing the jailbroken prompts to bypass both model-based and API-based safety mechanisms. The technique's effectiveness stems from exploiting the tension between linguistic complexity and intent detection in current safety systems.

## Key Results
- Achieved near-perfect jailbreak success rates up to 96% on standard benchmarks
- Outperformed state-of-the-art methods by up to 3× in jailbreak effectiveness
- Successfully evaded OpenAI Moderation API, Perspective API, and SmoothLLM defenses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
InfoFlood works by exploiting the fundamental challenge that safety systems face in distinguishing between genuinely complex technical discourse and malicious intent masked by linguistic complexity. By transforming simple harmful prompts into verbose, jargon-heavy queries, the method creates semantic ambiguity that confuses intent detection mechanisms. The iterative refinement process ensures that the transformed queries maintain their harmful semantic content while adopting the surface features of legitimate technical discourse, effectively hiding in plain sight among safe queries in latent space representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Linguistic complexity masking**: Understanding how technical vocabulary and verbose phrasing can obscure malicious intent. Why needed: Forms the core evasion mechanism. Quick check: Test whether simpler transformations achieve comparable results.
- **Iterative refinement optimization**: Process of systematically improving prompt transformations based on rejection feedback. Why needed: Enables progressive evasion improvement. Quick check: Measure convergence rate of refinement iterations.
- **Latent space clustering analysis**: Using embedding models to verify that transformed queries cluster with safe prompts. Why needed: Provides quantitative evidence of intent masking. Quick check: Validate clustering across multiple embedding models.
- **Safety filter limitations**: Recognizing the trade-offs between linguistic complexity handling and intent detection. Why needed: Explains why defenses fail. Quick check: Test filters with controlled complexity variations.
- **Semantic preservation**: Maintaining harmful intent while changing surface form. Why needed: Essential for effective jailbreaking. Quick check: Human evaluation of semantic equivalence.
- **Multi-model robustness**: Ensuring effectiveness across different LLM architectures. Why needed: Demonstrates general applicability. Quick check: Test against additional model families.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Linguistic Input -> Linguistic Saturation -> Rejection Analysis -> Saturation Refinement -> Jailbroken Output

**Critical Path**
The critical path is the iterative refinement loop where rejected prompts undergo analysis to identify successful transformation patterns, which are then applied to improve subsequent attempts. This feedback cycle between rejection analysis and saturation refinement drives the exponential improvement in evasion rates.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The method balances between transformation strength and semantic preservation - excessive modification risks losing the original intent, while conservative changes may not evade detection. The iterative approach mitigates this by allowing progressive refinement, though at the cost of computational overhead per jailbreak attempt.

**Failure Signatures**
Failures occur when transformations either (1) lose semantic coherence, making the prompt nonsensical, or (2) fail to sufficiently mask intent, resulting in continued rejection. The rejection analysis phase is designed to detect and correct these failure modes through pattern identification.

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Baseline comparison: Test InfoFlood against standard jailbreak benchmarks without refinement iterations
2. Ablation study: Evaluate effectiveness with individual refinement components disabled
3. Cross-model validation: Test transformed prompts across different LLM architectures to verify generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Near-perfect success rates may reflect overfitting to specific evaluation datasets rather than universal effectiveness
- Effectiveness against tested defenses may not generalize to all safety mechanisms or real-world deployment scenarios
- Computational cost and scalability of iterative refinement process for real-time applications remains unclear

## Confidence
- Jailbreak success rates and comparative performance: High
- Evasion of tested safety filters: Medium
- Latent space clustering and intent masking: Medium
- Generalizability to all LLM safety mechanisms: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test InfoFlood against a broader range of safety mechanisms, including proprietary and less commonly evaluated systems, to assess generalizability of evasion success
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of linguistic saturation, rejection analysis, and saturation refinement to overall jailbreak success
3. Evaluate the method's performance on dynamically generated harmful prompts rather than fixed benchmark datasets to assess robustness against varied attack scenarios
