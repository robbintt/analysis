# BetaWeb: Towards a Blockchain-enabled Trustworthy Agentic Web

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.13787
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13787
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Key outcome:** Proposes BetaWeb, a blockchain-enabled framework to address fragmentation and limitations in current agentic ecosystems through verifiable identities, traceable interactions, and fair incentives.

## Executive Summary
The paper proposes BetaWeb, a blockchain-enabled infrastructure for trustworthy LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (LaMAS), addressing the fragmentation and trust limitations of current agentic ecosystems. The core idea leverages blockchain's strengths—decentralized consensus, immutable records, and programmable trust logic—to enable verifiable agent identities, traceable interactions, and fair incentive mechanisms. This creates a scalable, interoperable, and trustworthy infrastructure for large-scale, heterogeneous agent collaboration, advancing the Web paradigm from Web3 (data ownership) to Web3.5 (agent capability ownership and intelligence monetization). The authors present a five-stage evolutionary roadmap for BetaWeb, analyzing each stage's characteristics and core technologies, and discuss key challenges across technical, ecosystem, and societal dimensions.

## Method Summary
BetaWeb is a conceptual framework proposing a dual-layer architecture for trustworthy agentic systems. The Business Layer handles task management (parsing, orchestration) and execution (container scheduling, tool invocation). The Support Layer provides agent management (identity, reputation) and rule management (smart contracts, DAO governance). Interactions are recorded as blockchain transactions to ensure lifecycle traceability. The framework includes a five-stage evolution from isolated silos to full autonomy, with governance gradually transferring from humans to agents through DAO mechanisms.

## Key Results
- Proposes blockchain as the trust infrastructure for verifiable agent identities and traceable interactions
- Introduces a five-stage evolutionary roadmap from isolated silos to full autonomy
- Defines the paradigm shift from Web3 (data ownership) to Web3.5 (agent capability ownership)
- Identifies key challenges in technical scalability, governance, and societal responsibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cryptographic Identity & Immutable Audit Trails
- **Claim:** Anchoring agent identities and task histories on blockchain creates verifiable trust without central authority.
- **Mechanism:** Every agent interaction and sub-task execution is mapped to a blockchain transaction, generating an immutable, tamper-proof history.
- **Core assumption:** Recording task lifecycles on-chain doesn't impede real-time agent workflow performance.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "verifiable agent identities, traceable interactions"; Section 2.1 describes interactions as "standardized task procedures... recorded as transactions"; corpus supports trust needs in distributed AI networks.
- **Break condition:** If gas fees or ledger latency make recording low-granularity sub-tasks prohibitive.

### Mechanism 2: Programmable Incentive Alignment
- **Claim:** Smart contracts automatically enforce fair value exchange, enabling transparent intelligence monetization.
- **Mechanism:** Rules for rewards and penalties are codified in smart contracts that automatically verify outputs and release payments.
- **Core assumption:** Agent contributions can be objectively measured by on-chain logic or oracle inputs.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract highlights "programmable trust logic" and "fair incentive mechanisms"; Section 2.3 details "Rule Management module" focusing on economic models; corpus supports rule-based management needs.
- **Break condition:** If adversarial agents exploit smart contract rigidity to siphon rewards without delivering value.

### Mechanism 3: Staged Governance Evolution
- **Claim:** Maturity of blockchain integration correlates with agent autonomy levels through a five-stage roadmap.
- **Mechanism:** System evolves from "Isolated Silos" to "Full Autonomy" by gradually transferring governance from human-stewarded contracts to agent-led DAOs.
- **Core assumption:** Humans will cede control incrementally and "Hybrid Governance" provides sufficient stability against agent unpredictability.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract references "five-stage evolutionary roadmap... from passive execution to advanced collaboration"; Section 3.5 describes "Hybrid Governance" with agent participation; corpus supports trajectory toward autonomous agents.
- **Break condition:** If agents develop "capability overhangs" surpassing governance constraints, leading to unchecked systemic errors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (LaMAS)**
  - **Why needed here:** BetaWeb is the infrastructure layer for LaMAS; understanding agent collaboration and task decomposition is necessary to see why coordination (blockchain) is required.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between a single agent executing a prompt and a multi-agent system decomposing a complex goal into sub-tasks?

- **Concept: On-chain vs. Off-chain Computation**
  - **Why needed here:** Framework relies on storing "proofs" and "identities" on-chain while executing heavy AI reasoning off-chain.
  - **Quick check question:** If an agent executes complex logical deduction, which part would be recorded on blockchain and which part remains off-chain?

- **Concept: Web3 vs. Web3.5**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper defines novelty through this paradigm shift—Web3 is about user-owned data; Web3.5 is about user/agent-owned capabilities and their monetization.
  - **Quick check question:** Does value flow derive primarily from owning training data (Web3) or renting agent's task performance ability (Web3.5)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Demand Source (Human/User/Another Agent) -> Business Layer (Task Management + Task Execution) -> Support Layer (Agent Management + Rule Management) -> Foundation (Blockchain: Identity, Ledger, Consensus)
- **Critical path:** Request -> Smart Contract Trigger -> Agent Selection (Identity Verification) -> Off-chain Execution -> Proof Generation -> On-chain Verification -> Incentive Settlement
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Transparency vs. Privacy:** Using zero-knowledge proofs to balance public auditability with agent data privacy
  - **Latency vs. Security:** Consensus mechanisms introduce latency; high-frequency interactions might require optimistic rollups or sidechains
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Stale Agent Registry:** Agents evolving capabilities faster than on-chain identity profiles update
  - **Governance Gridlock:** DAO mechanisms failing to reach consensus on rule updates during rapid environmental changes
  - **Economic Drain:** Gas fees for task verification exceeding micro-task value
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Identity Anchor Test:** Deploy minimal smart contract to register agent and verify cryptographic signature on mock task request
  2. **Static Workflow Pilot (Stage 2):** Implement hard-coded agentic workflow where two agents trade data and settle payment via smart contract, strictly observed by human
  3. **Reputation Query:** Simulate "Rule Management" module where agent's reputation score drops below threshold and test if system automatically revokes execution permissions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can large-scale on-chain deployment of agent workflows be achieved without compromising system performance and latency?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 5.1 states achieving large-scale on-chain deployment without compromising performance "remains an open problem"
- **Why unresolved:** Current blockchain infrastructures struggle with high transaction volume and frequency required by infinite agent scaling
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Prototype demonstrating high-throughput transaction processing and low latency under simulated full-autonomy conditions

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can multi-agent dynamic planning algorithms ensure stability and efficiency while simultaneously resisting attacks?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 5.1 identifies need for algorithms that "balance scalability and adaptability... while resisting potential attacks such as malicious agents, task tampering, or information asymmetry"
- **Why unresolved:** Designing allocation mechanisms that are both adaptable and robust against adversarial manipulation is technically difficult
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Simulation results showing algorithmic resilience in environments with defined percentage of malicious agent nodes

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the "triple demands" of high concurrency processing, strong trust guarantees, and data privacy protection be reconciled in single BetaWeb implementation?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 4 notes existing products face "complex challenge of balancing high concurrency processing, strong trust guarantees, and data privacy protection"
- **Why unresolved:** Optimizing for one factor often degrades others (e.g., privacy via ZK-proofs impacts performance)
- **What evidence would resolve it:** System architecture or comparative study demonstrating Pareto improvement across all three metrics

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can responsibility be accurately attributed for autonomous agent behaviors in "Full Autonomy" stage?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 5.3 argues "responsibility attribution for autonomous agent behaviors... require[s] careful regulation" and is essential for societal trust
- **Why unresolved:** Traditional legal frameworks struggle to apply to autonomous algorithmic decisions when humans are fully liberated from execution roles
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Definition of successful "human-machine governance framework" or on-chain audit trail that can definitively assign liability

## Limitations

- Framework remains largely conceptual with significant implementation gaps and no quantitative performance metrics
- Paper does not specify blockchain architecture choices (consensus mechanism, throughput capacity) needed for high-frequency agent interactions
- Five-stage evolution lacks empirical validation of transition thresholds and governance stability under real-world agent behavior patterns
- Does not address potential regulatory conflicts between decentralized autonomous agent operations and existing legal frameworks

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Foundational rationale for using blockchain to provide immutable audit trails and verifiable agent identities is well-established in literature.

**Medium Confidence:** Proposed mechanisms for programmable incentive alignment through smart contracts are theoretically sound but depend heavily on ability to objectively measure agent contributions—a challenging unsolved problem.

**Low Confidence:** Practical feasibility of achieving full autonomy (Stage 5) while maintaining system stability and preventing capability overhangs is not demonstrated; economic model's sustainability lacks quantitative validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Identity Anchor Test:** Deploy minimal smart contract on local blockchain testnet to register agent with decentralized identifier and verify cryptographic signature on mock task request, measuring latency and cost overhead.

2. **Static Workflow Pilot (Stage 2):** Implement two-agent data exchange workflow where task decomposition, execution, and smart contract-based payment settlement are fully observed by human operator, recording complete transaction lifecycle and identifying bottlenecks.

3. **Governance Stress Test:** Simulate rapid environmental changes requiring rule updates in "Hybrid Governance" scenario (Stage 4), measuring DAO consensus times and identifying conditions under which governance gridlock occurs.
