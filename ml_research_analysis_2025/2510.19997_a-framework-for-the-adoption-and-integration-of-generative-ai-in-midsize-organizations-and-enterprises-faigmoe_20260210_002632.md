# A Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises (FAIGMOE)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19997
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19997
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Abraham Itzhak Weinberg

## Executive Summary
FAIGMOE addresses the critical gap in generative AI adoption frameworks for midsize organizations and enterprises by synthesizing technology adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion perspectives. The framework provides a structured four-phase approach specifically designed to address the unique challenges faced by resource-constrained midsize firms while maintaining scalability for enterprise applications. Through its comprehensive coverage of GenAI-specific considerations like prompt engineering and hallucination management, FAIGMOE offers actionable guidance for organizations navigating the complexities of AI integration.

## Method Summary
The framework was developed through an extensive literature review and synthesis of existing theories related to technology adoption, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion. The author integrated these perspectives with emerging best practices in GenAI implementation to create a comprehensive conceptual framework. The development process involved identifying key challenges specific to midsize organizations and enterprises, mapping theoretical constructs to practical implementation needs, and structuring the framework around four distinct phases that address the full adoption lifecycle.

## Key Results
- Synthesizes technology adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion into a comprehensive four-phase framework
- Provides scalable guidance tailored to resource-constrained midsize firms and complexity-constrained enterprises
- Incorporates GenAI-specific considerations including prompt engineering and hallucination management
- Offers actionable implementation protocols and governance templates for organizational adoption

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FAIGMOE works by providing a structured approach that bridges theoretical frameworks with practical implementation needs. The four-phase structure addresses the complete adoption lifecycle, from initial strategic assessment through operational optimization. By incorporating both organizational change management principles and GenAI-specific technical considerations, the framework ensures comprehensive coverage of both human and technical factors. The scalability design allows adaptation across different organizational sizes while maintaining core principles that drive successful adoption.

## Foundational Learning
- Technology Adoption Theory: Why needed - provides foundation for understanding organizational readiness and resistance; Quick check - assess current technology maturity level
- Organizational Change Management: Why needed - addresses human factors and resistance to AI implementation; Quick check - evaluate change readiness and cultural factors
- Innovation Diffusion: Why needed - helps understand how new technologies spread through organizations; Quick check - identify innovation champions and early adopters
- GenAI-Specific Considerations: Why needed - addresses unique challenges like prompt engineering and hallucination management; Quick check - assess current GenAI knowledge and capabilities
- Governance Frameworks: Why needed - ensures responsible AI deployment and risk management; Quick check - evaluate existing governance structures and compliance requirements

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Strategic Assessment -> Planning and Use Case Development -> Implementation and Integration -> Operationalization and Optimization
Critical Path: Complete Strategic Assessment before proceeding to Planning; Ensure use cases are validated before Implementation
Design Tradeoffs: Balance between comprehensive coverage and practical usability; Resource allocation between phases; Technical complexity versus organizational readiness
Failure Signatures: Insufficient stakeholder buy-in, inadequate resource allocation, unrealistic use case expectations, poor integration planning
First Experiments:
1. Conduct a pilot implementation with one identified use case
2. Test governance templates with a small team before organization-wide rollout
3. Validate prompt engineering guidelines with sample GenAI applications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Conceptual framework without empirical validation across different organizational contexts
- Limited evidence of successful large-scale enterprise implementations
- Potential oversimplification of complex organizational dynamics in midsize firms

## Confidence
- Framework applicability across diverse midsize organizations: Medium
- Integration of GenAI-specific considerations: High
- Scalability claims for enterprise applications: Low
- Four-phase structure effectiveness: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal case studies across multiple midsize organizations implementing the framework
2. Perform comparative analysis between FAIGMOE-guided implementations and conventional AI adoption approaches
3. Develop and test the proposed governance templates and implementation protocols in real-world settings
