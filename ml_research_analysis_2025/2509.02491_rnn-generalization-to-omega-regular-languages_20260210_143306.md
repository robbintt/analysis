# RNN Generalization to Omega-Regular Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02491
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02491
- Reference count: 36
- RNNs achieve 98.4% accuracy on out-of-distribution sequences for ω-regular language recognition

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether recurrent neural networks can generalize to recognize ω-regular languages, which are used to specify properties of infinite system execution traces. The authors train RNNs on ultimately periodic ω-word sequences to replicate Büchi automaton behavior and evaluate their ability to classify out-of-distribution sequences up to 8 times longer than training examples. Across 27 tasks involving deterministic Büchi automata ranging from 3 to 105 states, RNNs achieved perfect or near-perfect generalization in 92.6% of cases, with overall accuracy of 98.4% on out-of-distribution data.

## Method Summary
The authors systematically evaluate RNN generalization to ω-regular languages by training on finite prefixes of ultimately periodic ω-words that represent Büchi automaton behavior. They generate training data from deterministic Büchi automata with 3 to 105 states across 27 tasks, using sequences up to length 16. The RNNs are then tested on out-of-distribution sequences up to 8 times longer than training examples. Performance is measured by comparing RNN predictions against the correct classification based on the original Büchi automaton's language acceptance criteria.

## Key Results
- 92.6% of tasks achieved perfect or near-perfect generalization (accuracy ≥ 99%)
- Overall accuracy of 98.4% on out-of-distribution sequences
- Generalization performance remains consistently high across automata of varying complexity
- Two failure cases showed unstable training behavior and degraded performance at longer sequence lengths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RNNs successfully learn to recognize ω-regular languages by internalizing the state transition patterns and acceptance conditions of Büchi automata. During training on ultimately periodic sequences, the networks develop internal representations that capture the cyclic nature of ω-words and the conditions for language acceptance. The ability to generalize to longer sequences suggests that RNNs can extrapolate the periodic structure beyond their training distribution, maintaining the logical relationships that define ω-regular languages.

## Foundational Learning
- Büchi automata: Finite state machines that accept or reject infinite sequences based on repeated visits to accepting states; needed to define ω-regular languages; quick check: can construct automaton for "infinitely many a's"
- ω-regular languages: Class of languages over infinite words; foundation for specifying system properties; quick check: can express safety and liveness properties
- Ultimately periodic sequences: Finite prefixes followed by repeating cycles; used to approximate infinite sequences for training; quick check: can identify period in a repeating pattern
- Neurosymbolic verification: Integration of neural networks with formal verification methods; application context for this work; quick check: can map neural predictions to logical properties

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input alphabet -> RNN layers -> Hidden states -> Output layer -> Language classification

**Critical path:** Sequence input → RNN state updates → Hidden representation → Classification decision

**Design tradeoffs:** 
- Tradeoff between model complexity and training stability
- Balance between sequence length and computational feasibility
- Generalization versus memorization of training patterns

**Failure signatures:**
- Unstable training with fluctuating loss curves
- Degradation in performance on longer sequences
- Inability to capture periodic structure in training data

**Three first experiments:**
1. Train RNN on simple Büchi automata (3-5 states) with periodic sequences
2. Test generalization to sequences 2× longer than training examples
3. Vary RNN architecture (LSTM vs GRU) to assess impact on learning ω-regular patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Only evaluates deterministic Büchi automata, not nondeterministic cases
- Sequence length extension (up to 8×) may not establish asymptotic generalization
- Training methodology sensitivity to hyperparameters not fully characterized

## Confidence

**High confidence:** 92.6% success rate in perfect or near-perfect generalization across diverse automata

**Medium confidence:** State-number independence claim requires more rigorous correlation analysis

**Low confidence:** Limited evaluation of training stability across different architectures and hyperparameters

## Next Checks
1. Test generalization to nondeterministic Büchi automata and compare performance with deterministic cases
2. Systematically vary sequence length extensions (10×, 20×, 50×) to establish scaling limits
3. Conduct ablation studies on different RNN architectures (LSTM, GRU, vanilla RNN) and training regimes to identify optimal configurations for ω-regular language learning
