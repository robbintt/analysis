# CommunityBench: Benchmarking Community-Level Alignment across Diverse Groups and Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.13669
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13669
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: Introduces CommunityBench, the first large-scale benchmark for community-level alignment evaluation, grounded in Common Identity and Common Bond theory, demonstrating that community-level alignment facilitates individual behavior modeling.

## Executive Summary
CommunityBench is the first large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate community-level alignment in large language models. It is grounded in Common Identity and Common Bond theory and features four tasks: preference identification, preference distribution prediction, community-consistent generation, and community identification. The benchmark includes 12,149 instances across 6,919 Reddit communities. Experiments with 17 models show that current LLMs have limited capacity to model community-specific preferences. Crucially, community-level alignment is shown to facilitate individual behavior modeling, outperforming both one-size-fits-all and individual-level approaches. The results validate community-level alignment as a scalable, pluralistic alternative that bridges the gap between global and individual strategies.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces CommunityBench, a comprehensive benchmark for community-level alignment evaluation. It leverages Common Identity and Common Bond theory to design four distinct tasks: preference identification, preference distribution prediction, community-consistent generation, and community identification. The benchmark is constructed from 12,149 instances across 6,919 Reddit communities, providing a diverse and representative dataset. The tasks are designed to evaluate models' ability to understand and generate content consistent with community norms and preferences. The evaluation framework is applied to 17 different models, including both proprietary and open-source LLMs, to assess their performance on community-level alignment tasks.

## Key Results
- CommunityBench is the first large-scale benchmark for community-level alignment evaluation, featuring 12,149 instances across 6,919 Reddit communities.
- Experiments with 17 models show current LLMs have limited capacity to model community-specific preferences.
- Community-level alignment is shown to facilitate individual behavior modeling, outperforming both one-size-fits-all and individual-level approaches.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Community-level alignment works by leveraging shared norms, values, and preferences within groups to improve model predictions. By training models to understand and generate content consistent with community norms, they can better predict individual behavior within those communities. This approach bridges the gap between global (one-size-fits-all) and individual-level alignment by providing a scalable, pluralistic alternative that respects group dynamics.

## Foundational Learning
- Common Identity and Common Bond theory: Explains how groups form and maintain cohesion through shared identity and interpersonal bonds. Needed to ground the benchmark in established social science. Quick check: Verify the theory's applicability to online communities.
- Community-specific preference modeling: The ability of models to learn and generate content consistent with group norms. Needed to evaluate community-level alignment. Quick check: Assess model performance on community-specific tasks.
- Preference distribution prediction: The task of predicting the distribution of preferences within a community. Needed to understand community dynamics. Quick check: Evaluate model accuracy on preference distribution tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Data collection -> Task design -> Model evaluation -> Result analysis
- Critical path: Data collection (Reddit communities) -> Task design (4 tasks) -> Model evaluation (17 models) -> Result analysis (community-level alignment effectiveness)
- Design tradeoffs: Using Reddit communities provides a large, diverse dataset but may introduce platform-specific biases. The four tasks cover different aspects of community alignment but may not capture all nuances.
- Failure signatures: Models may struggle with niche or rapidly evolving communities. Performance may vary based on community size and activity level.
- First experiments:
  1. Evaluate model performance on preference identification task.
  2. Assess community-consistent generation across different community types.
  3. Compare community-level alignment with global and individual approaches.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The benchmark relies on Reddit communities as the primary source of community behavior data, which may introduce platform-specific biases and may not generalize to communities in other contexts.
- The study focuses on community-level preferences but does not explicitly address how these preferences evolve over time, potentially missing dynamic aspects of community alignment.
- While the paper claims community-level alignment facilitates individual behavior modeling, the experiments primarily demonstrate relative improvements over baselines rather than establishing causation or the full extent of this facilitation.

## Confidence
- Community-level alignment as a scalable alternative: High
- Community-level alignment facilitates individual behavior modeling: Medium
- Current LLMs have limited capacity for community-specific preferences: High

## Next Checks
1. Cross-platform validation: Test CommunityBench on communities from diverse platforms (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, or specialized forums) to assess generalizability and identify platform-specific biases.
2. Temporal dynamics study: Investigate how community preferences and alignment change over time by applying CommunityBench to longitudinal data, ensuring the benchmark captures evolving behaviors.
3. Mechanistic analysis of individual facilitation: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the specific aspects of community-level alignment that contribute to improved individual behavior modeling, and validate these findings with alternative datasets or methods.
