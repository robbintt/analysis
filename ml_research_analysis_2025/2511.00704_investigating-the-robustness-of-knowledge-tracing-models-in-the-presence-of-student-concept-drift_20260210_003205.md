# Investigating the Robustness of Knowledge Tracing Models in the Presence of Student Concept Drift

## Quick Facts

- This study investigates KT model robustness under concept drift using five years of student interaction data.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates the temporal robustness of four knowledge tracing models—BKT, PFA, DKT, and SAKT—using five years of student interaction data. The authors find that all models experience performance degradation when applied to newer data, with simpler models like BKT showing the most stability (approximately 0.03 AUC loss over four years). More complex models, particularly SAKT with exercise-level embeddings, degrade most rapidly (up to 0.17 AUC decrease). The research demonstrates that model complexity and attention mechanisms increase vulnerability to concept drift, while simpler models maintain better long-term performance. The authors release a multi-year dataset to support longitudinal KT model evaluation.

## Method Summary
The study uses student interaction logs from an online learning platform, filtered to remove summer months, non-gradable questions, and problem sets assigned fewer than 100 times. Ten samples of 50,000 assignment logs are constructed per academic year (2019-2024). Four KT models are evaluated: BKT (hmmlearn with forgetting), PFA (scikit-learn logistic regression), DKT and SAKT (PyTorch). Hyperparameter tuning uses Optuna with 4-fold CV over 50 trials on a 100K-log validation sample. Models are assessed within-year via 10-fold CV and cross-year (train on year N, test on years N+1 to N+4). Metrics include AUC, Log Loss, and F1 Score.

## Key Results
- All four KT models show performance degradation when applied to newer data
- BKT demonstrates the most stability, with approximately 0.03 AUC loss over four years
- SAKT models degrade most rapidly, losing up to 0.17 AUC over four years
- Model complexity does not directly predict drift susceptibility—DKT (734K parameters) shows moderate drift similar to PFA (1.2K parameters)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BKT's temporal stability derives from its independence assumptions and parameter averaging.
- Mechanism: BKT models each KC as an independent latent Markov process. When evaluating on newer data with unseen KCs, the model uses averaged parameters from training KCs as a "best guess." This independence assumption prevents overfitting to year-specific interaction patterns and limits degradation to approximately 0.03 AUC loss over 4 years.
- Core assumption: Knowledge acquisition within a KC follows a consistent Markov process across years; only the student population parameters shift.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) remains the most stable KT model when applied to newer data"; [section 3.3] "learned parameters were averaged to make a 'best guess' KT model in the case of evaluating KCs that were not present in the training set"
- Break condition: If KCs change fundamentally in structure or difficulty (not just frequency), the averaged parameters will fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Attention mechanisms in SAKT amplify concept drift by capturing year-specific long-range dependencies.
- Mechanism: Self-attention learns which historical exercises to weight heavily. These attention patterns encode curriculum structure, skill sequencing, and temporal study behaviors specific to the training year. When applied to later years with different curricula or student behaviors, the learned attention weights misallocate importance, causing SAKT-E to lose approximately 0.17 AUC over 4 years—5× worse than BKT.
- Core assumption: Long-range temporal patterns in student sequences are year-specific rather than universal learning signals.
- Evidence anchors: [section 5] "longer range patterns derived from one year lose their explanatory power in future years due to curriculum changes, ordering of skills taught"; [section 5] "students' performance is more correlated to their performance on nearby problems rather than how they did on problems two months ago"
- Break condition: If future years maintain identical curriculum and platform structure, SAKT degradation should be minimal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Model parameter count alone does not predict drift susceptibility—architectural inductive bias matters more.
- Mechanism: DKT (734K parameters) shows moderate drift similar to PFA (1.2K parameters), while SAKT-KC (263K) degrades faster than both. The LSTM's sequential processing limits dependency horizon, whereas attention's direct access to all history amplifies noise from year-specific patterns. Complexity measured by trainable parameters is confounded by architectural assumptions about sequence structure.
- Core assumption: The relevant dimension of complexity is "sensitivity to temporal context," not raw parameter count.
- Evidence anchors: [section 5] "DKT which had more parameters than SAKT-KC but fewer than SAKT-E, and was far more robust than both"; [table 3] Parameter counts: BKT=2,012; PFA=1,208; DKT=734,026; SAKT-KC=262,982; SAKT-E=12,400,658
- Break condition: If attention mechanisms are constrained (e.g., local window attention), drift may reduce to LSTM levels.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Concept Drift vs. Covariate Shift**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes changes in P(Y|X) (relationship between features and correctness) from changes in P(X) (student population distribution). Misidentifying drift type leads to wrong mitigation strategies.
  - Quick check question: If student correctness rates drop but the relationship between practice and mastery stays constant, is this concept drift?

- Concept: **Knowledge Components (KCs)**
  - Why needed here: All four models operate on KC-tagged exercises. BKT and PFA explicitly model per-KC parameters; DKT and SAKT embed KCs as input. Understanding KC granularity is critical for interpreting why averaging works for BKT.
  - Quick check question: Why would averaging BKT parameters across KCs work as a fallback, but averaging SAKT attention weights would not?

- Concept: **Markov Assumption in Sequential Models**
  - Why needed here: BKT assumes knowledge state depends only on previous state and current observation (first-order Markov). This limits temporal context but provides stability. DKT's LSTM extends this with longer memory; SAKT removes the Markov constraint entirely.
  - Quick check question: How does the Markov assumption relate to BKT's resistance to concept drift?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw logs → Filter (summer, non-gradable, low-use) → Sample 50K assignments/year → Model Layer (BKT | PFA | DKT | SAKT) → Evaluation (Year-specific samples → Cross-year testing)
- Critical path: Start with BKT baseline on single-year data → implement cross-year evaluation → add DKT → add SAKT variants. The evaluation framework (not model architecture) is the infrastructure bottleneck.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - SAKT-E vs. SAKT-KC: Exercise-level embeddings (12.4M params) capture item-specific patterns but degrade fastest; KC-level embeddings (263K params) generalize better but lose item nuance.
  - Parameter averaging vs. per-KC fitting: Averaging handles unseen KCs but sacrifices precision; full fitting requires complete KC coverage in training.
  - Sample size (50K assignments): Balances computational cost against statistical power; may underrepresent rare KCs.
- Failure signatures:
  - BKT fails silently on new KCs (defaults to averaged parameters without warning).
  - SAKT attention weights become uninterpretable after 2+ years (paper shows approximately 0.1 AUC drop by year 2).
  - All models show non-monotonic degradation in some metrics (BKT AUC dips then recovers slightly), suggesting noise in year-to-year variation.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate BKT cross-year evaluation on the released dataset using hmmlearn with forgetting enabled. Verify the approximately 0.03 AUC degradation finding.
  2. Ablate SAKT attention window: Restrict attention to last K exercises (K=10, 20, 50) and measure whether drift reduces. Tests the "long-range dependency" hypothesis.
  3. Fit BKT on year 1 data, evaluate per-KC performance on years 2-5. Identify which KC types (high/low difficulty, high/low practice volume) drive the averaged parameter fallback behavior.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Is the self-attention mechanism specifically responsible for the accelerated susceptibility to concept drift observed in SAKT models, or is it attributable to other architectural factors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors hypothesize that "the attention mechanism of SAKT may cause its downfall" because it captures long-range dependencies that may lose explanatory power over time.
- Why unresolved: The study compares distinct model families (e.g., BKT vs. SAKT) but does not perform ablation studies to isolate the attention mechanism as the root cause of the rapid performance degradation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal comparison of architectures where the self-attention layer is swapped for recurrence or convolution layers while controlling for parameter count and input features.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can data-centric analysis quantify the specific distributional shifts in student interaction data that drive performance degradation in Knowledge Tracing models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note their "model-focused approach cannot describe how the distribution of student responses has changed" and suggest "future works could employ a data-centric approach to detecting concept drift."
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes that model performance decays but does not characterize the underlying changes in the data (e.g., changes in guess/slip behavior or curriculum ordering) causing the drift.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying statistical drift detection methods to input features and learning parameters across years to correlate specific distributional changes with drops in model AUC.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do advanced extensions of standard KT models (e.g., individualized priors or side information) improve or degrade a model's robustness to concept drift compared to their baseline implementations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they "limited our analysis to basic implementations" of the four model families and suggest exploring "how extensions to these model families impacts robustness."
- Why unresolved: While simpler baseline models (BKT) proved more stable, it is unknown if adding complexity to these models to boost short-term accuracy compromises their long-term temporal generalizability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal evaluation comparing baseline models against their extended variants (e.g., BKT vs. Individualized BKT) on the released multi-year dataset.

## Limitations
- The study cannot isolate specific drift causes (curriculum changes, student population shifts, platform updates), conflating multiple potential sources.
- The multi-year dataset spans only five academic years from a single OLP platform, limiting generalizability to other educational contexts.
- BKT's parameter averaging mechanism for unseen KCs is a practical workaround but lacks theoretical grounding.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Within-year model performance comparisons and the general pattern of SAKT models degrading faster than BKT/PFA. These findings are directly observable from the reported metrics.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that model complexity alone doesn't predict drift susceptibility. While the parameter-count comparison is explicit, the causal link between architectural inductive bias and temporal robustness requires further validation.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that SAKT's attention mechanisms specifically capture "year-specific long-range dependencies." The paper shows correlation but cannot definitively prove that attention weights encode curriculum structure versus other temporal patterns.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the cross-year evaluation on an independent KT dataset (e.g., ASSISTments or EdNet) to test whether the BKT stability and SAKT degradation patterns hold across platforms.
2. Implement attention window ablation studies (local vs. global attention) on the released dataset to isolate whether temporal horizon or attention mechanism design drives drift.
3. Conduct a per-KC analysis of BKT's parameter averaging fallback—compare averaged parameters against KC-specific parameters from the same year to quantify the performance penalty for unseen KCs.
