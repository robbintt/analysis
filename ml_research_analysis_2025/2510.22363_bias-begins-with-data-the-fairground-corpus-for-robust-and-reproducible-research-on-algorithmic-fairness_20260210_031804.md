# Bias Begins with Data: The FairGround Corpus for Robust and Reproducible Research on Algorithmic Fairness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.22363
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22363
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Introduces FairGround, a standardized framework and corpus of 44 tabular datasets with metadata and tools for reproducible algorithmic fairness research.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the reproducibility crisis in algorithmic fairness research by introducing FairGround, a comprehensive framework including a Python package and a corpus of 44 tabular datasets. The authors highlight how inconsistent data preprocessing and narrow dataset usage undermine the validity of fairness evaluations. FairGround standardizes data loading, transformation, and splitting while providing rich metadata annotations and computed features. Through large-scale experiments with seven debiasing methods across 136 scenarios, the study reveals significant variability in fairness and performance outcomes, with no single method consistently outperforming others. The work emphasizes the critical role of diverse, well-documented datasets and reproducible practices in advancing robust and generalizable fairness research.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces FairGround, a Python package and dataset corpus designed to standardize and improve reproducibility in algorithmic fairness research. The package provides configurable methods for dataset loading, preprocessing (e.g., binarization, imputation), transformation, and splitting. The corpus includes 44 tabular datasets (136 scenarios), each annotated with structural and statistical metadata (35 annotated, 27 computed). The authors evaluate seven fairness-enhancing debiasing methods across these scenarios, computing fairness (DPD, EOD) and performance (Balanced Accuracy, F1) metrics relative to logistic regression baselines. Random forest models are trained on metadata to predict debiasing method effectiveness, and curated collections are built using pairwise correlation analysis.

## Key Results
- Experiments with 7 debiasing methods across 136 scenarios show substantial variation in fairness and performance outcomes, with no single method consistently outperforming others.
- Feature importance analysis reveals that dataset characteristics like sensitive attribute predictability and base rate differences significantly influence debiasing method effectiveness.
- The FairGround corpus includes 44 datasets with 62 metadata features (35 annotated, 27 computed), selected for diversity and representativeness.
- Curated collections (e.g., DeCorrelatedSmall) are built using greedy algorithms to maximize diversity in debiasing performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Standardized Data Processing Reduces Experimental Variability
- Claim: Standardizing data loading, preprocessing, transformation, and splitting via the FairGround Python package can reduce hidden variability in fairness evaluation pipelines.
- Mechanism: The package provides explicit, configurable defaults for common preprocessing decisions (e.g., missing value handling, encoding sensitive attributes). By making these steps reproducible and transparent, it limits the "arbitrary" processing choices that the paper identifies as a source of non-reproducibility. The large-scale experiments (5440 models) demonstrate the feasibility of running many configurations under a consistent protocol.
- Core assumption: A significant portion of the reported non-reproducibility in fair ML stems from undocumented or inconsistent preprocessing choices, not only from algorithmic or model randomness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our accompanying Python package standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing, transformation, and splitting, streamlining experimental workflows."
  - [section] Page 2, Section 1: "...seemingly minor data processing and algorithmic design choices can significantly impact fairness outcomes..."
  - [corpus] The corpus contains related works on reproducibility benchmarks but does not provide direct comparative evidence on the reduction of variance *due to standardization*.
- Break condition: If subsequent studies show that preprocessing variability accounts for only a negligible fraction of overall fairness outcome variance compared to algorithmic or random seed variability, the impact of this mechanism would be limited.

### Mechanism 2: Diverse, Annotated Dataset Collections Enable More Robust Evaluation
- Claim: Curated dataset collections, selected for diversity in algorithmic performance and metadata, provide a more challenging and informative benchmark than commonly used narrow sets.
- Mechanism: FairGround includes 44 datasets (136 scenarios) with rich metadata (35 annotated, 27 computed). It defines collections based on properties like low correlation in debiasing performance (de-correlated), geographic diversity, and permissive licensing. The paper's experiments show that no single debiasing method consistently wins, suggesting evaluation is sensitive to dataset choice.
- Core assumption: Datasets that elicit divergent fairness-performance tradeoffs from debiasing methods are more informative for identifying a method's strengths and weaknesses than homogeneous benchmarks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...no single method consistently outperforming others."
  - [section] Page 7, Section 4.1: "The experiments reveal substantial variation in both fairness and performance metrics across datasets and methods."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus papers validate the "more informative" claim for these specific collections, though related works emphasize data diversity for bias evaluation.
- Break condition: If, in practice, the curated collections fail to expose failure modes of new algorithms that are later discovered in deployment or broader testing, the collections' utility as robust benchmarks is diminished.

### Mechanism 3: Dataset Metadata Predicts Debiasing Method Effectiveness
- Claim: Computed dataset metadata features can be used to predict the relative effectiveness of different fairness-enhancing interventions.
- Mechanism: The paper trains random forest models on computed metadata (e.g., sensitive attribute predictability, base rate differences, correlation statistics) to predict performance deltas of debiasing methods. Feature importance analysis identifies which dataset characteristics are most influential for each method.
- Core assumption: The relationship between dataset characteristics and debiasing method performance is learnable and sufficiently captured by the computed metadata features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The study identifies key dataset characteristics affecting fairness interventions..."
  - [section] Page 8-9, Section 4.3: "To uncover which dataset properties affect method performance, we train simple machine learning models... for each debiasing technique." Figure B3 shows predicted vs. observed deltas.
  - [corpus] Weak/missing. No related corpus papers are cited that replicate or challenge this predictive modeling approach for fairness.
- Break condition: If the predictive models fail to generalize to new datasets or new debiasing algorithms not included in the training set, their practical utility for method selection is limited.

## Foundational Learning
- Concept: Fairness Metrics in Classification (Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds).
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Demographic Parity Difference (DPD) and Equalized Odds Difference (EOD) as primary metrics to evaluate debiasing algorithms. Understanding these is critical to interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between Demographic Parity and Equalized Odds in terms of what they condition on?
- Concept: Types of Fairness Interventions (Pre-processing, In-processing, Post-processing).
  - Why needed here: The study evaluates 7 methods across these three categories. Distinguishing them is necessary to understand how and where in the ML pipeline bias mitigation occurs.
  - Quick check question: At what stage does "Adversarial Debiasing" operate, and what is its general goal?
- Concept: Reproducibility vs. Generalizability.
  - Why needed here: The paper's core motivation is addressing reproducibility (getting the same results with the same data/code) and generalizability (results holding across different datasets) challenges in fair ML.
  - Quick check question: If a debiasing technique works perfectly on the `Adult` dataset but fails on `COMPAS`, is this a failure of reproducibility or generalizability?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map:
  - Corpus: 44 tabular datasets, each a separate module.
  - Metadata Store: 62 total metadata features (35 annotated, 27 computed per dataset).
  - Python Package (`fairml-datasets`): Core infrastructure.
    - `Dataset` class: Handles loading, downloading, and metadata access for a single dataset.
    - Pipeline methods: `load()`, `transform()`, `train_test_split()`.
    - `Collection` classes: Provide iterators over curated groups of datasets/scenarios (e.g., `DeCorrelatedSmall`).
  - Selection Algorithm: A greedy algorithm that builds diverse collections based on pairwise correlations of method performance deltas.

- Critical path:
  1. Install package: `pip install fairml-datasets`.
  2. Select a dataset or collection: `Dataset.from_id("folktables_acsemployment")` or `DeCorrelatedSmall()`.
  3. Load and prepare: `dataset.load()`, `dataset.transform(df)`.
  4. Split: `dataset.train_test_split(df, test_size=0.3)`.
  5. Integrate with your ML pipeline: Train a baseline and/or debiasing algorithm using the split data and sensitive attribute columns from metadata.
  6. Evaluate: Compute fairness and performance metrics. Compare against baseline delta scores if using the paper's benchmark methodology.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Defaults vs. Customization**: The package provides opinionated defaults for preprocessing (e.g., median imputation, dummy encoding). This enhances reproducibility but may not be optimal for all research questions. All steps are configurable.
  - **Binarization**: The experimental results rely on binarized datasets for comparability across all debiasing methods. This simplifies the problem but may obscure nuance in multi-class or continuous settings.
  - **Scope**: The framework is currently focused on tabular classification, a dominant but not exclusive paradigm in fair ML.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Error: `ValueError` during `load()` or `transform()`**: May occur due to changes in the original data source URLs, file formats, or incompatible configuration parameters. Check the package's documentation or issue tracker for known data source problems.
  - **Error: `KeyError` for sensitive attribute**: The sensitive column name may have changed during transformation. Always use `transformation_info['sensitive_columns']` after calling `transform()`.
  - **Result: High technical error/timeout rate for certain methods**: The paper (Figure 4) reports this for some algorithms like LFR. Check the paper's logs or the AIF360 package documentation for stability issues.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce a Single Scenario**: Load the `bank` dataset, apply the default transformations, and run the paper's baseline logistic regression. Compute Balanced Accuracy and Equalized Odds Difference to verify your setup.
  2. **Compare Two Debiasing Methods**: On the same `bank` scenario, apply two different debiasing methods (e.g., Disparate Impact Remover and Adversarial Debiasing). Compare their delta scores (improvement/degradation from baseline) for both fairness and performance metrics.
  3. **Test on a Diverse Collection**: Iterate through the `DeCorrelatedSmall` collection. For each scenario, run one debiasing method. Aggregate results to observe if its ranking is stable or varies significantly across datasets, replicating the paper's finding on ranking instability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: Can the FairGround framework and processing pipelines be successfully extended to non-tabular data modalities such as text and images?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "In future work, we aim to extend our methodology and infrastructure to other data modalities, including text and image domains."
  - Why unresolved: The current infrastructure, metadata annotations, and Python package are designed specifically for tabular classification tasks, leaving the complexities of unstructured data unaddressed.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A functional extension of the Python package capable of standardized loading, preprocessing, and metadata extraction for benchmark text and image datasets.

- **Open Question 2**: How robust are current fairness-enhancing algorithms when applied to data collected from non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) contexts?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors highlight that "Geographical representation is notably skewed" (nearly 60% US) and explicitly encourage contributions to "expand beyond WEIRD contexts," implying current generalizability is limited.
  - Why unresolved: The corpus is currently dominated by US data; there is insufficient evidence to determine if the observed tradeoffs and algorithm rankings hold true across diverse global contexts.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing algorithm performance on a corpus with high geographic diversity outside of the US/Europe, showing whether feature importance and method rankings remain stable.

- **Open Question 3**: Can the computed metadata features (e.g., Sensitive AUC, base rate differences) be utilized to construct a reliable recommendation system for selecting the optimal fairness intervention for a specific dataset?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.3 analyzes feature importance to predict effectiveness, and Section 4.4 uses correlations to build collections, but the authors note that "no single method consistently outperforms others," leaving the selection problem open.
  - Why unresolved: While the paper identifies which dataset characteristics are influential, it does not integrate these into a prescriptive model that guides practitioners toward a specific algorithm for a new dataset.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating a predictive model that successfully recommends a debiasing technique for held-out datasets based on their computed metadata, outperforming random or static selection strategies.

## Limitations
- **Unknown 1**: Exact hyperparameters for AIF360 debiasing methods (e.g., adversarial learning rate, LFR prototypes, constraint weights) are not specified, affecting reproducibility.
- **Unknown 2**: The curated collections are not validated against alternative benchmarks or deployed model failures, limiting claims about their informativeness.
- **Unknown 3**: The predictive models for debiasing effectiveness are trained on a fixed set of methods and may not generalize to new algorithms or dataset types.

## Confidence
- **High**: FairGround corpus provides a diverse, well-documented set of tabular datasets for fair ML research.
- **Medium**: Standardized preprocessing reduces hidden variability in fairness evaluation pipelines.
- **Low**: Curated dataset collections are more informative benchmarks than commonly used narrow sets.
- **Low**: Metadata features reliably predict debiasing method effectiveness across new datasets and algorithms.

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce a Single Scenario**: Load the `bank` dataset, apply default transformations, and run the baseline logistic regression to verify setup and metric computation.
2. **Test Metadata Predictive Power**: Train random forest models on metadata to predict performance deltas for a held-out subset of debiasing methods. Evaluate generalization to new methods.
3. **Compare Collection Diversity**: Run a subset of debiasing methods across the `DeCorrelatedSmall` and a commonly used fairness benchmark (e.g., COMPAS, Adult). Compare ranking stability and failure mode exposure.
