core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of multi-table retrieval for
  open-domain question answering over datalakes, where retrieving and composing information
  from multiple tables requires balancing semantic relevance and structural coherence
  (e.g., joinability). The authors propose framing this task as an iterative search
  process, offering advantages in scalability, interpretability, and flexibility compared
  to exact optimization methods like Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) which are computationally
  prohibitive.

# Exploring Multi-Table Retrieval Through Iterative Search

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.13418
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13418
- **Reference count**: 16
- **Primary result**: Proposes iterative search framework for multi-table retrieval achieving 4-400x speedup over MIP baseline while maintaining competitive performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-table retrieval for open-domain question answering over data lakes, where information must be retrieved and composed from multiple tables while balancing semantic relevance and structural coherence (joinability). The authors propose framing this task as an iterative search process, offering advantages in scalability, interpretability, and flexibility compared to exact optimization methods like Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) which are computationally prohibitive. They present a general iterative framework and a concrete instantiation: a fast, effective Greedy Join-Aware Retrieval algorithm that balances relevance, coverage, and joinability. Experiments across five NL2SQL benchmarks demonstrate that their iterative method achieves competitive retrieval performance compared to the MIP-based approach while being 4-400x faster depending on the benchmark and search space settings.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces an iterative search framework for multi-table retrieval that addresses the limitations of exact optimization methods like MIP, which are computationally expensive and struggle with scalability on large data lakes. The proposed framework operates by iteratively expanding a table set, starting from a relevant seed table and adding tables that maximize a combined score of relevance, coverage, and joinability. The authors present a concrete instantiation called Greedy Join-Aware Retrieval, which uses a greedy approach to efficiently select tables while ensuring structural coherence. This method avoids the exponential complexity of exact methods while maintaining interpretability through its iterative nature, allowing for step-by-step table selection that can be easily monitored and adjusted.

## Key Results
- Achieved 4-400x speedup compared to MIP baseline across different benchmarks and search space configurations
- Maintained competitive retrieval performance on SPIDER, BIRD, FIBEN, BEA VER-DW, and BEA VER-NW benchmarks
- Demonstrated particular efficiency advantages on complex enterprise benchmarks where MIP approach times out

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The iterative search framework works by breaking down the complex multi-table retrieval problem into a series of simpler decisions. Instead of attempting to find the optimal table combination in one step (which is computationally intractable), the method builds up the table set incrementally, making locally optimal choices at each iteration. This approach leverages the fact that relevance, coverage, and joinability can be evaluated independently and combined in a way that approximates the global optimum. The greedy nature of the algorithm ensures fast execution while the join-aware component maintains structural coherence, preventing the selection of tables that cannot be meaningfully combined.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)**: Mathematical optimization technique for exact solutions - needed to understand baseline comparison; quick check: can be verified by testing on small table sets where exact solution is feasible
- **Joinability metrics**: Measures of how well tables can be combined based on schema relationships - needed for ensuring structural coherence; quick check: validate by attempting actual joins between selected tables
- **Greedy algorithms**: Optimization approach making locally optimal choices - needed for computational efficiency; quick check: compare against optimal solutions on small instances
- **Relevance scoring**: Methods for determining semantic similarity between queries and tables - needed for initial table selection; quick check: manual verification of top-ranked tables for sample queries
- **Coverage metrics**: Measures of how well selected tables collectively address query information needs - needed for completeness; quick check: analyze query-answering performance with varying table sets

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Query -> Relevance Score -> Coverage Score -> Joinability Check -> Table Selection -> Updated Table Set -> Next Iteration
- **Critical path**: The core iterative loop where tables are sequentially added based on combined relevance, coverage, and joinability scores
- **Design tradeoffs**: Speed vs. optimality (greedy approach sacrifices global optimum for efficiency), complexity vs. interpretability (iterative approach provides transparency but may miss optimal combinations)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor joinability leading to unjoinable table sets, low coverage resulting in incomplete answers, relevance bias causing selection of semantically relevant but structurally incompatible tables
- **First experiments**: 1) Run on SPIDER benchmark with varying table set sizes to measure performance scaling, 2) Compare greedy vs. beam search variants on BIRD to quantify optimality loss, 3) Stress test on BEA VER-DW with maximum table set sizes to identify timeout thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily compares against a single MIP-based baseline, limiting competitive analysis scope
- Performance gains highly dependent on specific search space configurations and benchmark characteristics
- Method's effectiveness across diverse data lake schemas and query distributions remains unestablished

## Confidence
- Iterative search framework provides scalability advantages over MIP: High confidence
- Greedy Join-Aware Retrieval achieves competitive retrieval performance: Medium confidence
- The approach generalizes well across different data lake scenarios: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of relevance, coverage, and joinability components
2. Evaluate on additional diverse datasets including unstructured data sources and real-world enterprise data lakes
3. Implement and compare against additional retrieval baselines beyond MIP, such as beam search or reinforcement learning approaches
