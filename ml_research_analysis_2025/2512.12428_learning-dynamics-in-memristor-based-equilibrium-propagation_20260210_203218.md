# Learning Dynamics in Memristor-Based Equilibrium Propagation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12428
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12428
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: EqProp converges with nonlinear memristors if $R_{OFF}/R_{ON} > 10$

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how nonlinear memristor conductance changes affect the convergence of neural networks trained with equilibrium propagation (EqProp). Six memristor models were characterized by their voltage-current hysteresis and integrated into the EBANA framework for evaluation on two benchmark classification tasks. EqProp achieved robust convergence under nonlinear weight updates, provided that memristors exhibited a sufficiently wide resistance range of at least an order of magnitude. The performance was largely independent of the specific memristor model, with minimal losses comparable to linear baseline models. Pulse-based weight-update strategies (PWM and PAM) produced equivalent results for continuous-drift models, while thresholded devices required higher frequencies with PAM to avoid overshoot.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates equilibrium propagation on memristor-based crossbar arrays using the EBANA framework. Six memristor models with different voltage-current characteristics were simulated, and their conductance updates were analyzed during the free and nudging phases of EqProp. Two weight-update strategies—pulse-width modulation (PWM) and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM)—were compared. Performance was benchmarked on MNIST and IRIS classification tasks, with a focus on convergence behavior and sensitivity to resistance range and nonlinearity.

## Key Results
- EqProp maintains robust convergence with nonlinear memristor models if $R_{OFF}/R_{ON} > 10$
- Performance is largely independent of the specific memristor model nonlinearity
- PWM and PAM weight-update strategies yield equivalent results for continuous-drift models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EqProp relies on the system reaching a stable energy minimum during both free and nudged phases. The gradient is approximated from the difference in squared voltage drops across memristors. Nonlinear memristors still obey Kirchhoff's laws, so the network can settle into equilibrium states. As long as the resistance range is wide enough to allow sufficient weight updates without saturation, the energy landscape remains navigable for convergence.

## Foundational Learning
- **Equilibrium Propagation (EqProp):** A biologically plausible learning rule where the network settles to equilibrium states in both free and nudged phases. Needed because it enables local, in-memory weight updates without external gradient computation.
  - *Quick check:* Verify that voltage drops during free and nudged phases are measurable and stable.
- **Vector-Matrix Multiplication (VMM):** Physical crossbar arrays compute VMM by Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's current law. Needed to leverage memristor conductance for efficient computation.
  - *Quick check:* Confirm linearity of VMM within operating voltage range.
- **Hysteresis in Memristors:** Voltage-dependent conductance changes that create nonlinear, history-dependent behavior. Needed to model realistic device physics but can affect learning dynamics.
  - *Quick check:* Characterize hysteresis loop symmetry and saturation points.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input Layer (DC voltage sources) -> Crossbar Arrays (VMM) -> Neurons (VCVS + CCCS + diode) -> Output Layer (prediction + feedback) -> Control System (gradient calc + pulse gen)

- Critical path:
  1. **Free Phase:** Set inputs -> System relaxes to equilibrium -> Measure voltage drops ($\Delta U^0_{ij}$) across all memristors.
  2. **Nudging Phase:** Inject feedback currents at output based on target -> System relaxes to new equilibrium -> Measure voltage drops ($\Delta U^\beta_{ij}$).
  3. **Update Phase:** For each memristor, calculate gradient approximation ($(\Delta U^\beta_{ij})^2 - (\Delta U^0_{ij})^2$) -> Generate PWM/PAM voltage pulse -> Apply pulse to update memristor conductance.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Negative Weights:** Wordline/bitline duplication doubles the number of physical memristors and I/O lines, increasing area and power but is required for representing signed weights.
  - **PWM vs. PAM:** The paper shows PWM and PAM are equivalent for continuous-drift models. PAM with higher frequencies is better for thresholded devices to avoid overshoot. The choice depends on the available control circuitry and the specific memristor model.
  - **Resistance Range ($R_{OFF}/R_{ON}$):** A wider range (>10x) is non-negotiable for convergence but may be harder to fabricate reliably.

- Failure signatures:
  - **High, non-decreasing loss:** Often indicates insufficient resistance range ($R_{OFF}/R_{ON} < 10$), causing weights to saturate.
  - **Unstable/Oscillating Loss:** For thresholded devices, this suggests PAM pulse width is too long, causing overshoot. Switch to higher frequency/shorter pulses.
  - **Drifting Performance:** Unaddressed state drift from voltages during inference phases slowly changes weights, degrading accuracy over time.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Validate Resistance Range:** Train on a simple task (e.g., Iris) with a baseline model. Systematically reduce $R_{OFF}/R_{ON}$ from 1000x to 5x and plot minimal loss vs. resistance range to confirm the >10x threshold.
  2. **Characterize Pulse Scheme:** For a given memristor model, train two networks: one with PWM and one with PAM. Compare loss curves. For thresholded models, run PAM at multiple frequencies to find the stability point.
  3. **Test Model Robustness:** Replace the baseline memristor model with one of the nonlinear models (e.g., VTEAM, Yakopcic) without changing hyperparameters (except pulse frequency for PAM) and verify that convergence is maintained, demonstrating robustness to nonlinearity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can neuron-level scaling factors effectively compensate for parasitic line resistances in bidirectional EqProp architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose a compensation method involving individual neuron scaling factors but state, "Whether such a compensation scheme is compatible with the dynamics of EqProp remains an open question."
- Why unresolved: Existing compensation methods assume unidirectional signal flow, whereas EqProp requires bidirectionality where input and output roles reverse during settling.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulations or hardware measurements confirming that position-dependent scaling factors maintain convergence accuracy in large crossbar arrays.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What circuit strategies can mitigate sneak-path currents in EqProp without inhibiting the bidirectional network dynamics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion notes that standard selectors (diodes/transistors) are incompatible with EqProp and concludes, "additional studies should explore alternative strategies for EqProp-compatible sneak-path suppression mitigation."
- Why unresolved: Sneak paths distort current summation, but suppressing them usually requires blocking elements that prevent the simultaneous network accessibility required for reaching equilibrium.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed circuit topology that suppresses parallel conduction while allowing the network to settle into a stable energy minimum.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does EqProp convergence behave when implemented on physical hardware with intrinsic device variability and state drift?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies "device-to-device variability" and "unintended drift" as omitted factors and states, "The next essential step is to conduct hardware-in-the-loop experiments using physical memristors."
- Why unresolved: The study relied on simulations that held memristive states fixed during inference phases and did not model stochastic device variations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical training results from a physical memristor-based crossbar demonstrating convergence comparable to the idealized simulation models.

## Limitations
- Simulations assume idealized crossbar behavior without parasitic resistances
- Performance metrics are based on specific benchmark tasks, limiting generalizability
- Real-world effects like device variability and state drift were not modeled

## Confidence

**Major Claim Clusters and Confidence:**
- **Convergence with nonlinear memristors (High):** The study provides strong empirical evidence that EqProp maintains convergence across multiple nonlinear models when the resistance range exceeds an order of magnitude. This claim is directly supported by experimental results.
- **Robustness to memristor model choice (Medium):** While results show minimal performance differences across models, this conclusion is based on a limited set of six models and may not hold for other nonlinearities or more complex behaviors.
- **PWM vs. PAM equivalence (Medium):** The study shows equivalence for continuous-drift models, but this finding is conditional on the specific models tested and may not generalize to all memristor types.

## Next Checks
1. **Benchmark against alternative learning rules:** Compare EqProp performance with other neuromorphic learning algorithms (e.g., backpropagation, contrastive Hebbian learning) on the same memristor models to quantify relative advantages and limitations.
2. **Real-device validation:** Implement the EBANA framework on fabricated memristor crossbar arrays to verify that simulation-based conclusions hold under physical conditions, particularly regarding resistance range requirements and state drift.
3. **Stress-test model assumptions:** Systematically vary the VMM linearity assumption (e.g., by introducing intentional non-idealities or using different circuit topologies) to identify the precise conditions under which EqProp remains robust.
