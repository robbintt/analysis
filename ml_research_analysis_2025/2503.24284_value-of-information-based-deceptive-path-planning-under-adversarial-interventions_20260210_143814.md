# Value of Information-based Deceptive Path Planning Under Adversarial Interventions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.24284
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24284
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper addresses deceptive path planning (DPP) under adversarial interventions where an observer can impede the path planning agent by altering the environment.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel Markov decision process (MDP)-based model for deceptive path planning under adversarial interventions. The authors develop two value of information (VoI)-based deception metrics that capture the impact of deceptive policies through the informational value of beliefs they induce in the observer. By leveraging connections to linear programming theory for MDPs, they derive computationally efficient solution methods for synthesizing policies that perform deceptive path planning under adversarial interventions.

## Method Summary
The method uses a linear programming approach over state-action occupancy measures to solve the deceptive path planning problem. For each candidate goal, the agent computes softmax value functions and intervention-induced costs. The agent then forms beliefs about goals based on observed trajectories and uses VoI metrics (Observer Value of Belief and Agent Value of Belief) to define a cost function. This cost function is combined with reachability constraints in a linear program that optimizes over occupancy measures, which are then converted to a stochastic policy.

## Key Results
- VoI DPP provides flexible levels of deceptiveness that can be tuned via a discount parameter
- Outperforms both existing passive-observer DPP methods and conservative path planning approaches when interventions occur during the critical deception window
- Approximately recovers conservative paths as a special case for low values of the discount parameter

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
By minimizing the "value of information" (VoI) available to an observer, an agent can influence the observer into selecting interventions that are suboptimal for impeding the agent. The system defines an "Observer Value of Belief" ($VoB_o$) which represents the maximum cost an observer can inflict based on their current belief distribution over the agent's goals. The agent selects a policy that generates trajectories minimizing this value. This forces the observer's belief distribution to shift such that the intervention maximizing the observer's expected utility corresponds to the intervention that minimizes the cost to the agent's true goal.

### Mechanism 2
Linear Programming (LP) over state-action occupancy measures allows for the efficient synthesis of policies that satisfy complex, non-linear deception objectives. Instead of solving the MDP directly via dynamic programming, the method converts the problem into a linear program where variables represent the frequency of visiting state-action pairs (occupancy measures). The deceptive cost (VoI) is approximated as a function of the state, allowing the global optimization of the deception-reward trade-off subject to reachability constraints.

### Mechanism 3
A tunable discount parameter ($\gamma_a$) controls the trade-off between path efficiency and deception, allowing the recovery of conservative (worst-case) paths as a special case. The cost function includes a time-decaying factor $\gamma_a^{T_{min}(s)}$. Low values of $\gamma_a$ heavily penalize short paths, forcing the agent to take long, deceptive detours. As $\gamma_a \to 1$, this penalty vanishes, and the agent reverts to the shortest path.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Softmax Value Iteration (Maximum Entropy IRL)
  - **Why needed here:** To model the "Observer." The agent predicts how the observer infers the agent's goal. The paper assumes the observer uses a softmax policy (Eq. 4) to assign probabilities to goals. You cannot calculate the VoI or the belief update $b_P(G|s_T)$ without understanding this.
  - **Quick check question:** If you increase the temperature parameter $\alpha$ in Eq. (2), does the observer assume the agent is acting more rationally or more randomly?

- **Concept:** Occupancy Measures in MDPs
  - **Why needed here:** The paper solves the deception problem using Linear Programming (LP) on "state-action occupancy measures" ($\lambda$) rather than standard value iteration. Understanding that $\lambda(s,a)$ represents the discounted visitation frequency is crucial for interpreting the optimization constraints in Eq. (8).
  - **Quick check question:** In the LP formulation, what does the constraint $\sum \lambda(s,a)r(s,a) = R_{max}(G^*)$ guarantee about the resulting policy?

- **Concept:** Value of Information (VoI)
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core metric. The agent minimizes the "value" of the information leaked to the observer. You must distinguish between "Observer Value of Belief" (how much the observer gains) and "Agent Value of Belief" (how much the agent loses).
  - **Quick check question:** In Eq. (12), the Observer Value of Belief $VoB_o(b)$ is defined as a maximum over interventions. Why does minimizing this maximum value constitute a defensive strategy for the agent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Observer Model Engine -> Intervention Cost Table -> VoI Calculator -> LP Solver -> Policy Extractor
- **Critical path:** The system relies on the pre-computation of the Intervention Cost Table. If this table (which maps interventions to goal-costs) is inaccurate or the set of interventions $I$ changes online, the VoI calculation (Component 3) fails, and the LP (Component 4) optimizes for the wrong objective.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Stochasticity:** The policy is stochastic by design (via LP over occupancy measures). This is necessary for deception (ambiguity) but complicates execution verification compared to deterministic planners.
  - **Myopic vs. Far-sighted:** The choice of objective ($VoB_o$ vs $VoB_a$) trades off "hiding the goal" (ambiguity) vs. "tricking the observer into a specific bad intervention" (exaggeration).
- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Distracted" Detours: If using passive-observer objectives in an adversarial setting, the agent may waste resources protecting against irrelevant goals
  - Shortest Path Collapse: If $\gamma_a$ is set too high, the agent ignores deception entirely and takes the shortest path, becoming vulnerable to intervention
  - Oscillation: If the observer is not naive (violating the assumption), the feedback loop between agent belief and observer intervention may cause unstable policy behavior
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Verify Observer Inference: Validate that the Observer Model Engine (Component 1) actually predicts goal probabilities correctly by running standard softmax agents and checking belief updates
  2. Intervention Sensitivity: Run the VoI Calculator (Component 3) on a simple gridworld with a single intervention. Confirm that $VoB_o(s)$ decreases as the agent moves away from the intervention point
  3. Critical Deception Window (CDW) Test: Implement the full pipeline. Intervene at timestep $T=1$ vs $T=10$. Verify that the performance gap between VoI-DPP and conservative planning is highest during the CDW

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the "Critical Deception Window" (CDW) be formally characterized, and does its significance persist across diverse environment topologies and observer capabilities? The paper identifies the CDW empirically in specific gridworlds but lacks a generalized theoretical definition or validation in broader contexts.

### Open Question 2
What is the precise theoretical relationship between VoI-based deception metrics and minimax value iteration as the discount parameter varies? The relationship is observed empirically as an approximation, but the mathematical bridge between the VoI objective and the minimax objective is not proven.

### Open Question 3
How robust is the VoI DPP framework against observers who deviate from the assumed belief-update model, such as strategic agents playing equilibrium strategies? The current observer model is fixed (naïve or specific rationality), and the paper does not analyze performance if the observer anticipates the deception or plays a best-response equilibrium strategy.

## Limitations
- The paper's claims rely heavily on the observer model assumptions (softmax policy with known goals and interventions)
- Computational efficiency gains from the LP formulation are demonstrated only on small gridworlds, and scalability to larger state spaces remains uncertain
- The paper does not address scenarios where interventions occur dynamically or adaptively based on the agent's observed behavior

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The theoretical framework connecting VoI to deception (Mechanism 1) is well-founded and mathematically rigorous
- **Medium confidence**: The LP-based solution method (Mechanism 2) works for the demonstrated examples but scalability to complex environments is unproven
- **Medium confidence**: The discount parameter mechanism (Mechanism 3) provides flexibility as claimed, but the relationship between γ_a values and actual deception success in varied environments needs more validation

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability test**: Implement the LP formulation on a larger state space (e.g., 20×20 grid or navigation mesh) and measure computational time and memory usage to verify claimed efficiency
2. **Observer model robustness**: Modify the observer to use a different inference model (e.g., Bayesian update with different priors or a non-softmax policy) and measure degradation in deception effectiveness
3. **Dynamic intervention test**: Implement an adaptive observer that selects interventions based on observed agent trajectories rather than pre-committed interventions, and evaluate whether the VoI-DPP agent maintains deception effectiveness
