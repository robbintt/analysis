# Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.07434
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434
- **Reference count**: 26
- **Primary result**: LLMs achieve state-of-the-art lemmatization results across 12 languages using in-context learning without domain-specific training data

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models can generate correct lemmas without domain- or language-specific training data. The authors compare in-context learning using LLMs against traditional supervised approaches across three settings: evaluating LLM performance on in-context lemmatization across morphologically diverse languages, comparing LLM performance to encoder models fine-tuned on out-of-domain data, and examining cross-lingual transfer scenarios where target language data is unavailable. Experiments across 12 languages demonstrate that while fine-tuning encoders on gold data remains competitive for out-of-domain settings, LLMs achieve state-of-the-art results by directly generating lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided with just a few examples.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comparative evaluation framework examining LLM lemmatization capabilities against traditional supervised approaches. Three experimental settings are tested: in-context learning across 12 languages with varying morphological complexity, comparison with encoder models fine-tuned on out-of-domain data, and cross-lingual transfer scenarios where target language data is unavailable. The evaluation uses standard lemmatization benchmarks and measures accuracy across different morphological systems. Multiple LLM variants including Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are tested with varying numbers of in-context examples to determine optimal performance configurations.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve state-of-the-art lemmatization results without prior fine-tuning when provided with just a few in-context examples
- Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 demonstrated the strongest overall performance across languages
- Claude achieved the highest accuracy for most languages tested in the study
- While fine-tuning encoders on gold data remains competitive for out-of-domain settings, LLMs match or exceed these results through direct generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of LLMs in lemma generation without domain-specific training data stems from their ability to leverage learned linguistic patterns and morphological regularities from pretraining across multiple languages. LLMs can perform in-context learning by recognizing morphological patterns and applying them to new instances when provided with few examples. This approach bypasses the need for extensive language-specific training data by tapping into the model's generalized understanding of morphological processes acquired during pretraining on diverse multilingual corpora.

## Foundational Learning
- **Morphological analysis**: Understanding how words are formed from morphemes and their canonical forms (why needed: essential for lemma generation; quick check: verify model correctly identifies root forms)
- **Cross-linguistic typology**: Knowledge of how different languages handle morphological processes (why needed: ensures broad applicability; quick check: test across diverse language families)
- **In-context learning**: Model's ability to learn from examples within prompts (why needed: core mechanism for few-shot performance; quick check: measure performance with varying example counts)
- **Lemma consistency**: Ensuring uniform canonical forms across different morphological variants (why needed: quality metric for lemmatization; quick check: verify consistent outputs for related forms)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input text -> Tokenizer -> LLM embedding layer -> Cross-attention mechanism -> Output generation layer -> Lemma prediction

**Critical Path**: Tokenization and embedding -> Context understanding through cross-attention -> Pattern matching for morphological rules -> Generation of canonical form

**Design Tradeoffs**: Few-shot in-context learning vs. fine-tuning - in-context learning requires no training data but may be less consistent, while fine-tuning provides stability but requires domain-specific data

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent lemma generation across morphologically similar words, failure to recognize language-specific morphological exceptions, inability to handle out-of-vocabulary forms

**First Experiments**: (1) Test in-context learning with 1, 3, and 5 examples to determine minimum effective example count, (2) Evaluate across morphologically simple vs. complex languages to identify performance patterns, (3) Compare performance on regular vs. irregular morphological forms to assess robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on only 12 languages, potentially insufficient to represent full morphological diversity
- Evaluation focuses on accuracy without addressing lemma consistency across morphological forms
- Methodological heterogeneity in comparing in-context LLM evaluation with fine-tuned encoder models

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| LLMs achieve state-of-the-art results without prior fine-tuning | Medium |
| Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are strongest performers | High (within tested languages), Low (for generalization) |
| Competitive results with just a few examples | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Expand testing to include languages from underrepresented families (e.g., polysynthetic languages, sign languages) to verify cross-linguistic robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies on the number of in-context examples needed for different morphological complexities to determine minimum effective example count
3. Perform systematic error analysis on ambiguous cases where multiple valid lemmas exist to assess how LLMs handle morphological ambiguity compared to rule-based systems
