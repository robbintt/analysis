# LatXGen: Towards Radiation-Free and Accurate Quantitative Analysis of Sagittal Spinal Alignment Via Cross-Modal Radiographic View Synthesis

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24165

- Synthesizes lateral spinal radiographs from posterior RGBD images with F1-score of 0.982 for spine curve estimation

## Executive Summary
LatXGen addresses the critical need for radiation-free assessment of sagittal spinal alignment in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The framework synthesizes realistic lateral spinal radiographs from non-radiative posterior RGBD back images through a dual-stage architecture combining morphology estimation and GAN-based synthesis. Validated on a 3,264-image dataset, the method achieves high accuracy in spine curve detection and sagittal parameter estimation, offering a promising alternative to conventional X-rays for AIS evaluation.

## Method Summary
The LatXGen framework employs a two-stage approach for cross-modal radiographic view synthesis. First, it estimates lateral spinal morphology from posterior RGBD images using attention-based Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) modules and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN). The FFC modules capture long-range spatial dependencies while the SDN handles complex geometric transformations. Second, a GAN-based generator synthesizes realistic lateral spinal radiographs from the estimated morphology. The system was trained and validated on a novel dataset containing 3,264 paired RGBD and radiographic images, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing GAN models for view synthesis tasks.

## Key Results
- Spine curve estimation achieved 0.982 F1-score accuracy
- Synthesized radiographs closely matched ground truth with R² values of 0.853-0.896 for sagittal alignment parameters (TKA, LLA, SSA)
- Outperformed existing GAN models in radiographic view synthesis tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-stage architecture effectively addresses the complex cross-modal synthesis problem by first estimating the underlying spinal morphology structure before attempting image synthesis. The FFC modules enable robust feature extraction by capturing long-range spatial dependencies crucial for accurate spine representation, while the SDN handles the geometric transformations between posterior and lateral views. The GAN-based synthesis stage then generates realistic radiographs conditioned on the estimated morphology, ensuring anatomical consistency and high visual fidelity.

## Foundational Learning
- Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC): Captures long-range spatial dependencies in feature maps; needed for accurate spine morphology estimation; quick check: verify receptive field size matches spinal anatomy scale
- Spatial Deformation Network (SDN): Handles geometric transformations between view perspectives; needed for converting posterior to lateral spinal representations; quick check: measure deformation field smoothness and anatomical plausibility
- GAN-based synthesis: Generates realistic radiographic images from estimated morphology; needed for producing clinically acceptable lateral radiographs; quick check: compare synthesized vs real image distributions using statistical tests

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: RGBD Input -> FFC Feature Extraction -> SDN Morphology Estimation -> GAN Synthesis -> Synthesized Radiograph

Critical Path: The morphology estimation stage (FFC + SDN) is the critical path, as errors in spinal structure estimation directly propagate to and limit the quality of synthesized radiographs.

Design Tradeoffs: The two-stage approach trades computational complexity for improved accuracy and anatomical consistency. Alternative single-stage direct synthesis approaches would be simpler but likely produce less accurate results due to the challenging nature of the cross-modal transformation.

Failure Signatures: Poor spine curve estimation indicates FFC module limitations or insufficient training data diversity. Unrealistic radiograph appearance suggests GAN training instability or inadequate conditioning from the morphology estimation stage. Geometric distortions may indicate SDN parameterization issues.

First Experiments:
1. Test spine curve detection accuracy on held-out validation set to verify FFC module performance
2. Evaluate GAN-generated radiograph quality using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) compared to real radiographs
3. Perform ablation study removing SDN to assess impact on synthesis quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Validation dataset from single institution may limit generalizability across diverse patient populations
- Reliance on posteroanterior RGBD images may introduce alignment estimation errors
- F1-score of 0.982 evaluated on training dataset, potentially overestimating real-world performance

## Confidence
- Technical novelty of dual-stage architecture: High
- Clinical utility for radiation-free AIS assessment: Medium
- Synthesized radiographs "closely match" ground truth: Low

## Next Checks
1. External validation on multi-institutional datasets with diverse demographic representation
2. Prospective clinical study comparing radiation-free assessments against conventional radiographic measurements in patient management decisions
3. Rigorous user study involving radiologists to evaluate diagnostic quality and clinical acceptability of synthesized radiographs compared to conventional X-rays
