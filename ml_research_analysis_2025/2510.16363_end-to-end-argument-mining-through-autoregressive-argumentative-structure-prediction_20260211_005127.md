core_contribution: The study addresses the challenge of Argument Mining (AM), which
  involves extracting complex argumentative structures such as Argument Components
  (ACs) and Argumentative Relations (ARs) from text. Traditional methods struggle
  with modeling dependencies between ACs and ARs, often leading to imbalanced classifications
  and inefficient handling of relational structures.

# End-to-End Argument Mining through Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16363
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16363
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: AASP achieves state-of-the-art results in two AM benchmarks and strong performance in the third, excelling particularly in relational tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AASP (Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction), a novel framework for End-to-End Argument Mining that models argumentative structures as sequences of autoregressive structure-building actions. The approach reformulates AM tasks as conditional pre-trained language model predictions of span-identifying, boundary-pairing, and type-labeling actions. Experiments on three standard benchmarks show AASP achieves state-of-the-art performance in two datasets and delivers strong results in the third, particularly excelling at relational tasks like ARI and ARC.

## Method Summary
AASP uses Flan-T5-Large as a conditional PLM with three adapter-style FFNs added to the decoder for action prediction. The model predicts sequences of structure-building actions: span-identifying (using FFN 1), boundary-pairing (using combined FFN 1/2), and type-labeling (using FFN 3). Training uses AdamW optimizer with dual learning rates (5×10^-5 for main model, 3×10^-4 for FFNs), batch sizes of 64/16, and 200 epochs. Greedy decoding is used at inference. The framework specifically addresses the challenge of modeling dependencies between argument components and relations through autoregressive sequential prediction rather than flattened generation.

## Key Results
- AASP achieves state-of-the-art results in two AM benchmarks (AAE, AAE-FG)
- Strong performance in the third benchmark (CDCP), particularly excelling in relational tasks like ARI and ARC
- The framework shows superior handling of longer AC spans and distantly related ACs compared to baselines
- Ablation study confirms that larger FFNs (1500 hidden units) are critical for relational performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Autoregressive structure prediction captures argumentative dependencies better than flattened sequence generation
- Mechanism: The model predicts structure-building actions sequentially, where each action conditions on all previous predictions, maintaining a "reasoning state" as it builds the argument structure
- Core assumption: Argumentative structures have sequential dependencies that benefit from autoregressive modeling
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "AASP framework models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions... to capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Larger feed-forward networks (1500 vs 150 hidden units) are necessary for handling long AC spans and distant AC relations
- Mechanism: Larger FFNs provide greater capacity to encode long-range dependencies between distantly positioned argument components
- Core assumption: The original ASP framework's FFNs were undersized for AM-specific challenges (longer spans, greater distances)
- Evidence anchors: [page 2] "To accommodate longer spans and distantly related ACs, we modify the feed-forward networks of the original ASP framework to a larger size"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The three-action formulation (span-identifying, boundary-pairing, type-labeling) enables joint end-to-end learning of all four AM tasks
- Mechanism: Span-identifying actions solve ACI, boundary-pairing actions complete ACI by finalizing boundaries, and type-labeling actions jointly solve ACC, ARI, and ARC by linking related ACs and classifying both component and relation types
- Core assumption: These three action types are sufficient to express all argumentative structures in standard AM benchmarks
- Evidence anchors: [page 2] "We solve the ACI task using Span-Identifying and Boundary-Pairing actions, and the ACC, ARI and ARC tasks using the Type-Labeling actions"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Autoregressive Sequence Modeling**
  - Why needed here: AASP relies on conditional language models that predict each token/action given all previous predictions. Understanding p(y_n | y_{<n}, W) is essential.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why greedy decoding (argmax at each step) might produce different results than beam search for structured prediction?

- Concept: **Biaffine Attention for Relation Extraction**
  - Why needed here: The baseline ST model uses biaffine attention for argumentative relations. AASP is compared against this paradigm, so understanding the contrast helps contextualize results.
  - Quick check question: Why does comparing every AC pair (biaffine approach) lead to class imbalance, and how does AASP's action sequence avoid this?

- Concept: **Constrained Decoding**
  - Why needed here: AASP uses a "dynamic vocabulary" at each time step based on the history y_{<n}. The action space changes as predictions proceed.
  - Quick check question: At what decoding step would the boundary-pairing action B_n become invalid, and how should the model handle it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input text -> T5 Encoder -> Decoder with FFN 1 (Span-identifying) + FFN 2 (Boundary-pairing) + FFN 3 (Type-labeling) -> Action sequence output
- Critical path:
  1. Encode input paragraph W with T5 encoder
  2. Initialize decoder with encoder outputs
  3. At each step n: compute decoder hidden state h_n
  4. If previous action was ⟨/m⟩: use FFN 3 with p_n = [h_n; h_bn] for type-labeling
  5. Else: use FFN 1 for span-identifying actions
  6. Apply dynamic vocabulary constraints (e.g., only valid boundary-pairing actions)
  7. Greedy decode: y*_n = argmax over valid actions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **FFN size (1500 vs 150)**: Larger FFNs improve long-range relation handling but increase memory/compute. Ablation shows 1.5-2.5% F1 drops with smaller FFNs, especially in relational tasks
  - **Greedy vs beam decoding**: Paper uses greedy for efficiency. Beam search might improve results but would require handling action constraints across beams
  - **Tree vs non-tree datasets**: AASP excels on tree-structured datasets (AAE, AAE-FG) but shows weaker ACI performance on non-tree CDCP with long paragraphs (>8 ACs)

- Failure signatures:
  - **Missed ACs in non-tree datasets**: 22.3% error rate in CDCP (page 8). Long paragraphs with complex relation structures cause AC identification failures
  - **AC Misclassification**: 24.33% in AAE-FG, 10.59% in CDCP. Fine-grained AC types and limited training data per class cause confusion
  - **Long-range relation drops**: ARI performance drops to 0% for CDCP at maximum distance (3 intermediate ACs), while AAE maintains >50% at 7 intermediate ACs
  - **Chain detection struggles**: 3-length chains have 0-20% accuracy across datasets, indicating difficulty with multi-hop reasoning structures

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce AAE baseline with reduced FFN (150 hidden)**: Run AASP(-rhs) on AAE dataset. Expect ~1.5% drop in average F1, with largest drops in ARI/ARC. This validates the FFN scaling hypothesis
  2. **Analyze ARI performance vs AC distance**: Bin AAE test set by distance between related ACs (0, 1, 2, ..., 7 intermediate ACs). Plot Micro-F1 for each bin. Expect AASP to maintain >50% at distance 7 while ST drops sharply. This confirms long-range relation capability
  3. **Inspect boundary-pairing failures in CDCP**: For CDCP paragraphs with >8 ACs, manually inspect where AASP misses ACs. Hypothesis: non-tree structures with multiple outgoing relations confuse the boundary-pairing logic. This identifies architecture limitations for non-tree datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can argument mining frameworks be advanced to capture longer, multi-hop relational chains of reasoning more accurately?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section V.F that "none of the existing works has focused on this aspect" and emphasize "the need for further advancements in modelling complex relational structures" after showing AASP achieves only 13.33% accuracy on 3-length chains in AAE
- Why unresolved: While AASP improves upon baselines, it still fails to reliably identify extended reasoning chains (length ≥ 3), particularly in complex non-tree structures like CDCP where accuracy drops to 0.0%
- What evidence: Improved accuracy scores specifically for 3-length and 4-length chain detection tasks in the AAE and AAE-FG benchmarks

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the autoregressive approach be optimized to handle Argument Component Identification (ACI) in longer, non-tree-structured paragraphs effectively?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section V.C notes that while AASP excels at tree-structured data, it "underperforms compared to ST for longer paragraphs, especially beyond 8 ACs" in the non-tree CDCP dataset
- Why unresolved: The modified Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) successfully handle distance in tree structures but appear insufficient for maintaining component identification performance in long, complex non-tree discourse
- What evidence: Improved Micro-F1 scores on the ACI task specifically for paragraphs containing more than 8 Argument Components within the CDCP dataset

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the high rate of misclassification for fine-grained Argument Component (AC) types be reduced?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section V.G identifies "AC Misclassifications" as the most significant error type, noting it poses a "consistent challenge" particularly in the fine-grained AAE-FG dataset where it accounts for 24.33% of errors
- Why unresolved: Increasing the granularity of AC types (e.g., splitting "Premise" into "Testimony", "Statistics", etc.) introduces ambiguity that the current model features struggle to disambiguate
- What evidence: A reduction in the percentage of "AC Misclassification" errors in the error distribution analysis on the AAE-FG dataset

## Limitations
- The three-action formulation, while effective for standard AM benchmarks, may be insufficient for more complex argumentative structures requiring additional attributes or nested relations
- AASP shows performance degradation on non-tree structured datasets with long paragraphs (>8 ACs), particularly struggling with component identification in CDCP
- The model still struggles with multi-hop reasoning chains, achieving only 13.33% accuracy on 3-length chains in AAE, indicating limitations in capturing extended argumentative reasoning

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The autoregressive modeling mechanism's superiority over flattened approaches is well-supported by comparative results showing consistent gains across benchmarks
- **Medium Confidence**: The FFN size claim (1500 vs 150) is validated through ablation but lacks broader parameter sensitivity studies
- **Medium Confidence**: The three-action formulation's sufficiency for standard AM tasks is theoretically sound but untested on more complex argumentative structures

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the AAE baseline with reduced FFN (150 hidden units) to confirm the ~1.5% performance drop and validate the architectural scaling hypothesis
2. Conduct distance-based ARI analysis on AAE test set to quantify long-range relation handling improvements over baseline methods
3. Perform manual inspection of boundary-pairing failures in CDCP's longest paragraphs to identify specific structural limitations in non-tree datasets
