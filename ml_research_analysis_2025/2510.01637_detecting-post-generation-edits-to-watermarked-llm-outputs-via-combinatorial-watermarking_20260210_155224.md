# Detecting Post-generation Edits to Watermarked LLM Outputs via Combinatorial Watermarking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01637
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01637
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework to detect and localize post-generation edits to LLM outputs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and localizing post-generation edits made to watermarked LLM outputs. The authors propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework that partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds a deterministic pattern over these subsets during generation. This framework is accompanied by a global statistic for watermark detection and lightweight local statistics for identifying and localizing edits. The method is evaluated on open-source LLMs (LLaMA-2-7b and OPT-1.3b) across various editing scenarios, demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization. The proposed approach achieves high detection accuracy, particularly for consecutive edits, and outperforms baseline watermarking methods, especially for deletion-type edits and short-span edits.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a combinatorial watermarking framework that embeds a deterministic pattern over partitioned vocabulary subsets during LLM generation. The approach uses a global statistic for watermark detection and lightweight local statistics for edit identification and localization. The framework is designed to detect and localize various types of post-generation edits, including deletions, insertions, and modifications, while maintaining robustness to editing strategies. The method is evaluated on LLaMA-2-7b and OPT-1.3b models across different editing scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline watermarking methods, particularly for consecutive edits and deletion-type edits.

## Key Results
- The framework achieves high detection accuracy for consecutive edits and outperforms baseline watermarking methods
- Strong performance in localizing deletion-type edits and short-span edits
- Demonstrates robustness across various editing scenarios on LLaMA-2-7b and OPT-1.3b models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The combinatorial watermarking framework works by embedding a deterministic pattern over partitioned vocabulary subsets during LLM generation. This pattern is designed to be robust to common editing strategies while remaining detectable through global and local statistical analysis. The global statistic provides an overall watermark detection signal, while the lightweight local statistics enable precise identification and localization of edits. By partitioning the vocabulary into disjoint subsets, the framework creates a structured embedding that can withstand certain types of modifications while maintaining detectability. The combinatorial approach allows for efficient encoding of the watermark while preserving the ability to detect and localize edits through statistical analysis of the output text.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Combinatorial pattern-based watermarking**
   - Why needed: Enables robust embedding of detectable patterns while maintaining efficiency
   - Quick check: Verify that the pattern is both detectable and resistant to common editing strategies

2. **Global vs. local statistical analysis**
   - Why needed: Global statistics detect watermark presence, while local statistics enable precise edit localization
   - Quick check: Ensure that both global and local statistics are sensitive enough to detect edits while minimizing false positives

3. **Vocabulary partitioning**
   - Why needed: Creates structured embedding that can withstand certain types of modifications
   - Quick check: Confirm that partitioned subsets maintain statistical properties necessary for watermark detection

4. **Edit detection and localization**
   - Why needed: Critical for identifying and pinpointing post-generation modifications
   - Quick check: Validate that the framework can distinguish between different types of edits (deletions, insertions, modifications)

5. **Lightweight statistical computation**
   - Why needed: Ensures practical applicability without significant computational overhead
   - Quick check: Measure and compare computational requirements against baseline methods

6. **Robustness to editing strategies**
   - Why needed: Ensures watermark persistence under common post-generation modifications
   - Quick check: Test against various editing strategies including deletions, insertions, and semantic-preserving rewrites

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Watermarking Framework -> Global Statistic Module -> Local Statistic Module -> Edit Detection and Localization Module

**Critical Path:**
1. LLM generates output with embedded watermark pattern
2. Global statistic analyzes overall watermark presence
3. Local statistics identify potential edit locations
4. Edit detection and localization module pinpoints modifications

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Balancing watermark strength with detectability
- Optimizing for computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy
- Ensuring robustness to various editing strategies without compromising generation quality

**Failure Signatures:**
- False negatives in watermark detection
- Inaccurate localization of edits
- High computational overhead
- Sensitivity to benign text modifications

**First Experiments:**
1. Test watermark detection accuracy on clean (unedited) outputs
2. Evaluate localization precision for consecutive deletions
3. Measure computational overhead compared to baseline methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused on specific open-source models (LLaMA-2-7b and OPT-1.3b), raising questions about generalizability to other architectures
- Limited testing against sophisticated adversarial editing strategies such as synonym substitution
- Computational efficiency claims lack quantitative validation through runtime measurements
- Robustness to complex editing patterns and semantic-preserving rewrites remains untested

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Core detection and localization accuracy | High |
| Generalizability to other architectures | Medium |
| Robustness against adversarial attacks | Medium |
| Computational efficiency ("lightweight") | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the framework's performance on additional LLM architectures (e.g., GPT-3, BLOOM) to assess generalizability.

2. Test robustness against adversarial editing strategies, such as synonym substitution or semantic-preserving rewrites.

3. Measure and report computational overhead for local statistics computation to validate the "lightweight" claim.
