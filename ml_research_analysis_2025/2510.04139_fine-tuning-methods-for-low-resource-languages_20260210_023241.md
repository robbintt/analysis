# Fine Tuning Methods for Low-resource Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04139
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04139
- Reference count: 30
- This project fine-tuned Gemma 2 for Swedish by creating a 500-prompt dataset and combining it with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Swedish cultural datasets

## Executive Summary
This project demonstrates the feasibility of adapting large language models to low-resource languages through a hybrid fine-tuning approach. By combining LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning with RAG and a carefully curated Swedish dataset, the researchers successfully adapted Gemma 2 for Swedish language tasks. The approach achieved strong performance in translation and summarization while addressing the challenge of limited training data through efficient parameter updates and contextual augmentation.

## Method Summary
The methodology involved creating a 500-prompt Swedish dataset and fine-tuning Gemma 2 using LoRA with rank 8 for parameter efficiency. Mixed-precision training was employed to optimize computational resources. RAG was integrated by leveraging Swedish cultural datasets to reduce hallucinations and improve contextual accuracy. The combination of these techniques enabled effective adaptation of the model to Swedish language and cultural nuances while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- Strong translation performance: BLEU score of 0.46 and BERTScore of 0.76
- Effective summarization: ROUGE-1 score of 0.76
- RAG integration reduced hallucinations and improved contextual accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success stems from combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with contextual augmentation. LoRA enables targeted adaptation without full model retraining, while RAG provides external knowledge to compensate for limited training data. Mixed-precision training optimizes resource utilization, making the approach computationally feasible. The integration of Swedish cultural datasets through RAG specifically addresses the challenge of capturing cultural nuances in low-resource language settings.

## Foundational Learning

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that adds low-rank matrices to model weights. Needed to reduce computational cost and memory requirements when adapting large models. Quick check: Verify rank parameter selection balances adaptation quality vs. parameter count.

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combines retrieval systems with generation models to provide external context. Essential for low-resource languages where training data is limited. Quick check: Evaluate retrieval precision and relevance of retrieved documents.

**Mixed-precision training**: Uses lower precision (e.g., FP16) for faster computation and reduced memory usage. Critical for making fine-tuning feasible on limited hardware. Quick check: Monitor for numerical instability or gradient underflow.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Gemma 2 -> LoRA adapter -> RAG retriever -> Generation output

Critical path: Input prompt → RAG retrieval → LoRA fine-tuning → Model generation

Design tradeoffs: LoRA rank 8 balances adaptation capacity vs. parameter efficiency; mixed-precision trades some numerical precision for computational feasibility

Failure signatures: 
- Low BLEU/BERTScore indicates poor translation quality
- High hallucination rates suggest RAG retrieval issues
- Training instability may indicate mixed-precision problems

First experiments:
1. Benchmark LoRA-only fine-tuning against full fine-tuning baseline
2. Test RAG integration with different embedding models
3. Compare mixed-precision training speeds vs. full precision

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small 500-prompt dataset may not capture full linguistic diversity
- Limited ablation studies prevent isolating individual component contributions
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture cultural appropriateness and nuanced language quality

## Confidence
- Translation metrics: Medium (BLEU, BERTScore may miss cultural nuances)
- RAG effectiveness: Medium (implementation details unclear)
- Scalability claims: Low (only tested on 500 prompts)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of LoRA, RAG, and mixed-precision training components
2. Expand evaluation to include additional linguistic metrics (e.g., chrF, METEOR) and human evaluation for cultural appropriateness
3. Test model performance on progressively larger Swedish datasets (100-1000 prompts) to establish scaling relationships and identify performance ceilings
