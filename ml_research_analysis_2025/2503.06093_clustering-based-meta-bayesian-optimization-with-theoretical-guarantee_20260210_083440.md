core_contribution: This paper presents a clustering-based meta-Bayesian Optimization
  (cm-BO) framework designed to address heterogeneous and large-scale meta-task scenarios
  in black-box optimization. The core idea is to partition historical meta-tasks into
  homogeneous clusters using statistical distances, construct cluster prototypes (geometric
  centers or Wasserstein barycenters), and adaptively synthesize meta-priors during
  online optimization based on similarity-based weighting policies.

# Clustering-based Meta Bayesian Optimization with Theoretical Guarantee

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06093

- Key outcome: cm-BO framework addresses heterogeneous and large-scale meta-task scenarios in black-box optimization through clustering and adaptive synthesis of meta-priors

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a clustering-based meta-Bayesian Optimization (cm-BO) framework that tackles the challenges of heterogeneous and large-scale meta-task scenarios in black-box optimization. The approach partitions historical meta-tasks into homogeneous clusters using statistical distances, constructs cluster prototypes, and adaptively synthesizes meta-priors during online optimization based on similarity-based weighting policies. This method effectively addresses the task heterogeneity and scalability issues faced by traditional meta-BO methods. The framework demonstrates superior convergence rates and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines across real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks, with theoretical regret bounds ensuring computational feasibility and convergence guarantees.

## Method Summary
The cm-BO framework employs a clustering strategy to partition historical meta-tasks into homogeneous groups based on statistical distances between task functions. For each cluster, prototypes are constructed using either geometric centers or Wasserstein barycenters of the task distributions. During online optimization, the framework adaptively synthesizes meta-priors by weighting these prototypes according to their similarity to the target task. This adaptive weighting policy allows for effective transfer learning from similar historical tasks while mitigating negative transfer from dissimilar ones. The approach balances exploration and exploitation through a modified acquisition function that incorporates the synthesized meta-prior, enabling efficient optimization even in highly heterogeneous meta-task environments.

## Key Results
- cm-BO variants outperform state-of-the-art baselines in convergence rate and robustness
- WssClus_WssCMP_Bary (Wasserstein clustering with Wasserstein barycenter) achieves the best overall performance
- Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds demonstrating computational feasibility and convergence guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The cm-BO framework works by leveraging the structure in heterogeneous meta-task distributions through clustering and adaptive synthesis. By partitioning tasks into homogeneous clusters, the method ensures that meta-priors are constructed from truly similar tasks, reducing the risk of negative transfer. The use of Wasserstein distances and barycenters allows for robust handling of distributional differences between tasks, capturing both location and shape information. The adaptive weighting policy ensures that during online optimization, the synthesized meta-prior is most influenced by clusters most similar to the target task, providing an effective balance between leveraging historical knowledge and adapting to new tasks. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional meta-BO methods that assume task homogeneity or use fixed weighting schemes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Meta-Task Dataset -> Clustering Module -> Prototype Construction -> Adaptive Weighting -> Acquisition Function -> Optimizer -> Target Task

**Critical Path:**
The critical path in cm-BO flows from the meta-task dataset through clustering, prototype construction, and adaptive weighting to influence the acquisition function used by the optimizer on the target task. This path ensures that historical knowledge is effectively transferred to the current optimization process.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Clustering granularity vs. computational complexity: Finer clustering improves similarity matching but increases computational cost
- Prototype choice (geometric center vs. Wasserstein barycenter): Wasserstein barycenters capture distributional properties better but are computationally more expensive
- Weighting policy flexibility vs. stability: More adaptive policies can better match task similarity but may introduce instability in meta-prior synthesis

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor clustering quality leading to mixed-task clusters and ineffective meta-priors
- Overfitting to historical tasks when the target task distribution significantly differs from all clusters
- Computational bottlenecks in large-scale scenarios due to clustering or barycenter calculations

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Reproduce baseline experiments on standard HPO benchmark datasets to validate performance claims
2. Conduct ablation studies on different clustering algorithms and prototype constructions
3. Test cm-BO on a synthetic heterogeneous task distribution to analyze clustering and transfer effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided

## Limitations
- Computational complexity of clustering and barycenter computation may be intensive for very large meta-task datasets
- Performance heavily depends on the quality of task clustering, which may not hold in all scenarios
- Theoretical regret bounds assume specific conditions on task similarity and cluster formation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Experimental results showing improved convergence rates and robustness are well-supported by the data provided
- **Medium Confidence**: Theoretical analysis providing regret bounds is sound within its assumptions, but practical implications need further validation
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about effectiveness in extremely heterogeneous and large-scale scenarios are based on limited experiments and need more diverse testing

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments with significantly larger meta-task datasets to validate scalability claims and identify potential computational bottlenecks
2. Systematically evaluate the impact of varying clustering quality on cm-BO performance by introducing controlled noise or using different clustering algorithms
3. Test cm-BO on a wider range of optimization problems from different domains to assess generalization capabilities and identify potential domain-specific limitations
