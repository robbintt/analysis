# Sampling in High-Dimensions using Stochastic Interpolants and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.00355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00355
- Authors: Anand Jerry George; Nicolas Macris
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces diffusion-based sampling algorithms that generate exact samples from high-dimensional probability distributions in finite time using stochastic interpolants and FBSDEs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to high-dimensional sampling by leveraging stochastic interpolants and forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). The method bridges a Gaussian prior to a target distribution through a time-indexed collection of probability densities, then derives diffusion processes that obey these densities. By solving the resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs using FBSDEs combined with machine learning techniques, the approach avoids computationally expensive neural SDE gradients while claiming to produce exact samples in finite time.

## Method Summary
The approach constructs a family of probability densities indexed by time that interpolate between a simple Gaussian prior and the complex target distribution. These stochastic interpolants define a diffusion process whose evolution is governed by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Rather than solving this PDE directly, the authors reformulate it as a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) system. Machine learning techniques are employed to approximate the solutions to these FBSDEs, which then yield the diffusion process needed for sampling. The method claims to produce exact samples without requiring importance sampling correction and can estimate normalization constants directly.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates effective sampling from challenging distributions including Gaussian mixtures, Neal's funnel, and spin glass models
- Successfully estimates normalization constants and other quantities without importance sampling correction
- Detects phase transitions in spin glass models consistent with theoretical predictions
- Shows promise in overcoming limitations of existing methods for high-dimensional sampling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by constructing a continuous path of probability distributions connecting a tractable prior to the target distribution. This path is defined through stochastic interpolants, which are time-indexed probability densities. The evolution along this path is governed by a diffusion process derived from the Fokker-Planck equation associated with each interpolant. By reformulating the resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs as FBSDEs, the authors can leverage powerful mathematical tools and machine learning techniques to approximate the solution. The FBSDE formulation allows for efficient computation while maintaining theoretical guarantees of exactness when the equations are solved precisely.

## Foundational Learning
1. Stochastic Interpolants

   - Quick check: Verify that the interpolants satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation

2. Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs)
   - Why needed: Reformulate the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs for tractable solution
   - Quick check: Confirm that the FBSDE system has a unique solution

3. Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations
   - Why needed: Govern the evolution of the diffusion process along the interpolant path
   - Quick check: Validate that the HJB equation is correctly derived from the interpolants

4. Machine Learning for PDE Approximation

   - Quick check: Test convergence of the neural network approximation to known solutions

5. Diffusion Processes in Sampling
   - Why needed: Provide a mechanism for generating samples from complex distributions
   - Quick check: Verify that the diffusion process preserves the target distribution

6. Normalization Constant Estimation

   - Quick check: Compare estimated normalization constants against analytical values for simple cases

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Stochastic Interpolants -> Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations -> Forward-Backward SDEs -> Machine Learning Approximation -> Diffusion Process -> Samples

Critical Path:
The critical path begins with constructing stochastic interpolants between prior and target distributions, then formulating the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This PDE is reformulated as a forward-backward SDE system, which is then approximated using machine learning techniques. The resulting solution yields the parameters of the diffusion process that generates exact samples from the target distribution.

Design Tradeoffs:
The primary tradeoff is between computational efficiency and exactness. While the FBSDE approach claims finite-time exactness, practical implementations require approximations through machine learning, potentially introducing small errors. The method trades off the simplicity and scalability of neural SDE approaches for potentially better theoretical guarantees and avoidance of importance sampling correction.

Failure Signatures:
- Poor convergence of the machine learning approximation to the FBSDE solutions
- Numerical instability in solving the FBSDE system
- Failure to maintain the target distribution when generating samples
- Overestimation or underestimation of normalization constants

Three First Experiments:
1. Verify exact sampling on a simple 1D Gaussian mixture where analytical solutions exist
2. Test convergence rates on progressively higher dimensional Gaussian distributions
3. Compare sample quality and computational efficiency against HMC on the Neal's funnel distribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational scalability to very high dimensions remains unverified
- Claims of finite-time exactness depend on perfect solution of FBSDEs and PDEs
- Limited comprehensive benchmarking against existing sampling methods
- Potential sensitivity to initialization and hyperparameter choices not fully explored

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The mathematical framework connecting stochastic interpolants to FBSDEs is rigorous and well-developed

**Medium confidence**: Empirical results on moderate-dimensional distributions are promising but limited in scope

**Low confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency compared to existing methods lack comprehensive benchmarking

## Next Checks

1. Benchmark scalability on synthetic high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures with dimensions ranging from 100 to 1000, comparing wall-clock time and sample quality against HMC and normalizing flows

2. Validate the finite-time exactness claim by testing convergence rates on problems with known analytic solutions across varying levels of discretization in the FBSDE solver

3. Test robustness to initialization and hyperparameter sensitivity by running ablation studies on the spin glass model with varying initial conditions and network architectures for the FBSDE components
