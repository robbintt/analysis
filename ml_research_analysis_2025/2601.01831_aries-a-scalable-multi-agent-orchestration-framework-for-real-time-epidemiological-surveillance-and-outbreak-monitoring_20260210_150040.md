# ARIES: A Scalable Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework for Real-Time Epidemiological Surveillance and Outbreak Monitoring

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01831
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01831
- Reference count: 30
- ARIES uses hierarchical multi-agent orchestration to achieve 9× word count and 7× citation count improvements in epidemiological reporting

## Executive Summary
ARIES addresses real-time epidemiological surveillance through a hierarchical multi-agent framework that overcomes knowledge gaps in general-purpose AI. The system orchestrates specialized sub-agents to autonomously query WHO, CDC, and PubMed sources, synthesizing data for outbreak detection and risk assessment. Comparative experiments demonstrate that asymmetric model configuration (high-reasoning manager with specialized sub-agents) produces significantly more comprehensive reports than uniform model approaches.

## Method Summary
ARIES employs a hierarchical architecture where a Manager Agent decomposes natural language queries into domain-specific subtasks and delegates them to specialized sub-agents with distinct tool access. The framework uses CrewAI for agent orchestration, implementing four-stage investigative loops: ingestion, decomposition & delegation, reasoning, and final briefing. The system interfaces with WHO Disease Outbreak News via OData API, CDC WONDER via XML-POST requests, and PubMed literature via BioC-JSON format.

## Key Results
- Asymmetric model configuration (gpt-5.1 manager with o3 sub-agents) increased output from 323 to 2,962 words
- Source citations expanded from 3 to 20 when using specialized high-reasoning models
- Parallel sub-agent dispatch reduced total latency compared to sequential approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hierarchical task decomposition with specialized tool-bound agents produces more comprehensive epidemiological reports than single-model inference. The Manager Agent decomposes queries into clinical, statistical, and regulatory subtasks, dispatching them in parallel to sub-agents with distinct tool access (PubMed BioC-JSON, CDC WONDER XML, WHO OData). Core assumption: Query decomposition and cross-source verification reduce hallucination frequency compared to single-agent generation.

### Mechanism 2
Asymmetric model configuration—higher-reasoning manager with specialized sub-agents—increases output depth and citation count. The Manager requires stronger reasoning for synthesis and contradiction detection, while sub-agents need domain-specific retrieval competence. Core assumption: Observed output expansion reflects genuine information quality improvement, not verbosity without semantic gain.

### Mechanism 3
Role-persona assignment with constrained toolsets reduces scope drift and improves domain relevance. Each sub-agent is assigned a persona (e.g., "CDC Data Analyst"), goal, and specific tool access. This constrains agent behavior to domain-appropriate queries and reduces off-target generation. Core assumption: Persona-based role assignment measurably constrains agent output distribution toward domain-relevant responses.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-agent orchestration patterns**: ARIES relies on centralized coordination with parallel sub-agent execution; understanding delegation and synthesis patterns is prerequisite.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why sequential agent chains risk cumulative error propagation compared to hierarchical parallel dispatch?

- **API data formats for epidemiological sources**: Sub-agents interface with CDC WONDER (XML-POST), PubMed (BioC-JSON), and WHO DONs (OData); format handling is critical.
  - Quick check: What is the difference between BioC-JSON and raw XML extraction for LLM consumption?

- **LLM configuration parameters**: Table I shows temperature settings affect creativity/factual balance; model selection impacts output depth.
  - Quick check: Why would temperature=1.0 be problematic for factual epidemiological reporting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: User query → Manager intent classification → Parallel sub-agent dispatch → Tool execution (PubMed/CDC/WHO) → Sub-agent summaries returned → Manager logic verification → Final briefing with sources displayed
- **Critical path**: User query → Manager intent classification → Parallel sub-agent dispatch → Tool execution → Sub-agent summaries → Manager logic verification → Final briefing with sources
- **Design tradeoffs**: Higher-reasoning models increase output quality but raise cost and latency; parallel dispatch reduces total latency but increases API rate-limit risk; transparent reasoning logs improve trust but expose internal logic
- **Failure signatures**: Sub-agent timeout or API rate-limit → incomplete report; logic verification detects contradiction → Manager should flag inconsistency; temperature too high → hallucinated citations
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate Table I Scenario #1 vs #2 locally using CrewAI with gpt-4o uniform vs asymmetric configuration; measure word count and citation count
  2. Introduce deliberate contradictory mock data and verify Manager logic-verification triggers correctly
  3. Test API failure handling by simulating CDC WONDER timeout; confirm graceful degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Factual accuracy validation**: What is the factual accuracy and reliability of ARIES-generated reports when evaluated by domain experts against ground truth epidemiological data?
- **Scalability with additional agents**: How does system latency and output quality scale when adding specialized sub-agents for genomic and geospatial data?
- **Human-in-the-Loop effectiveness**: Can a Human-in-the-Loop feedback mechanism with reinforcement learning effectively reduce hallucination rates in ARIES outputs?
- **RAG integration benefits**: Does integrating RAG with WHO Weekly Epidemiological Records improve information recency compared to the current API-only retrieval approach?

## Limitations
- Quantitative claims lack statistical significance testing or error margins
- Asymmetric model configuration advantage remains unproven beyond single example query
- API endpoint specifications and authentication mechanisms are unspecified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Hierarchical multi-agent architecture and role-based tool assignment represent established patterns
- **Medium Confidence**: Comparative output metrics appear reproducible but semantic quality improvements lack independent verification
- **Low Confidence**: Claim that asymmetric configuration produces objectively "more precise and detailed reports" lacks rigorous validation

## Next Checks
1. **Statistical Validation**: Replicate word count and citation count experiments across 10+ diverse queries; apply paired t-tests to determine statistical significance
2. **Logic Verification Testing**: Construct controlled test cases with deliberate contradictory data; verify Manager correctly identifies all contradictions
3. **Cost-Latency Analysis**: Implement complete system; measure end-to-end latency and calculate cost per report using actual API pricing for gpt-5.1 and o3 models
