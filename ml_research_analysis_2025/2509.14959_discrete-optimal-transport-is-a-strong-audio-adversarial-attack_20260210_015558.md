## Executive Summary
This work introduces a novel black-box adversarial attack on audio anti-spoofing systems using discrete optimal transport (DOT). The method aligns WavLM embeddings from generated speech to an unpaired bona fide speech pool via entropic OT and barycentric projection, then reconstructs audio using a neural vocoder. Tested on ASVspoof2019 and ASVspoof5 benchmarks with AASIST countermeasures, DOT consistently yields high equal error rates (EER) across datasets and remains effective after CM fine-tuning, outperforming several conventional attacks in cross-dataset transfer.

## Method Summary
The DOT attack operates by first extracting WavLM embeddings from generated speech and a pool of bona fide speech samples. An entropic optimal transport problem is formulated to align the generated speech distribution to the genuine speech distribution, solved using the Sinkhorn algorithm. The barycentric projection is then applied to obtain adversarial embeddings that lie in the distribution of genuine speech. These adversarial embeddings are converted back to audio using a neural vocoder, producing adversarial examples that can fool anti-spoofing systems. The attack is designed to work in a black-box setting without requiring access to the target model's internal parameters.

## Key Results
- DOT attack achieves high equal error rates (EER) across ASVspoof2019 and ASVspoof5 benchmarks
- Attack remains effective after countermeasure fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness
- Cross-dataset transfer shows DOT outperforms several conventional attack methods
- Ablation analysis reveals vocoder overlap with CM training data significantly affects attack strength

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The attack exploits the vulnerability of anti-spoofing systems to distribution-level alignment attacks. By leveraging optimal transport theory, the DOT method can effectively map the distribution of generated speech to that of genuine speech in the embedding space, creating adversarial examples that bypass detection mechanisms. The use of barycentric projection ensures that the resulting adversarial embeddings maintain the statistical properties of genuine speech while preserving the semantic content from the original generated speech.

## Foundational Learning

**Discrete Optimal Transport**: Mathematical framework for comparing and aligning probability distributions; needed for aligning generated and genuine speech distributions; quick check: verify Wasserstein distance computation between distributions

**WavLM Embeddings**: Audio representation model capturing both content and speaker characteristics; needed as intermediate representation for distribution alignment; quick check: ensure embedding dimensionality matches OT requirements

**Entropic Regularization**: Technique for making OT computations tractable through entropy addition; needed to solve large-scale OT problems efficiently; quick check: verify Sinkhorn algorithm convergence

**Barycentric Projection**: Method for mapping points between distributions based on OT coupling; needed to obtain adversarial embeddings in genuine speech space; quick check: validate projection preserves embedding structure

**Neural Vocoder**: Model for converting embeddings back to audio waveform; needed to reconstruct adversarial audio from embeddings; quick check: assess audio quality and intelligibility

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Generated Speech -> WavLM Encoder -> Optimal Transport Solver -> Barycentric Projector -> Neural Vocoder -> Adversarial Audio

Critical path: The optimal transport alignment and barycentric projection stages are critical, as they directly determine the adversarial nature of the output embeddings. Any failure in these steps will result in ineffective attacks.

Design tradeoffs: The choice between computational efficiency and attack strength is balanced through the entropic regularization parameter in OT. Higher regularization leads to faster computation but potentially weaker attacks.

Failure signatures: Low attack success rates indicate issues with either the OT alignment quality or the vocoder's ability to reconstruct meaningful audio from adversarial embeddings. Poor audio quality suggests vocoder-related problems.

First experiments:
1. Verify OT alignment quality by visualizing Wasserstein distance reduction between generated and genuine speech distributions
2. Test barycentric projection by checking if adversarial embeddings maintain statistical properties of genuine speech
3. Validate vocoder reconstruction by comparing audio quality metrics between original and reconstructed speech

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Attack effectiveness may degrade against actively adaptive defenses that detect distribution-level shifts
- Performance uncertainty across different audio processing pipelines using varied feature extraction methods
- Limited validation against production environments with common preprocessing steps like compression and noise addition

## Confidence
High confidence: DOT attack's ability to generate adversarial audio achieving high equal error rates in controlled benchmark settings against standard countermeasures.

Medium confidence: Distribution-level alignment via discrete optimal transport represents a fundamentally powerful attack surface for audio anti-spoofing systems.

Low confidence: Attack will remain effective against actively adaptive countermeasures or in production environments with different processing pipelines.

## Next Checks
1. Test the DOT attack against actively adaptive countermeasures that can detect distribution-level shifts in real-time, measuring attack success rates as the defense continuously updates its detection parameters.

2. Evaluate the attack's effectiveness across different embedding architectures (beyond WavLM) and vocoder types to assess generalizability to various audio processing pipelines.

3. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the attack's robustness to common audio preprocessing steps used in production systems, including compression, noise addition, and resampling, to quantify real-world effectiveness.
