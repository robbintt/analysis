# Scaling Personality Control in LLMs with Big Five Scaler Prompts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.06149
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06149
- **Authors:** Gunhee Cho; Yun-Gyung Cheong
- **Reference count:** 39
- **Primary result:** Big5-Scaler enables controllable Big Five personality expression in LLMs via numeric prompts without training, achieving correlation >0.8 and consistent multi-turn behavior.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Big5-Scaler, a prompt-based framework for conditioning LLMs with controllable Big Five personality traits. The method embeds numeric trait values (0–100) into natural language prompts to enable fine-grained, interpretable personality control without requiring model training or curated data. Evaluation across multiple models and tasks shows that Big5-Scaler reliably induces distinguishable and consistent personality traits, with average identification scores exceeding 40 (out of 100) by LLM-based evaluators and trait alignment correlations above 0.8. The analysis indicates that concise prompts and lower trait intensities (scale 10) yield the best performance, highlighting an efficient approach for scalable personality-aware dialogue agents.

## Method Summary
Big5-Scaler conditions LLMs by embedding explicit numeric trait values (0–100) into natural language prompts containing trait definitions, behavioral descriptions, and assigned numerical intensities. The framework uses three prompt types: Simple (trait-level), Specific (facet-level), and Simspec (both). For each trait, the prompt includes a definition, behavioral description, and numerical value. The method evaluates personality expression through standardized questionnaires (BFI, IPIP-NEO-120, NEO-FFI) and LLM-based evaluators. Multi-turn dialogue consistency is maintained through memory buffers initialized with personality prompts and updated with conversation history. The approach demonstrates proportional scaling (Pearson r > 0.85) and consistent trait expression across dialogue turns.

## Key Results
- Pearson correlation coefficients between assigned trait values and questionnaire scores generally exceed 0.85, demonstrating effective proportional scaling
- PersonaCLR scores of ~0.8 indicate high personality consistency across multi-turn dialogues
- LLM evaluator identification scores exceed 40/100, showing distinguishable personality profiles
- Simple prompts at scale 10 outperform more complex variants across most models and traits
- Neuroticism consistently underperforms due to safety alignment suppressing negative affect expression

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Numerical Trait Embedding in Natural Language Prompts
Embedding explicit numeric trait values (0–100) into natural language prompts enables fine-grained, proportional control over personality expression without model modification. The prompt provides three components per trait: (1) a definition, (2) a behavioral description, and (3) an assigned numerical value. The LLM interprets these numbers as intensity signals and modulates its output accordingly, leveraging the model's instruction-following capacity to translate abstract numbers into behavioral patterns.

### Mechanism 2: Proportional Scaling Through Interpretability of Numeric Ranges
The assigned trait intensity scale creates a predictable, linear relationship between prompt values and expressed personality strength. By varying a single trait value from 0–90 while holding others at 50, and measuring output via standardized questionnaires, the paper demonstrates that LLMs produce proportionally stronger trait expression at higher assigned values. The Pearson correlation coefficient exceeds 0.85 for most configurations.

### Mechanism 3: Memory-Conditioned Dialogue Consistency
Initializing agent memory with the Big5-Scaler personality prompt and updating it with dialogue history maintains trait consistency across multi-turn interactions. Each agent maintains a memory buffer initialized with its personality prompt. At each turn, the agent generates utterances conditioned on current memory, with the utterance appended to both agents' memories. PersonaCLR scores of ~0.8 indicate high consistency.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Big Five Personality Theory (OCEAN)**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework depends on understanding the five dimensions (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) and their 30 facets. Without this, you cannot construct meaningful prompts or interpret evaluation results.
  - Quick check question: If an agent scores high on Openness but low on Agreeableness, would you expect it to enthusiastically debate unconventional ideas or avoid conflict? (Answer: enthusiastically debate—high openness drives intellectual curiosity; low agreeableness reduces harmony-seeking.)

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering for Behavioral Conditioning**
  - Why needed here: Big5-Scaler is fundamentally a prompt design method. Understanding how different prompt structures (simple vs. specific vs. simspec) affect model behavior is critical for effective deployment.
  - Quick check question: Why might a shorter, simpler prompt outperform a detailed, facet-level description for personality control? (Answer: LLMs struggle with verbose prompts; cognitive load may dilute the signal. Concise prompts focus attention on key intensity values.)

- **Concept: Psychometric Evaluation via Standardized Questionnaires**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates personality expression by having LLM agents complete validated instruments (BFI, IPIP-NEO-120, NEO-FFI). Understanding what these measure and their limitations is essential for interpreting correlation coefficients and RMSE values.
  - Quick check question: If an agent achieves Pearson r = 0.95 on Openness correlation but RMSE = 1.8 on human imitation, what does this tell you? (Answer: The agent scales proportionally (high r) but doesn't precisely match specific human profiles (moderate RMSE)—consistent direction, imperfect magnitude calibration.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Prompt Generator -> Agent Memory Buffer -> Dialogue Engine -> Evaluation Pipeline
- **Critical path:** 1. Define trait configuration (5 values, scale n) 2. Select prompt type (start with simple, scale 10) 3. Initialize agent memory with prompt 4. Run dialogue generation (temperature=1.0, top_p=0.8, max_tokens=512) 5. Evaluate via questionnaire completion or LLM-based trait identification
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Scale n: Lower (10) → more reliable interpretation; Higher (100) → finer granularity but potential noise
  - Prompt type: Simple → best for most models; Specific/Simspec → may help for abstract traits like Openness but adds complexity
  - Model selection: Mistral-25B achieved highest trait identification scores; Phi4-14B achieved lowest RMSE. Choose based on whether you prioritize distinguishability or human alignment.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Neuroticism underperformance: All methods struggle; safety alignment likely suppresses negative affect. Expect weak correlation regardless of prompt design.
  - High RMSE on human imitation (~1.8): Full personality replication remains infeasible. Use for approximate persona matching, not precise simulation.
  - Openness correlation drops with simple prompts on LLaMA3-8B (r=0.486): Abstract traits require more explicit behavioral anchoring on some models.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline validation: Implement simple prompt at scale 10 with extreme trait values (0 vs. 10 on all dimensions). Run agents through BFI questionnaire. Verify correlation >0.85 for at least 4/5 traits.
  2. Ablation across prompt types: Compare simple vs. specific vs. simspec on your target model using fixed trait configuration. Measure both correlation (proportionality) and RMSE (accuracy). Expect simple to win on most models.
  3. Multi-turn consistency test: Generate 20-turn dialogues between two agents with contrasting profiles (e.g., high Extraversion/low Agreeableness vs. low Extraversion/high Agreeableness). Evaluate with PersonaCLR or cosine similarity on embeddings. Target >0.75 consistency score.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can adaptive trait representations be integrated into prompt-based frameworks to enable dynamic, context-sensitive personality expression? The framework assumes static personality expression throughout interaction, whereas human personality is often dynamic and context-sensitive. The current Big5-Scaler method relies on fixed numerical values assigned at initialization, lacking a mechanism for the agent to adjust its persona based on conversational context or emotional shifts.

### Open Question 2
Can agent-based simulations using Big5-Scaler reliably validate psychological hypotheses regarding social dynamics? While the paper demonstrates trait consistency, it does not test whether these simulated interactions produce emergent social outcomes (like compatibility) that align with established psychological theory.

### Open Question 3
How can the tension between safety alignment and the expression of Neuroticism be resolved in LLM personality control? Neuroticism induction underperforms because LLMs are typically discouraged from expressing negative affective states due to safety alignment objectives. Current safety training suppresses the outputs required to accurately simulate high Neuroticism.

### Open Question 4
How can multi-trait interaction modeling be incorporated to better capture the correlation between personality dimensions? The current method treats traits as independent numeric inputs, potentially failing to capture the complex, non-linear correlations found in human psychology.

## Limitations
- Neuroticism consistently underperforms across all models due to safety alignment suppressing negative affect expression
- RMSE values (~1.8) indicate approximate human alignment but fall short of precise personality simulation
- Memory-based consistency mechanism remains untested beyond 20-turn dialogues
- Numerical interpretation depends on model's instruction-following capability, which varies across architectures

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core finding that Big5-Scaler enables controllable personality expression via numeric prompts is well-supported by consistent correlation coefficients (>0.85) across multiple models and evaluation methods.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that simpler prompts (scale 10) outperform more complex variants is supported by the data, but specific superiority for certain traits requires further investigation.
- **Medium Confidence:** Multi-turn consistency results are promising but limited to 20-turn dialogues; performance may degrade in longer interactions.
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that this approach scales efficiently compared to training-based alternatives is plausible but not empirically validated.

## Next Checks
1. **Neuroticism Breakage Test:** Systematically test whether different prompt formulations can overcome the Neuroticism suppression effect, or whether this represents an inherent limitation of current LLM safety alignment.
2. **Long-Dialogue Degradation Analysis:** Extend the multi-turn consistency evaluation to 100+ turns to identify the exact point where personality consistency begins to degrade and whether this correlates with specific memory management strategies.
3. **Cross-Architecture Transferability:** Validate whether the optimal prompt configurations (simple format, scale 10) generalize to smaller models (7B and below) and non-transformer architectures, as the current evaluation is limited to 8B-25B parameter models.
