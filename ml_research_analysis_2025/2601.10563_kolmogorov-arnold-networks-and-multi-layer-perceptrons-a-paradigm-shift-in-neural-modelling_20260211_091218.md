# Kolmogorov Arnold Networks and Multi-Layer Perceptrons: A Paradigm Shift in Neural Modelling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.10563
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10563
- **Reference count:** 0
- **One-line primary result:** KANs outperform MLPs in accuracy while reducing computational costs by up to 99% in function approximation and classification tasks.

## Executive Summary
This study compares Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) across three domains: function approximation, time-series prediction, and classification. KANs leverage adaptive spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling efficient representation of complex functions with significantly fewer computations. The research demonstrates KANs' superior performance through reduced Mean Squared Error and FLOPs while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to traditional MLPs.

## Method Summary
The research evaluates KANs versus MLPs using three datasets: synthetic square/cube functions (15 rows), daily minimum temperature time-series (3651 rows with 3-day sliding window), and the Wine classification dataset (178 rows, 13 attributes). KANs employ learnable B-spline activations on edges with residual connections and grid extension capabilities. MLPs use standard fully connected layers with Adam optimizer and grid search for hyperparameters. Performance is measured through MSE for regression tasks, accuracy for classification, and FLOPs for computational efficiency using De Boor's formula for KANs.

## Key Results
- KANs achieved up to 99% fewer FLOPs compared to MLPs in regression tasks while maintaining lower MSE
- Classification accuracy improved by 2.21% on the Wine dataset using KANs
- Grid extension capabilities allow KANs to adapt to input distributions without complete retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Replacing fixed node activation functions with learnable spline-based functions on edges reduces parameter count while improving function approximation accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** KANs compute $\phi(x) = w_b b(x) + w_s \text{spline}(x)$ directly on connections, adapting nonlinearity shape to data distribution rather than forcing through rigid activation shapes.
- **Core assumption:** The target function can be effectively decomposed into a sum of compositional univariate functions.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "adaptive spline-based activation functions"; Section 3.1 describes architecture with modifiable B-splines on edges.
- **Break condition:** Performance may degrade or overfit if the target relationship is highly irregular or lacks compositional structure.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** "Grid Extension" capability allows the model to increase resolution and accuracy without requiring complete weight reset.
- **Mechanism:** KANs utilize a grid of control points for splines. The grid can expand from size $G_1$ to $G_2$ with optimized coefficients $c'_j$ to preserve function shape, enabling "coarse-to-fine" learning.
- **Core assumption:** The underlying function is smooth enough that refining the discretization grid leads to better approximation without catastrophic forgetting.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 2.2 describes grid extension without complete retraining; Equation 2 defines optimization for extending control points.
- **Break condition:** If inputs frequently fall outside trained grid range and grid updates are lagging, the layer defaults to SiLU behavior, potentially losing the KAN advantage.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Reducing complex multivariate problems into ensembles of simpler univariate functions mitigates the curse of dimensionality, resulting in lower FLOPs.
- **Mechanism:** Leveraging Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, the network sums univariate functions $\phi_{q,p}(x_p)$ rather than computing dense matrix multiplications across high-dimensional spaces.
- **Core assumption:** The theoretical decomposition into $2n+1$ terms translates efficiently into practical deep learning architectures without numerical instability.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract highlights "significantly reducing computational costs—achieving up to 99% fewer FLOPs"; Section 4.1 shows drastic FLOP reductions.
- **Break condition:** In cases of extreme multivariate correlation where variables cannot be treated independently, the shallow decomposition might fail.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: B-Splines (Basis Splines)**
  - **Why needed here:** KANs rely on B-splines to model the shape of activation functions. Understanding how control points define a curve is essential for debugging overfitting (too many grid points) or underfitting (too few).
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how changing the "grid size" ($G$) in a B-spline affects the smoothness versus the flexibility of the curve?

- **Concept: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the theoretical justification for the entire architecture. It posits that any multivariate continuous function can be represented by superpositions of univariate functions.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the theorem guarantee that the inner functions required for this representation are smooth and easy to learn?

- **Concept: Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) Analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's primary claim to fame is efficiency measured in FLOPs (Eq. 6). Understanding FLOPs as a proxy for computational cost, not necessarily latency, is crucial for evaluating if KAN is truly faster on specific hardware.
  - **Quick check question:** Based on Equation 6, does increasing the spline degree $K$ or grid size $G$ have a linear or quadratic impact on computational cost?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Edges (The "Neurons") -> Nodes (The "Aggregators") -> Grid (Dynamic control points)
- **Critical path:**
  1. Input Processing: Normalize inputs (crucial, as splines fail if inputs exceed grid range)
  2. Forward Pass: Calculate B-spline basis values → Scale by control points → Add residual activation ($w_b b(x)$)
  3. Grid Update: Monitor input distribution; if inputs exceed range, trigger grid extension logic (Eq. 2) to prevent mode collapse to SiLU
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Grid Size vs. Capacity: Higher grid size = better approximation but higher FLOPs and risk of overfitting
  - Spline Degree ($k$): Higher degree = smoother curves but higher computational complexity
  - Shallow vs. Deep: Practical KANs often go deeper than the theoretical depth 2 to learn features
- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Mode Collapse" to MLP: If inputs consistently fall outside spline grid range, the term $w_b b(x)$ (SiLU) dominates, and the model becomes an inefficient MLP
  - High Variance: If grid size is too high for small datasets, the model may memorize noise
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Replication: Implement the "Square Numbers" experiment. Train an MLP (1 hidden layer) and a KAN. Compare MSE and FLOPs to verify the ~80-99% efficiency gap
  2. Grid Range Stress Test: Feed a KAN input outside its initialized grid range (e.g., values > 1). Observe if grid extension logic activates or if performance degrades
  3. Classification Comparison: Using the Wine dataset, train a KAN and an MLP. Measure parameter count vs. accuracy to see if KAN maintains high accuracy (98.43%) with fewer total parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do KANs retain their superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to MLPs when applied to large-scale, high-dimensional datasets?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions "pave the way for further exploration of KAN's potential in high-dimensional and large-scale applications" in Section 4.3, but experiments were restricted to small datasets
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if spline-based efficiency demonstrated on simple tasks translates to complex, high-dimensional data where grid sizing might become prohibitively expensive
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative benchmark of KANs versus MLPs on standard large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet or CIFAR-100) measuring accuracy and FLOPs

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific performance gains in latency and energy consumption can be achieved by implementing KANs on FPGA hardware compared to GPU implementations?
- Basis in paper: Section 5 states that "Further efficiency gains can be achieved through... FPGA acceleration" for resource-constrained environments
- Why unresolved: The paper measures theoretical computational cost (FLOPs) but does not provide empirical data on actual hardware deployment latency or power consumption for KANs
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical analysis of KAN inference speed (latency) and power draw on FPGA hardware compared to standard GPU executions

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do standard neural network compression techniques degrade the spline-based activation functions of KANs compared to MLP weights?
- Basis in paper: Section 5 suggests that "Further efficiency gains can be achieved through pruning, quantization," but does not implement or test these methods
- Why unresolved: Since KANs rely on learnable spline activation functions rather than fixed weights, it is unknown if standard pruning or quantization methods damage the model's functional approximation capabilities more than they do in MLPs
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying varying levels of pruning and quantization to KANs, followed by evaluation of MSE and accuracy retention

## Limitations

- Limited dataset diversity: Evaluation relies on small synthetic datasets (15 rows for square/cube functions) and standard UCI datasets
- Hyperparameter transparency: Specific KAN configurations used for benchmark results are not fully disclosed, limiting reproducibility
- Scalability concerns: Memory overhead from storing spline control points may offset efficiency gains on resource-constrained devices

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Claims about KANs reducing FLOPs compared to MLPs are supported by quantitative evidence (Table 1) and theoretical justification
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance improvements in classification (2.21% accuracy gain) and regression (lower MSE) are demonstrated but may be dataset-dependent
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that KANs generalize to complex, real-world problems without overfitting or mode collapse requires further validation

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Noise**: Test KANs on noisy real-world datasets (e.g., healthcare or financial time series) to evaluate generalization beyond clean UCI data
2. **Memory Efficiency Analysis**: Measure actual memory usage during training/inference to confirm FLOP reductions translate to practical resource savings
3. **Large-Scale Scaling**: Evaluate KANs on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet or web-scale text) to assess scalability and identify failure modes in high-dimensional spaces
