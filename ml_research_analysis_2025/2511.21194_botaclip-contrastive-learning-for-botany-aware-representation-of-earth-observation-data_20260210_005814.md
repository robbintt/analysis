# BotaCLIP: Contrastive Learning for Botany-Aware Representation of Earth Observation Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.21194
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21194
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Lightweight contrastive alignment of aerial imagery with vegetation relevés injects ecological semantics while preserving foundation model generalization, outperforming both DOFA and supervised baselines across plant, butterfly, and soil tasks.

## Executive Summary
BotaCLIP introduces a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enriches Earth Observation foundation model embeddings with botanical semantics from vegetation relevés. The method aligns high-resolution aerial imagery with species composition data through sigmoid contrastive loss, enhanced by a regularization strategy that prevents catastrophic forgetting of the original foundation model representations. Evaluated on three ecological tasks, BotaCLIP consistently outperforms both the original DOFA model and supervised baselines, with task-specific improvements ranging from +1.8% to +14.9% depending on the strength of the visual-ecological relationship.

## Method Summary
BotaCLIP aligns DOFA foundation model embeddings from RGB orthophotos with vegetation relevé data using a sigmoid contrastive loss. The framework employs a lightweight adapter initialized near identity to preserve DOFA representations while learning domain-specific transformations. A regularization term penalizes deviation from original pairwise similarities, weighted higher for originally similar pairs. The image adapter is trained jointly with a pre-trained Botania tabular encoder, and after training, the tabular branch is discarded while the image adapter outputs serve as enriched embeddings for downstream ecological tasks.

## Key Results
- BotaCLIP improves plant presence prediction by +14.9% TSS over DOFA and +3.9% over supervised baselines
- Butterfly occurrence modeling shows +10.4% Boyce Index improvement, demonstrating transfer to species linked to vegetation composition
- Soil trophic group abundance estimation achieves +1.8% Spearman correlation gain, reflecting weaker visual-ecological signal
- Among BotaCLIP variants, the regularized loss with identity-initialized adapter (BWiAuSclR) consistently outperformed unregularized or MLP-only approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Aligning aerial imagery with vegetation relevés via contrastive learning injects domain-specific ecological semantics into generic EO embeddings.
- **Mechanism**: Paired image–tabular samples are projected into a shared latent space where positive pairs (same location) are pulled together and negative pairs are pushed apart via sigmoid contrastive loss. This forces image embeddings to encode information predictive of species composition without explicit species labels.
- **Core assumption**: Vegetation composition reflects underlying ecological gradients (soil, microclimate, species interactions) that are partially visible in aerial imagery.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "aligns high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés through contrastive learning"
  - [Section 2.2] "paired samples are aligned with a sigmoid contrastive loss (SCL)"
  - [Section 4.1] "butterflies' distributions are tightly linked to host plants and vegetation composition, making this task the clearest demonstration that BotaCLIP embeddings capture transferable ecological interactions"
- **Break condition**: If the relationship between visual features and species composition is weak (e.g., below-ground biodiversity), gains will be marginal. The paper shows only +1.8% improvement for soil trophic groups vs. +14.9% for plants, consistent with this constraint.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Regularization that preserves local similarity structure from foundation embeddings mitigates catastrophic forgetting during domain adaptation.
- **Mechanism**: A regularization term R(θ) penalizes deviation from original DOFA pairwise similarities, weighted higher for originally similar pairs. This constrains the projection to maintain neighborhood geometry while allowing semantic enrichment.
- **Core assumption**: DOFA embeddings already contain meaningful structure (terrain, land cover, texture) that remains useful even if not directly predictive of vegetation.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting"
  - [Section 2.2] "Relying solely on the contrastive loss can lead to catastrophic forgetting... cues captured by DOFA but not strongly linked to vegetation composition (e.g., soil, relief, or anthropogenic patterns) risk being discarded"
  - [Section 4.1] "Among BotaCLIP variants, BWiAuSclR consistently emerged as the best model" (regularized loss vs. unregularized)
- **Break condition**: If λ is too high, adaptation is stifled; if too low, forgetting dominates. Paper uses λ=1 without extensive tuning—sensitivity not reported.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Identity-initialized adapters enable stable, lightweight specialization without destabilizing the pretrained representation.
- **Mechanism**: The image adapter is initialized as identity matrix + small Gaussian noise (variance 10⁻⁴), starting near an identity mapping. This preserves DOFA embeddings at initialization while allowing gradient-based refinement.
- **Core assumption**: Small perturbations around the identity are sufficient to capture domain-specific transformations; large deviations are unnecessary.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [Section 2.2] "This ensures that the adapter starts close to an identity mapping, preserving DOFA embeddings at initialization, while introducing enough noise to break symmetry"
  - [Section 3.1] BotaSP (supervised baseline without this design) underperforms BotaCLIP
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—related work on adapter initialization not cited
- **Break condition**: Assumption: if the domain shift is large, identity initialization may require many epochs or fail to escape local minima. Paper doesn't ablate initialization strategy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Contrastive Learning (CLIP-style)**
  - Why needed here: BotaCLIP uses sigmoid contrastive loss to align image–tabular pairs. Understanding positive/negative pair construction, temperature scaling, and normalization is essential.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why ℓ₂ normalization before computing logits matters for contrastive learning?

- **Catastrophic Forgetting in Transfer Learning**
  - Why needed here: The central motivation is adapting a foundation model without destroying its general representations. The regularization term directly addresses this.
  - Quick check question: Why does gradient descent on contrastive loss alone tend to collapse dimensions irrelevant to the alignment task?

- **Multimodal Representation Spaces**
  - Why needed here: BotaCLIP projects images and tabular data into a shared 768-dim space. Understanding how different modalities can be meaningfully aligned is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: What properties must two modalities share for contrastive alignment to yield useful joint representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Orthophoto (RGB, 100m×100m) → DOFA (frozen ViT) → 768-dim embedding → Image Adapter (Linear 768→768, identity init) → ℓ₂ normalize → Shared embedding space ← Tabular Adapter (Linear 768→768) ← Relevé (species×cover vector) → Botania (MLP, trainable) → 768-dim embedding ← ℓ₂ normalize

- **Critical path**:
  1. Extract DOFA embeddings once (frozen backbone)—no gradients flow here
  2. Pre-train Botania classifier on phytosociological labels (66% top-1, 86% top-3)
  3. Train adapters + Botania jointly with contrastive + regularization loss
  4. After training, discard tabular branch; use image adapter outputs as features

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Frozen vs. fine-tuned backbone**: Freezing DOFA saves ~111M parameters but limits adaptability. Paper claims lightweight adaptation is sufficient—validated on three tasks but not universally proven.
  - **Botania trainable vs. frozen**: Making Botania trainable allows joint adaptation but risks overfitting to the alignment task. Paper uses early stopping (patience=10).
  - **Spatial cross-validation**: 5km buffer prevents leakage but reduces effective training data. Paper uses single fold (k=1) for efficiency.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Embeddings cluster by irrelevant features (e.g., illumination, sensor artifacts): augmentation likely insufficient
  - Performance on butterfly/soil tasks degrades vs. DOFA: regularization too weak, forgetting dominant
  - Training loss plateaus but validation diverges: overfitting to relevé noise—reduce Botania capacity or increase dropout

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Reproduce ablation baseline**: Train MWoAuScl (MLP encoder, no augmentation, plain loss) to establish lower bound. Compare TSS on plant task vs. paper's 0.42±0.00.
  2. **Regularization sweep**: Fix all else, vary λ ∈ {0, 0.1, 1, 10}. Plot plant TSS vs. butterfly BI to observe tradeoff between domain specialization and transfer.
  3. **Identity vs. random init**: Compare image adapter initialized as identity+noise vs. default PyTorch init. Hypothesis: identity init converges faster and more stably; test with learning curve plots.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does incorporating environmental covariates into a tri-modal alignment framework (images, relevés, and covariates) improve ecological prediction performance over the current bi-modal setup?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion states future work includes "exploring tri-modal alignments of images, relevés, and environmental covariates."
- **Why unresolved**: The current BotaCLIP framework and loss function are designed for bi-modal contrastive alignment between orthophotos and vegetation surveys.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative benchmarks showing TSS or Boyce Index improvements on downstream tasks when a third environmental modality is added to the contrastive objective.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the BotaCLIP adaptation framework effectively transfer to non-visual ecological modalities such as plant traits or acoustic data?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion identifies "extending BotaCLIP to other ecological modalities (traits, acoustics)" as a direction for future work.
- **Why unresolved**: The current study validates the framework strictly on visual (aerial imagery) and tabular (species composition) data for specific biological taxa.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Successful application of the contrastive alignment method to acoustic sensor data or trait databases, showing improved performance over unadapted foundation models.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: To what extent do BotaCLIP embeddings generalize to geographic regions or biomes outside the French Alps where the model was trained?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The training and validation data are exclusively sourced from the French Alps (CBNA), yet the method aims to adapt global Earth Observation foundation models.
- **Why unresolved**: While the regularization strategy preserves generic features, the alignment is tuned on a specific regional flora, potentially overfitting the embedding space to local ecological structures.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluation of downstream task performance (e.g., plant presence prediction) using BotaCLIP embeddings on datasets from distinct biogeographic regions (e.g., Boreal or Mediterranean zones) without retraining.

## Limitations
- Task-dependent gains: +14.9% TSS for plants but only +1.8% for soil trophic groups, reflecting reliance on visual-ecological alignment strength
- Regularization strength (λ=1) not systematically tuned, leaving uncertainty about optimal adaptation-generalization balance
- Single spatial fold (k=1) used for cross-validation, limiting statistical robustness of reported improvements

## Confidence
- **High**: Mechanism 1 (contrastive alignment injects domain semantics) — supported by consistent task-specific gains and ablation showing MWoAuScl underperforms
- **Medium**: Mechanism 2 (regularization mitigates catastrophic forgetting) — supported by ablation but no sensitivity analysis on λ
- **Medium**: Mechanism 3 (identity initialization stabilizes training) — design choice documented but not directly ablated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a λ-sensitivity sweep to quantify the tradeoff between specialization (plant TSS) and generalization (butterfly BI/soil ρ).
2. Re-run with k=5 spatial folds to assess variance and robustness of performance improvements.
3. Replace identity initialization with random initialization and compare convergence speed and final task performance to isolate initialization effects.
