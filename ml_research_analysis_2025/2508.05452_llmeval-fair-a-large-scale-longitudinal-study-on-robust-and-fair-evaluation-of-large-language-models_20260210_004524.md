## Executive Summary
This study addresses critical challenges in LLM evaluation: data contamination and leaderboard overfitting. The researchers developed LLMEval-Fair, a dynamic framework featuring a secure 220k-question private bank and LLM-as-a-judge system with 90% human agreement. Over 30 months, they evaluated nearly 60 models across 180k+ data points, revealing that static benchmarks suffer severe contamination (models achieve 54-248 completions vs. 36-179 on private data) while all models converge to a ~90% performance ceiling.

The framework demonstrates exceptional stability through its relative ranking system (variance <2%) and near-perfect human alignment. By comparing model performance on contaminated static benchmarks versus private evaluation data, the study establishes empirical evidence for framework superiority over traditional static benchmarks and Elo-style ranking methods. The results suggest that current LLM capabilities may be approaching a fundamental performance ceiling while highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methodologies.

## Method Summary
LLMEval-Fair employs a secure evaluation framework with three core components: a 220k-question private bank, secure anti-cheating architecture, and LLM-as-a-judge system. The private question bank ensures novel evaluation content inaccessible to training data, while the secure infrastructure prevents unauthorized access. The LLM judges achieve 90% human agreement through standardized criteria. Over 30 months, the framework evaluated nearly 60 models across 180k+ data points, comparing performance on both static benchmarks and private data to quantify contamination effects. The longitudinal design enables tracking of model convergence patterns and relative ranking stability across evaluation periods.

## Key Results
- All evaluated models converge to ~90% performance ceiling regardless of architecture
- Static benchmarks show severe contamination (54-248 completions) versus private data (36-179 completions)
- Relative ranking system demonstrates exceptional stability with <2% variance and near-perfect human alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its multi-layered defense against contamination. The private question bank provides novel evaluation content that cannot be memorized during training, while the secure architecture prevents unauthorized access to evaluation questions. The LLM-as-a-judge system with 90% human agreement ensures consistent and scalable evaluation criteria across the 30-month period. By continuously evaluating models on both static benchmarks and private data, the framework can quantify and mitigate contamination effects while tracking genuine performance improvements. The relative ranking approach normalizes for model differences, revealing stable performance hierarchies despite varying absolute scores.

## Foundational Learning

**Data contamination in LLM evaluation** (why needed: static benchmarks become ineffective as models memorize training data; quick check: compare model performance on benchmark vs. private data)
**Secure evaluation architecture** (why needed: prevents unauthorized access to evaluation questions; quick check: verify anti-cheating measures through security audit)
**LLM-as-a-judge methodology** (why needed: scalable evaluation with human-aligned criteria; quick check: validate 90% human agreement across diverse model types)
**Longitudinal evaluation design** (why needed: tracks model convergence and ranking stability over time; quick check: analyze variance in relative rankings across evaluation periods)
**Performance ceiling identification** (why needed: distinguishes genuine capability limits from contamination effects; quick check: verify ~90% convergence across different model architectures)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Private Question Bank -> Secure Server -> LLM Judge -> Performance Metrics -> Ranking System

**Critical path**: Model submission → Secure evaluation on private data → LLM judge scoring → Performance aggregation → Relative ranking calculation

**Design tradeoffs**: Private data ensures contamination resistance but limits external verification; LLM judges provide scalability but require human alignment validation; relative ranking enables fair comparison but may mask absolute capability differences

**Failure signatures**: Performance gaps between static benchmarks and private data indicate contamination; ranking instability (>2% variance) suggests evaluation inconsistencies; judge disagreement >10% points to criteria misalignment

**First experiments**: 1) Submit test model to verify secure evaluation pipeline functionality; 2) Run side-by-side evaluation on static vs. private data to quantify contamination effects; 3) Compare LLM judge scores with human evaluators on sample questions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Anti-cheating architecture effectiveness cannot be fully verified without public security validation
- LLM-as-a-judge reliability may mask systematic biases despite 90% human agreement
- Private dataset composition cannot be independently verified for comprehensive coverage

## Confidence

**Framework robustness and contamination resistance**: High confidence (supported by 180k+ data points and clear performance gap evidence)
**Performance ceiling convergence**: Medium confidence (extensive data but requires validation across different model types)
**Ranking stability and human alignment**: High confidence (supported by large-scale comparative data across multiple periods)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent third-party security audit of anti-cheating architecture
2. Replicate evaluation framework using independently generated private question bank
3. Perform comprehensive human judge diversity study to validate 90% alignment and identify potential systematic biases
