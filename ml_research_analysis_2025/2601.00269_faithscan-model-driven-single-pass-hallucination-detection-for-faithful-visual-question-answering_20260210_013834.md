# FaithSCAN: Model-Driven Single-Pass Hallucination Detection for Faithful Visual Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.00269
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00269
- Reference count: 40
- FaithSCAN is a single-pass, model-driven framework for detecting faithfulness hallucinations in VQA

## Executive Summary
FaithSCAN presents a novel approach to detecting hallucinations in visual question answering systems by leveraging internal uncertainty signals from vision-language models. The framework processes multiple uncertainty metrics including token-level generation uncertainty, visual patch embeddings, and cross-modal alignment features through branch-wise encoding and uncertainty-aware attention fusion. The method aims to achieve single-pass detection while maintaining high accuracy in identifying faithfulness hallucinations.

## Method Summary
The framework extracts multiple internal uncertainty signals from vision-language models, including token-level generation uncertainty, visual patch embeddings, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are processed through branch-wise encoding and fused using uncertainty-aware attention mechanisms. Supervision for training is generated using a model-based method, though specific implementation details are not provided in the abstract.

## Key Results
- Achieves single-pass hallucination detection in VQA systems
- Leverages multiple internal uncertainty signals from vision-language models
- Uses branch-wise encoding and uncertainty-aware attention fusion for signal processing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by capturing various sources of uncertainty within vision-language models that indicate potential hallucinations. Token-level generation uncertainty reveals inconsistencies in language generation, visual patch embeddings highlight mismatches between visual features and generated responses, and cross-modal alignment features detect discrepancies between visual and textual modalities. By fusing these signals through attention mechanisms, the system can more accurately identify when the model is generating unfaithful or hallucinated responses.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Model Uncertainty**: Understanding different types of uncertainty signals (why needed: forms the basis for hallucination detection; quick check: verify multiple uncertainty sources are captured)
- **Cross-Modal Alignment**: Methods for measuring alignment between visual and textual features (why needed: detects when generated text doesn't match visual input; quick check: validate alignment metrics are meaningful)
- **Attention Fusion Mechanisms**: Techniques for combining multiple uncertainty signals (why needed: enables effective integration of diverse uncertainty sources; quick check: ensure fusion improves over individual signals)
- **Model-Based Supervision Generation**: Methods for creating training labels without human annotation (why needed: enables scalable training data creation; quick check: verify supervision quality)

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Vision-Language Model -> Uncertainty Extraction -> Branch-Wise Encoding -> Attention Fusion -> Hallucination Detection
**Critical Path**: Input image and question flow through V&L model, uncertainty signals are extracted in parallel branches, signals are encoded separately, then fused via attention mechanism for final detection
**Design Tradeoffs**: Single-pass detection offers computational efficiency but may sacrifice some accuracy compared to iterative methods; multiple uncertainty signals increase robustness but add complexity
**Failure Signatures**: High uncertainty in multiple signals simultaneously, misalignment between visual and textual features, inconsistent token-level uncertainty patterns
**First Experiments**: 1) Test individual uncertainty signal performance on benchmark dataset, 2) Evaluate attention fusion effectiveness through ablation studies, 3) Measure computational overhead compared to baseline detection methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The computational overhead of the model-based supervision generation method is unclear
- Specific uncertainty metrics employed are not detailed, raising reproducibility concerns
- Effectiveness of attention fusion mechanism is claimed but not empirically demonstrated

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Framework leverages internal uncertainty signals from vision-language models
- Medium Confidence: Use of token-level generation uncertainty, visual patch embeddings, and cross-modal alignment features
- Low Confidence: Claim of single-pass detection without iterative refinement

## Next Checks
1. Implement the model-based supervision generation method and measure its computational overhead to verify the "single-pass" claim and benchmark against iterative hallucination detection approaches
2. Conduct ablation studies removing each uncertainty signal (token-level uncertainty, visual patch embeddings, cross-modal alignment) to determine whether the attention fusion mechanism provides statistically significant improvements over simpler ensemble methods
3. Test the framework on diverse VQA datasets with varying levels of visual-grounding complexity to evaluate robustness across different types of hallucinations (e.g., object confusion vs. factual errors)
