# Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00475
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: ERI detects that CL methods adapt faster but are less sensitive to a synthetic magenta patch shortcut, indicating reduced shortcut exploitation rather than beneficial transfer.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI) to diagnose shortcut-induced rigidity in continual learning. ERI quantifies whether adaptation is genuinely beneficial or biased toward spurious features by measuring: Adaptation Delay (how quickly accuracy thresholds are reached), Performance Deficit (final accuracy gap on shortcut classes), and Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (sensitivity to a suspected shortcut when masked). In experiments on a two-phase CIFAR-100 benchmark with injected magenta patches as shortcuts, ERI reveals that continual learning methods (SGD, EWC, DER++, GPM) adapt faster than scratch baselines (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on shortcut classes (positive PD) and are less harmed by patch masking (negative SFR_rel). This pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor rather than a helpful shortcut, demonstrating ERI's ability to detect the absence of shortcut exploitation and guide screening for rigidity risks.

## Method Summary
ERI is computed using a two-phase continual learning protocol with CIFAR-100. Phase 1 trains on 8 superclasses without shortcuts, establishing baseline features. Phase 2 trains on 4 new superclasses (2 with 4×4 magenta patches) from either Phase 1 weights (CL methods) or random initialization (Scratch-T2 baseline). ERI consists of three facets: Adaptation Delay (epochs to reach threshold τ=0.6), Performance Deficit (final accuracy gap), and Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (difference in masking delta between CL and scratch). The masking operator replaces the patch region with black pixels to measure shortcut reliance.

## Key Results
- CL methods (SGD, EWC, DER++, GPM) adapt faster than Scratch-T2 baselines (negative AD)
- CL methods achieve slightly lower final accuracy on shortcut classes (positive PD)
- CL methods are less harmed by patch masking than scratch (negative SFR_rel)
- This pattern indicates the magenta patch acted as a distractor rather than a helpful shortcut
- ERI successfully detects the absence of shortcut exploitation in CL models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A two-phase training protocol cleanly separates genuine feature transfer from shortcut exploitation by controlling when the suspected cue appears. Phase 1 trains on cue-free data to establish baseline semantic representations. Phase 2 introduces new classes with a controlled shortcut (magenta patch). By comparing CL models (inheriting Phase 1 weights) against a scratch baseline (random initialization on Phase 2 only), differences in adaptation speed and accuracy can be attributed to prior training effects rather than task difficulty.

### Mechanism 2
Masking the suspected shortcut at test time and measuring the accuracy delta reveals reliance on spurious versus semantic features. A deterministic masking operator removes the shortcut cue (e.g., replacing the patch region with black pixels). Computing ΔM = Acc(patched) - Acc(masked) quantifies the shortcut's contribution: ΔM > 0 indicates shortcut reliance (performance drops when removed), while ΔM < 0 indicates the cue acts as a distractor (performance improves).

### Mechanism 3
Comparing CL models against a scratch baseline isolates the effect of weight inheritance and anti-forgetting mechanisms on adaptation behavior. Scratch-T2 provides a "fresh learner" counterfactual trained only on Phase 2 data. CL models inherit Phase 1 weights and apply regularization (EWC), replay (DER++), or projection constraints (GPM). ERI facets computed relative to Scratch-T2 reveal whether prior training accelerates adaptation (AD), impairs final performance (PD), or amplifies shortcut sensitivity (SFRrel).

## Foundational Learning

- **Catastrophic Forgetting vs. Rigidity Tradeoff**
  - Why needed here: The paper positions shortcut-induced rigidity as the adaptation-side counterpart to catastrophic forgetting. Understanding this duality is essential: anti-forgetting mechanisms protect parameters encoding prior knowledge, but may also entrench shortcut-encoding parameters from earlier tasks.
  - Quick check question: Why might preventing forgetting also prevent discovery of better features on new tasks?

- **Shortcut Features in Deep Learning**
  - Why needed here: ERI diagnoses shortcut exploitation. Without understanding shortcuts—incidental input-label correlations without causal meaning (e.g., texture instead of shape, background artifacts)—interpreting ERI facets is impossible.
  - Quick check question: In a dataset where all "healthy" images come from one hospital and all "disease" images from another, what is the shortcut and how would you detect model reliance on it?

- **Einstellung Effect (Cognitive)**
  - Why needed here: The paper draws an analogy to the cognitive Einstellung effect—prior habits blocking optimal solutions. This framing explains why CL models might preferentially reuse suboptimal features from Phase 1 even when Phase 2 offers better signals.
  - Quick check question: How does the Einstellung analogy explain the difference between "negative AD + positive SFRrel" (rigidity) versus "negative AD + negative SFRrel" (benign transfer)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Phase 1 Training -> Phase 2 Training -> ERI Computation Module -> Shortcut Injection/Masking -> Baseline (Scratch-T2)
- **Critical path**: 1. Train Phase 1 → save checkpoint W1; 2. Initialize Phase 2 from W1 (CL) or random (Scratch-T2); 3. During Phase 2: log accuracy at each effective epoch on patched test set; 4. After Phase 2: evaluate on patched and masked test sets at best validation checkpoint; 5. Compute ERI triplet by comparing CL to Scratch-T2
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Threshold τ: Lower values (0.3) yield more measurements but may capture noise; higher values (0.6) are meaningful but risk "no crossing" events. Paper uses τ=0.6 with smoothing w=3.
  - Patch salience: High-contrast synthetic patches maximize signal but may not generalize to natural shortcuts.
  - Masking operator: Black square is simple but may create edge artifacts; alternatives include inpainting or color-matched replacement.
  - Effective epoch normalization: Counting only real T2 samples (not replay) ensures fair comparison across methods.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - No threshold crossing (hatched cells in Fig. 4): Model never reaches τ; AD undefined. Indicates severe rigidity (DGR in paper) or insufficient budget.
  - Large positive PD with negative SFRrel: CL underperforms scratch but is less harmed by masking—suggests different (possibly more robust) features, not shortcut rigidity.
  - High SFRrel variance across seeds: Noisy patch effect; may require larger samples or different patch designs.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate masking operator neutrality: Train on Phase 2 WITHOUT patch; evaluate original vs. masked. Expect Δ≈0. If not, masking introduces artifacts—redesign.
  2. Establish Scratch-T2 baseline: Run multiple seeds; verify patch is helpful (ΔS > 0) or harmful (ΔS < 0). If ΔS ≈ 0, patch is not a shortcut—setup invalid.
  3. Single CL ablation (SGD): Run naive fine-tuning; compute full ERI. Interpret triplet: AD<0 + PD≈0 + SFRrel>0 (when ΔS>0) suggests rigidity; SFRrel<0 (as in paper) indicates distractor effect. Calibrate expectations before testing complex methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does ERI effectively diagnose rigidity caused by subtle, naturally occurring artifacts, or is its utility limited to synthetic, high-salience cues? Current experiments only validate ERI using a deterministic magenta patch, which may not reflect the complexity of real-world spurious correlations.

### Open Question 2
Can ERI metrics be operationalized as a feedback mechanism to actively regularize training and mitigate rigidity? The paper establishes ERI as a purely diagnostic tool but does not explore how to use the index to alter the training dynamics to correct the detected rigidity.

### Open Question 3
Can proxy masking techniques (e.g., attribution-guided deletion) robustly estimate ERI when the specific shortcut feature is unknown? The core ERI methodology relies on a known masking operator; while proxies are suggested, their reliability and potential to introduce bias are untested.

## Limitations
- Generalizability uncertainty to natural shortcuts with subtler statistical correlations
- Reliance on synthetic, high-salience magenta patch may overstate effects relative to real-world artifacts
- Scratch-T2 baseline validity depends critically on hyperparameter matching

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of ERI computation (AD, PD, SFRrel) and the masking delta interpretation are well-defined and mathematically sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: The interpretation that negative SFRrel indicates reduced shortcut sensitivity (rather than reduced reliance) is valid for harmful shortcuts but requires careful context-specific interpretation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that CL methods show rigidity (faster adaptation but lower final accuracy) is supported for this specific synthetic shortcut but may not generalize to beneficial shortcuts.

## Next Checks

1. **Masking Operator Validation**: Verify that masking the patch on Phase 2 data WITHOUT shortcuts yields ΔM ≈ 0. If not, redesign the masking operator to avoid introducing artifacts that confound shortcut reliance measurements.

2. **Baseline Consistency Check**: Run multiple Scratch-T2 seeds with the same hyperparameters as CL methods. Confirm that ΔS (scratch masking delta) is consistently positive (shortcut helpful) or negative (shortcut harmful) before interpreting SFRrel.

3. **Shortcut Variation Test**: Replace the magenta patch with alternative shortcuts (e.g., background color, texture patches, or natural artifacts) and verify that ERI detects different rigidity patterns. This validates robustness to shortcut type and salience.
