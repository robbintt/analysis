# Co-Designing a Knowledge Graph Navigation Interface: A Participatory Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.00907
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00907
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Participatory design with doctoral students yielded a prototype knowledge graph interface featuring profiles, recommendations, and simplified layouts for academic navigation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a participatory design approach to creating a user-centric navigation interface for complex, multilayered knowledge graphs in academic settings. Through workshops with 15 PhD students in an interdisciplinary program, the authors identified critical usability challenges and co-created design solutions including user profiles, tailored recommendations, simplified network layouts, and knowledge cards. The resulting prototype incorporates these recommendations but remains untested with end-users. The study demonstrates that involving end-users throughout the design process leads to more intuitive and effective knowledge graph interfaces, particularly for academic communities.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted hybrid participatory design workshops with 15 doctoral students (8 in-person, 7 online) from an interdisciplinary PhD program. Participants evaluated existing graph tools through voting exercises and discussions, then proposed design features addressing identified pain points. The knowledge graph schema includes 12 dimensions describing Person entities and their affiliations, stored in a Neo4J database. A Figma prototype was developed incorporating six key design recommendations, though the prototype remains untested with end-users.

## Key Results
- Participatory workshops successfully identified critical usability issues in existing graph tools
- Students proposed profile-based filtering to reduce multilayer graph complexity
- Knowledge cards and simplified layouts were recommended to address "hairball effect" in dense networks
- Prototype interface features user profiles, tailored recommendations, search functionality, color-coded nodes, and temporal display options

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Participatory design with end-users surfaces tacit knowledge needs that isolated design approaches miss.
- Mechanism: Faculty-free workshops + iterative feedback loops → honest disclosure of pain points → design decisions anchored in lived experience → higher relevance and trust.
- Core assumption: Users will share genuine needs only when power dynamics are minimized and anonymity is protected.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "participatory approach successfully identified critical usability issues and design improvements"
  - [section 5] "Creating a faculty-free, open forum for students (with measures for anonymity) encouraged honest input regarding pain points"
  - [corpus] "Co-Designing with Multiple Stakeholders and Datasets" shows multi-stakeholder collaboration surfaces community-specific requirements (FMR=0.39, weak direct evidence)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Profile-based filtering reduces multilayer graph complexity to cognitively manageable views.
- Mechanism: User-declared interests + program progress stage → recommendation engine filters graph categories → reduced node count → lower visual overwhelm.
- Core assumption: Users can accurately self-assess their interests and stage, and these remain relatively stable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "user profiles, tailored recommendations, search functionality, and simplified network layouts"
  - [section 4.1, Recommendation 1] "This feature would allow the recommendation of the most relevant results from the graph, which was suggested as a way to reduce graph visualization complexity"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge cards with summarized node information reduce "hairball effect" confusion.
- Mechanism: Aggregate node statistics (e.g., dissertation counts, collaboration patterns) into card format → hide edge complexity until requested → support progressive disclosure.
- Core assumption: Users primarily need summary-level information before exploring relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "knowledge cards, color-coded nodes, and temporal display options"
  - [section 4.1, Recommendation 4] "Li et al. [20] recommend minimizing the display of complex network structures...propose using knowledge cards to present summarized information about nodes"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multilayer/Multiplex Knowledge Graphs**
  - Why needed here: The system models 12 dimensions of person-affiliation relationships; understanding that the same nodes exist across layers is prerequisite to navigation design.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a "Person" node might appear differently across research-area, methodological, and departmental layers?

- **Concept: Participatory Design Methodology**
  - Why needed here: The entire approach hinges on co-design with end-users; distinguishing it from user-testing-after-build is critical.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between showing users a prototype for feedback vs. involving them in ideation from the start?

- **Concept: Hairball Effect in Network Visualization**
  - Why needed here: The core problem this paper addresses; without understanding why dense graphs become unreadable, design recommendations lack context.
  - Quick check question: Why does increasing node count in a force-directed layout eventually reduce comprehension?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Graph database (Neo4J) → User profile module → Recommendation engine → Predefined query library → Visualization layer → Temporal display module

- **Critical path:**
  User creates profile → system filters relevant subgraph → user browses knowledge cards or runs predefined query → user drills into relationships → temporal view shows pathway evolution

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Completeness vs. cognitive load: Showing all 12 layers creates hairballs; filtering loses serendipitous discovery
  - Exploration vs. efficiency: Open-ended browsing vs. predefined queries serve different curiosity types
  - Faculty insight vs. student candor: Including faculty enriches data but may suppress honest student feedback

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Users default to search-only, ignoring graph view (suggests visualization adds no value)
  - Profile fields remain empty (suggests motivation or clarity gap)
  - Color legend consulted repeatedly (suggests over-complex coding)
  - Temporal animation never used (suggests feature misalignment with tasks)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. A/B test: Full filtered subgraph vs. knowledge-card-only view for "find potential supervisor" task; measure time-to-answer and confidence
  2. Profile completion rate tracking: Test whether progress-check automation (vs. manual entry) increases engagement
  3. Temporal animation comprehension test: Show graph-evolution animation to 5 users; ask them to describe what changed and why; identify comprehension failure points before broader rollout

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed interface prototype perform regarding usability and task completion when evaluated with a fully functional backend?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 4.2 that "the prototype has not yet been developed into a fully functional one, which would allow us to evaluate it with end users."
- Why unresolved: The current study relies on a Figma design and participatory feedback rather than quantitative performance data or user testing of a working system.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from a formal usability study (e.g., task success rates, error rates) using a deployed version of the interface connected to the live graph database.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does integrating Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) influence user trust and query accuracy in a scholarly knowledge context?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.2 outlines the aim to "observe how users trust, refine, and contribute to an AI-augmented graph" following the integration of GraphRAG workflows.
- Why unresolved: While the authors plan to use GraphRAG to mitigate hallucinations and aid natural language queries, the actual impact on user trust in this specific academic domain remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Qualitative analysis of user sessions and trust metrics comparing standard graph navigation with the proposed GraphRAG-enhanced query interface.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What new interface heuristics are necessary to ensure transparency and effective feedback in AI-augmented knowledge graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in Section 4.2 the need to "find new heuristics for transparency, feedback, and continual graph curation in scholarly knowledge-work interfaces."
- Why unresolved: Existing design heuristics for static graphs may not sufficiently address the dynamic, generated nature of LLM-based summaries and relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validated set of design principles derived from iterative participatory design sessions focusing on AI-transparency features.

## Limitations
- Prototype validation gap: The participatory design process successfully identified user needs, but the proposed interface remains untested with end-users
- Data scope limitation: The system is designed for a single interdisciplinary PhD program; generalizability to other academic or professional contexts is unproven
- Temporal feature uncertainty: While temporal display was recommended, its practical utility for academic navigation tasks has not been evaluated

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Participatory design effectively surfaces usability issues and design improvements (supported by direct evidence from student workshops and multiple similar studies)
- **Medium Confidence:** Profile-based filtering and knowledge cards will reduce complexity (theoretically sound but untested with the proposed prototype)
- **Low Confidence:** Specific design recommendations (color coding, grid layout, temporal animation) will improve navigation (based on student preference but not validated through task completion studies)

## Next Checks
1. **A/B Task Performance Test:** Compare the proposed prototype against existing graph tools on realistic academic navigation tasks (finding supervisors, identifying collaborators, tracking research trends); measure completion time and accuracy
2. **Longitudinal Engagement Study:** Deploy the system with new PhD cohorts over a full academic year; track profile completion rates, feature usage patterns, and correlation with academic milestones
3. **Cognitive Load Assessment:** Use eye-tracking and think-aloud protocols during graph navigation; identify specific pain points in the proposed grid layout and knowledge card interactions before full implementation
