# Agent-centric learning: from external reward maximization to internal knowledge curation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.22255
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22255
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: Introduces representational empowerment as a meta-objective for agent-centric learning, shifting focus from external reward maximization to internal knowledge curation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces representational empowerment, a new perspective on agent-centric learning that shifts focus from maximizing external rewards to curating internal knowledge structures. The key idea is that an agent's adaptability and "preparedness" for future challenges can be enhanced by maximizing control over its own evolving representations, rather than focusing solely on environmental control. The authors propose a meta-level curator that maintains a library of symbolic programs (e.g., melodies) and selects integration actions guided by representational empowerment. This framework balances diversity (potential to transform representations) and controllability (predictable outcomes of modifications). While no formal experiments are presented, the paper provides a theoretical framework and example that suggests representational empowerment could lead to more adaptable agents by focusing on internal knowledge curation rather than external task completion.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a two-level system for agent-centric learning: a curator that maintains and optimizes a knowledge library of symbolic programs, and an executor that uses this library to solve specific tasks. The curator selects integration actions to maximize representational empowerment, defined as the mutual information between modification operations and resulting representations. This creates a balance between representational diversity and controllability. The framework operates by having the curator observe accumulated knowledge and select actions (like selection, crossover, mutation, abstraction) to optimize empowerment, while the executor adapts this knowledge for task completion. The approach uses symbolic programs to enable interpretable operations and functional distance metrics to measure representational similarity.

## Key Results
- Proposes representational empowerment as a meta-objective: RepEmp(Zk) = H(Z'k | Zk) - H(Z'k | Zk, ωk)
- Introduces a two-level architecture separating knowledge curation from task execution
- Illustrates approach with melodic program library example showing how empowerment guides selection of diverse and controllable representations
- Theoretical framework suggests focusing on internal knowledge curation may lead to more adaptable agents
- No formal experiments presented; validation remains conceptual

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Diversity-Controllability Decomposition
Maximizing mutual information between operations and outcomes naturally balances representational diversity against transformation uncertainty. The decomposition RepEmp(Zk) = H(Z'k | Zk) − H(Z'k | Zk, ωk) rewards libraries that can transform into many distinct forms while penalizing unpredictable modifications. This captures both "how many outcomes are possible" and "how predictable outcomes are given inputs."

### Mechanism 2: Meta-Level Curation with Task-Level Execution
Separating library curation from task execution enables amortized learning across task sequences. The curator maintains Zk and selects integration actions to maximize RepEmp, while the executor uses Zk to solve specific tasks via bounded operation sequences followed by policy optimization. This separation allows knowledge to be optimized for empowerment (diverse and controllable) rather than any specific task distribution.

### Mechanism 3: Regularized Diversity via Operation Set Constraints
The choice of modification operations Ω implicitly defines what constitutes useful diversity. Operations (crossover, mutation, abstraction, selection) constrain reachable representation space, and empowerment is measured only over transformations the agent can actually perform. The operation set captures cognitively meaningful transformations, though a poorly designed Ω can make bad libraries appear empowered.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Mutual Information and Channel Capacity**
  - Why needed here: Representational empowerment is formally defined as maximum mutual information between action sequences and resulting representations
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why I(X;Y) = H(Y) − H(Y|X) captures both "how many outcomes are possible" and "how predictable outcomes are given inputs"?

- Concept: **Meta-Reinforcement Learning**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames curator/executor in meta-RL terms where curator learns across tasks and executor adapts to specific tasks
  - Quick check question: How does MAML's approach of learning an initialization differ from learning a library of programs that maximize empowerment?

- Concept: **Symbolic Program Induction**
  - Why needed here: The paper argues representations should be symbolic programs to support interpretable operations like composition and abstraction
  - Quick check question: Why would crossover and mutation be more meaningful on symbolic programs than on neural network weights?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Knowledge Library Zk -> Curator -> Operation Set Ω -> RepEmp Calculator -> Executor -> Task τk+1
- Critical path: 1) Agent completes task τk, gains candidate knowledge Ẑk; 2) Curator evaluates integration actions by computing RepEmp for each candidate library via simulated T-step rollouts; 3) Curator selects action maximizing RepEmp → updated Zk; 4) New task τk+1 arrives; executor adapts Zk via short operation sequence → Zk⋆; 5) Executor uses Zk⋆ for task completion, possibly interleaving further tuning
- Design tradeoffs: Symbolic vs neural representations (interpretable vs expressive), library size vs empowerment (diversity vs computational cost), rollout horizon T (empowerment capture vs computation), functional vs syntactic metrics (robust vs fast)
- Failure signatures: Universal program trap (converges to single flexible but uncontrollable program), metric collapse (poor distance metric makes all libraries appear equally empowered), operation set mismatch (Ω lacks needed operations), curator-executor misalignment (what curator finds empowering doesn't help executor)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Implement melodic program example exactly as described; verify RepEmp(ZB) > RepEmp(ZA) and ZB preferred over ZC despite lower raw diversity; 2) Create multi-task benchmark where tasks share abstract structure; compare RepEmp-guided curation against: (a) no curation, (b) random curation, (c) task-performance-only curation; 3) Test sensitivity to operation set Ω by varying available operations; measure how correlation between RepEmp and task performance changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can we learn or define robust (pseudo-)metrics in representation space that accurately capture functional similarity between programs for computing representational empowerment? The framework's effectiveness is sensitive to the (pseudo-)metric used to measure distance in the representation space, which is important for computing entropy terms. Syntactic metrics are easier to compute but may not capture task-relevant similarity.

### Open Question 2
Can the set of representational modification operations Ω be learned dynamically rather than predefined, and does co-evolving Ω with the knowledge library Zk improve adaptability? One direction is to treat the set of operations not as fixed, but as a dynamic, learnable component that co-evolves with the primary knowledge library Zk.

### Open Question 3
Does maximizing representational empowerment actually improve few-shot adaptation to genuinely novel tasks compared to standard meta-learning or intrinsic motivation approaches? The core claim that RepEmp leads to better "preparedness" remains untested without formal experiments comparing against MAML, curiosity-driven exploration, or other baselines.

## Limitations
- No formal experiments or empirical validation presented; all claims supported by abstract examples and theoretical arguments
- Framework is highly sensitive to implementation details, particularly the choice of operation set Ω and distance metrics, which are underspecified
- Computational challenges with entropy estimation for large libraries not addressed, though critical for practical implementation
- No comparative evaluation against standard meta-learning approaches or other intrinsic motivation methods

## Confidence

- Core mechanism (diversity-controllability decomposition): Medium - mathematical formulation is sound but lacks empirical validation
- Curator-executor separation architecture: Medium - plausible but untested design
- Sensitivity to implementation details: Low - critical aspects like Ω and distance metrics are underspecified
- Computational feasibility: Low - entropy estimation approach appears challenging for large libraries with no alternatives discussed

## Next Checks

1. Implement the melodic program example with exact specifications to verify RepEmp calculations match stated values
2. Create a multi-task benchmark testing whether RepEmp-guided curation outperforms alternatives on downstream task performance
3. Systematically test how different operation sets Ω affect the correlation between RepEmp and actual task success
