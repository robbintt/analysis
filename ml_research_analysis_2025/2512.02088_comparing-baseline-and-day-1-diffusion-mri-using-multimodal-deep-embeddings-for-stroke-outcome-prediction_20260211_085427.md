# Comparing Baseline and Day-1 Diffusion MRI Using Multimodal Deep Embeddings for Stroke Outcome Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.02088
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02088
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** J1 (24-hour) multimodal models achieved AUC = 0.923 ± 0.085, outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC ≤ 0.86) for predicting three-month functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke.

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value compared to baseline imaging for predicting three-month functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke. Using a multimodal framework that combines 3D ResNet-50-derived ADC embeddings with clinical variables and lesion-volume features, the J1 (24-hour) models achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 ± 0.085), significantly outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC ≤ 0.86). Principal Component Analysis effectively reduced dimensionality for stable classification with linear SVMs. Key predictors included motor NIHSS subscores, age, and specific MRI-derived features.

## Method Summary
The study used 74 patients with paired ADC scans at baseline (J0) and 24-hour (J1) timepoints. A 3D ResNet-50 (MedicalNet, frozen) extracted 2048-D embeddings from ADC volumes, which were concatenated with clinical variables and log-transformed lesion volume. PCA reduced embeddings to ≤12 components (>95% variance), and linear SVM (C=0.1, class-balanced, Platt scaling) performed binary classification of three-month functional outcomes (mRS ≤ 1 vs > 1). Eight-fold StratifiedGroupKFold cross-validation was used for evaluation.

## Key Results
- J1 multimodal models achieved highest performance (AUC = 0.923 ± 0.085), significantly outperforming J0 configurations (AUC ≤ 0.86)
- Multimodal fusion improved performance over single-modality models, with MRI-only achieving AUC = 0.901 ± 0.085
- Key predictors included motor NIHSS subscores, age, and specific MRI-derived embeddings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Post-treatment (J1) ADC imaging provides stronger prognostic signal than baseline (J0) because it captures tissue response dynamics unavailable at admission. J1 imaging reflects infarct evolution, reperfusion success, collateral flow status, and secondary injury processes that manifest within 24 hours. Baseline ADC only shows the initial infarct core without treatment response information.

### Mechanism 2
Multimodal fusion of deep MRI embeddings with clinical variables and lesion-volume features creates complementary predictive pathways. Clinical variables capture systemic and neurological baseline status, deep embeddings capture latent tissue-level patterns, and lesion-volume features provide explicit infarct-size quantification. Linear SVM coefficients show motor NIHSS and MRI features contribute independently.

### Mechanism 3
PCA-based dimensionality reduction stabilizes training on small datasets by eliminating embedding redundancy before classification. 3D ResNet-50 produces 2048-D embeddings with substantial redundancy. PCA projects to ≤12 orthogonal components retaining >95% variance, enabling stable linear SVM convergence. Without PCA, the authors report "unstable convergence and large variance."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) as ischemic tissue marker**
  - Why needed here: ADC maps quantify water diffusion restriction in ischemic tissue; lower values indicate cytotoxic edema from acute injury.
  - Quick check question: Why would ADC values decrease in acute stroke, and why might they change between J0 and J1?

- **Concept: Transfer learning with 3D medical pretrained networks**
  - Why needed here: The authors use MedicalNet-pretrained ResNet-50; understanding why pretrained weights help is critical for reproducing results.
  - Quick check question: What is the risk of using a network pretrained on a different organ/modality for ADC feature extraction?

- **Concept: Stratified group cross-validation**
  - Why needed here: With 74 patients, proper validation prevents data leakage and ensures class balance across folds.
  - Quick check question: Why use stratified group K-fold instead of simple random K-fold for this dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** ADC Volume (24×256×256) → 3D ResNet-50 (frozen, MedicalNet) → Global Avg Pool → 2048-D embedding → Concatenate with Clinical vars + Lesion volume → PCA (≤12 comps) → Linear SVM

- **Critical path:** ResNet embedding quality → PCA component selection → SVM regularization (C=0.1). The frozen backbone means performance depends heavily on pretrained feature relevance.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Frozen vs. fine-tuned ResNet: Frozen enables small-sample stability but may sacrifice domain-specific features
  - Linear SVM vs. nonlinear: Linear provides interpretability (coefficient inspection) but may miss complex interactions
  - 12 PCA components: Chosen empirically; fewer components risk underfitting, more risk instability

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High cross-fold variance in AUC (e.g., J0 MRI-only SD=0.263) suggests insufficient signal or overfitting
  - If SVM coefficients show only clinical features with near-zero MRI weights, embedding extraction is failing
  - Large train-validation gap indicates overfitting despite PCA

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation by modality:** Train MRI-only, clinical-only, and multimodal configurations to quantify each modality's marginal contribution
  2. **PCA component sweep:** Test 4, 8, 12, 16 components to validate that 12 is optimal for this dataset size
  3. **J0 vs. J1 head-to-head:** With identical pipelines, confirm J1 advantage is not an artifact of feature processing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Does the superior performance of the J1 multimodal framework generalize to large, multicenter cohorts with heterogeneous scanner protocols?**
   - Basis: Authors plan to test framework in larger cohorts and validate on multicenter longitudinal data
   - Why unresolved: Current single-center sample (n=74) may not capture variance in acquisition protocols across different hospitals
   - Evidence needed: Replication of high AUC (>0.90) on external datasets with different MRI vendors and field strengths

2. **Does replacing intensity-threshold segmentation with advanced methods improve the stability of lesion-volume features?**
   - Basis: Authors list "automated lesion segmentation" as a limitation and plan to explore better segmentation
   - Why unresolved: Current method relies on simple percentile-based intensity thresholds (480 and 620 ×10−6 mm2/s) which may be sensitive to noise
   - Evidence needed: Comparative study showing reduced variance in model performance with deep learning-based lesion segmentation

3. **Can stable anatomical activation patterns be derived from the deep embeddings if the dataset size is increased?**
   - Basis: MRI-derived embeddings "do not yield stable anatomical activation patterns, likely due to the small dataset"
   - Why unresolved: High dimensionality of 3D ResNet embeddings relative to sample size may prevent learning consistent spatial features
   - Evidence needed: Saliency maps or activation clustering from a larger cohort showing consistent localization to specific stroke territories

## Limitations

- Modest sample size (n=74) from single institution limits generalizability
- Frozen ResNet-50 backbone prevents adaptation to stroke-specific imaging patterns
- PCA dimensionality reduction may discard discriminative low-variance components
- Key implementation details (grouping key, clinical variable schema) remain unspecified

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** J1 imaging advantage (AUC = 0.923 vs J0 ≤ 0.86) is well-supported by direct comparisons and consistent with stroke pathophysiology
- **Medium Confidence:** Multimodal complementarity claim rests on SVM coefficient analysis showing clinical and imaging features contribute independently
- **Medium Confidence:** PCA's stabilizing role is reported but lacks external validation beyond this dataset

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study Replication:** Reproduce MRI-only, clinical-only, and multimodal configurations to quantify each modality's marginal contribution and validate complementarity
2. **PCA Component Sensitivity:** Test 4, 8, 12, and 16 PCA components to confirm 12 is optimal and discriminative signal isn't being lost
3. **External Dataset Validation:** Apply trained model to independent stroke cohort to assess generalizability and confirm J1 advantage isn't dataset-specific
