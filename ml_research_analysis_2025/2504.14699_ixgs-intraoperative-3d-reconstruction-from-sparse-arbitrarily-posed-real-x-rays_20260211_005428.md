# IXGS-Intraoperative 3D Reconstruction from Sparse, Arbitrarily Posed Real X-rays

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.14699
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14699
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Adapts Gaussian splatting for 3D reconstruction from sparse, arbitrarily posed real intraoperative X-rays with clinical utility for navigation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents IXGS, a framework for 3D volumetric reconstruction of anatomy from sparse, arbitrarily posed intraoperative X-rays. The approach adapts Gaussian splatting by replacing circular-orbit initialization with random sampling, enabling reconstruction from non-standard acquisition trajectories common in surgery. A key innovation is an anatomy-guided radiographic standardization step using style transfer to bridge the domain gap between real X-rays and synthetic Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs). The method requires no pretraining and can adapt to new patients, with expert surgical evaluation confirming clinical utility for navigation using 20-30 views. The work demonstrates the feasibility of instance-based volumetric reconstruction from arbitrary sparse-view X-rays, advancing intraoperative 3D imaging for surgical navigation.

## Method Summary
The IXGS framework extends R2-Gaussian splatting with an anatomy-guided radiographic standardization step using style transfer to improve visual consistency across views and enhance bone structure visibility. The method takes raw X-rays and calibration poses as input, processes them through a Pix2Pix GAN to create standardized domain images resembling bone-enhanced DRRs, then performs Gaussian splatting optimization with random initialization (since FDK is inapplicable for arbitrary poses). The framework optimizes Gaussian kernels within a normalized volume using a loss combining L1, SSIM, and total variation. No pretraining is required, enabling adaptability to new patients and anatomies. The resulting volume is voxelized and thresholded for clinical review.

## Key Results
- Expert surgical evaluation confirmed clinical utility for navigation with 20-30 views
- Quantitative benchmarking showed PSNR/SSIM improvements over raw real X-rays
- Reconstruction from arbitrary poses achieved comparable quality to synthetic circular-orbit data
- Style transfer preprocessing significantly improved reconstruction quality over raw X-rays
- Framework successfully reconstructed 5 of 6 ex-vivo specimens to acceptable clinical standards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Preprocessing real X-rays via style transfer bridges the domain gap to synthetic Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs), enabling the optimization to converge on anatomically coherent structures.
- **Mechanism:** A Pix2Pix GAN maps raw inputs ($I_{real}$) to a standardized domain ($I_{ST}$) that mimics the appearance of bone-enhanced DRRs ($I_{DRR}$). This normalizes intensity variations (kVp/mAs) and suppresses noise/artifacts that would otherwise cause the Gaussian primitives to overfit to imaging noise rather than anatomy.
- **Core assumption:** The reconstruction network performs significantly better on noise-free, standardized "synthetic-style" inputs than on raw clinical fluoroscopy.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "We introduce an anatomy-guided radiographic standardization step using style transfer, improving visual consistency across views, and enhancing reconstruction quality."
- **Break condition:** If the style transfer removes pathological textures (e.g., subtle fractures) present in $I_{real}$ but absent in the DRR training target ($I_{DRR}$), the 3D reconstruction will lose clinical utility despite improved visual metrics.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Replacing analytical initialization with random sampling allows 3D reconstruction from arbitrary (non-circular) acquisition trajectories.
- **Mechanism:** Standard frameworks like $R^2$-Gaussian rely on Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithms for initialization, which assume circular orbits. IXGS uses random initialization of Gaussian kernels within the normalized volume $[-1, 1]^3$, allowing the gradient descent to converge from sparse, unconstrained viewpoints.
- **Core assumption:** The optimizer can resolve the global structure from sparse views without a strong prior provided by FDK initialization.
- **Evidence anchors:** [methods] "In contrast to $R^2$-Gaussian... which initializes kernels with the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm, our IXGS approach requires random initialization due to the non-circular and arbitrary acquisition poses."
- **Break condition:** If the number of input views is too low (<20) or the angular coverage is too sparse, random initialization may fail to converge or result in "cloudy" artifacts in unconstrained regions.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Scaling the 3D density of Gaussian kernels by a view-dependent factor ($\mu$) rectifies integration bias, allowing accurate volumetric density reconstruction from 2D projections.
- **Mechanism:** The framework adapts $R^2$-Gaussian's rectification strategy. It transforms 3D Gaussians into ray space and applies a scaling factor $\mu = \sqrt{2\pi|\tilde{\Sigma}|/|\hat{\Sigma}|}$ to the density $\rho$. This accounts for the varying footprints of the Gaussians when projected through the cone-beam geometry.
- **Core assumption:** Accurate density reconstruction requires correcting the variance mismatch between 3D volume integration and 2D pixel accumulation.
- **Evidence anchors:** [methods] "This scaling corrects the integration bias inherent in standard Gaussian splatting projections... yielding the effective 2D density."
- **Break condition:** If camera calibration (poses) is inaccurate, the Jacobian computation for the affine approximation in ray space will be wrong, causing the density scaling to distort the anatomy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Cone-Beam X-ray Geometry & DRRs**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire pipeline relies on differentiating between idealized circular orbits (common in CBCT) and the arbitrary poses of C-arms, and understanding how 3D anatomy projects onto 2D sensors.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm fails when the X-ray source positions do not follow a circular trajectory?

- **Concept:** **Image-to-Image Translation (Pix2Pix)**
  - **Why needed here:** The "anatomy-guided standardization" is not a simple filter; it is a learned mapping. You must understand conditional GANs to debug why the network might hallucinate or erase bone structures.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the Pix2Pix generator differ from a standard autoencoder, and what role does the discriminator play in preserving high-frequency bone details?

- **Concept:** **Differentiable Rendering**
  - **Why needed here:** The IXGS reconstruction is an optimization loop. You need to understand how gradients flow from the 2D rendered image back to the 3D Gaussian parameters (position, covariance, density).
  - **Quick check question:** If the loss function is strictly L1 distance, would you expect the optimization to converge faster or slower than when combining it with SSIM, particularly for structural features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Real X-rays + Calibration Poses -> Pix2Pix GAN (Standardization: $I_{real} \rightarrow I_{ST}$) -> Random Gaussian Initialization -> Differentiable Rasterization -> Loss Calculation (L1 + SSIM + TV) -> Backprop -> Voxelized Density Volume

- **Critical path:** The **style transfer** step. The paper explicitly states that reconstructions from raw real X-rays ($I_{real}$) were "found to be of insufficient quality for clinical usability assessment." If the Pix2Pix model fails to generalize to a new patient's anatomy, the downstream reconstruction is likely to fail.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Speed vs. Generality:** IXGS requires no pretraining (high generality) but takes ~13 minutes to optimize per case (slow), unlike pre-trained networks (e.g., X23D) that are near-instantaneous but rigid.
  - **Views vs. Quality:** The paper identifies a "knee" in the curve at roughly **20-30 views**. Below this, the random initialization struggles to resolve the volume; above this, returns diminish.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"Cloudy" Artifacts:** High-density blobs appearing in areas not covered by input views (unconstrained regions). Solution: Increase view count or tighter volume bounding.
  - **Volume-Axis Misalignment:** The paper notes that slice views are aligned to the reconstruction volume grid, not the patient's anatomical axes. This can confuse surgeons during axial review.
  - **Domain Drift:** If the input X-ray has implants or pathologies not represented in the training data of the style transfer network, they may be smoothed out or distorted in $I_{ST}$.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Standardization Ablation:** Run the pipeline on raw X-rays ($I_{real}$) vs. style-transferred X-rays ($I_{ST}$). Verify that the PSNR drops significantly for raw inputs (Table 1 suggests ~23dB vs ~25dB).
  2. **View Count Sensitivity:** Reconstruct a specimen using 5, 15, 25, and 50 views. Plot the "cloudiness" (artifact density) vs. view count to empirically find the minimum viable views for your hardware setup.
  3. **Pose Robustness:** Feed in "circular" synthetic data vs. "arbitrary" real data. Verify that the random initialization handles both, whereas a baseline FDK-initialized model would fail on the arbitrary set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can reconstruction time be reduced to near-real-time levels suitable for intraoperative workflows using coarse-to-fine strategies or alternative initialization methods?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Discussion states that reconstruction takes approximately 13 minutes and explicitly lists "accelerating reconstruction" and "coarse-to-fine reconstruction strategies for speed" as necessary future work.
- **Why unresolved:** The current 13+ minute latency is a limitation for practical surgical navigation, which requires immediate feedback; current random initialization requires 30k iterations to converge.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstration of the IXGS framework converging to "Acceptable" or "Very Good" clinical ratings in under 60 seconds on the ex-vivo dataset.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the standardization or splatting process be modified to guarantee robustness for outlier cases, such as the specific specimen that failed to reach "Acceptable" ratings regardless of view count?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly identify "outlier cases (like the poorly performing specimen in Section [Results])" as a limitation and list "improving robustness to challenging inputs" as a future research direction.
- **Why unresolved:** The current framework successfully reconstructed most specimens with 20-30 views, but failed on at least one, indicating the method is not yet reliable enough for universal clinical application.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study identifying the specific anatomical or imaging features causing the failure, followed by an algorithmic update that brings the outlier specimen's rating to "Acceptable."

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Do perceptual metrics (e.g., LPIPS) or task-specific metrics correlate more strongly with expert clinical utility ratings than PSNR and SSIM?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper notes that standard metrics like PSNR/SSIM "often correlate poorly with anatomical plausibility" and calls for "developing evaluation metrics that are better correlated with clinical utility."
- **Why unresolved:** The study observed that reconstructions with modest quantitative scores were still rated as clinically usable by surgeons, creating a gap between automated quality assessment and human perception.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis showing a statistically significant higher correlation between expert surgeon Likert scores and a proposed new metric compared to PSNR/SSIM.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Can a calibration-free workflow be implemented that jointly estimates pose and volume from arbitrary X-rays without fiducials?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion lists "developing calibration-free approaches" as a key avenue for future work to reduce procedural complexity.
- **Why unresolved:** The current method relies on fiducial-based calibration to determine camera pose (P), which adds steps (implanting fiducials, inpainting) that are often impractical in a sterile, time-constrained operating room.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful reconstruction of the lumbar spine from arbitrary X-rays using pose estimation, achieving accuracy comparable to the fiducial-based method without external markers.

## Limitations

- **Time-intensive optimization:** Reconstruction takes approximately 13 minutes per case, limiting intraoperative applicability without speed improvements.
- **Domain shift risk:** Style transfer may remove clinically relevant details (pathologies, implants) not present in the DRR training target, potentially compromising clinical utility.
- **Robustness to outliers:** The framework successfully reconstructed 5 of 6 specimens but failed on at least one regardless of view count, indicating incomplete reliability for universal clinical application.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The mechanism for random initialization replacing FDK for arbitrary poses (Mechanism 2) is well-supported by the stated geometry limitations.
- **Medium Confidence:** The density scaling factor $\mu$ for rectification (Mechanism 3) is theoretically sound but the practical impact on reconstruction accuracy needs more empirical validation.
- **Medium Confidence:** The style transfer bridging the domain gap (Mechanism 1) is supported by qualitative improvements in visual metrics but lacks clinical validation for preserving pathological features.

## Next Checks

1. **Clinical Feature Preservation Test:** Run the pipeline on real X-rays containing known pathologies (fractures, implants) and compare the reconstructed volume against the ground truth CT to quantify what anatomical details are lost during style transfer.

2. **View Coverage Analysis:** Systematically vary the angular coverage and number of input views (5, 15, 25, 50) on a single specimen, measuring both 2D rendering quality and 3D artifact density to precisely map the "knee" in the curve beyond which returns diminish.

3. **Cross-Institutional Generalization:** Test the framework on X-ray data from a different hospital system (different C-arm, protocols) without retraining the style transfer network to assess real-world robustness to domain shift.
