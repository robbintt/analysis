# A BERT Based Hybrid Recommendation System For Academic Collaboration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15223
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15223
- Reference count: 27
- Hybrid TF-IDF + BERT recommendation system for academic collaboration with NDCG=0.8587, mAP=0.8275

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines TF-IDF and BERT embeddings to connect academic stakeholders based on skills, domain expertise, and collaboration interests. The system processes user profiles containing professional information, generates hybrid embeddings through simple averaging, clusters profiles using Affinity Propagation, and provides ranked recommendations via cosine similarity. A mobile application was developed with swipe-based matching functionality, achieving strong clustering metrics (Silhouette=0.3383, Davies-Bouldin=1.1052) and ranking performance.

## Method Summary
The system processes academic profiles through a two-stage vectorization pipeline: TF-IDF vectorization on preprocessed text fields (domain and skillset) with stemming, and BERT embeddings using bert-large-uncased with MPNet tokenizer. These vectors are combined via simple averaging to create hybrid embeddings, which are then used to compute cosine similarity matrices. Affinity Propagation clustering operates on these similarity matrices to automatically determine cluster structure, while cosine similarity ranking with preference filters generates the final recommendations. The approach balances lexical precision from TF-IDF with semantic generalization from BERT.

## Key Results
- Hybrid model achieved NDCG of 0.8587 and mAP of 0.8275
- Clustering performance: Silhouette score of 0.3383 and Davies-Bouldin index of 1.1052
- Intra-Cluster Similarity of 0.8053
- Outperformed both TF-IDF-only and BERT-only baselines
- Deployed as mobile app with swipe-based matching interface

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Averaging TF-IDF and BERT vectors produces embeddings that balance lexical precision with semantic generalization
- Core assumption: TF-IDF and BERT contributions to profile similarity are approximately equal
- Evidence: Hybrid averaging explicitly stated; neighbor papers use more complex fusion approaches
- Break condition: If one modality is consistently noisier, fixed averaging may mask superior signal

### Mechanism 2
- Affinity Propagation automatically determines coherent profile clusters without pre-specifying cluster count
- Core assumption: Cosine similarity on hybrid vectors provides meaningful affinity landscape
- Evidence: Affinity Propagation explicitly used on cosine similarity matrix; neighbor papers don't directly compare
- Break condition: Highly overlapping or sparse profiles may produce too many or too few clusters

### Mechanism 3
- Cosine similarity with contextual preference filters produces ranked recommendations aligned with user collaboration intent
- Core assumption: Self-reported collaboration preferences are accurate and stable
- Evidence: NDCG/mAP metrics reported; neighbor papers show filtered approaches improve relevance
- Break condition: Misstated or changing preferences may exclude relevant matches through hard filtering

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **TF-IDF vectorization**
  - Why needed here: Converts profile text into sparse, interpretable term-weight vectors that reward exact skill/keyword overlap
  - Quick check question: Given two profiles with "machine learning" and "ML", will TF-IDF treat them as similar without preprocessing?

- Concept: **BERT contextual embeddings**
  - Why needed here: Produces dense, context-sensitive vectors capturing semantic similarity beyond lexical overlap
  - Quick check question: If two profiles describe the same domain using different terminology, how does BERT ensure their embeddings are close?

- Concept: **Cosine similarity and clustering metrics (Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin)**
  - Why needed here: Quantifies vector alignment for ranking and evaluates cluster compactness/separation for model selection
  - Quick check question: Why might high intra-cluster similarity coexist with low Silhouette score, and what does that imply for recommendation diversity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Profile ingestion -> TF-IDF and BERT vectorization -> Hybrid embedding averaging -> Affinity Propagation clustering -> Cosine similarity ranking with filters -> Mobile app interface
- Critical path: Profile ingestion and preprocessing → Hybrid embedding generation → Similarity matrix computation → Real-time recommendation query per user login
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed averaging vs. learned weighting: Simpler but may not adapt to domain-specific signal variance
  - Affinity Propagation vs. K-means: Automatic cluster count but higher computational cost (O(N²))
  - Hard preference filters vs. soft weighting: Ensures intent alignment but risks over-constraining
- Failure signatures:
  - Cold start: New profiles with sparse data produce low-similarity recommendations; synthetic data mitigation required
  - Noisy inputs: TF-IDF may overemphasize rare but irrelevant terms; BERT may propagate embedding noise from short text
  - Cluster fragmentation: Too many small clusters reduce cross-cluster discovery
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablate hybrid fusion: Run TF-IDF-only and BERT-only baselines; compare NDCG and mAP to quantify fusion gain
  2. Cluster stability test: Vary damping factor in Affinity Propagation; observe cluster count and Silhouette score changes
  3. Filter sensitivity analysis: Remove or soften preference filters; measure recall/diversity impact on top-5 recommendations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the integration of collaborative filtering techniques alongside the current content-based hybrid model affect the long-term accuracy and serendipity of recommendations?
  - Basis: Conclusion explicitly mentions future work on collaborative recommendation techniques
  - Why unresolved: Current system lacks mechanisms to learn from user interactions or temporal changes
  - Resolution evidence: Comparative study measuring NDCG/mAP after longitudinal deployment with interaction data

- Question: Can the system maintain clustering performance when deployed with sparse, real-user data without synthetic augmentation?
  - Basis: Shortcomings section notes cold start problem and synthetic data reliance
  - Why unresolved: High metrics are based on heavily augmented corpus, not representative of live user data
  - Resolution evidence: Performance metrics from live pilot with minimal synthetic data

- Question: Does weighted or learned fusion of TF-IDF and BERT vectors outperform current simple averaging?
  - Basis: Section 3.4 describes simple averaging without examining optimality
  - Why unresolved: Averaging assigns equal importance without empirical justification
  - Resolution evidence: Ablation study comparing averaging against concatenation or attention-based fusion

## Limitations

- Ground truth generation for NDCG/mAP on unlabeled profile data is not explained
- Dataset composition (real vs synthetic profiles) and exact size remain unspecified
- BERT fine-tuning parameters and MPNet tokenizer usage lack clarification
- Fixed averaging assumes equal modality contribution without domain-specific validation

## Confidence

- High confidence: TF-IDF + BERT hybrid architecture concept, clustering methodology, and metric computation procedures
- Medium confidence: Reported metric values are likely accurate but ground truth creation process unclear
- Low confidence: Optimal parameter settings and BERT fine-tuning specifics were not detailed

## Next Checks

1. Generate synthetic academic profiles following the described schema, apply exact preprocessing and hybrid embedding pipeline, verify reported metrics are achievable
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing TF-IDF-only, BERT-only, and hybrid models on same dataset to quantify fusion benefits
3. Test Affinity Propagation sensitivity by varying damping factors and measuring cluster stability and Silhouette score changes across runs
