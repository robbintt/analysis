# Rethinking Normalization Strategies and Convolutional Kernels for Multimodal Image Fusion

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2411.10036
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10036
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key result:** Hybrid IN+GN normalization + large kernel convolution achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal medical image fusion with significant improvements in structural similarity and detail preservation

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies that batch normalization commonly used in fusion networks smooths critical sparse features in medical images, limiting performance. The authors propose a hybrid normalization strategy combining instance normalization and group normalization to preserve image properties and feature correlations. Under this strategy, large kernel convolution is shown to effectively leverage its expanded receptive field to enhance detail preservation. The method also includes a multipath adaptive fusion module that dynamically recalibrates features across scales and receptive fields. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both visual quality and objective metrics.

## Method Summary
The proposed fusion network uses a hybrid normalization strategy (IN+GN) where instance normalization is applied only at the input layer to handle modality statistical gaps, while group normalization is used throughout the encoder and decoder. Large kernel convolution (LKC) with progressively decreasing kernel sizes (15×15, 11×11, 5×5) is employed to capture long-range dependencies. A multipath adaptive fusion module (MPAFM) with competitive attention allocation and cross-gating is inserted at each skip connection to improve information transfer between encoder and decoder paths.

## Key Results
- IN+GN normalization strategy achieves 83.422 SD vs 76.553 with BN+LKC on benchmark datasets
- Large kernel convolution with IN+GN significantly outperforms small kernel alternatives while reducing layer depth
- MPAFM module provides additional performance gains by improving skip connection quality through attention-based feature recalibration
- The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple medical image fusion datasets with superior detail preservation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hybrid IN+GN normalization preserves sparse features better than BN or single-normalization strategies in multimodal medical image fusion. IN normalizes each modality input independently at the shallow layer, reducing statistical gaps between modalities while preserving fine-grained details. GN in deeper layers maintains feature correlations without cross-sample interference. Together, they prevent BN's batch-level smoothing that destroys sparse, high-value features common in medical images (e.g., lesions, metabolic hotspots).

### Mechanism 2
Large kernel convolution (LKC) enhances detail preservation only when paired with normalization that maintains rich, non-smoothed feature maps. LKC's expanded receptive field captures long-range dependencies in fewer layers than stacked small kernels. However, BN's smoothing reduces feature richness, making the larger receptive field capture smoothed/irrelevant context—degrading performance. With IN+GN, feature maps retain sufficient detail for LKC to leverage spatially distributed patterns effectively.

### Mechanism 3
The multipath adaptive fusion module (MPAFM) improves decoder input quality through competitive attention allocation and cross-gating between encoder-decoder paths. MPAFM generates attention maps for encoder and decoder features via spatial-channel attention, then uses softmax-based competitive allocation forcing the model to prioritize one path per location. Bidirectional cross-gating enables mutual enhancement. Finally, recalibration distills interaction context into pixel-wise attention applied to encoder features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Normalization strategies (BN, IN, GN, LN)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's central claim depends on understanding how each normalization statistic-aggregation choice affects feature preservation differently. Without this, the hybrid strategy appears arbitrary.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a 4D tensor (N, C, H, W), which dimensions does BN aggregate over? What about IN?

- **Concept: Receptive field vs. effective receptive field**
  - **Why needed here:** LKC's value proposition is expanding receptive field, but the paper argues theoretical RF ≠ effective RF when features are smoothed. This distinction is critical for architectural reasoning.
  - **Quick check question:** If all activations in a layer become nearly identical due to aggressive normalization, does a 15×15 kernel provide more useful information than a 3×3 kernel?

- **Concept: Attention-based feature recalibration**
  - **Why needed here:** MPAFM uses attention to weight skip connections. Understanding how spatial and channel attention compute importance weights is necessary to debug fusion failures.
  - **Quick check question:** What does the softmax operation in competitive attention ensure about w₁ and w₂? What happens if you remove it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input (concatenated modalities) → InitBlock (IN + 15×15 LKC) → Encoder: 4 stages of [LKDCBlock ×2 → LKCBlock] with GN → Decoder: Symmetric upsampling with MPAFM at each skip connection → FinalBlock (GN + 1×1 Conv) → Fused output

- **Critical path:** InitBlock's IN normalization is the linchpin. If IN is replaced with BN or removed, the entire downstream feature quality degrades, and LKC's benefit reverses to detriment. Verify IN is applied per-modality on the concatenated input.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - IN+GN vs. all-GN: IN at input handles modality statistical gaps; all-GN risks modality-specific feature loss. IN throughout causes instability (g=c failure mode).
  - LKC kernel sizes (15→11→5→5): Larger kernels at high resolution capture global structure but cost O(k²) compute. Progressive reduction balances receptive field and efficiency.
  - GN group size: g=32 in LKCBlock, g=1 in LKDCBlock. Larger g in LKDCBlock (depthwise conv) amplifies distribution differences, causing artifacts.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Black spots or artifacts in fused output: Likely IN used throughout network (g=c case) instead of only in InitBlock.
  - Blurred lesions/metabolic regions with BN: BN's cross-sample smoothing; verify normalization type in encoder/decoder.
  - High parameter count but poor detail: LKC without correct normalization; check if IN is actually applied in InitBlock.
  - Unstable training with GN: Group size too large for LKDCBlock; verify g=1 for depthwise conv blocks.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation on InitBlock normalization: Train with IN, BN, GN, and no normalization in InitBlock while keeping rest fixed (all GN). Measure SD, AG, SF on MRI-CT pairs. Expect IN to show highest feature preservation metrics.
  2. LKC kernel size sweep: With IN+GN fixed, test 3×3, 7×7, 11×11, 15×15 kernels at InitBlock. Verify that performance gains plateau or degrade with smaller kernels, and that 15×15 is optimal for 256×256 medical images.
  3. MPAFM removal test: Disable MPAFM (direct skip concatenation) and measure the gap in SCD and VIFF metrics. This quantifies the attention mechanism's contribution to information transfer.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The superiority of IN+GN over BN is demonstrated numerically but not explained at the feature-map level with visualizations showing what specific features are preserved or destroyed.
- The claim that BN's smoothing "conflicts with maintaining sample independence" isn't validated with feature statistics or quantitative analysis.
- The MPAFM design is mathematically complete but lacks ablation studies on individual components (attention vs. gating vs. recalibration) to isolate which architectural elements drive the observed improvements.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The IN+GN hybrid normalization strategy is necessary and beneficial for multimodal medical fusion, supported by consistent metric improvements across datasets
- **Medium confidence:** Large kernel convolution only works effectively with non-smoothing normalization, though the mechanism linking receptive field quality to feature map richness needs direct visualization
- **Medium confidence:** MPAFM's competitive attention allocation improves fusion quality, but the specific architectural choices (softmax constraint, bidirectional gating) lack ablation validation

## Next Checks

1. **Feature map visualization study:** Extract and visualize intermediate feature maps from BN, IN+GN, and IN-only configurations on MRI-CT pairs. Identify specific structural features (edges, lesions, textures) that are preserved/destroyed by each normalization strategy.

2. **LKC kernel size efficiency test:** Conduct a comprehensive sweep of LKC kernel sizes (3×3 through 19×19) with both BN and IN+GN normalization. Plot performance vs. parameter count to identify optimal receptive field size for medical image fusion at different resolutions.

3. **MPAFM component ablation:** Systematically disable each MPAFM component (remove attention, remove gating, remove recalibration) and measure individual contributions to SCD and VIFF metrics. This isolates which architectural elements drive the observed improvements.
