# RL-Guided Data Selection for Language Model Finetuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25850
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25850
- Authors: Animesh Jha; Harshit Gupta; Ananjan Nandi
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Training on a 5% data subset selected by the approach matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to 10.8 accuracy points while reducing wall-clock training time by up to 2x

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of efficient data selection for fine-tuning large language models under strict data budget constraints. The authors reformulate data selection as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) over semantic clusters of the training data and train reinforcement learning agents to learn optimal selection policies guided by proxy-model-based reward signals. The approach demonstrates that training on carefully selected subsets (as small as 5% of the original data) can match or exceed the performance of full-data fine-tuning across four diverse tasks.

## Method Summary
The core method involves clustering the training data into semantically meaningful groups, defining MDP states over subsets of these clusters, and learning a sequential policy to select high-quality data subsets. The authors explore various RL algorithms including DQN and PPO, along with different reward model strategies such as DynaDQN and CLIMB-Disc. The RL agent learns to identify which data clusters contain the most valuable examples for the target task, effectively filtering out noisy or redundant data while preserving information-rich samples.

## Key Results
- Training on a 5% data subset selected by the approach matches or outperforms full-data fine-tuning by up to 10.8 accuracy points
- Wall-clock training time reduced by up to 2x compared to full-data fine-tuning
- Effective filtering of noisy data improves performance on datasets like MetaHate where full-data training suffers from data quality issues
- Demonstrated across four diverse tasks: ANLI, GooglePlay, MetaHate, and MMLU

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by learning a data selection policy that identifies high-quality, informative examples while filtering out noisy or redundant data. By framing data selection as an MDP, the RL agent can learn sequential decision-making that considers the cumulative value of selected data rather than making independent choices for each example. The proxy-model-based reward signal provides a scalable way to evaluate the potential impact of data subsets without requiring full model training for each selection.

## Foundational Learning
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: Framework for modeling sequential decision-making problems where current actions affect future states; needed to formalize data selection as a tractable optimization problem
- **Reinforcement Learning (DQN/PPO)**: Algorithms for learning optimal policies through interaction with an environment; quick check: can the agent converge to stable policies given the state and action space
- **Semantic Clustering**: Grouping data into meaningful categories based on content similarity; needed to create the state space for the MDP formulation
- **Proxy Model Rewards**: Using a smaller or faster model to approximate the performance of the target model; needed to make reward computation tractable during training
- **Data Quality vs Quantity Tradeoff**: Understanding that carefully selected smaller datasets can outperform larger, noisier ones; needed to justify the 5% budget approach

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Proxy Model -> Clustering Module -> MDP Environment -> RL Agent -> Data Selection Policy -> Fine-tuned LLM

**Critical Path**
The critical path runs from the proxy model evaluation through the MDP state representation to the RL agent's policy decisions. The proxy model provides the reward signal that guides the RL agent's learning, while the clustering module determines the granularity of the MDP state space.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The approach trades computational complexity (training RL agents and proxy models) for reduced fine-tuning time and improved data efficiency. The clustering granularity represents a key tradeoff between computational tractability and the ability to capture nuanced data relationships. Using proxy models instead of the target model for reward signals trades accuracy for scalability.

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor clustering quality leading to semantically inconsistent MDP states
- RL agent overfitting to proxy model noise rather than learning meaningful selection patterns
- Proxy model failing to capture task-relevant features, providing misleading reward signals
- Computational overhead of RL training outweighing the benefits of reduced fine-tuning time

**First Experiments**
1. Verify that the clustering algorithm produces semantically coherent groups on a small validation set
2. Test the proxy model's ability to predict full-model performance on a held-out subset
3. Evaluate the RL agent's learned policy on a simplified version of the MDP with fewer clusters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes data clusters are semantically meaningful and that optimal selection policies can be learned via proxy-model rewards
- MDP formulation may oversimplify complex data relationships, potentially missing non-local patterns
- Computational overhead of training RL agents (DQN/PPO) and proxy models adds complexity compared to simpler heuristic methods

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Claims about achieving competitive performance with 5% data budgets on tested tasks (ANLI, GooglePlay, MetaHate, MMLU) are supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: Generalizability across different domains and tasks needs further validation
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about wall-clock time reduction depend heavily on specific hardware configurations and may not translate across different setups

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on specialized domains (medical, legal, technical) to evaluate performance beyond general-purpose datasets and assess robustness to domain-specific data characteristics
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing the RL-guided approach against simpler data selection heuristics (e.g., length-based filtering, frequency-based sampling) to quantify the marginal benefit of the RL component
3. Measure and report the full computational overhead, including RL agent training time and proxy model development, to provide a complete cost-benefit analysis against traditional fine-tuning approaches
