# Robust Filtering -- Novel Statistical Learning and Inference Algorithms with Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.11530
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11530
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Robust filtering framework outperforms standard approaches in outlier-heavy environments across multiple applications

## Executive Summary
This dissertation presents a comprehensive framework for robust state estimation in dynamical systems subject to measurement abnormalities, particularly outliers and biases. The core innovation involves modifying standard state-space models to explicitly represent measurement corruption using Bernoulli random variables and appropriate statistical models. A Bayesian inference framework is then employed to detect and mitigate corrupted measurements during state estimation. The methods demonstrate superior performance compared to standard filtering approaches across various applications including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization.

## Method Summary
The approach modifies standard state-space models by introducing Bernoulli indicator variables that represent the presence of outliers or biases in each measurement channel. For outlier handling, these indicators effectively switch between nominal and inflated noise covariances, causing the Kalman gain to approach zero for corrupted channels. For bias handling, the framework treats biases as slowly evolving Markovian processes that can be estimated alongside the system state. Variational Bayes and Expectation-Maximization techniques are employed to approximate the intractable joint posterior distributions, enabling tractable inference. The framework is applied across multiple scenarios including target tracking with range/bearing sensors, indoor localization using UWB sensors, 3D point cloud registration, and pose graph optimization.

## Key Results
- Outperforms standard Kalman filtering approaches in high outlier ratio environments
- Achieves lower estimation errors in both simulations and experiments across multiple applications
- Successfully handles both sporadic outliers and sustained biases through unified probabilistic framework
- Demonstrates computational efficiency competitive with theoretical bounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Probabilistic Data Switching via Latent Indicators
The method treats data corruption as a distinct statistical mode governed by a latent Bernoulli variable. When an outlier is suspected, the measurement noise covariance for that specific channel is effectively inflated, causing the Kalman gain to approach zero and ignoring that dimension of the measurement vector. This works because abnormalities are statistically distinct from nominal measurement noise and can be approximated by mixture models.

### Mechanism 2: Joint Inference via Mean-Field Approximation
Rather than searching all possible combinations of corrupted channels, Variational Bayes assumes a factorized posterior that allows iterative updates of state mean and outlier probability weights independently. This converts an intractable integral into simpler updates by assuming weak correlation between system state and corruption indicators.

### Mechanism 3: Markovian Bias Tracking
The filter distinguishes between sporadic outliers and sustained biases by modeling biases as slowly evolving state variables. The Bernoulli indicator switches between treating residuals as outliers (ignore) or biases (estimate and subtract), allowing the system to learn systematic offsets while remaining robust to random noise.

## Foundational Learning

- **State-Space Models (SSM) & Kalman Filtering**: Standard KF/EKF prediction/update steps are modified; understanding the Kalman gain derivation and how measurement noise covariance affects measurement weighting is essential.
- **Variational Bayes (VB) & Mean-Field Approximation**: Core innovation uses VB to minimize KL-divergence between true and tractable distributions; understanding the factorization assumption is critical.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) & Heavy-Tailed Distributions**: Outliers and biases are modeled as arising from distinct probability distributions; understanding mixture models explains the mathematical basis for detection logic.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw sensor vector $y_k$ -> Prediction Block (standard KF/EKF) -> VB/EM Core (Robustifier) -> Corrected state estimate $\hat{x}_{k}^{+}$ and anomaly probabilities
- **Critical path**: The iteration loop within the VB/EM Core is the bottleneck, specifically the calculation of modified noise covariance $R_k(I_k)$ or its inverse $R_k^{-1}(\hat{I}_k)$
- **Design tradeoffs**: VB approach (robust but computationally heavier) vs EM approach (reduced complexity but potentially less statistical richness); tuning sensitivity requires careful initialization
- **Failure signatures**: "Flickering" between outlier/inlier states suggests overlapping noise distributions; unbounded covariance growth indicates excessive data rejection
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Implement standard EKF and inject outliers to establish baseline performance degradation; 2) Implement SOR filter and verify selective channel rejection; 3) Implement BDM filter and verify bias convergence tracking

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the computational complexity of the particle filter-based method for simultaneous outlier and bias handling be reduced by devising Variational Bayes-based alternatives?
- Can the proposed Bayesian heuristics (ESOR and ASOR) be effectively integrated into existing certifiable perception pipelines like TEASER++?
- How does the performance of the proposed robust state estimators degrade or hold up in the presence of adversarial data corruption compared to non-adversarial gross errors?

## Limitations

- VB mean-field assumption accuracy for highly coupled state-corruption dynamics is empirically validated only within tested scenarios
- Performance with non-Markovian bias evolution (abrupt jumps) has limited evaluation
- Computational complexity scaling for high-dimensional systems is not thoroughly characterized

## Confidence

- **High**: Robust filtering framework validity; performance improvements in tested scenarios; mathematical correctness of core algorithms
- **Medium**: Computational efficiency claims relative to alternatives; generalization to completely unseen scenarios
- **Low**: Absolute optimality of VB approximations; robustness to extreme noise conditions beyond tested ranges

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness boundary testing**: Systematically evaluate performance degradation as outlier ratios exceed 80% and as bias magnitude increases beyond calibrated ranges
2. **Real-time feasibility assessment**: Profile computational requirements across all proposed methods and compare against strict real-time constraints for high-frequency sensor systems
3. **Domain transferability validation**: Apply the framework to fundamentally different state-space problems (e.g., biomedical signal processing) to test method generalizability beyond the presented applications
