# Federated Learning for Video Violence Detection: Complementary Roles of Lightweight CNNs and Vision-Language Models for Energy-Efficient Use

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07171
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07171
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: Evaluated three federated learning approaches for video violence detection achieving >90% accuracy while demonstrating significant energy efficiency differences between lightweight CNNs and VLMs

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates federated learning strategies for privacy-preserving video violence detection, comparing zero-shot VLM inference, LoRA-based federated fine-tuning, and personalized federated learning with lightweight 3D CNNs. Under realistic non-IID conditions using RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets, all methods exceed 90% accuracy for binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior calibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) while consuming roughly half the energy of federated LoRA (240 Wh vs 570 Wh). For multiclass classification on UCF-Crime, hierarchical category grouping based on semantic similarity improves VLM accuracy from 65.31% to 81%.

## Method Summary
The research evaluates three federated learning approaches for video violence detection: zero-shot VLM inference, LoRA-based federated fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and personalized federated learning with a lightweight 3D CNN. Experiments were conducted under realistic non-IID conditions using RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets for binary detection, and UCF-Crime for multiclass classification. Energy consumption was measured under controlled hardware conditions, and hierarchical semantic grouping was applied to improve multiclass VLM performance. All FL runs were simulated without real edge devices.

## Key Results
- 3D CNN achieves ROC AUC of 92.59% for binary violence detection with ~240 Wh energy consumption
- Federated LoRA approaches consume ~570 Wh, roughly double the energy of lightweight CNN
- Hierarchical semantic grouping improves VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on UCF-Crime
- All methods exceed 90% accuracy in binary violence detection under non-IID federated conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from combining privacy-preserving federated learning with complementary model architectures. Lightweight 3D CNNs provide efficient routine screening with superior calibration, while VLMs offer multimodal reasoning for complex scenarios. The hierarchical semantic grouping exploits natural category relationships in violence detection tasks. Federated learning enables privacy preservation while maintaining model accuracy through collaborative training across distributed clients.

## Foundational Learning

**Federated Learning** - Decentralized machine learning where models train across multiple devices without sharing raw data
Why needed: Enables privacy-preserving video violence detection across distributed surveillance systems
Quick check: Verify model convergence and accuracy across simulated FL rounds

**Vision-Language Models** - Multimodal models combining visual and textual understanding for zero-shot reasoning
Why needed: Enables flexible violence detection without task-specific fine-tuning
Quick check: Test VLM performance on out-of-distribution violence examples

**Non-IID Data Distribution** - Real-world scenario where data across clients follows different distributions
Why needed: Reflects practical surveillance deployments with heterogeneous video sources
Quick check: Measure performance degradation when client data distributions diverge

**Hierarchical Semantic Grouping** - Organizing categories based on conceptual similarity rather than flat classification
Why needed: Improves multiclass reasoning by reducing cognitive load on VLMs
Quick check: Compare accuracy with and without hierarchical grouping on UCF-Crime

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Client devices -> FL Server -> Global Model -> Local Inference
- Client devices: Run local training/inference with either 3D CNN or VLM
- FL Server: Coordinates model aggregation and distribution
- Global Model: Represents consensus across all clients
- Local Inference: Executes violence detection on device or cloud

**Critical Path:** Video capture → Local feature extraction → FL aggregation → Global model update → Classification output

**Design Tradeoffs:** CNN vs VLM selection involves balancing energy efficiency (CNN: ~240 Wh) against multimodal reasoning capabilities (VLM). Federated learning preserves privacy but introduces communication overhead and convergence challenges with non-IID data.

**Failure Signatures:** Accuracy drops may indicate client drift from non-IID data, insufficient local training, or communication bottlenecks. Energy spikes suggest inefficient model selection or hardware utilization issues.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Compare binary detection accuracy across CNN, VLM, and federated approaches on RWF-2000
2. Measure energy consumption during FL rounds for each model type
3. Evaluate multiclass performance with and without hierarchical grouping on UCF-Crime

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can lightweight 3D CNNs achieve competitive performance on multiclass violence detection when extended with hierarchical semantic grouping?
- Basis in paper: The CNN baseline was evaluated only for binary detection, whereas multiclass analysis was conducted exclusively with VLMs
- Why unresolved: The authors demonstrate that hierarchical grouping improves VLM multiclass accuracy from 65% to 81%, but do not evaluate whether CNNs could benefit from similar strategies or match VLM performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Train and evaluate the 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN on UCF-Crime with the same hierarchical category groupings, comparing accuracy, calibration, and energy against VLMs

### Open Question 2
- Question: What uncertainty thresholds and escalation criteria optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and energy consumption in hybrid CNN-VLM cascade deployments?
- Basis in paper: The authors recommend a hybrid cascade with always-on CNN screening and on-demand VLM escalation and state future work will address uncertainty/novelty-conditioned model selection
- Why unresolved: The hybrid strategy is proposed conceptually but not implemented or empirically validated
- What evidence would resolve it: Implement the cascade, vary CNN confidence thresholds for VLM escalation, and measure accuracy retention versus energy savings compared to single-model baselines

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do findings from simulated federated learning transfer to real edge device deployments with hardware heterogeneity, varying bandwidth, and battery constraints?
- Basis in paper: All FL runs are simulated (no real devices) and emulates clients with uniform GPU/CPU resources
- Why unresolved: Real-world surveillance nodes have heterogeneous hardware, unreliable connectivity, and power constraints absent from simulation
- What evidence would resolve it: Deploy the compared approaches on physical edge devices (e.g., different camera-equipped platforms) and evaluate convergence, energy use, and accuracy under real network conditions

## Limitations
- Federated learning privacy preservation not fully validated against inference attacks through model updates
- Energy consumption measurements based on controlled hardware that may not reflect production-scale variations
- Binary detection benchmarks limited to two datasets without testing on diverse cultural contexts or camera perspectives

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Energy efficiency measurements showing 3D CNN consuming ~240 Wh versus LoRA-based approaches at ~570 Wh under controlled conditions

**Medium confidence:** Overall accuracy claims (>90%) for binary violence detection across federated approaches, though dataset-specific performance may vary

**Medium confidence:** ROC AUC of 92.59% for the lightweight 3D CNN, representing a strong baseline for calibrated violence detection

**Medium confidence:** Hierarchical category grouping improving multiclass VLM accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on UCF-Crime

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-dataset validation by testing trained models on external surveillance video sources to assess real-world generalization and cultural bias in violence detection

2. Implement differential privacy mechanisms within the federated learning framework and measure privacy-utility trade-offs across varying noise levels

3. Perform ablation studies on the hierarchical semantic grouping methodology for UCF-Crime to quantify the impact of different category definitions on VLM performance
