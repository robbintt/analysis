# SwiftMem: Fast Agentic Memory via Query-aware Indexing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08160
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08160
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Achieves 47× faster search than state-of-the-art baselines

## Executive Summary
SwiftMem is a query-aware agentic memory system that dramatically accelerates memory search operations through specialized indexing over temporal and semantic dimensions. The system achieves 47× faster search compared to existing baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, making it practical for real-time applications of memory-augmented LLM agents. By organizing memory entries through both time-based and topic-based indices, SwiftMem enables sub-15ms search latency across varying conversation lengths, addressing the fundamental bottleneck of memory retrieval in agentic systems.

## Method Summary
SwiftMem employs a dual-indexing approach combining temporal and semantic dimensions. The temporal index enables logarithmic-time range queries for chronological memory retrieval, while the semantic DAG-Tag index maps queries to relevant topics through hierarchical tag structures. A co-consolidation mechanism dynamically reorganizes storage based on semantic clusters to improve cache locality as memory grows. This query-aware approach optimizes both search speed and accuracy by creating specialized pathways for different types of memory access patterns.

## Key Results
- 47× faster search compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- Sub-15ms search latency maintained across varying conversation lengths
- Competitive accuracy of 0.704 LLM score on benchmark tests
- Effective performance on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its specialized indexing architecture that addresses the dual challenges of temporal and semantic memory organization. The temporal index provides efficient chronological access through logarithmic search, while the semantic DAG-Tag structure creates meaningful topic relationships that improve relevance. The co-consolidation mechanism continuously optimizes memory layout based on actual usage patterns, ensuring that frequently accessed semantic clusters remain cache-friendly as the memory system scales.

## Foundational Learning
- Temporal indexing - needed to enable efficient chronological queries; quick check: verify logarithmic search time
- Semantic DAG structures - needed to map queries to relevant topics; quick check: validate hierarchical tag accuracy
- Cache locality optimization - needed for sustained performance at scale; quick check: measure memory access patterns
- Query-aware indexing - needed to differentiate between temporal and semantic search needs; quick check: benchmark both query types
- Co-consolidation mechanisms - needed to maintain performance during memory growth; quick check: track reorganization overhead
- Agentic memory systems - needed context for understanding retrieval requirements; quick check: compare to baseline memory systems

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Query Processor -> Temporal Index -> Semantic DAG-Tag Index -> Co-consolidation Layer -> Memory Storage
- Critical path: Query parsing → Index selection (temporal/semantic) → Search execution → Result consolidation → Response generation
- Design tradeoffs: Speed vs. memory overhead, specialized indexing vs. general-purpose search, dynamic reorganization vs. stability
- Failure signatures: Degraded accuracy with ambiguous queries, increased latency during consolidation phases, memory bloat from index structures
- First experiments: 1) Benchmark temporal vs. semantic query performance separately, 2) Measure co-consolidation overhead during memory growth, 3) Test accuracy degradation with increasing memory size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Sparse implementation details for temporal index construction overhead
- Lack of empirical validation on datasets with complex semantic hierarchies
- Uncertain performance under continuous real-world memory growth patterns
- Insufficient context for claimed accuracy score and error margins

## Confidence
- High Confidence: 47× speedup claim, sub-15ms latency achievement
- Medium Confidence: Accuracy claims of 0.704 LLM score, scalability beyond benchmarks
- Low Confidence: Long-term performance under dynamic conditions, memory efficiency of indexing structures

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate individual contributions of temporal indexing, semantic DAG-Tag indexing, and co-consolidation
2. Test SwiftMem on diverse real-world datasets with complex semantic relationships and ambiguous queries
3. Measure memory overhead and construction costs for indexing structures at scale (100K+ memory entries)
