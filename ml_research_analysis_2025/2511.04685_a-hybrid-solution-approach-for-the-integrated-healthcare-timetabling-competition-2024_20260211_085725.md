# A hybrid solution approach for the Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.04685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04685
- Reference count: 19
- Ranked 3rd in the Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a hybrid solution approach for the Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024 that combines mixed-integer programming (MIP), constraint programming (CP), and simulated annealing (SA) in a 3-phase decomposition framework. The approach decomposes the complex healthcare timetabling problem into four manageable subproblems: patient admission, room assignment, operating theater assignment, and nurse assignment. The method achieved third place in the competition and demonstrated significant improvements over traditional single-method approaches, though substantial room for optimization remains.

## Method Summary
The approach employs a hybrid methodology that integrates multiple optimization techniques through a systematic decomposition strategy. Mixed-integer programming handles the patient admission and room assignment phases, while constraint programming manages operating theater scheduling and nurse assignments. Simulated annealing provides a metaheuristic layer for global optimization and escape from local optima. The 3-phase decomposition breaks down the complex healthcare timetabling problem into sequential subproblems, allowing for focused optimization of each component while maintaining overall solution feasibility.

## Key Results
- Achieved 3rd place ranking in the Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024
- Solution gaps ranged from 0.0% to 27.0% compared to best known solutions
- Computational experiments conducted on 30 competition instances with 10-minute runtime limits
- First-time computation of lower bounds on optimal solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach succeeds by leveraging the complementary strengths of different optimization paradigms. MIP provides exact solutions for structured subproblems with strong mathematical formulations, while CP excels at handling complex constraints and logical relationships inherent in healthcare scheduling. Simulated annealing offers global search capabilities that help escape local optima and explore solution spaces more effectively. The decomposition strategy allows each method to focus on its strengths without being overwhelmed by the full problem complexity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mixed-Integer Programming**: Required for exact optimization of admission and room assignment problems where discrete decisions must be made; quick check: verify integrality constraints are properly formulated
- **Constraint Programming**: Essential for handling complex logical constraints in operating theater and nurse scheduling; quick check: validate constraint propagation efficiency
- **Simulated Annealing**: Provides metaheuristic optimization for global search space exploration; quick check: monitor temperature cooling schedule effectiveness
- **Problem Decomposition**: Enables manageable subproblem optimization while maintaining solution coherence; quick check: assess solution quality degradation from sequential processing
- **Hybrid Methodology**: Combines complementary optimization techniques for enhanced overall performance; quick check: evaluate integration points between different methods
- **Computational Efficiency**: Balances solution quality with practical runtime constraints (10-minute limit); quick check: benchmark against single-method approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Patient Admission (MIP) -> Room Assignment (MIP) -> Operating Theater Assignment (CP) -> Nurse Assignment (CP)

**Critical Path:**
The critical path follows the sequential decomposition: admission decisions influence room availability, which constrains theater assignments, which ultimately determine nurse scheduling requirements. Each phase depends on the output of previous phases, making early-stage decisions particularly impactful.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The sequential decomposition trades global optimality for computational tractability. While treating subproblems holistically might yield better solutions, the decomposition enables practical solution times within competition constraints. The hybrid integration requires careful parameter tuning to balance exploration (SA) with exploitation (MIP/CP).

**Failure Signatures:**
- Admission infeasibilities propagate downstream, causing room assignment failures
- Nurse assignment bottlenecks indicate theater scheduling inefficiencies
- Large solution gaps suggest decomposition suboptimalities or method parameter issues
- Runtime timeouts indicate need for heuristic adjustments or problem simplification

**First Experiments:**
1. Test sequential vs. parallel decomposition on small instances to quantify optimality loss
2. Compare SA cooling schedules to optimize global search effectiveness
3. Validate constraint propagation efficiency in CP modules using benchmark constraint satisfaction problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Sequential decomposition may sacrifice global optimality by treating subproblems independently
- Significant performance variation across instances (0.0% to 27.0% gaps) without clear explanation
- Lower bounds quality and tightness relative to optimal solutions remain unverified
- Nurse assignment efficiency improvements lack specific comparative metrics

## Confidence

**High**: Hybrid methodology combining MIP, CP, and SA is technically sound; competition ranking (3rd place) is verifiable

**Medium**: Computational results and gap analyses presented but lack depth in explaining instance-specific performance variations

**Medium**: Lower bounds computation methodology appears novel but validation of their quality is insufficient

## Next Checks

1. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the sequencing of subproblems to determine optimal ordering and identify cases where the current sequence fails

2. Compare the computed lower bounds against exact solutions for smaller instances to establish bound quality and tightness

3. Perform cross-validation by applying the same hybrid framework to a different healthcare timetabling benchmark to assess generalizability beyond the competition instances
