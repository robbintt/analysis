# rETF-semiSL: Semi-Supervised Learning for Neural Collapse in Temporal Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.10147
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10147
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: 12% average relative improvement in time series classification with limited labels

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of training deep neural networks for time series classification with limited labeled data. The core method introduces rETF-semiSL, a novel semi-supervised pre-training framework that enforces Neural Collapse (NC) in latent embeddings using a rotational equiangular tight frame (ETF) classifier and pseudo-labeling. The approach is specialized for temporal data through generative SSL tasks and a novel forward-mixing augmentation strategy. Experiments on three multivariate time series classification datasets (HAR, Epilepsy, Heartbeat) with LSTM, transformer, and state-space model backbones show that rETF-semiSL consistently outperforms established SSL and supervised methods, achieving an average relative improvement of 12% in downstream classification performance. The method also demonstrates lower computational complexity and faster convergence compared to other approaches.

## Method Summary
rETF-semiSL combines semi-supervised learning with Neural Collapse enforcement for time series classification. The framework uses a rotational ETF classifier to enforce class separability in latent space during pre-training. Three generative SSL pretext tasks are introduced: inpainting (reconstructing masked segments), contextual prediction (predicting future from past), and forward-mixing augmentation (combining sequences with temporal alignment). During fine-tuning, pseudo-labeling propagates confident predictions to unlabeled data. The method is designed specifically for temporal data, incorporating temporal coherence in augmentation and prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 12% average relative improvement in downstream classification performance compared to established SSL and supervised methods
- Outperforms baselines across three datasets (HAR, Epilepsy, Heartbeat) and three backbone architectures (LSTM, transformer, state-space model)
- Demonstrates lower computational complexity and faster convergence than competing approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages Neural Collapse theory to create highly discriminative feature representations. By enforcing an equiangular tight frame structure during pre-training, the model learns representations where class means are maximally separated while intra-class variance is minimized. The semi-supervised component amplifies this effect by using pseudo-labels to extend supervision to unlabeled data. The temporal-specific augmentations preserve the sequential nature of time series while creating challenging prediction tasks that force the model to learn meaningful temporal patterns rather than superficial correlations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Neural Collapse**: The phenomenon where features of the same class converge to their mean while class means become maximally separated. Needed to understand the theoretical foundation of ETF classifiers. Quick check: Can verify collapse behavior by visualizing feature distributions after training.
- **Equiangular Tight Frames**: A mathematical construct ensuring optimal class separation in feature space. Required for understanding how the rotational ETF classifier enforces Neural Collapse. Quick check: Confirm ETF properties hold by checking angles between class mean vectors.
- **Pseudo-labeling**: Self-training technique using model predictions as labels for unlabeled data. Essential for understanding the semi-supervised component. Quick check: Monitor pseudo-label confidence distributions to detect noisy labels.
- **Temporal Data Augmentation**: Techniques that preserve sequential structure while creating variation. Needed to grasp forward-mixing and other temporal-specific methods. Quick check: Validate that augmented sequences maintain temporal coherence.
- **Generative SSL Pretext Tasks**: Self-supervised tasks like inpainting and contextual prediction that learn meaningful representations. Critical for understanding the pre-training phase. Quick check: Measure reconstruction quality and prediction accuracy on pretext tasks.
- **Transformer and State-Space Models**: Modern sequence processing architectures that serve as backbones. Important for understanding model flexibility. Quick check: Compare performance across different backbone types.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Time Series -> Temporal Augmentations -> Backbone (LSTM/Transformer/SSM) -> Encoder -> Rotational ETF Classifier -> Pseudo-labels -> Fine-tuned Classifier

**Critical Path**: The essential flow is: temporal augmentations generate training examples → backbone processes sequences → encoder produces embeddings → rotational ETF classifier enforces Neural Collapse → pseudo-labeling extends supervision → fine-tuned classifier achieves final performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades pre-training computational cost for better sample efficiency during fine-tuning. Using three different pretext tasks increases pre-training complexity but provides richer representations. The rotational ETF classifier adds regularization that may slow convergence but improves final accuracy. Pseudo-labeling introduces potential noise but dramatically increases effective training data.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate: (1) inadequate Neural Collapse enforcement (check class separation in embeddings), (2) noisy pseudo-labels (monitor pseudo-label confidence), (3) inappropriate temporal augmentations (verify augmented sequences are meaningful), or (4) backbone-architecture mismatch (compare across different backbones).

**First Experiments**:
1. Train with only supervised loss (no SSL pretext tasks) to establish baseline performance
2. Enable pseudo-labeling while keeping rotational ETF classifier disabled to measure its individual contribution
3. Run each pretext task (inpainting, contextual, forward-mixing) independently to identify which contributes most to performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Generalizability concerns across different data modalities and extremely high-dimensional feature spaces

## Next Checks
1. Test rETF-semiSL on diverse time series datasets beyond the three presented, including datasets with different sampling rates, dimensionalities, and domain characteristics
2. Conduct systematic ablation studies on each pretext task (inpainting, contextual, forward-mixing) individually and in combination
3. Perform comprehensive benchmarking of computational requirements across varying dataset sizes, model architectures, and hardware configurations
