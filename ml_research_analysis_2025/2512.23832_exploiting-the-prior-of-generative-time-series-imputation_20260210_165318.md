# Exploiting the Prior of Generative Time Series Imputation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23832
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23832
- Authors: YuYang Miao; Chang Li; Zehua Chen
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Bridge-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance on time series imputation by combining expert priors with Schrödinger Bridge refinement.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses time series imputation by proposing Bridge-TS, a generative model that leverages informative priors from pretrained deterministic models within a Schrödinger Bridge framework. The key innovation is using expert model outputs as starting distributions rather than random noise, enabling more efficient data-to-data generation. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show Bridge-TS consistently outperforms both deterministic and generative baselines in terms of MSE and MAE.

## Method Summary
Bridge-TS employs a two-stage approach: first, pretrained expert models (TimesNet, Non-stationary Transformer, optionally FEDformer) generate deterministic estimates of missing values; second, a Schrödinger Bridge model refines these estimates toward ground truth. For compositional priors, multiple expert outputs are concatenated along the channel dimension and jointly processed. The bridge learns to predict the original data at different timesteps using a tractable closed-form solution under linear-Gaussian assumptions, minimizing L2 loss between predictions and ground truth.

## Key Results
- Bridge-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance across six benchmark datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Exchange)
- Consistently outperforms both deterministic baselines (TimesNet, Non-stationary Transformer) and generative methods (diffusion models, CSDI)
- Compositional priors (Bridge-TS-2) show consistent gains over single expert variants across all datasets and masking ratios
- Bridge-TS-D demonstrates that probabilistic refinement provides additional accuracy gains beyond deterministic averaging

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Expert Prior Reduces Generative Burden
- Claim: Initializing with deterministic model outputs improves accuracy by reducing the distribution gap between prior and target
- Mechanism: Pretrained experts produce informed point estimates that serve as starting distributions for the bridge, which then refines them toward ground truth
- Core assumption: Deterministic models optimized for MSE capture temporal patterns closer to ground truth than uninformed priors
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] leveraging expert models for deterministic estimation as priors; [section 4.2] constructing model upon expert priors for superior initial conditions
- Break condition: Poorly matched expert models introduce systematic errors the bridge cannot fully correct

### Mechanism 2: Tractable Schrödinger Bridge Under Linear-Gaussian Assumption
- Claim: Closed-form marginal distribution under Gaussian smoothing enables efficient data-to-data generation without iterative simulation
- Mechanism: With Gaussian priors p_0 and p_T, the marginal at time t follows a closed-form distribution; the model learns to predict x_0 from x_t using L2 loss
- Core assumption: Linear-Gaussian approximation sufficiently captures transition dynamics between prior and target
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.1] advantageous for utilizing informative content from prior data; reduces sampling steps compared to diffusion models
- Break condition: Highly multimodal or non-Gaussian target distributions may not be captured by tractable solution

### Mechanism 3: Compositional Prior Fusion via Channel Concatenation
- Claim: Concatenating multiple expert priors allows the bridge to learn adaptive fusion of complementary temporal patterns
- Mechanism: N expert predictions are concatenated along channels; the bridge processes jointly and outputs average across channels
- Core assumption: Different architectural biases capture distinct aspects of temporal structure
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] combining multiple expert results in data-to-data generation; [section 6.8] Bridge-TS-2 shows consistent gains over Bridge-TS-1
- Break condition: Adding weak or poorly correlated priors degrades performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Schrödinger Bridge as Optimal Transport
  - Why needed here: Understanding why SB finds minimum KL-divergence path between two distributions, and when closed-form solutions exist
  - Quick check question: Why does linear-Gaussian assumption enable tractable marginal whereas general SB requires iterative IPF simulation?

- Concept: Time Series Imputation Notation (x_ob, x_ta, M)
  - Why needed here: Paper uses mask M ∈ {0,1}^(L×C) to indicate observed vs missing, with x_ob as observed values and x_ta as target missing values
  - Quick check question: Given M with 25% zeros, what is relationship between prior x_ta_prior and ground truth x_ta during training?

- Concept: Deterministic vs Generative Trade-offs in Imputation
  - Why needed here: Bridge-TS explicitly combines deterministic accuracy with generative flexibility
  - Quick check question: Why would deterministic model with low MSE still benefit from probabilistic refinement? What does bridge provide beyond direct averaging?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Pretrained experts (TimesNet, Non-stationary Transformer, optionally FEDformer) -> Prior concatenation layer -> Schrödinger Bridge core (TimesNet-based encoder) -> Channel averaging

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train expert models on target dataset with MSE objective
  2. Generate expert priors, concatenate, sample t ~ Uniform(0,1)
  3. Compute x_t via interpolation between replicated ground truth and expert priors
  4. Train bridge to minimize ||prediction - ground truth||²
  5. Inference: average N channel predictions for final imputation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Bridge-TS-1 (single expert) vs Bridge-TS-2 (dual): +computation, +robustness; gains consistent but diminishing
  - Joint training vs frozen: Joint converges faster but requires storing expert gradients
  - g_constant vs g_max noise schedule: g_max helps on some datasets but not universal; tune per domain

- Failure signatures:
  - Bridge-TS-3 < Bridge-TS-2 on specific datasets: Third prior is weak/incompatible—check individual expert MSE first
  - Linear-Bridge outperforming expert-prior variants: Expert may be undertrained or mismatched
  - Bridge-TS-D matching Bridge-TS-2: Probabilistic component not learning—check noise schedule and diffusion coefficient

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Table 2 on ETTh1 at 25% masking: Compare Linear-Bridge, Bridge-TS-1 (TimesNet), Bridge-TS-2 to validate prior quality hypothesis
  2. Ablation on training strategy (Table 3): Compare joint vs frozen vs MSE training to confirm joint training benefit
  3. Deterministic vs probabilistic (Table 5): Compare Bridge-TS-2 vs Bridge-TS-D to isolate contribution of stochastic sampling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can compositional prior framework be adapted to automatically filter or down-weight "weak" expert priors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6.8 notes adding third prior (FEDformer) improved ETTh1 but degraded Exchange, concluding inaccurate priors can mislead refinement
- Why unresolved: Current implementation concatenates priors without mechanism to assess individual reliability or compatibility
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study implementing learnable gating or uncertainty-based weighting for compositional priors

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does linear-Gaussian assumption limit ability to capture non-linear or heavy-tailed temporal dynamics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.1 states tractable solution derived under linear-Gaussian assumption despite emphasizing non-stationarity and complex dynamics
- Why unresolved: Paper does not evaluate impact of distributional assumption on datasets violating Gaussianity
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on synthetic data with controlled non-Gaussian noise or heavy-tailed distributions

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are computational efficiency trade-offs (latency and memory) of running multiple pretrained expert models alongside Schrödinger Bridge?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Method requires running N pretrained models to generate priors before bridge process, but results only report accuracy
- Why unresolved: Feasibility of deploying multiple large models in sequential pipeline for real-time imputation not discussed
- What evidence would resolve it: Reporting inference time and GPU memory consumption for Bridge-TS-3 vs Bridge-TS-1 and deterministic baselines

## Limitations
- Performance degrades when adding incompatible expert priors (e.g., FEDformer on Exchange), showing sensitivity to expert model selection
- Relies on linear-Gaussian assumption that may not hold for highly non-linear or heavy-tailed temporal patterns
- Computational overhead of running multiple large expert models before bridge processing may limit real-time deployment

## Confidence
- Expert Prior Mechanism: Medium-High - Well-supported by consistent performance gains over baselines
- Tractable SB Formulation: Medium - Novel contribution with empirical validation but assumption robustness uncertain
- Compositional Prior Fusion: Medium - Shows gains but diminishing returns and sensitivity to expert quality suggest practical limits

## Next Checks
1. Measure KL divergence between expert prior distributions and ground truth distributions across datasets to quantify "distribution gap" reduction
2. Evaluate Bridge-TS performance on synthetic datasets with known non-Gaussian temporal patterns to test linear-Gaussian assumption limits
3. Systematically vary number and types of compositional priors on each dataset to identify conditions where additional experts improve or degrade performance
