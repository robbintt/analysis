# Fairness in Machine Learning-based Hand Load Estimation: A Case Study on Load Carriage Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.05610
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05610
- Reference count: 10
- Conventional ML models (k-NN, SVM, Random Forest) exhibited significant sex-based prediction disparities when trained on imbalanced datasets, particularly underestimating loads carried by males.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses algorithmic bias in machine learning models used to predict hand-carried box weights from gait patterns captured by inertial sensors. Conventional ML models (k-NN, SVM, Random Forest) exhibited significant sex-based prediction disparities when trained on imbalanced datasets, particularly underestimating loads carried by males. To mitigate this bias, the authors developed a Debiasing VAE (DVAE) that separates sex-agnostic and sex-specific latent features in motion data, enabling fair predictions across sexes. DVAE achieved superior performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.42, outperforming k-NN (MAE = 6.13) and Random Forest (MAE = 4.89), while maintaining fairness metrics (SP, PRD, NRD) closest to ideal values across varying training ratios. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of fairness-aware ML algorithms in ergonomic risk assessment applications.

## Method Summary
The study uses inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from 22 participants performing load carriage tasks to predict carried box weights while mitigating sex-based algorithmic bias. The DVAE architecture employs dual encoders to separate sex-agnostic and sex-specific latent features, with a shared decoder reconstructing motion data. The model is trained with a combined loss function balancing reconstruction quality, discriminative power, and independence between latent spaces. Performance is evaluated using MAE for accuracy and fairness metrics (SP, PRD, NRD) across various training data imbalances.

## Key Results
- DVAE achieved MAE of 3.42, outperforming k-NN (MAE = 6.13) and Random Forest (MAE = 4.89)
- DVAE maintained fairness metrics (SP, PRD, NRD) closest to ideal values across varying training ratios
- Conventional ML models exhibited significant sex-based prediction disparities, particularly underestimating loads carried by males

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The DVAE works by explicitly disentangling sex-specific and sex-agnostic features in the latent space. By separating these features through dual encoders and optimizing for independence between them, the model learns to predict weight based on motion patterns that are not confounded by sex-related differences in gait. This architectural choice allows the model to capture relevant biomechanical information for weight estimation while removing sex-based bias from the prediction process.

## Foundational Learning
1. **VAE (Variational Autoencoder)**: Probabilistic generative model that learns latent representations by maximizing the evidence lower bound. Needed to capture complex motion patterns in gait data. Quick check: Latent space should reconstruct input data accurately.

2. **Latent Feature Disentanglement**: Separating correlated features into independent components to remove bias. Needed to isolate sex-specific gait patterns from weight-relevant motion features. Quick check: t-SNE plots should show distinct clustering patterns for sex and weight in separated latent spaces.

3. **Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**: Validation method where each subject's data is held out once for testing. Needed to ensure model generalizes across individuals rather than memorizing subject-specific patterns. Quick check: Performance should be consistent across all held-out subjects.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw IMU Data -> Preprocessing -> Dual Encoder (Sex-agnostic + Sex-specific) -> Latent Spaces -> Shared Decoder -> Reconstruction + Predictions

**Critical Path**: The dual-encoder architecture is critical, where the sex-agnostic encoder must successfully extract weight-relevant features while the sex-specific encoder captures gender-related motion patterns. The independence loss term ensures these spaces remain disentangled.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model trades some reconstruction accuracy for fairness by enforcing independence between latent spaces. Higher β₂ values increase debiasing strength but may reduce predictive accuracy. The choice of latent dimension (16) balances representational capacity with computational efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- If sex information leaks into the sex-agnostic latent space (z), predictions will show sex-based disparities
- If the independence excitation loss is too weak, the model may simply learn to copy sex labels
- If reconstruction quality drops significantly, the model may lose important weight-relevant features

**First Experiments**:
1. Train DVAE with varying β₂ values (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) to find optimal debiasing strength
2. Visualize t-SNE plots of z and z_sex spaces colored by sex and weight labels
3. Compare MAE and fairness metrics across training ratios (0.9:0.1 to 0.1:0.9)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are specific to sex-based bias in gait-based weight estimation and may not generalize to other bias types or domains
- The approach has not been tested for other bias types (e.g., age, body mass index) or in different ergonomic or biomechanical contexts
- Missing hyperparameters (β₁, β₂, baseline model configurations) limit exact reproduction and may affect reported superiority

## Confidence
- **High** in the technical soundness of the dual-encoder VAE architecture for separating sex-agnostic and sex-specific features
- **Medium** in the claim that DVAE outperforms conventional ML models for both accuracy and fairness, given clear metrics and LOSOCV validation, but uncertainty in hyperparameters may affect reproducibility
- **Low** in the generalizability of the results beyond the studied sex-based bias and gait-based weight estimation

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce DVAE with multiple β₁/β₂ settings to identify the optimal balance and confirm reported performance
2. Test DVAE on additional bias types (e.g., age, body mass index) and in different ergonomic or biomechanical contexts
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the debiasing components to quantify their specific contribution to fairness gains
