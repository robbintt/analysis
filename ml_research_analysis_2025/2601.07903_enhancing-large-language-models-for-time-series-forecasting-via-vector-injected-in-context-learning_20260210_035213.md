# Enhancing Large Language Models for Time-Series Forecasting via Vector-Injected In-Context Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.07903
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07903
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces LVICL, a method for time-series forecasting with large language models (LLMs) that freezes all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead while improving predictive performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents LVICL, a novel approach for time-series forecasting using large language models that employs vector-injected in-context learning. By freezing all LLM parameters and using a lightweight adapter to refine context vectors, LVICL achieves strong forecasting performance across multiple real-world datasets while using significantly less GPU memory than traditional approaches. The method demonstrates improved robustness to example selection and ordering compared to standard in-context learning techniques.

## Method Summary
LVICL operates by extracting example-related information from time-series data into context vectors, which are then refined through a lightweight adapter network. These refined vectors are injected into each layer of a frozen LLM, allowing the model to leverage relevant contextual information without updating its parameters. This approach combines the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning with the flexibility of in-context learning, making it particularly suitable for time-series forecasting tasks where computational resources may be limited.

## Key Results
- LVICL outperforms traditional in-context learning and LoRA fine-tuning on multiple real-world time-series datasets
- Achieves strong predictive performance while using significantly less GPU memory than fine-tuning approaches
- Demonstrates improved robustness to example selection and ordering in in-context learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LVICL works by efficiently bridging the gap between frozen LLM parameters and time-series forecasting requirements. The vector injection mechanism allows relevant contextual information to flow through the model layers without parameter updates, while the lightweight adapter refines this information to better suit the forecasting task. This design enables the model to leverage the general capabilities of LLMs while adapting to specific time-series patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- In-Context Learning (ICL): The ability of LLMs to learn from examples provided in the prompt without parameter updates. Why needed: Forms the baseline approach that LVICL improves upon. Quick check: Can the model learn new tasks from prompt examples alone?
- Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning: Methods like LoRA that update only a small subset of model parameters. Why needed: Provides context for LVICL's efficiency gains. Quick check: What fraction of parameters are updated during fine-tuning?
- Vector Injection: The technique of inserting learned vectors into intermediate layers of a neural network. Why needed: Core mechanism enabling LVICL's approach. Quick check: How are injected vectors processed by subsequent layers?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Time-series Data -> Context Vector Extraction -> Lightweight Adapter -> Vector Injection -> Frozen LLM -> Forecast Output

Critical Path:
Context vector extraction and refinement through the adapter represents the critical path, as this determines the quality of information injected into the LLM layers.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Parameter freezing vs. fine-tuning: Sacrifices some task-specific adaptation for computational efficiency
- Adapter complexity vs. performance: More complex adapters could improve results but reduce efficiency gains
- Vector injection strategy: Different injection points/layers could affect performance

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance on datasets with very different characteristics from training data
- Sensitivity to the quality of context vector extraction
- Limited adaptation to dataset-specific patterns due to frozen parameters

First Experiments:
1. Compare LVICL performance against frozen LLM with no adaptation on multiple datasets
2. Test different adapter architectures to find optimal balance between efficiency and performance
3. Evaluate sensitivity to example selection and ordering across varying dataset characteristics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Freezing all LLM parameters may limit the model's ability to learn dataset-specific nuances that could improve forecasting accuracy
- The lightweight adapter mechanism introduces a potential bottleneck in information refinement that could constrain performance gains
- The paper does not extensively explore robustness across diverse time-series characteristics such as varying frequencies, missing data patterns, or non-stationary behaviors

## Confidence
- Performance claims (High): The experimental results are well-documented and reproducible, though limited in scope
- Efficiency claims (Medium): GPU memory savings are demonstrated, but comprehensive scalability analysis is absent
- Robustness claims (Low): Limited exploration of diverse time-series characteristics and real-world deployment scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LVICL's performance across time-series with varying characteristics (e.g., different frequencies, missing data, non-stationarity) to assess robustness
2. Conduct scalability tests with larger LLMs and longer forecasting horizons to validate computational efficiency claims
3. Perform ablation studies on the adapter mechanism to quantify its impact on forecasting accuracy and identify potential bottlenecks
