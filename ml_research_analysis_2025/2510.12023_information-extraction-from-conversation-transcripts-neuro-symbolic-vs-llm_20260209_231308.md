# Information Extraction from Conversation Transcripts: Neuro-Symbolic vs. LLM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12023
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12023
- Reference count: 21
- Neuro-symbolic vs. LLM performance: F1 total 69.4 vs. 52.7; core F1 63.0 vs. 47.2

## Executive Summary
This paper compares a neuro-symbolic and an LLM-based system for extracting structured information from agricultural interview transcripts across pork, dairy, and crop domains. The neuro-symbolic system uses rule-based extraction with syntactic parsing and embedding-based ontology grounding, while the LLM approach employs topic segmentation, in-context learning, and hallucination filtering. Evaluated on nine interviews, the LLM-based system achieved higher performance (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2) with better recall but slower runtime. The neuro-symbolic system was faster, more controllable, and precise for context-free tasks but struggled with generalization and contextual nuances.

## Method Summary
The study compares two information extraction systems on agricultural interview transcripts. The neuro-symbolic system uses a multi-task encoder (POS, NER, dependency parsing) with Odin rules for fragment extraction, dialogue management for context windows, and ontology grounding via embeddings and string matching. The LLM system uses OpenChat 3.5 with temperature=0, in-context learning via Pydantic dataclasses, keyword-based topic segmentation, and a two-stage hallucination filter (type validation plus lexical overlap). Both systems process ASR transcripts through correction and domain segmentation before extraction.

## Key Results
- LLM-based system achieved higher F1 scores (69.4 total, 63.0 core) compared to neuro-symbolic (52.7 total, 47.2 core)
- LLM system had significantly better recall (67.4 vs. 44.6 total; 59.6 vs. 37.4 core) but slower runtime (22,987s vs. 69s on CPU)
- Neuro-symbolic system was 330× faster on CPU and offered better interpretability and control for context-free tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: In-Context Learning with Constrained Decoding
Structured output constraints via schema-guided prompts improve extraction consistency and reduce format errors. Pydantic dataclasses define field types and validation rules; JSON schemas are injected into prompts; constrained decoding forces the LLM to produce valid JSON matching the dataclass structure. Temperature=0 ensures deterministic outputs.

### Mechanism 2: Topic Segmentation Narrows Hallucination Surface
Partitioning long interviews into topic-focused segments reduces hallucinations by constraining expected information types. Keyword-based detection identifies topic shifts (e.g., "barn" signals barn capacity discussion). Each segment presents a smaller context window to the LLM, reducing opportunity for confabulation about unrelated topics.

### Mechanism 3: Two-Stage Verification Filters Invalid Extractions
Post-hoc verification catches type errors and hallucinations that escape prompt-level constraints. Stage 1 validates field types and attempts conversion (e.g., "true" → True). Stage 2 checks string fields for lexical overlap with source text; values with zero overlap are flagged as hallucinations and discarded.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: In-Context Learning (ICL)**
  - Why needed here: The LLM-based system uses zero-shot/few-shot prompting with task descriptions and output schemas, not fine-tuning. Understanding ICL helps diagnose why the model succeeds or fails on unseen phrasings.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how ICL differs from gradient-based fine-tuning, and what happens when the prompt exceeds the model's effective context window?

- **Concept: Constrained Decoding / Grammar-Based Generation**
  - Why needed here: The system uses constrained decoding to force JSON output matching Pydantic schemas. Without this, the LLM might generate prose, markdown, or malformed JSON.
  - Quick check question: What token-level mechanisms enforce constrained decoding, and how does temperature=0 interact with them?

- **Concept: Hallucination Taxonomy and Detection**
  - Why needed here: The paper identifies hallucination as a critical LLM failure mode. Understanding intrinsic vs. extrinsic hallucinations informs filter design choices.
  - Quick check question: Why does lexical overlap filtering fail to catch hallucinations that share common words with the source (e.g., "years" appearing in both source and confabulated output)?

  ```

- **Critical path:** ASR quality → Topic segmentation accuracy → (LLM path) Verification recall. The LLM's F1 gains (69.4 vs. 52.7) depend on segmentation placing relevant content in the same block and verification not over-filtering valid extractions.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **NS:** 330× faster on CPU (69s vs. 22,987s), interpretable rules, easy debugging → but requires labor-intensive rule authoring; low recall (44.6) on conversational variability.
  - **LLM:** +31.6% F1 improvement, faster deployment, schema-driven maintenance → but black-box errors, hallucination risk, GPU dependency (74s vs. 69s NS on same GPU).
  - **Assumption:** The paper evaluates only OpenChat 3.5; larger models or fine-tuned variants may shift these tradeoffs.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **NS:** Silent failures on unseen phrasings (no rule matches); identifier-value mismatches when context spans multiple turns; ontology grounding errors on semantically similar categories (e.g., "Manure Handling" vs. "Manure Storage").
  - **LLM:** Hallucinations that share vocabulary with source (evade overlap filter); segmentation splits relevant information across blocks; black-box debugging requires prompt iteration without clear causality.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Segmentation ablation:** Measure extraction F1 when using oracle (manually correct) segment boundaries vs. keyword-based segmentation to quantify segmentation error contribution.
  2. **Hallucination filter calibration:** Compute precision/recall tradeoff of the overlap filter at different threshold settings (e.g., requiring 2+ shared words instead of 1+).
  3. **Runtime profiling with model scaling:** Test LLaMA-3-70B or Mistral-Large to determine if larger models reduce hallucinations enough to justify slower inference, or if verification remains necessary.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the comparative trade-offs between Neuro-Symbolic and LLM-based systems change when applied to diverse domains and larger datasets beyond agricultural interviews?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section states, "Future work should examine broader domains, additional IE tasks, and diverse model architectures with larger datasets to validate and extend these findings."
- Why unresolved: The study was constrained to a specific domain (agriculture) and a small dataset (9 interviews), making it unclear if the observed efficiency vs. performance trade-offs generalize.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluations of both system types across multiple distinct domains (e.g., legal, medical) and larger corpora.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can semi-automated rule synthesis effectively reduce the manual maintenance burden of Neuro-Symbolic systems without compromising their precision?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 6.1 notes that despite "promising directions in semi-automated rule learning," manual effort and domain expertise remain significant bottlenecks for the NS system.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights resource intensity as a key weakness of the NS approach but does not test methods to mitigate this specific overhead.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study integrating automated rule generation into the NS pipeline and measuring the reduction in human-in-the-loop hours relative to performance retention.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can LLM verification pipelines be enhanced to detect hallucinations in non-string data types, such as boolean flags or numerical values?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Appendix G.2 (Error analysis) highlights that the current verification system "only applies to string-type fields, allowing hallucinations in boolean or integer values to go undetected."
- Why unresolved: The current overlap-based filtering method relies on text matching, which is fundamentally incompatible with non-textual extracted fields.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of verification modules that use logical constraints or range validation for numerical/boolean outputs.

## Limitations

- The study compares only a single LLM (OpenChat 3.5) against a custom neuro-symbolic system, limiting generalizability to other model families or scales.
- The neuro-symbolic system's performance depends heavily on undocumented rule sets, encoder specifications, and ontology definitions, making exact reproduction challenging.
- Hallucination filtering via lexical overlap is incomplete—non-string fields and shared-vocabulary hallucinations can bypass detection, potentially inflating LLM precision scores.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The observed F1 gap (69.4 vs. 52.7 total) and recall improvements (67.4 vs. 44.6) for the LLM system are well-supported by exact-match evaluation on gold annotations.
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about neuro-symbolic advantages in speed (330× faster CPU runtime) and controllability are reproducible but may not hold for all NS architectures or rule sets.
- **Low confidence**: Generalization of trade-offs (e.g., "LLM better for exploratory tasks, NS for context-free tasks") beyond the tested domains and transcripts.

## Next Checks

1. **Segmentation ablation study**: Compare extraction F1 using oracle (manually corrected) topic boundaries versus the proposed keyword-based segmentation to quantify segmentation error impact.
2. **Hallucination filter calibration**: Systematically vary the lexical overlap threshold and measure precision/recall tradeoffs to assess filter effectiveness and false positive/negative rates.
3. **Model scaling experiment**: Test the LLM pipeline with a larger or instruction-tuned model (e.g., LLaMA-3-70B or Mistral-Large) to determine if improved reasoning reduces hallucination rates enough to justify slower inference, or if verification remains essential.
