# A Modular and Multimodal Generative AI Framework for Urban Building Energy Data: Generating Synthetic Homes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.09794
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09794
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces a multimodal generative AI framework that integrates web scraping, image processing, GeoJSON generation, EnergyPlus simulation, and weighted labeling to produce labeled synthetic urban building energy data from public records.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive pipeline for generating labeled synthetic building energy data by combining web scraping, multimodal AI analysis, and physics-based simulation. The framework extracts data and images from public county records, processes them through LLaVA for focused visual analysis, generates EnergyPlus-compatible GeoJSON files via GPT, simulates energy performance, and applies a weighted heuristic labeler. The authors validate their approach through occlusion tests demonstrating LLaVA's focused visual processing and ablation studies showing their weighted labeler effectively balances simulation and text inputs. This methodology addresses critical barriers in urban energy modeling by creating reproducible, privacy-preserving datasets for building energy analysis.

## Method Summary
The framework operates as a five-stage pipeline: (1) Selenium-based web scraping extracts residential data and images from Northampton County's public portal, (2) LLaVA processes building images and floor plans to generate detailed textual descriptions, (3) GPT-4.1-mini converts the LLaVA output and scraped metadata into EnergyPlus-compatible GeoJSON files with estimated building parameters, (4) EnergyPlus simulates energy consumption from the generated IDF files, and (5) a weighted heuristic labeler combines simulation results and GPT-parsed inspection notes to produce final efficiency scores. The pipeline leverages early-fusion visual processing for focused feature extraction and employs an 80/20 weighted combination of simulation and text scores to balance modality bias in labeling.

## Key Results
- LLaVA demonstrated 20% higher mean difference in "roof" cells vs. "non-roof" cells during occlusion testing, indicating focused visual analysis compared to GPT's scattered responses
- Ablation studies showed the weighted labeler (80% simulation, 20% text) produced equitable results that correctly ranked efficient vs. inefficient homes, while unweighted text scoring was heavily skewed
- The pipeline successfully generated labeled synthetic homes from Northampton County data, demonstrating feasibility for cost-effective, reproducible building energy dataset creation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Early-Fusion Visual Grounding for Feature Extraction
The framework achieves superior feature extraction by using LLaVA's early-fusion architecture, where images are converted to visual tokens and prepended to text tokens for joint processing. This forces the model to rely on visual data more heavily to resolve ambiguities, reducing distractibility from irrelevant background features. Occlusion testing validated this approach, showing LLaVA demonstrated focused analysis while late-fusion alternatives scattered responses.

### Mechanism 2: Weighted Multimodal Labeling (Heuristic + Semantic)
The labeler calculates final scores using μ = 0.80η + 0.20λ, combining physics-based simulation (η) with semantic inference from text (λ). This addresses modality bias by leveraging simulation's numerical precision while incorporating text's contextual nuance. Ablation studies confirmed unweighted text scoring was heavily skewed, while the weighted approach produced balanced, accurate rankings.

### Mechanism 3: Structured Proxy Generation for Simulation
GPT-4.1-mini bridges unstructured web data and rigid EnergyPlus requirements by transforming scraped information into GeoJSON format with estimated building parameters. The LLM maps messy real-world descriptions to specific EnergyPlus variables using strict schema guidelines, enabling automated parameter estimation for building physics inputs.

## Foundational Learning

- **EnergyPlus & IDF Files**: Why needed: EnergyPlus is the physics engine; understanding IDF syntax is critical for LLM-generated files. Quick check: Can you identify where `Wall R-value` is defined in a standard IDF file structure?
- **Occlusion Sensitivity (Visual XAI)**: Why needed: Primary validation method to prove LLaVA is analyzing the correct image regions. Quick check: If you occlude the roof and the model's output embedding changes drastically, does that imply the model was or was not relying on the roof initially?
- **Multimodal Ablation Testing**: Why needed: Used to diagnose and fix modality bias in the labeler. Quick check: In an ablation test, if output varies wildly when changing text but stays flat when changing simulation data, which modality is dominating?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: County Web Portal (Selenium Scraper) -> LLaVA (Early Fusion VLM) -> GPT-4.1-mini (LLM) -> GeoJSON -> EnergyPlus -> Weighted Heuristic Labeler
- **Critical path**: The LLM-to-GeoJSON conversion is critical; if GPT fails to produce valid JSON or estimates impossible parameters, the pipeline halts
- **Design tradeoffs**: LLaVA was chosen over GPT-4V for focus over world knowledge; the labeler uses a heuristic formula rather than neural network for determinism and low cost
- **Failure signatures**: JSON syntax errors stall GeoJSON generation; EnergyPlus crashes due to impossible geometry; labels correlate perfectly with text and ignore energy data (weight calibration issue)
- **First 3 experiments**: (1) Run occlusion test on 5 new homes with distinct features to confirm LLaVA focus, (2) Manually inspect 10 random geojson files for parameter drift, (3) Recalculate labels using 50/50 weight instead of 80/20 to observe ranking shifts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the synthetic data generated by this framework effectively train neural networks to recommend energy efficiency retrofits? The paper suggests this as a promising direction but does not attempt to train or evaluate such a downstream model.
- How robust is the pipeline when applied to diverse geographic regions with varying architectural styles? The framework relies exclusively on Northampton County data, leaving generalizability to other regions unproven.
- How accurately do EnergyPlus simulation results derived from synthetic GeoJSON files correlate with actual metered energy consumption? The validation focuses on internal AI reliability rather than physical accuracy against ground truth.

## Limitations

- Data source specificity limits generalizability; the framework's performance is tied to Northampton County's data structure and may not transfer to counties with different schemas
- Vision model generalization remains untested beyond this dataset; LLaVA's superiority for broader urban energy contexts is unproven
- Parameter estimation accuracy lacks independent benchmarks; the LLM's ability to estimate building physics parameters from visual descriptions is validated internally but not against ground truth measurements

## Confidence

- LLaVA Early-Fusion Focus: Medium - Occlusion tests show focused analysis, but broader validation is needed
- Weighted Multimodal Labeling: Medium - Ablation tests show balanced outputs, but the 80/20 ratio is dataset-specific
- LLM-Generated GeoJSON Validity: Low-Medium - Method is described, but accuracy against physical measurements is unbenchmarked
- Pipeline Reproducibility: Medium - Repository provided, but key unknowns could block faithful reproduction

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-County Generalization**: Apply the pipeline to data from a different U.S. county with a distinct data schema and measure success rates for scraping, GeoJSON generation, and simulation convergence
2. **Ground Truth Energy Benchmarking**: For a subset of homes, obtain actual utility bill data and compare EnergyPlus simulation results and weighted labels against these ground truth values to quantify estimation error
3. **Weight Sensitivity Analysis**: Re-run labeling with various weights (60/40, 50/50, 40/60) and analyze how synthetic home rankings by efficiency score change to determine if the 80/20 ratio is optimal
