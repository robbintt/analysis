# Robust Experimental Design via Generalised Bayesian Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07671
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07671
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces Generalised Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (GBOED) that enhances robustness to model misspecification through Gibbs inference and scoring rules

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of model misspecification in Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) by proposing Generalised Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (GBOED). The method extends Gibbs inference to the experimental design setting, using generalised Bayesian inference for robust parameter inference and introducing the Gibbs expected information gain (Gibbs EIG) as a utility function for design selection. The approach employs scoring rules like weighted score matching with inverse multi-quadric kernels to handle outliers and model misspecification. Empirical results across three experimental design problems demonstrate that GBOED enhances robustness to outliers and incorrect noise distributional assumptions compared to traditional BOED, with the Gibbs EIG inducing more exploration of the design space and leading to improved predictive performance under misspecification.

## Method Summary
GBOED extends the Gibbs inference framework to experimental design by replacing the standard likelihood with a scoring rule that provides robustness to model misspecification. The method uses a pseudo-posterior distribution obtained through generalised Bayesian inference with a chosen scoring rule, where the learning rate ω controls the degree of robustness. For design selection, GBOED employs the Gibbs expected information gain (Gibbs EIG) as the utility function, which measures the expected information gain under the generalised posterior. The method uses importance sampling with Nested Monte Carlo estimation to approximate the Gibbs EIG, and Bayesian optimization to select designs sequentially. The scoring rules, particularly weighted score matching with inverse multi-quadric kernels, provide robustness to outliers and heavy-tailed noise distributions that would violate standard Gaussian assumptions.

## Key Results
- GBOED demonstrates improved robustness to outliers and model misspecification compared to traditional BOED across linear regression, pharmacokinetics, and location finding problems
- The Gibbs EIG induces more exploration of the design space, leading to better predictive performance under misspecification scenarios
- Ablation studies show that the Gibbs EIG contributes to better design selection, particularly in higher dimensions where robustness is most critical

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GBOED works by replacing the standard likelihood with a scoring rule that is robust to model misspecification. When the assumed model is incorrect, the scoring rule provides a more stable inference mechanism than the likelihood. The Gibbs framework allows for inference that doesn't rely on the likelihood being the correct data-generating process. By using the Gibbs EIG as the utility function, the method naturally balances exploration and exploitation in a way that accounts for uncertainty about model correctness. The scoring rules, particularly those designed for robustness like weighted score matching, provide a mechanism to downweight the influence of outliers and heavy-tailed noise, which are common sources of model misspecification.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Scoring Rules** - Functions that measure the quality of probabilistic forecasts. Why needed: Provide an alternative to the likelihood that can be robust to model misspecification. Quick check: Verify that the scoring rule satisfies the propriety condition for the chosen generalised posterior.
2. **Generalised Bayesian Inference** - Bayesian inference framework using scoring rules instead of likelihoods. Why needed: Enables inference when the likelihood is misspecified or unreliable. Quick check: Confirm that the pseudo-posterior updates correctly with the scoring rule and learning rate.
3. **Expected Information Gain (EIG)** - Expected reduction in posterior entropy from acquiring new data. Why needed: Standard utility function for experimental design that quantifies information gain. Quick check: Ensure the EIG calculation correctly marginalizes over the design space.
4. **Importance Sampling** - Monte Carlo method for estimating expectations under complex distributions. Why needed: Required for computing EIG when the posterior is intractable. Quick check: Monitor effective sample size to detect poor mixing or high variance.
5. **Nested Monte Carlo (NMC)** - Double-loop Monte Carlo estimation for expected values of expectations. Why needed: Necessary for estimating EIG which involves an expectation over the data space. Quick check: Verify convergence of both inner and outer Monte Carlo loops.
6. **Bayesian Optimization** - Sequential optimization method for expensive black-box functions. Why needed: Efficiently searches the design space to find optimal experimental designs. Quick check: Track acquisition function values to ensure exploration-exploitation balance.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Prior → Scoring Rule → Generalised Posterior → Gibbs EIG → Bayesian Optimization → Design Selection → Data Collection → Posterior Update

### Critical Path
The critical path is: Prior → Scoring Rule → Generalised Posterior → Gibbs EIG → Bayesian Optimization → Design Selection. Each component must function correctly for robust experimental design.

### Design Tradeoffs
The main tradeoff is between robustness and efficiency. More robust scoring rules (like those handling heavy tails) may require more computational resources and careful tuning of the learning rate ω. The choice of scoring rule involves balancing theoretical robustness properties with practical computational considerations and the specific characteristics of the experimental problem.

### Failure Signatures
Common failure modes include: high variance in Gibbs EIG estimates (indicating poor proposal distribution or numerical instability), sensitivity to the choice of learning rate ω, and computational intractability in high-dimensional design spaces. The importance sampling regime can also fail when the statistical model is a poor proposal, leading to unstable estimates.

### First Experiments
1. **Synthetic Linear Regression with Outliers**: Implement GBOED on a simple linear regression problem where 20% of observations are corrupted by heavy-tailed noise, comparing design performance against standard BOED.
2. **Pharmacokinetics Model with Misspecified Noise**: Apply GBOED to a pharmacokinetic model where the assumed Gaussian noise is violated, evaluating predictive accuracy and design quality.
3. **Location Finding with Limited Measurements**: Test GBOED in a sensor placement problem where only a few measurements are possible, examining how the method balances exploration and exploitation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a method for adaptively selecting the learning rate $\omega$ be developed specifically for the sequential experimental design setting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion states that while GBOED relies on a well-chosen learning rate, "we still lack a method suitable for the experimental design setting to select this."
- Why unresolved: Existing methods for selecting $\omega$ in generalized Bayesian inference typically require a dataset to already be available, which contradicts the goal of experimental design where data is yet to be collected.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sequential heuristic or optimization procedure for $\omega$ that maintains robustness and convergence without requiring a pre-existing dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can variational estimators effectively replace the Nested Monte Carlo (NMC) estimator for the Gibbs EIG to improve computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion suggests using "variational estimators" as a "better approximation method" given that the current NMC estimator has a "slow convergence rate."
- Why unresolved: While variational bounds exist for standard Expected Information Gain, a tractable variational bound for the specific Gibbs EIG formulation (involving pseudo-expectations) has not been derived.
- What evidence would resolve it: The derivation of a variational lower bound for the Gibbs EIG that empirically demonstrates faster convergence and lower computational cost than the NMC estimator.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can GBOED be adapted for high-dimensional design spaces using amortized inference or policy networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the framework is "not so easily scalable to complicated and high-dimensional experimental design problems" and suggest "advances in amortisation and learning policies" as a solution.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies on myopic Bayesian optimization and expensive Nested Monte Carlo sampling, both of which scale poorly as dimensionality increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: The successful integration of GBOED with amortized experimental design techniques (e.g., Deep Adaptive Design) showing maintained robustness and tractable runtimes in high-dimensional tasks.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What alternative proposal distributions can mitigate the high variance and numerical instability of the importance sampling regime when the model is misspecified?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion highlights that if the statistical model is not a "suitable proposal," the importance sampling regime "can have repercussions" regarding high variance and instability.
- Why unresolved: The current method uses the statistical model as the proposal distribution, but since GBOED assumes the model is misspecified, this proposal is theoretically suboptimal, leading to potential estimation failure.
- What evidence would resolve it: Identification of a robust proposal distribution (e.g., a tempered or inflated likelihood) that stabilizes the importance weights and reduces the variance of the Gibbs EIG estimator.

## Limitations
- Computational cost of Gibbs inference scales poorly with design space dimensionality, limiting applicability to high-dimensional problems
- Method relies heavily on synthetic experiments with controlled misspecification, which may not fully capture real-world complexity
- Performance and robustness claims depend on careful tuning of the learning rate ω and selection of appropriate scoring rules

## Confidence
- High confidence in the methodological framework and its mathematical soundness
- Medium confidence in the empirical performance claims, particularly for the most complex experimental scenarios
- Low confidence in the scalability analysis and computational efficiency claims for large-scale problems

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark the computational runtime and scalability of GBOED against traditional BOED on problems with increasing design parameter dimensions (e.g., 10, 50, 100 parameters)
2. Test the method on real-world experimental data with known model misspecification to validate the robustness claims
3. Compare different scoring rules within the Gibbs framework to determine sensitivity to scoring rule choice and identify optimal selections for different problem types
