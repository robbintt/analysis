- This paper presents a comprehensive survey of distributed large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs), exploring their advancements, challenges, and future directions.

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines distributed large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs), analyzing how decentralization strategies address scalability and privacy concerns in training, inference, and deployment. The authors categorize over 100 related works into six key areas including distributed training, federated learning, edge computing, and communication efficiency. The paper highlights practical innovations like edge deployment on low-cost devices and parameter-efficient techniques while identifying critical challenges such as hallucination and data heterogeneity. It outlines future research directions emphasizing novel strategies at the intersection of distributed learning and MLLMs to enhance robustness and applicability across various domains.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes research across distributed/federated LLMs and MLLMs by analyzing approximately 100 works across six categories: distributed training, distributed inference and optimization, distributed computing infrastructures, federated learning and fine-tuning, edge computing and mobile intelligence, and communication efficiency. The authors describe the federated LLM pipeline where servers broadcast global models to clients, clients perform local fine-tuning using parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA, and servers aggregate updates via weighted averaging. Optimization is framed as minimizing the weighted sum of local objectives across clients. The survey summarizes various benchmarks including Fed-Aya, Fed-ChatbotIT, and Fed-WildChat, with common evaluation metrics including perplexity, Rouge-L, inference latency, throughput, communication cost, and GPU memory utilization.

## Key Results
- The survey identifies six key research areas in distributed LLMs and MLLMs, providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the field
- It highlights practical innovations like edge deployment on low-cost devices and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques
- The authors identify critical challenges including hallucination, data heterogeneity, and the need for novel strategies at the intersection of distributed learning and MLLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of distributed approaches stems from their ability to address fundamental limitations of centralized LLM deployment. By distributing computation across multiple devices or locations, these methods reduce the computational burden on individual systems while preserving privacy through local data processing. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA enable adaptation to specific domains without full model retraining, making deployment on resource-constrained devices feasible. Federated learning frameworks allow collaborative model improvement while keeping sensitive data localized, addressing both scalability and privacy concerns simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning

**Federated Learning Pipeline**: The process where a central server coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without sharing raw data. Why needed: Enables privacy-preserving collaborative learning across distributed data sources. Quick check: Can you trace the flow from model initialization to aggregation across clients?

**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: Techniques like LoRA and adapters that modify a small subset of model parameters for task adaptation. Why needed: Reduces computational requirements for fine-tuning large models on edge devices. Quick check: Do you understand how LoRA modifies weight matrices through low-rank decomposition?

**Non-IID Data Distribution**: When data across clients follows different distributions rather than being independent and identically distributed. Why needed: Real-world federated learning scenarios rarely have uniform data distributions across devices. Quick check: Can you identify how data heterogeneity affects model convergence in federated settings?

**Communication Efficiency**: Techniques to reduce the bandwidth and frequency of communication between clients and servers. Why needed: Network constraints are often the bottleneck in federated learning systems. Quick check: Do you understand the trade-offs between compression quality and communication overhead?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Sources -> Client Devices -> Local Training -> Parameter Updates -> Server Aggregation -> Global Model -> Client Devices. The critical path follows: Local Training -> Parameter Updates -> Server Aggregation.

**Critical Path**: The sequence of operations that determines overall system latency, consisting of local fine-tuning on clients, communication of parameter updates, and server-side aggregation. This path is most sensitive to client computational capacity and network bandwidth.

**Design Tradeoffs**: There is a fundamental tension between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Full-parameter fine-tuning yields better performance but requires significantly more resources than parameter-efficient methods. Similarly, more frequent communication improves convergence but increases network overhead.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include convergence failure with non-IID data distributions, out-of-memory errors on resource-constrained devices, and communication bottlenecks in cross-silo settings. These typically manifest as training stalls, increasing loss values, or extended synchronization times.

**First Experiments**:
1. Set up FederatedScope-LLM with 10 simulated clients to fine-tune LLaMA-2-7B using LoRA on Alpaca dataset, measuring convergence speed and final Rouge-L score.
2. Compare communication efficiency of different compression techniques (top-k, quantization) under varying network conditions using FedLLM-Bench datasets.
3. Test edge deployment feasibility by running FedVA on a low-cost device (Raspberry Pi or similar) with a small LLM variant, measuring inference latency and memory utilization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided text.

## Limitations
- The survey synthesizes results across heterogeneous methods without unified benchmarks, making direct comparison difficult
- Many surveyed works lack rigorous evaluation on real-world edge devices or under realistic network constraints
- The field is rapidly evolving with new approaches emerging monthly, potentially making the survey's snapshot outdated within months

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The taxonomy of six research areas and identification of core challenges (scalability, privacy, communication efficiency) is well-supported by the literature.

**Medium confidence**: Claims about the effectiveness of federated approaches for edge deployment are supported by individual studies but lack large-scale deployment evidence.

**Low confidence**: Predictions about future directions are speculative given the field's rapid evolution and unknown technical breakthroughs.

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce federated fine-tuning on a standard benchmark (e.g., FedLLM-Bench) to verify claimed performance improvements over centralized training.

2. Conduct controlled experiments comparing communication efficiency across different compression techniques under varying network conditions.

3. Test the scalability limits of distributed inference approaches by measuring performance degradation as the number of edge devices increases.
