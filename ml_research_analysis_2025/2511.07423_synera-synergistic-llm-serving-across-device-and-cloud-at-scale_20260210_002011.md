# Synera: Synergistic LLM Serving across Device and Cloud at Scale

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07423
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07423
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 1.20-5.47× better generation quality than baselines with comparable latency, reducing cloud serving cost by 8.2-16.5%

## Executive Summary
Synera addresses the challenge of deploying LLMs on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices by introducing a device-cloud synergistic system. Instead of either offloading entire queries to the cloud (communication bottleneck) or using small on-device models (quality sacrifice), Synera selectively offloads only quality-critical tokens from a small on-device language model (SLM) to a cloud-based LLM for verification and refinement. The system uses a dual-metric approach combining confidence and attention-based importance scores to make offloading decisions, implements progressive early exit to reduce device overhead, and employs stall-free parallel inference to overlap device and cloud computation. Extensive evaluations show Synera achieves significant quality improvements while maintaining comparable latency and reducing cloud serving costs.

## Method Summary
Synera implements a four-component system for device-cloud LLM serving. The selective offloading mechanism uses confidence scores (top-1 probability) as a coarse filter and attention-based importance scores as a fine-grained filter to identify quality-critical tokens for cloud verification. Progressive early exit inference allows the SLM to terminate generation early when confident, reducing computation. Stall-free parallel inference enables the device to speculatively continue generation in parallel with cloud verification, masking communication latency. The verification-aware scheduler treats verification requests as partial prefills, allowing continuous batching in the cloud runtime without pipeline stalls. The system is implemented with ~3k lines of code on the device (Transformer/mllm) and ~2k lines on the cloud (Sarathi-Serve).

## Key Results
- Achieves 1.20-5.47× better generation quality (BERTScore/Rouge) than competitive baselines with comparable latency
- Reduces cloud serving cost by 8.2-16.5% compared to cloud-only serving through selective offloading
- Maintains stall-free parallel inference with 31-38% rejection position prediction hit rates
- Demonstrates effectiveness across multiple tasks (summarization, QA) and model pairs (Llama, Falcon, Yi)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Metric Selective Offloading
The system employs a cascading filter where Confidence Score ($P_{conf}$) acts as a coarse-grained filter, retaining high-confidence tokens locally, while Importance Score ($P_{imp}$) derived from attention matrix column-wise summation identifies quality-critical tokens among uncertain tokens. This optimizes the accuracy-latency-cost trade-off by offloading only tokens that will significantly impact generation quality.

### Mechanism 2: Stall-free Parallel Inference via Rejection Prediction
The device runs Parallel Inference (PI), speculatively continuing generation from a predicted rejection position while the cloud verifies the original draft. If the prediction matches the cloud's actual rejection point, the pre-generated branch is adopted, masking communication and verification latency through speculative execution.

### Mechanism 3: Verification-Aware Cloud Scheduling
The scheduler treats verification requests as "partial prefills" - computing KV caches for uncached tokens followed by forward passes for pending verification tokens. This allows reusing existing continuous batching logic (like vLLM/Sarathi) to maintain high throughput without pipeline bubbles when handling intermittent verification requests.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Speculative Decoding (Draft & Verify)**
Why needed: Synera extends speculative decoding across device-cloud boundaries. Understanding the draft-then-verify loop and rejection sampling criterion is essential to grasp how Synera modifies this for partial offloading.
Quick check: Explain why standard speculative decoding guarantees output distribution matches the target LLM, and how Synera modifies the "draft" phase.

**Concept: Attention Mechanism & Importance Scores**
Why needed: The system calculates "Importance Score" from the attention matrix ($QK^T$) to determine offloading priority.
Quick check: Given an attention matrix, how would you compute the "importance" of a specific token, and what does a high column-sum imply about that token's role?

**Concept: Continuous Batching & PagedAttention**
Why needed: The cloud runtime integrates with systems like vLLM/Sarathi. Understanding continuous batching and KV cache management is required to understand the "Verification-aware Scheduler."
Quick check: In continuous batching, how does the scheduler handle new incoming prefill requests without interrupting ongoing decoding steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Device Runtime -> Cloud Runtime
(SLM, Progressive Inference, Selective Offloader, Parallel Inference) -> (LLM, Request Pool, Verification-aware Scheduler)

**Critical path:**
1. Local Draft: SLM generates tokens; Progressive Inference checks for early exit
2. Selection: Calculate Confidence/Importance. If quality-critical, compress and transmit to Cloud
3. Parallelism: While Cloud verifies, Device starts Parallel Inference based on predicted rejection position
4. Cloud Schedule: Verification requests are batched as partial prefills
5. Merge: Device receives verification result; merges PI branch if prediction was correct

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Offloading Budget ($i_{th}$): Tuning trades cloud serving cost for generation quality; ~0.2 cited as sweet spot
- PI Speculation: Increases device energy consumption and code complexity to mask network latency
- Compression: Aggressive compression saves bandwidth but assumes top-k/p sampling sufficiency

**Failure signatures:**
- Latency spikes: Network bandwidth <1 Mbps, compression disabled, or $i_{th}$ too high
- Quality degradation: Poor $P_{imp}$ correlation with task performance or premature sequence-wise early exit
- Pipeline stalls: Low rejection position prediction hit rate (<20%) causing wasted PI branches

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Threshold Profiling: Run offline profiler on specific SLM-LLM pair to map offloading budget vs BERTScore/Rouge score relationship
2. Ablation of Parallel Inference: Measure Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) with PI enabled vs disabled under 10 Mbps bandwidth to quantify stall-masking benefit
3. Scheduler Throughput: Stress test cloud runtime with increasing devices (req/s) and varying offloading budgets (0.3 vs 0.9) to observe verification latency scaling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the evaluation suggests several areas for future work including privacy-preserving mechanisms integration, dynamic threshold adaptation, and generalization to non-Transformer architectures.

## Limitations
- Model Dependency: Performance critically depends on specific SLM-LLM pair alignment; attention-based importance scoring may not generalize across diverse architectures
- Static Thresholds: Relies on offline profiled thresholds that may not adapt well to domain shifts or varying task complexities during deployment
- Communication Assumptions: Stall-free benefits assume sufficient network bandwidth; severe constraints (<1 Mbps) may degrade latency significantly

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Core architectural components are technically sound with well-supported experimental results showing 1.20-5.47× quality improvements and 8.2-16.5% cost reduction across multiple tasks and model pairs.

**Medium Confidence:** Attention-based importance scoring mechanism is intuitive and supported by evidence, but relies on assumptions about SLM-LLM attention pattern alignment that need broader validation.

**Low Confidence:** System robustness to extreme network conditions and adversarial inputs is not thoroughly explored; comprehensive failure analysis and fallback mechanisms are lacking.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-Architecture Validation: Test Synera with a non-Transformer SLM (e.g., Mamba-130M) paired with a cloud LLM to evaluate attention-based importance scoring generalization beyond Transformers.

2. Dynamic Threshold Adaptation: Implement online threshold adjustment that updates $c_{th}, i_{th},$ and $\alpha$ based on recent verification outcomes, comparing against static offline profiling in non-stationary environments.

3. Extreme Bandwidth Stress Test: Systematically evaluate performance under bandwidth constraints from 100 Mbps down to 100 Kbps to identify the minimum viable bandwidth for maintaining quality-latency trade-offs.
