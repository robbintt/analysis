  humidity, CO2, VOCs, PM2.5, and PM10) inside a trout facility using an Awair HOME
  monitor over 84 days. The dataset, publicly available on Figshare, contains over
  23,000 quality-controlled observations sampled every five minutes, with 99.7% completeness.

# AQUAIR: A High-Resolution Indoor Environmental Quality Dataset for Smart Aquaculture Monitoring

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24069
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: 84-day high-resolution IEQ dataset (CO2, VOCs, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, humidity) from trout facility, 99.7% completeness, publicly available on Figshare

## Executive Summary
AQUAIR is a novel high-resolution Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) dataset collected inside a commercial trout facility over 84 days, capturing six key variables at 5-minute intervals. The dataset addresses the scarcity of long-term, high-frequency IEQ data in aquaculture, offering rich temporal structure for short-horizon forecasting, anomaly detection, and sensor drift studies. Collected using an Awair HOME monitor, the dataset includes over 23,000 quality-controlled observations, with stable median conditions and distinct feeding-time peaks. The authors provide an open-source preprocessing pipeline and publicly release the data on Figshare, positioning AQUAIR as a benchmark for machine learning research in smart aquaculture monitoring.

## Method Summary
The AQUAIR dataset was collected in a commercial trout facility using an Awair HOME (AQM-8002A) sensor, placed according to ISO 16000-1 guidelines at 1.5 meters height and centrally in the room. Data were logged every 5 minutes for 84 days (14 Oct 2024 – 9 Jan 2025), yielding 23,856 observations across two CSV files. A quality-controlled preprocessing pipeline normalized timestamps, anchored data to a strict 5-minute grid, interpolated single-channel gaps ≤10 minutes, applied Hampel filter outlier detection, and enforced sensor operating ranges. The result is a 99.7% complete, analysis-ready dataset with flagged anomalies, publicly available on Figshare.

## Key Results
- 99.7% data completeness after preprocessing with minimal interpolation (<10 min gaps)
- Stable median conditions: CO2 = 758 ppm, PM2.5 = 12 µg/m³, temperature = 15.9°C
- Pronounced feeding-time peaks in CO2, VOC, and PM levels; strong negative temp-RH correlation (ρ = -0.64)
- High collinearity between PM2.5 and PM10 (ρ = 0.91), moderate CO2-VOC correlation (ρ = 0.48)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: High-frequency (5-minute) sampling captures structured diurnal and event-driven variations suitable for short-horizon forecasting.
- Mechanism: The 5-minute cadence (12 samples/hour) resolves feeding-time peaks (08:00–10:00) and cleaning events (18:00–20:00), producing autocorrelated time series with predictable periodic components that time-series models can exploit.
- Core assumption: The observed patterns (temperature peaks, CO2/VOC/PM rises) are recurrent and not artifacts of transient external factors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Exploratory statistics show stable conditions with pronounced feeding-time peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting."
  - [section] "Mean 24-h profiles reveal a clear mid-afternoon temperature peak (∼16.4°C)... CO2, VOC and both PM fractions rise sharply after the morning feeding (08:00–10:00) and evening cleaning (18:00–20:00)."
  - [corpus] Related aquaculture datasets (SOLAQUA) focus on underwater robotics rather than IEQ temporal dynamics; no direct corpus comparison for forecasting benchmarks.
- Break condition: If future deployments show irregular or non-recurrent event timing, short-horizon forecasting accuracy degrades without external event labels.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Correlated IEQ variables enable multi-variate modeling and anomaly detection through shared source attribution.
- Mechanism: Human activity (feeding, cleaning, maintenance) simultaneously elevates CO2, VOC, and PM fractions; temperature and humidity inversely covary (ρ = −0.64). Models can leverage these correlations for imputation, cross-validation, and contextual anomaly detection.
- Core assumption: Correlations reflect underlying physical/operational causality and are not spurious or device-specific.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Spearman matrix confirms expected relationships: temperature vs. RH is strongly negative (ρ = −0.64); PM2.5 and PM10 are nearly collinear (ρ = 0.91); and CO2 moderately covaries with VOC (ρ = 0.48), reflecting shared human-activity sources."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence for IEQ correlation structures in aquaculture; most datasets focus on water quality, not head-space dynamics.
- Break condition: If ventilation patterns or occupancy schedules change significantly, learned correlation structures may shift, requiring retraining or domain adaptation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Quality-controlled pre-processing preserves data integrity while maintaining temporal resolution.
- Mechanism: The pipeline (timestamp normalization → 5-minute grid anchoring → linear interpolation for ≤10-min gaps → Hampel filter outlier detection → range tests) removes artifacts without aggressive smoothing, yielding 99.7% completeness with flagged anomalies.
- Core assumption: Linear interpolation for short gaps and median-based outlier correction do not distort underlying dynamics for downstream ML tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Open-source processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and exports analysis-ready tables."
  - [section] "Missing-value treatment: single-channel gaps of 10 min or less are linearly interpolated. Longer gaps are left as NaN and flagged."
  - [corpus] No corpus comparison for QC pipelines specific to aquaculture IEQ; general IEQ datasets in buildings use similar approaches.
- Break condition: If sensor drift is non-linear or gaps exceed interpolation thresholds, downstream models may inherit biased or incomplete inputs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Time-series stationarity and seasonality**
  - Why needed here: Forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet) assume or exploit periodic patterns; understanding stationarity informs model selection and preprocessing (differencing, detrending).
  - Quick check question: Given the diurnal CO2 peaks at feeding times, would you expect this series to be stationary? What transformation might help?

- **Sensor drift and calibration transfer**
  - Why needed here: Consumer-grade sensors (Awair HOME) may drift over 84 days; recognizing drift signatures vs. true environmental changes is critical for anomaly detection.
