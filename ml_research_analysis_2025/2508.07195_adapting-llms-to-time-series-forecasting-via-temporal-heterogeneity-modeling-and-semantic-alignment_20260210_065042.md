# Adapting LLMs to Time Series Forecasting via Temporal Heterogeneity Modeling and Semantic Alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.07195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07195
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: TALON achieves up to 11% MSE improvement by dynamically routing time series segments to specialized experts and aligning them with LLM-compatible representations

## Executive Summary
TALON addresses the challenge of adapting large language models to time series forecasting by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment. The method partitions multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments and dynamically routes each to specialized experts, enabling localized modeling of diverse temporal patterns. A Semantic Alignment Module then aligns continuous time series features with LLM-compatible representations via contrastive learning, eliminating the need for handcrafted prompts during inference. Evaluated on seven real-world benchmarks, TALON consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 11% improvement in mean squared error. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and robust performance across different LLM backbones, validating its effectiveness and flexibility in modeling complex, heterogeneous temporal dynamics.

## Method Summary
TALON introduces a novel framework for adapting large language models to time series forecasting by addressing temporal heterogeneity through dynamic expert routing and semantic alignment. The method partitions multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, each routed to specialized experts for localized modeling. A Semantic Alignment Module then bridges the gap between continuous time series features and LLM-compatible representations via contrastive learning, removing the need for handcrafted prompts. Evaluated across seven real-world benchmarks, TALON demonstrates consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art baselines, with up to 11% improvement in mean squared error, strong zero-shot generalization, and robustness across different LLM backbones.

## Key Results
- TALON achieves up to 11% improvement in mean squared error compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- Demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and robust performance across different LLM backbones
- Consistent outperformance across seven real-world benchmark datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TALON leverages the natural heterogeneity in time series by segmenting them into coherent temporal units and routing each to specialized experts. This allows localized modeling of diverse temporal patterns, which is more effective than treating all segments identically. The Semantic Alignment Module uses contrastive learning to map continuous time series features to LLM-compatible representations, removing the need for handcrafted prompts. This dual approach—temporal segmentation with expert routing and semantic alignment—enables LLMs to better understand and forecast complex, heterogeneous time series data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal heterogeneity**: Time series often contain segments with different underlying patterns or structures; modeling them uniformly can miss important dynamics. Quick check: Identify distinct regimes in a sample time series (e.g., periods of stability vs. rapid change).
- **Dynamic expert routing**: Assigning different segments to specialized experts allows for more accurate local modeling. Quick check: Verify that segments with similar patterns are routed to the same expert.
- **Contrastive learning for alignment**: Aligning continuous time series features with discrete LLM embeddings improves compatibility and reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. Quick check: Measure embedding similarity before and after alignment.
- **Zero-shot generalization**: The ability to perform well on unseen data or tasks without additional fine-tuning. Quick check: Test performance on a held-out dataset or new domain.
- **LLM backbone flexibility**: Ensuring the method works across different large language model architectures. Quick check: Swap the LLM backbone and compare results.
- **Statistical significance testing**: Confirming that performance improvements are not due to random chance. Quick check: Apply paired t-tests or bootstrapping to benchmark results.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Raw time series → Temporal Segmentation → Dynamic Expert Routing → Expert Outputs → Semantic Alignment Module → LLM-compatible Embeddings → Forecasting

**Critical path**: Temporal Segmentation → Dynamic Expert Routing → Semantic Alignment Module → Forecasting. This path is critical because it directly determines how well the method captures and models temporal heterogeneity and aligns it with LLM representations.

**Design tradeoffs**: The choice between more granular segmentation (better local modeling) and fewer segments (reduced complexity and computational cost). The use of contrastive learning for alignment versus supervised or heuristic methods. The selection of the number and type of expert models versus a single monolithic model.

**Failure signatures**: Poor segmentation leading to misaligned expert routing and degraded forecasting accuracy. Ineffective semantic alignment causing mismatch between time series features and LLM embeddings. Overfitting to specific temporal patterns, reducing generalization. High computational overhead due to excessive segmentation or routing complexity.

**First experiments**:
1. Validate segmentation quality by visualizing and clustering segmented time series to ensure coherent patterns.
2. Test expert routing accuracy by confirming that segments with similar dynamics are consistently assigned to the same expert.
3. Evaluate semantic alignment effectiveness by measuring embedding similarity and downstream forecasting performance before and after alignment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The selection of evaluation datasets is narrow, and the study does not address potential domain shift or performance in extreme imbalance scenarios.
- No comparative analysis of computational overhead is provided, which is critical for practical deployment.

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed statistical significance testing to confirm robustness of performance gains across repeated trials.
- Limited ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of temporal segmentation, expert routing, and semantic alignment modules.
- Narrow dataset selection and absence of testing under extreme imbalance or domain shift scenarios.

## Confidence
- **High**: Architectural novelty and demonstrated flexibility across LLM backbones.
- **Medium**: Claims about absolute performance superiority and scalability, due to limited statistical validation and broader domain testing.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests, bootstrapped confidence intervals) across all benchmark results to confirm robustness of performance gains.
2. Perform large-scale ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of temporal segmentation, expert routing, and semantic alignment modules.
3. Evaluate TALON on additional diverse time series domains (e.g., finance, healthcare, sensor networks) and test performance under extreme class imbalance and domain shift scenarios.
