# Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Retinal OCT Images: A UK Biobank Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05106
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05106
- Authors: Yasemin Turkan; F. Boray Tek; M. Serdar Nazlı; Öykü Eren
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: ResNet-34 achieved highest stability with AUC 0.62 for 4-year pre-diagnosis AD prediction

## Executive Summary
This study pioneers the application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scan images for early Alzheimer's disease detection using the UK Biobank dataset. The authors developed a pipeline leveraging pretrained models including ImageNet-based networks and the OCT-specific RETFound transformer, evaluated through subject-level cross-validation. To address dataset limitations, they implemented standard and OCT-specific augmentations alongside a novel year-weighted loss function prioritizing cases diagnosed within four years of imaging. While ResNet-34 achieved the highest stability with an AUC of 0.62 in the 4-year cohort, the results indicate OCT's potential for AD prediction while highlighting the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

## Method Summary
The study employed a deep learning pipeline processing raw OCT B-scan images from UK Biobank participants. Multiple pretrained models were tested, including ImageNet-based networks and the OCT-specific RETFound transformer. Subject-level cross-validation was used to evaluate model performance. To combat overfitting in the small dataset, the researchers applied both standard and OCT-specific data augmentations. A novel year-weighted loss function was introduced to prioritize cases diagnosed within four years of imaging. The best-performing model, ResNet-34, achieved an AUC of 0.62 for detecting AD cases within the 4-year prediction window.

## Key Results
- ResNet-34 achieved highest stability with AUC of 0.62 in 4-year AD prediction cohort
- Year-weighted loss function prioritized cases diagnosed within four years of imaging
- OCT-specific RETFound transformer underperformed compared to ImageNet-based models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study leverages structural retinal changes detectable by OCT imaging that precede clinical Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Retinal neurodegeneration, vascular changes, and inflammatory processes manifest as measurable alterations in OCT B-scan layers before cognitive symptoms appear. The year-weighted loss function specifically targets the critical window where these changes become detectable but precede clinical manifestation, while data augmentations help models generalize from limited samples by simulating various imaging conditions and pathological presentations.

## Foundational Learning
- OCT B-scan interpretation: Essential for understanding how retinal layers correlate with neurodegenerative processes; quick check: identify major retinal layers and their pathological changes
- Deep learning transfer learning: Critical for adapting pretrained models to medical imaging; quick check: compare performance of ImageNet vs OCT-specific pretraining
- Subject-level cross-validation: Necessary for preventing data leakage in medical studies; quick check: verify train/test splits maintain subject independence
- Year-weighted loss functions: Novel approach for prioritizing near-term predictions; quick check: analyze impact on early vs late diagnosis prediction
- OCT-specific data augmentation: Addresses domain-specific challenges; quick check: evaluate augmentation impact on model robustness

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Raw OCT B-scans -> Preprocessing -> Pretrained Model (ResNet-34) -> Year-weighted Loss -> Classification Output

Critical path: OCT image acquisition -> Model inference -> AD probability score within 4-year window

Design tradeoffs: The study prioritized model stability over peak performance, choosing ResNet-34 for consistent results rather than higher-variance models. This conservative approach favors clinical applicability but may miss optimal performance.

Failure signatures: Low AUC suggests limited predictive power from OCT alone, potentially due to:
- Insufficient sample size (124 AD cases)
- 4-year window missing earlier pathological changes
- OCT capturing only subset of AD biomarkers
- Lack of multimodal integration

First experiments:
1. Test model performance across different pre-diagnosis windows (2-year, 6-year) to identify optimal prediction timeframe
2. Compare saliency maps with known AD retinal biomarkers to validate model attention
3. Evaluate impact of additional OCT layers (ganglion cell complex, RPE) on prediction accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

Open Question 1
- Question: Would external validation on independent cohorts with longitudinal AD outcomes improve the generalizability of OCT-based prediction models beyond the UK Biobank?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "external validation remains a critical next step. However, to the best of our knowledge, no publicly available OCT datasets exist that include both retinal imaging and longitudinal Alzheimer's disease outcomes, making such validation infeasible."
- Why unresolved: No publicly available OCT datasets with longitudinal AD outcomes exist for external validation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validation on independent clinical cohorts with OCT imaging and AD diagnosis follow-up data.

Open Question 2
- Question: Can multimodal integration (combining OCT with angiography, cognitive testing, or demographic data) significantly improve early AD prediction accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "further improvements could be achieved through ensembling, multimodal integration (e.g., OCT angiography, cognitive testing), or temporal modeling of longitudinal scans."
- Why unresolved: This study deliberately excluded demographic confounders to isolate structural retinal features; multimodal combinations were not tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing AUC improvements when combining OCT with other modalities on matched cohorts.

Open Question 3
- Question: Do retinal biomarkers detected by deep learning correlate with gold-standard AD biomarkers (amyloid PET, CSF tau)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "clinical validation against gold-standard biomarkers (e.g., amyloid PET and CSF tau) is necessary to establish OCT's role in preclinical AD screening."
- Why unresolved: UK Biobank lacks paired PET/CSF data for the OCT-scanned AD cohort.
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analysis between model saliency regions and amyloid/tau burden in patients with both OCT and gold-standard biomarker data.

Open Question 4
- Question: Can temporal modeling of longitudinal OCT scans capture disease progression patterns that improve early detection beyond single time-point classification?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study used only single baseline scans; the authors mention "temporal modeling of longitudinal scans" as a potential improvement.
- Why unresolved: Dataset limitations prevented analysis of scan progression over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies using multiple OCT scans per subject with temporal models (e.g., RNNs) showing improved prediction compared to baseline-only approaches.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (124 AD cases) limits statistical power and generalizability
- 4-year pre-diagnosis window may miss earlier pathological changes detectable with different imaging approaches
- Modest AUC of 0.62 indicates OCT alone captures only subset of AD biomarkers

| OCT-specific foundation models advantage | Low |
| 4-year prediction window validity | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on independent validation cohorts with diverse demographic representation to assess generalizability beyond UK Biobank participants
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual OCT layer contributions to AD prediction and compare performance with multimodal approaches incorporating cognitive scores and demographic data
3. Perform temporal analysis using longitudinal OCT data to identify progressive retinal changes preceding clinical AD diagnosis by more than 4 years
