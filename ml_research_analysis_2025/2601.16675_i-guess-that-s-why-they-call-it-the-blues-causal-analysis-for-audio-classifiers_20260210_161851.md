# I Guess That's Why They Call it the Blues: Causal Analysis for Audio Classifiers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.16675
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16675
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: Identifies frequency subsets sufficient, necessary, and complete for audio classification using causal analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FreqReX, a novel causality-based method for analyzing audio classifiers by identifying frequency subsets that are sufficient, necessary, and complete for specific classifications. The approach uses Fourier Transform analysis to decompose audio signals into their causal components without requiring model access beyond input-output observation. Experiments demonstrate that FreqReX can manipulate audio classifications by altering minimal frequency components—just one out of approximately 240,000 frequencies suffices to change classification 58% of the time, with changes as small as imperceptible amplitude adjustments.

## Method Summary
FreqReX operates on audio signals by computing their Fourier Transform (F(x)), partitioning the frequency space into subsets, and iteratively querying the black-box model to identify frequencies with high causal responsibility for the classification outcome. The algorithm converges on minimal sufficient sets (preserving classification), necessary sets (changing classification when removed), and complete sets (matching original confidence). Once identified, these frequencies can be manipulated through amplitude or phase changes to alter the model's output, with STFT-based attacks enabling temporally localized, often imperceptible perturbations.

## Key Results
- Single frequency changes (out of ~240,000) alter classification 58% of the time
- Five frequency changes achieve 78% classification success rate
- STFT-based perturbations succeed on 62% of attacked audio while remaining imperceptible
- 5-20% of frequency space suffices for classification across different models
- Sufficient frequencies vary across models, indicating different reasoning processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: FreqReX identifies frequency subsets that are causally sufficient, necessary, and complete for a given audio classification.
- **Mechanism**: The algorithm partitions the Fourier Transform (F) of the signal into subsets, queries the black-box model on reconstructed audio from each subset, computes approximate causal responsibility for each frequency, and iteratively refines until it converges on minimal sets that satisfy sufficiency (minimal subset preserving classification), necessity (removing it changes classification), and completeness (matches original confidence score).
- **Core assumption**: Frequencies are causally independent as data elements, even if they are correlated in real-world audio signals.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "uses causal reasoning to discover features of the frequency space that are sufficient and necessary for a given classification"
  - [section 3] Defines sufficient subset as S ⊆ F(x) such that N(F⁻¹(S)) = N(x) with minimality requirement
  - [corpus] Related work on causal dataset biases (arxiv:2509.04295) supports causal analysis for robustness, but no direct validation of frequency-level causal independence.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Altering a single frequency (out of ~240,000) changes classification 58% of the time, demonstrating concentrated model sensitivity.
- **Mechanism**: After identifying sufficient frequencies ranked by responsibility, Algorithm 2 applies progressively larger mutations (amplitude shifts, phase changes) starting with the highest-responsibility frequency. If one frequency fails, it adds the next most responsible. Once classification changes, it backtracks to minimize mutation magnitude.
- **Core assumption**: The sufficient frequency set contains the model's decision-critical features; manipulating these directly affects the decision boundary.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "a change to one out of 240,000 frequencies results in a change in classification 58% of the time"
  - [section 5] Algorithm 2 details the Fourier Attack procedure with ranked frequencies and mutation minimization
  - [corpus] "Attacker's Noise Can Manipulate Your Audio-based LLM" (arxiv:2507.06256) demonstrates similar audio manipulation vulnerabilities.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) enables temporally localized, often imperceptible perturbations that change classification 62% of the time on successfully attacked audio.
- **Mechanism**: Algorithm 3 maps FFT-identified critical frequencies to STFT frequency bins, orders time frames by amplitude of those frequencies, and applies mutations frame-by-frame until classification changes. Smaller frame sizes enable finer temporal targeting.
- **Core assumption**: Critical frequencies vary in importance over time; localizing perturbations reduces perceptibility while maintaining effectiveness.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 6.1] STFT attacks succeed on 62% of previously attacked audio; Figure 4 shows "imperceptible" change from 'calm' to 'sad'
  - [section 4] Mentions STFT enables "smaller manipulations to the input (to the extent of not being audible)"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Actual Causality (Halpern 2019)**
  - **Why needed here**: FreqReX adapts formal causal responsibility definitions to identify which frequencies "cause" a classification outcome, distinguishing between necessity and sufficiency.
  - **Quick check question**: If removing frequency f changes the classification from A to B, is f sufficient for A, necessary for A, or neither?

- **Concept: Fourier Transform and Inverse Transform**
  - **Why needed here**: FreqReX operates in frequency domain (F(x)), manipulates subsets, then reconstructs audio via inverse transform (F⁻¹(S)). Understanding this bidirectional mapping is essential.
  - **Quick check question**: If you zero out 99% of frequencies in F(x) and apply F⁻¹, what information is lost vs. preserved?

- **Concept: Occlusion-Based Attribution**
  - **Why needed here**: FreqReX's responsibility calculation is occlusion-based—it removes frequency subsets and observes classification changes. This differs from gradient-based methods.
  - **Quick check question**: Why might occlusion-based attribution be more suitable for black-box models than gradient-based methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: FFT Preprocessing -> Responsibility Calculator -> Sufficiency/Necessity Finder -> Attack Module -> Reconstruction
- **Critical path**: Responsibility calculation → Ranking → Sufficient set identification → Mutation application
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Partition size p: Smaller partitions = finer-grained responsibility but more model queries
  - Chain length: Longer chains = more confidence in sufficiency but higher compute cost
  - Frame size in STFT: Smaller frames = finer temporal control but lossier frequency mapping
  - EMD threshold ε: Smaller = stricter convergence but may never terminate
- **Failure signatures**:
  - EMD never converges below ε → increase ε or set max iterations
  - Single-frequency attack success <20% → try larger initial mutations or multi-frequency attacks
  - STFT reconstruction artifacts → check padding/overlap settings
  - Sufficient signal classified differently than original → increase chain length requirement
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline responsibility validation**: Run FreqReX on 10 audio samples from different genres, verify that identified sufficient signals are classified identically to originals.
  2. **Single-frequency attack sweep**: For each model, attempt single-frequency attacks on 100 correctly classified samples. Report success rate and correlate with sufficiency percentage.
  3. **STFT frame size ablation**: On 20 samples, test STFT attacks with frame sizes 256, 512, 1024. Compare success rate, perceptibility, and computational cost.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Future work on fine-tuning**: Using sufficient, necessary, and complete frequency sets to improve adversarial attacks and fine-tune models to reduce reliance on spurious features.
- **Genre pattern analysis**: Investigating why 'country' and 'disco' genres exhibit similar responsibility patterns across models despite being musically dissimilar.
- **Frequency independence assumption**: Examining how assuming causal independence between frequency components affects accuracy when real acoustic signals exhibit harmonic relationships.

## Limitations
- **Frequency independence assumption**: Assumes frequencies are causally independent, but real audio signals have harmonic relationships that could violate this assumption.
- **Lack of ablation studies**: No sensitivity analysis of partition size, iteration count, or EMD threshold on algorithm performance.
- **Dataset limitations**: Experiments use GTZAN (small, well-studied) and RAVDESS, limiting generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Claims about FreqReX identifying frequency subsets (sufficient, necessary, complete) - directly demonstrated through algorithmic results and quantitative metrics.
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about non-musical features being decision-critical - supported by experimental results but limited to specific datasets and models.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about imperceptible perturbations - while STFT attacks are reported as "imperceptible," no objective measurements are provided to verify this.

## Next Checks
1. **Frequency independence validation**: Test FreqReX on audio with known harmonic dependencies and compare responsibility scores of fundamental vs. overtone frequencies.
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Run FreqReX with varying partition sizes, chain lengths, and EMD thresholds on 50 samples to quantify impact on sufficiency percentages and attack success rates.
3. **Perceptibility measurement**: For successful STFT attacks, compute objective metrics (SNR, PESQ) comparing original vs. manipulated audio, and conduct blind listening tests with 10 participants.
