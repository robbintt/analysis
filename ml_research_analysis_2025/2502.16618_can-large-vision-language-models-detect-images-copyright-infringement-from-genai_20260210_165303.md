# Can Large Vision-Language Models Detect Images Copyright Infringement from GenAI?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.16618
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16618
- Authors: Qipan Xu; Zhenting Wang; Xiaoxiao He; Ligong Han; Ruixiang Tang
- Reference count: 9
- Key outcome: LVLMs show high recall but low precision for detecting AI-generated image copyright infringement, primarily due to overfitting on superficial visual features.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large vision-language models (LVLMs) can effectively detect copyright infringement in images generated by AI models. The authors construct a benchmark dataset with positive samples infringing on five well-known IP characters and negative samples that visually resemble but do not infringe on these characters. They evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LVLMs using both in-context learning and zero-shot learning approaches. Results show LVLMs can achieve high recall but suffer from low precision, tending to misclassify negative samples as infringing due to focusing on isolated visual features rather than holistic character similarity.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a dataset of 1000 images (200 per character: Iron Man, Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Super Mario) using SDXL, Ideogram, and DALL-E. Positive samples are generated using direct and descriptive prompts, while negative samples use Plain Negative Prompts (PNP) and Non-overlapped Negative Prompts (NNP/Perp-Neg) with classifier-free guidance weight w=7.5. Human annotation by 10 participants per sample with majority voting determines ground truth labels. LVLMs are evaluated in two modes: In-context Learning (ICL) with demonstration examples and zero-shot VQA. The study compares seven models including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, VILA-2.7b, Qwen-VL, DeepSeek-VL2, and InternVL2 using precision and recall metrics.

## Key Results
- ICL significantly outperforms zero-shot learning for IP infringement detection across all models
- LVLMs consistently achieve high recall (0.9-1.0) but low precision (0.4-0.6)
- Models tend to focus on specific visual features (e.g., golden armor, mustache) rather than holistic character similarity
- SAM integration for segmentation showed only marginal improvement in detection performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: In-Context Learning Improves Accuracy
- ICL improves copyright detection by providing labeled demonstration examples that condition the model on the distinction task
- Core assumption: LVLMs can transfer patterns from demonstration examples without parameter updates
- Evidence: ICL consistently shows higher precision than zero-shot across all models and character classes (Table 2)
- Break condition: When demonstrations are too dissimilar from query images or context window is insufficient

### Mechanism 2: Feature-Level Detection Causes False Positives
- LVLMs detect isolated visual features (colors, accessories, poses) rather than holistic similarity, causing high false positive rates
- Core assumption: Feature-level associations learned during pretraining dominate over nuanced similarity judgments
- Evidence: GPT-4o mini classified non-infringing images as positive due to "golden armor" (Iron Man) and other isolated features (Table 3)
- Break condition: When images contain multiple overlapping IP-signaling features or background elements obscure key features

### Mechanism 3: Contrastive Learning as Hypothetical Solution
- Fine-tuning on hard negative samples using contrastive learning is proposed to improve precision by teaching models to distinguish feature-similar non-infringing cases
- Core assumption: Feature-overfocus is correctable through gradient-based learning on targeted examples
- Evidence: Authors identify this as future work without experimental validation (Section 5)
- Break condition: If hard negatives are insufficiently diverse, causing overfitting to specific counterexamples

## Foundational Learning

- **In-Context Learning (ICL) for Vision-Language Models**
  - Why needed: Primary evaluation method; understanding how demonstration examples condition model behavior is essential
  - Quick check: Given 3 labeled IP-detection examples (2 positive, 1 negative), can you predict how an LVLM would classify a new image with ambiguous features?

- **Precision vs. Recall Trade-off in Detection Systems**
  - Why needed: Central finding is high-recall/low-precision performance; understanding sensitivity vs. specificity is critical
  - Quick check: If a model flags 100 images as infringing, but only 40 actually are, what is the precision? If 50 total infringing images exist, what is the recall?

- **Negative Prompting in Diffusion Models**
  - Why needed: Negative samples are generated using PNP and NNP/Perp-Neg; understanding these techniques is necessary for dataset construction
  - Quick check: How does classifier-free guidance with negative prompts differ from simply removing concepts from the positive prompt?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Image + text prompt -> Vision Encoder -> Text Tokenizer -> Multimodal Fusion -> LLM Decoder -> Classification output
- **Critical path**: Construct ICL prompt with demonstration images and labels → model processes visual-textual context → decoder generates yes/no response → parse output for metrics
- **Design tradeoffs**: ICL requires more tokens/latency but improves precision; more demonstrations improve accuracy but consume context window; recall vs. precision optimization depends on application
- **Failure signatures**: High false positive rate from feature overfocus, character confusion, over-refusal of similar-looking images
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate baseline: Run zero-shot VQA on benchmark dataset using GPT-4o or Claude 3.5
  2. Compare ICL vs. zero-shot: Construct ICL prompts with demonstration examples, measure precision/recall delta
  3. Failure case analysis: Collect false positives, categorize errors by feature overfocus, character confusion, or prompt ambiguity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Contrastive Learning Validation**: Can fine-tuning LVLMs on hard negative samples using contrastive learning effectively mitigate low precision caused by feature-overfocus? The authors propose this solution but provide no experimental validation.
- **Legal Standard Alignment**: How can LVLMs be trained to align with legal standards of copyright infringement (substantial similarity, fair use) rather than simple visual resemblance? The study relies on common sense annotation without addressing legal thresholds.
- **Advanced Segmentation Architectures**: Can more sophisticated segmentation or attention-guided architectures improve precision where SAM integration failed? The authors tested SAM but found only marginal improvements.

## Limitations

- No validated mitigation strategies for the false positive problem despite identifying feature-overfocus as the root cause
- Dataset construction relies on human annotation that may not capture nuanced legal aspects of copyright infringement
- Evaluation limited to five well-known IP characters, restricting generalizability to other domains

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: ICL superiority over zero-shot learning is well-supported by quantitative evidence and aligns with VL literature
- **Medium Confidence**: Failure mode analysis identifying feature-overfocus is well-reasoned but lacks systematic feature attribution studies
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to real-world copyright scenarios and effectiveness of proposed contrastive learning solution remain uncertain

## Next Checks

1. Implement and evaluate contrastive learning approach on the benchmark dataset, measuring precision/recall improvement compared to baseline LVLMs
2. Extend the benchmark to include 10 additional character classes spanning different IP types to assess pattern persistence across broader domains
3. Conduct blind study with copyright law experts to compare expert consensus with model outputs and assess alignment with legal standards
