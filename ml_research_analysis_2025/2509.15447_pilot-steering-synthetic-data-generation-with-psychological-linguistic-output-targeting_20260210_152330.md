## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PILOT, a framework that addresses the challenge of precise persona-based steering in synthetic data generation by translating natural language personas into structured psycholinguistic profiles. PILOT employs a two-phase approach: first, it converts persona descriptions into multidimensional profiles with normalized scores across linguistic and psychological dimensions; second, these profiles guide generation through structured prompt schemas. The framework was evaluated across three LLMs (Mistral Large 2, DeepSeek-R1, LLaMA 3.3 70B) under three steering conditions, demonstrating that schema-based approaches significantly improve coherence while maintaining high response quality.

## Method Summary
PILOT operates in two phases: Phase 1 uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet to translate natural language persona descriptions into PILOT JSON profiles with normalized psycholinguistic scores; Phase 2 generates responses using target LLMs with three steering strategies (Natural Language Persona Steering, Schema-Based Steering, Hybrid Steering). The study evaluated 250 personas across 7 content types using 210 prompt instructions, measuring steerability through silhouette scores and topic purity, diversity through Type-Token Ratio, and quality through human evaluation. The framework separates linguistic features into Stable, Semi-Stable, and Variable tiers to balance consistency with context-sensitivity.

## Key Results
- Schema-based steering improved silhouette scores from 0.098 to 0.237 and topic purity from 0.773 to 0.957
- Human evaluation confirmed no statistically significant quality differences between steering strategies
- Hybrid steering achieved balance between SBS's coherence and NPS's lexical diversity
- Schema-based outputs were more concise with fewer repetitive persona statements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Explicit Psycholinguistic Quantification
Translating natural language personas into normalized psycholinguistic vectors (0–100 scores) improves steering precision by reducing the model's need to infer which attributes to emphasize. This constrains the output probability space around measurable linguistic axes rather than relying on the model's internal persona associations. The core assumption is that generator LLMs can reliably interpret numerical style constraints in structured schemas. Break condition occurs when models ignore low-valued dimensions or over-saturate high-valued dimensions, leading to caricatured outputs.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Stability Separation
Organizing constraints into Stable, Semi-Stable, and Variable tiers prevents over-constraining context-dependent features while maintaining persona consistency. The schema enforces strict adherence to stable features (function words) while allowing fluctuation in variable features (emotional tone) based on the specific request. This decouples style from content, allowing the model to adapt to diverse prompts without breaking the core persona fingerprint. Break condition occurs when variable dimensions are over-specified, causing outputs to become non-sequiturs when content requests conflict with baseline emotional states.

### Mechanism 3: Hybrid Persona-Schema Steering (HPS)
Combining natural language identity with structured schemas balances lexical diversity (NPS) and topical coherence (SBS). HPS leverages the identity signal from natural language to ground content while using the schema to enforce structural consistency. The core assumption is that models can integrate two steering sources without confusion. Break condition occurs through inconsistency in personal perspective, such as pronoun shifts noted in 21% of HPS responses.

## Foundational Learning

**LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) Dimensions**: The PILOT schema is built on LIWC categories (affect, cognition, social processes). You cannot debug or design profiles without understanding what "clout" or "authenticity" means in computational linguistics. Quick check: If a persona has high "Analytical Thinking" but low "Authenticity," what kind of output should you expect? (Answer: Formal, logic-heavy, potentially distant or guarded tone).

**Silhouette Score & Topic Purity**: These are the primary metrics for "steerability." High silhouette scores mean outputs cluster tightly together (consistency), while high topic purity means the cluster aligns with the prompt's subject. Quick check: If silhouette scores are low but topic purity is high, what is happening? (Answer: The model is staying on topic but using inconsistent styles/personas).

**Type-Token Ratio (TTR)**: This measures lexical diversity (unique words / total words). The paper identifies a trade-off where Schema-Based Steering lowers TTR compared to Natural Language Steering. Quick check: Why might a very high TTR be undesirable for a specific persona like a "simple-spoken mechanic"? (Answer: It would violate the persona's expected vocabulary constraints).

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Persona Description -> Translator Prompt -> PILOT JSON -> Generator Prompt (Hybrid/Schema) -> Synthetic Output

**Critical path**: `Persona Description` -> **Translator Prompt** -> `PILOT JSON` -> **Generator Prompt (Hybrid/Schema)** -> `Synthetic Output`

**Design tradeoffs**: Precision vs. Naturalness (SBS offers high precision but risks "fake vibe"; NPS offers naturalness but risks "template-like" repetition); Compute (Phase 1 adds an extra LLM call per persona).

**Failure signatures**: NPS Failure ("As a [persona], I..." explicit self-identification; Excessive length); SBS Failure ("Vague, fake vibe"; Keyword mirroring); HPS Failure (Pronoun shifts; Style inconsistencies).

**First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline Validation: Run 10 prompts using NPS vs. SBS on a single persona to verify SBS outputs are shorter and lack "As a..." phrasing; 2) Dimension Ablation: Generate outputs using only "Stable" dimensions vs. "Full" schema to check if "Stable-only" outputs retain enough persona signal; 3) Extreme Persona Test: Create a persona with contradictory extremes (high certainty + high hedging) to test if the generator hallucinates a resolution or produces incoherent text.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on synthetic evaluation metrics without ground truth for "correct" persona adherence
- Human evaluation covered only a subset of steering conditions and content types
- Critical hyperparameters (temperature, max tokens) are unspecified
- Clustering methodology for steerability metrics is not fully described

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Framework architecture (Phase 1 Translator + Phase 2 Generator) is clearly specified and implementable; Three-tier stability model is logically sound and supported by linguistic literature.

**Medium Confidence**: Steering efficacy improvements are statistically supported within the study but require independent validation; Human evaluation methodology is appropriate but limited in scope.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about HPS achieving optimal balance are based on partial human evaluation and require broader testing across diverse personas and content domains.

## Next Checks

1. **Baseline Replication Test**: Generate 50 outputs each using NPS vs SBS for 5 diverse personas (academic researcher, mechanic, artist, teenager, executive) on the same 3 content types. Measure TTR, silhouette scores, and explicit persona repetition rates to verify documented trade-offs.

2. **Extreme Profile Stress Test**: Create 3 personas with contradictory psycholinguistic extremes (high certainty + high hedging, high affect + low emotional tone, high clout + low authenticity). Generate 10 outputs per steering strategy and analyze for coherence breakdowns or hallucination patterns.

3. **Clustering Methodology Validation**: Implement the exact clustering pipeline (unknown embedding model and algorithm) on a small dataset (25 outputs) to verify silhouette score calculations. Compare results with alternative clustering approaches to assess metric robustness.
