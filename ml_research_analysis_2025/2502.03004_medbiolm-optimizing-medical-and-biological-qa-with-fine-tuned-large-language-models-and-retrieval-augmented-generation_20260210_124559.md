# MedBioLM: Optimizing Medical and Biological QA with Fine-Tuned Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.03004
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03004
- Authors: Seonok Kim
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Fine-tuning GPT-4o achieves 88% accuracy on MedQA and 96% on BioASQ for medical question answering.

## Executive Summary
MedBioLM addresses the challenge of optimizing large language models for specialized medical and biological question-answering tasks. The model integrates fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering to improve accuracy and factual consistency across closed-ended, long-form, and short-form QA formats. Fine-tuning significantly enhances structured reasoning, achieving 88% accuracy on MedQA and 96% on BioASQ, outperforming base models like GPT-4o. RAG improves short-form QA performance by enhancing lexical overlap, while prompt engineering refines response generation. Long-form QA results show fine-tuning improves ROUGE-1 and BLEU scores, though challenges remain in generating human-like responses. The study highlights the complementary benefits of fine-tuning and retrieval-based approaches for biomedical AI applications.

## Method Summary
The method combines supervised fine-tuning of GPT-4o on biomedical QA datasets (MedQA, PubMedQA, BioASQ, MedicationQA, LiveQA) with retrieval-augmented generation using Azure AI Search. The model is trained on Azure AI Foundry with dataset-specific epochs (1-3) and batch sizes (~0.2% of training samples). Fine-tuning uses a learning rate scaling factor (0.5-2× pre-training rate). RAG employs keyword-based retrieval with Microsoft English analyzer and strict Top-K=1 for short-form QA. Task-specific prompt engineering adjusts decoding parameters: low temperature (0.1) for closed-ended tasks, higher temperature (0.2) and max tokens (300) for long-form generation. Evaluation uses accuracy for closed-ended QA and ROUGE/BLEU/BERTScore/BLEURT for long/short-form responses.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning achieves 88% accuracy on MedQA and 96% on BioASQ, outperforming base GPT-4o models
- RAG with Top-K=1 improves short-form QA lexical overlap, but performance degrades significantly when K>1
- Long-form QA shows high ROUGE-1/BLEU scores after fine-tuning, but negative BLEURT indicates lack of human-like semantic quality
- Fine-tuning reduces "Maybe" responses from 82% (GPT-3.5) to 19.3% (MedBioLM) on PubMedQA

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Domain-Specific Alignment via Supervised Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning improves accuracy by aligning model weights with medical corpora distributions, reducing uncertainty responses. Training on domain-specific QA pairs suppresses non-committal answers in favor of decisive reasoning. Performance gain stems from learned domain patterns rather than memorization, assuming datasets are representative of general medical reasoning. Evidence shows fine-tuned models reduce "Maybe" responses from 82% to 19.3% on PubMedQA.

### Mechanism 2: Precision-Retrieval Context Injection (RAG)
RAG improves short-form QA by reducing hallucinations through context injection, but requires strict retrieval precision. The model conditions output on retrieved chunks, but exceeding Top-K=1 introduces noise that degrades lexical similarity. Retrieval success depends on accurate keyword mapping; failed queries corrupt generation with irrelevant context. Evidence shows ROUGE-1 scores drop from ~11.33 to 2.58 as Top-K increases from 1 to 5.

### Mechanism 3: Decoding Constraint via Task-Specific Prompting
Performance optimization comes from strictly constraining decoding space to match output format requirements. Low temperature (0.1) and frequency penalties force deterministic token selection for closed-ended tasks, preventing stylistic drift. Optimal decoding parameters are assumed static per task type. Evidence shows specific configurations for each QA type: Closed-ended uses Temp 0.1, Long-form uses Temp 0.2 and Max Tokens 300.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **RAG vs. Fine-Tuning Trade-offs**
  - Why needed here: Paper demonstrates fine-tuning dominates structured reasoning while RAG is secondary; critical for resource allocation decisions
  - Quick check question: "If your goal is to improve accuracy on a static multiple-choice exam (MedQA), should you prioritize RAG or Fine-Tuning based on Table 1?"

- Concept: **Evaluation Metrics (ROUGE/BLEU vs. BLEURT/BERTScore)**
  - Why needed here: Paper shows high ROUGE scores but negative BLEURT, indicating lexical overlap ≠ human-like quality
  - Quick check question: "Why did MedBioLM achieve high ROUGE-1 scores on MedicationQA but still receive a negative BLEURT score?"

- Concept: **The "Maybe" Problem (Uncertainty Quantification)**
  - Why needed here: In medical QA, false confidence is dangerous, but excessive "Maybe" answers render models useless
  - Quick check question: "According to Table 2, how did fine-tuning alter the distribution of 'Yes/No/Maybe' responses compared to base models?"

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base Model (GPT-4o) -> Fine-Tuning (Azure AI Foundry) -> Retrieval (Azure AI Search) -> Prompt Layer (System messages) -> Evaluator (ROUGE/BLEU/BERTScore scripts + Human Pairwise)

- Critical path: 1. Data Prep: Format datasets into JSONL with system/user/assistant roles 2. Fine-Tuning Job: Trigger Azure training (Epochs: 2-3, Batch size: small) 3. RAG Integration: Index medical texts; configure Query Encoder and Top-K retrieval (Start with k=1) 4. Inference: Route query -> Retriever -> Context Concatenation -> Fine-Tuned Model -> Output

- Design tradeoffs: Keyword vs. Semantic Search uses keyword-based strategy for "deterministic" results, potentially sacrificing nuance for reliability. Top-K Setting strictly keeps K=1 for short-form QA to avoid noise, while Long-form might theoretically tolerate more context.

- Failure signatures: High "Maybe" Rate indicates under-fitted model or non-decisive prompt. Negative BLEURT Scores indicates robotic responses despite correct keywords. Performance Drop with RAG suggests retrieval index contains conflicting documents.

- First 3 experiments: 1. Baseline vs. FT Comparison: Run GPT-4o vs. MedBioLM on 100-sample MedQA subset to replicate ~88% accuracy claim 2. RAG Noise Ablation: Test Short-Form QA with Top-K=1 vs. Top-K=5 to verify performance degradation curve 3. Long-Form Qualitative Check: Generate 10 Long-Form answers and calculate ROUGE-1 vs. BLEURT to confirm lexical overlap vs. semantic quality discrepancy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does involving medical professionals from diverse specialties significantly reduce subjective bias and improve reliability of qualitative model evaluations compared to single-expert assessments?
- Basis in paper: Authors acknowledge qualitative evaluation relied on single general physician, "may introduce subjectivity," and propose multi-specialty collaboration for future research
- Why unresolved: Current study lacks inter-rater reliability metrics (e.g., Fleiss' kappa) across different medical domains, leaving generalizability unconfirmed
- What evidence would resolve it: New evaluation phase using panel of specialists showing high inter-rater agreement and distinct scoring from single-physician baseline

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) effectively bridge semantic gap to generate more "human-like" responses in long-form biomedical QA?
- Basis in paper: Discussion notes despite fine-tuning, BLEURT scores remain negative, indicating lack of human-likeness; authors explicitly suggest exploring RLHF to refine performance
- Why unresolved: Current optimization focuses on lexical overlap (ROUGE/BLEU), but models fail to capture deeper semantic nuance and conversational style as measured by BLEURT
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing RLHF-optimized model achieves positive BLEURT scores and higher human preference ratings than current fine-tuned MedBioLM

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can hybrid retrieval techniques be optimized to prevent performance degradation caused by information noise when retrieving multiple documents (Top-K)?
- Basis in paper: Results show increasing retrieved documents lowers ROUGE scores due to noise; conclusion explicitly calls for exploration of "hybrid retrieval techniques" to solve this
- Why unresolved: Current RAG implementation struggles to synthesize conflicting information from multiple sources, suggesting retrieval prioritizes recall over precision required for concise medical answers
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of hybrid retrieval system (combining keyword and semantic search) that maintains/improves accuracy as number of retrieved chunks (K) increases

## Limitations
- Data Quality and Generalization: Evaluation limited to curated biomedical QA datasets; real-world clinical scenarios with noisy/ incomplete queries untested
- RAG Implementation Constraints: Performance highly sensitive to Top-K parameter; specific content and quality of Azure AI Search index not detailed
- Decoding Parameter Sensitivity: Performance heavily depends on task-specific decoding parameters; paper doesn't address systematic optimization vs. fixed defaults

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Core finding that fine-tuning improves structured reasoning accuracy on standardized medical exams (MedQA, BioASQ) is well-supported by quantitative results
- Medium Confidence: Claim that RAG improves short-form QA through lexical overlap enhancement is supported, but strict constraint (k=1) suggests noise-reduction technique rather than true knowledge augmentation
- Low Confidence: Assertion that prompt engineering alone can refine response generation lacks detailed analysis of specific modifications driving performance improvements

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization Test**: Evaluate MedBioLM on held-out clinical QA dataset (e.g., USMLE Step 1 practice questions not in training data) to assess real-world applicability beyond benchmark performance

2. **RAG Robustness Analysis**: Systematically vary Azure AI Search index content quality (curated vs. general PubMed abstracts) while keeping retrieval parameters constant to isolate retrieval component's contribution to performance

3. **Parameter Sensitivity Study**: Conduct ablation study varying decoding parameters (temperature, max tokens) across three QA formats to determine optimal ranges and identify potential overfitting to specific values used in paper
