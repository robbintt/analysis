# AnimatedLLM: Explaining LLMs with Interactive Visualizations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.04213
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04213
- Reference count: 8
- One-line primary result: Interactive browser-based tool for visualizing LLM mechanics to non-technical audiences

## Executive Summary
AnimatedLLM provides interactive visualizations of large language model mechanics through pre-computed traces of open models on curated inputs. The tool runs entirely in the browser as a React application with four distinct views covering text generation and pre-training processes. It has been tested with high school students and received positive feedback for helping explain LLM architecture concepts.

## Method Summary
The system uses pre-computed traces from open LLMs (GPT-2, Llama 3.2, Olmo 3, Aya Expanse, Qwen 3) on manually curated prompts, serialized as JSON files. A static React web application loads these traces and provides four visualization views: text generation simple/detailed and pre-training simple/detailed. The tool includes multilingual support in English, Czech, French, Ukrainian, and Chinese. Python scripts are provided for computing custom traces using Huggingface Transformers.

## Key Results
- Successfully bridges gap between technical Transformer visualizations and clean AI assistant interfaces
- Tested with high school students at outreach events with generally positive feedback
- Supports five languages with language-specific trace demonstrations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Pre-computed model traces enable browser-only visualization without requiring users to run inference locally or connect to external APIs. The system captures full model outputs offline and serves them as static JSON assets that the React application reads directly.

### Mechanism 2
Multiple abstraction levels (simple vs. detailed views) allow the same tool to serve learners with varying prior knowledge. Four distinct views progressively reveal complexity, with users self-selecting appropriate depth.

### Mechanism 3
Multilingual localization with language-specific traces enables demonstration of cross-linguistic differences in tokenization and model behavior. Interface translations paired with localized prompts show how different languages are tokenized differently.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Tokenization (subword splitting)**
  - Why needed here: Users must understand that text is broken into tokens before processing; otherwise, "word" and "token" appear interchangeable, confusing attention and probability visualizations
  - Quick check question: Given the input "unhappiness," how many tokens might a BPE tokenizer produce, and why might this vary across languages?

- **Concept: Autoregressive generation**
  - Why needed here: The text generation views assume users grasp that each output token conditions on all prior tokens; without this, the sequential animation appears arbitrary
  - Quick check question: If a model has generated "The cat sat on the," what information does it use to predict the next token?

- **Concept: Probability distribution over vocabulary**
  - Why needed here: Both simple and detailed views visualize next-token prediction as probabilities; users unfamiliar with distributions will misinterpret bar charts as deterministic outputs
  - Quick check question: Why does the model assign non-zero probability to multiple next tokens instead of selecting a single token with certainty?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  React static web application -> Pre-computed trace files (JSON) -> Python scripts for trace generation -> Models traced: GPT-2, Llama 3.2, Olmo 3, Aya Expanse, Qwen 3 -> Four visualization view components -> i18n localization layer

- **Critical path:**
  1. Select prompt and model → run Python trace script → generate JSON trace
  2. Place JSON in application's data directory
  3. React app loads trace on user selection
  4. Animation engine steps through trace, rendering appropriate visualization layer

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Pre-computed traces vs. live inference: enables zero-backend deployment but limits exploration to curated examples
  - Curated prompts vs. user input: ensures pedagogical quality but reduces user agency
  - Simple vs. detailed views: broadens audience reach but increases maintenance surface

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Large trace files cause slow initial load on mobile devices
  - Users skip simple views and get overwhelmed in detailed views without foundational context
  - Language mismatch (interface language ≠ prompt language) produces confusing tokenization examples
  - Probability distribution visualizations misinterpreted as confidence scores rather than relative likelihoods

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Load a single pre-computed trace for GPT-2 on a short English prompt; step through generation-simple view, observing probability bars change across decoding steps
  2. Switch to generation-detailed view for the same trace; trace the flow from input tokens through embedding and attention layers to output distribution
  3. Compare tokenization traces for the same semantic prompt across English and Chinese; observe token count differences and discuss implications for model efficiency and fairness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does AnimatedLLM measurably improve learners' understanding of LLM mechanics compared to static materials or technical visualization tools?
- **Open Question 2:** How can interactive visualizations effectively represent post-training approaches (RLHF, instruction tuning) and BPE tokenizer training?
- **Open Question 3:** Does localized interface support improve learning outcomes for non-English speakers?
- **Open Question 4:** How does reliance on pre-computed traces affect user engagement compared to tools allowing custom prompt exploration?

## Limitations
- No quantitative validation metrics beyond qualitative feedback from high school outreach events
- Pre-computed trace architecture cannot support exploratory use cases requiring arbitrary user inputs
- Unknown effectiveness of simple vs. detailed views in practice without formal user study data

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the technical implementation (React app, pre-computed traces, visualization logic)
- **Medium confidence** in pedagogical effectiveness (qualitative feedback positive but not systematically measured)
- **Low confidence** in multilingual fairness claims (mechanism described but no evaluation data provided)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct A/B testing with learners comparing comprehension gains between AnimatedLLM and traditional lecture-based instruction on the same LLM concepts
2. Measure loading performance and usability across device types (mobile vs. desktop) with trace files of varying sizes
3. Evaluate language-specific trace accuracy by comparing tokenization patterns across languages for parallel prompts and checking against known tokenizer biases documented in literature
