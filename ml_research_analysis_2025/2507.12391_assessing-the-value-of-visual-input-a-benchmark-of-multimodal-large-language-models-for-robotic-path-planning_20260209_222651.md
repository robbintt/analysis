# Assessing the Value of Visual Input: A Benchmark of Multimodal Large Language Models for Robotic Path Planning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.12391
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12391
- **Reference count**: 23
- **Key outcome**: Benchmarking 15 multimodal LLMs on grid-based path planning shows text-only few-shot prompting benefits smaller models while visual input doesn't universally improve results; performance collapses on larger grids.

## Executive Summary
This paper benchmarks 15 multimodal large language models on grid-based path planning tasks, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs across different model sizes and grid complexities. The study systematically evaluates zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on 8×8 and 20×20 grids, finding that while larger models generally perform better, visual input doesn't consistently improve results and can sometimes impair performance. The research highlights fundamental scalability challenges, with performance degrading dramatically on larger grids regardless of model size, suggesting current LLMs face intrinsic limitations in spatial reasoning and multimodal integration for robotic planning tasks.

## Method Summary
The study uses procedurally generated 2D grid problems with BFS-verified optimal paths, testing 15 multimodal LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, Mistral, DeepSeek, Amazon) across Small/Medium/Large categories. Three prompting strategies are evaluated: Text Zero-Shot (structured grid description), Text Few-Shot (adds one example), and Multimodal (grid image plus two-step visual confirmation then path planning). Models generate Python coordinate lists in single API calls at temperature=0.1, with automatic validation checking start/end correctness, adjacent moves, boundaries, obstacle avoidance, and no-revisit constraints. Performance metrics include Success Rate, Optimality Rate, Path Length Ratio, and Suboptimality Gap across 20 problems per grid size.

## Key Results
- Larger models achieved higher success rates (up to 55-60%) on 8×8 grids, while small models typically remained below 25%
- Text-only few-shot prompting offered measurable benefits for smaller and medium models
- Visual input did not universally improve performance and could impair results in some instances
- Performance dramatically collapsed on 20×20 grids, with success rates near zero for small models and only 4-5% for large models
- When successful, path quality remained high with many optimal solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Textual Representation for Spatial Reasoning
Explicit coordinate-based textual descriptions with clear rules enable LLMs to perform spatial planning without visual input, often matching or exceeding multimodal performance. Textual format provides unambiguous information about grid dimensions, start/goal positions, and obstacle coordinates that models can process through language understanding without requiring visual grounding.

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Modal Verification for Grounding
Explicitly prompting models to verify consistency between textual and visual obstacle information can improve multimodal integration when successful. Two-step prompting strategy (visual confirmation → path planning) forces active correlation across modalities before path generation.

### Mechanism 3: Scale-Dependent Planning Capacity with Hard Limits
Larger model size correlates with better spatial reasoning, but fundamental scalability limits persist across all sizes. Larger models have greater capacity for multi-step reasoning chains and spatial representations, yet all models hit a complexity ceiling regardless of scale.

## Foundational Learning

- **Grid-Based Path Planning**: Core evaluation framework; understanding how start/goal positions, obstacles, and valid moves define the search space is essential. *Quick check*: Why does a 20×20 grid present fundamentally different challenges than an 8×8 grid beyond just "more cells"?

- **Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Prompting**: Paper systematically compares these across model sizes; results show different effectiveness depending on scale. *Quick check*: Why might few-shot prompting help a small model but hurt a large model's performance?

- **Cross-Modal Distraction**: The surprising finding that visual input doesn't universally help requires understanding when multimodal input degrades performance. *Quick check*: What are two failure modes when a model receives both an image and text describing the same scene?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Grid Generator → Prompt Templates → LLM Interface → Response Parser → Validator
- **Critical path**: 1) Load pre-generated grid problem 2) Format prompt per strategy 3) Query LLM (temperature=0.1) 4) Parse coordinate list from response 5) Validate against BFS ground truth 6) Compute metrics
- **Design tradeoffs**: Text precision vs. Visual intuition; Single-call generation vs. iterative refinement; Low temperature (0.1) for determinism vs. exploration; No-revisit constraint increases difficulty
- **Failure signatures**: Parse failures (model outputs explanations instead of list format); Constraint violations (revisits cells, hits obstacles, exits boundaries); Incomplete paths; Scalability collapse (35% → <5% success when scaling 8×8 → 20×20); Cross-modal inconsistency
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate 8×8 baseline with 2-3 models across size categories to verify reported success rates 2) Ablate prompting: Compare ZS vs FS on one medium model—expect ~5 percentage point FS benefit 3) Map scalability curve: Test one large model on progressive grid sizes (8×8 → 12×12 → 16×16 → 20×20)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Scalability Question**: What architectural or training improvements would enable MLLMs to maintain planning performance as grid complexity scales beyond 8×8 environments? Current models achieved only 4-5% success on 20×20 grids even for large models, suggesting fundamental limitations in handling longer planning horizons and larger state spaces.

- **Visual Input Conditions**: Under what specific conditions does visual input provide measurable benefits over well-structured text for spatial planning tasks? The paper shows inconsistent benefits from visual input across models and sizes, but doesn't identify the factors determining when vision helps versus hinders.

- **Iterative Planning Approaches**: Can iterative or hierarchical planning approaches overcome the constraint adherence failures observed in single-shot path generation? The single-shot approach may not align with how LLMs reason about sequential constraints; alternative decomposition strategies were not tested.

## Limitations
- **Scalability Gap**: Dramatic performance collapse from 8×8 to 20×20 grids represents a fundamental limitation that isn't fully explained
- **Cross-Modal Integration**: Underlying reasons for cross-modal distraction remain unclear; two-step verification approach is proposed but not thoroughly validated
- **Artificial Constraints**: No-revisit constraint and Python list output format create artificial limitations that don't reflect practical deployment scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Larger models consistently outperform smaller ones; Text-only few-shot prompting provides measurable benefits for smaller/medium models; Performance degrades significantly on 20×20 grids; Path quality remains high when solutions are found

**Medium Confidence**: Visual input does not universally improve multimodal performance; Two-step cross-modal verification could improve grounding when successful; Current LLMs face fundamental scalability limits for spatial reasoning tasks

**Low Confidence**: Exact mechanism causing cross-modal distraction; Whether proposed strategies scale to real-world scenarios; Generalizability to continuous space or 3D environments

## Next Checks
1. **Scaling Curve Characterization**: Systematically test model performance across intermediate grid sizes (8×8, 10×10, 12×12, 16×16, 20×20) to identify the precise scaling threshold where performance collapses and determine if this follows a predictable pattern.

2. **Cross-Modal Verification Validation**: Implement ablation study testing the two-step visual confirmation approach by measuring actual visual-textual consistency detection rates and comparing against single-step multimodal prompts.

3. **Constraint Relaxation Impact**: Repeat experiments on 8×8 grids with relaxed constraints—allow revisiting cells and accept multiple valid output formats—to determine whether current performance limitations stem from task constraints rather than fundamental reasoning capabilities.
