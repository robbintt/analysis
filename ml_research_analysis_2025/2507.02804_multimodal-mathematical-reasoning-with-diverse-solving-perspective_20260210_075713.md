core_contribution: This paper introduces MathV-DP, a dataset that captures multiple
  diverse solution trajectories for each image-question pair in multimodal mathematical
  reasoning. Unlike existing datasets that provide only one solution per problem,
  MathV-DP includes multiple correct solutions with different reasoning perspectives,
  as well as incorrect solutions for learning discrimination.

# Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning with Diverse Solving Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.02804
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02804
- Reference count: 11
- Introduces MathV-DP dataset with multiple diverse solution trajectories for multimodal mathematical reasoning problems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitation of existing multimodal mathematical reasoning datasets that provide only single solution paths for each problem. The authors introduce MathV-DP, a novel dataset capturing multiple diverse solution trajectories, including both correct and incorrect solutions, to enable models to learn from different mathematical reasoning perspectives. They propose Qwen-VL-DP, an enhanced model built on Qwen-VL that is fine-tuned using supervised learning on MathV-DP and further optimized through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward functions assessing correctness, diversity, and solution discrimination. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and generative diversity on MathVista and Math-V benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce MathV-DP, a dataset containing multiple diverse solution trajectories for each multimodal mathematical reasoning problem, including correct solutions with different reasoning perspectives and incorrect solutions for discrimination learning. Qwen-VL-DP is developed by fine-tuning Qwen-VL on MathV-DP using supervised learning, then applying GRPO with a composite reward function that evaluates correctness, diversity, and discrimination between solutions. The training process enables the model to not only generate accurate solutions but also explore multiple reasoning paths and distinguish between correct and incorrect approaches. Evaluation on MathVista and Math-V benchmarks shows significant improvements in both accuracy (up to 70.4% overall on MathVista) and the ability to generate diverse solution trajectories.

## Key Results
- Qwen-VL-DP achieves 70.4% overall accuracy on MathVista benchmark, significantly outperforming prior MLLMs
- The model demonstrates improved generative diversity by successfully producing multiple distinct solution trajectories for the same problem
- Enhanced ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect solutions while maintaining solution correctness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by exposing the model to multiple valid solution paths for each problem during training, enabling it to learn different mathematical reasoning perspectives rather than memorizing a single approach. The GRPO fine-tuning with composite rewards encourages the model to balance correctness with diversity, preventing it from converging to a single solution pattern. The inclusion of incorrect solutions in the training data helps the model develop better discrimination capabilities, learning to identify and avoid common reasoning errors while recognizing multiple valid solution strategies.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal mathematical reasoning**: Understanding how to process visual and textual information together to solve mathematical problems
  - Why needed: Mathematical problems often combine diagrams, equations, and text requiring integrated understanding
  - Quick check: Can the model correctly interpret a geometry problem with a diagram and word description?
- **Diverse solution trajectories**: Multiple valid paths to solve the same mathematical problem
  - Why needed: Real-world problems can be solved through different mathematical approaches
  - Quick check: Does the model generate fundamentally different solution methods, not just surface variations?
- **Solution discrimination**: Ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning paths
  - Why needed: Helps prevent propagation of errors and improves robustness
  - Quick check: Can the model identify flawed reasoning in otherwise plausible solutions?
- **Group Relative Policy Optimization**: Reinforcement learning technique that evaluates policies relative to peers
  - Why needed: Enables optimization of multiple objectives (correctness, diversity) simultaneously
  - Quick check: Does the model improve on both diversity and accuracy metrics during training?
- **Composite reward functions**: Multi-objective optimization combining multiple evaluation criteria
- **Why needed**: Necessary to balance competing goals like correctness and diversity
  - Quick check: Does the model maintain high accuracy while increasing solution diversity?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Qwen-VL -> Supervised Fine-tuning on MathV-DP -> GRPO Fine-tuning (Correctness + Diversity + Discrimination rewards) -> Qwen-VL-DP

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves first establishing baseline multimodal reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning on MathV-DP, then enhancing these capabilities through GRPO that optimizes for multiple objectives simultaneously. The dataset construction and reward function design are equally critical, as they determine what the model learns during both phases.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The approach trades increased training complexity (multiple reward signals, diverse dataset) for improved model capabilities in generating diverse solutions. This requires more sophisticated training infrastructure and careful reward function balancing compared to standard supervised fine-tuning approaches.

**Failure Signatures:**
Potential failure modes include the model learning superficial variations rather than genuinely different mathematical approaches, optimization challenges from conflicting reward signals (e.g., diversity vs. correctness), and overfitting to the specific diversity patterns in the training dataset rather than learning true mathematical flexibility.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Ablation study comparing GRPO with only correctness reward vs. composite rewards to isolate diversity contribution
2. Human evaluation of solution diversity to verify mathematical distinctiveness of generated trajectories
3. Testing on out-of-distribution mathematical problems to assess generalization beyond benchmark datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Dataset construction methodology for capturing "diverse" solutions lacks clear specification, raising questions about genuine diversity
- Evaluation focuses on accuracy improvements without deep analysis of whether diverse solutions represent meaningfully different mathematical approaches
- Complex reward function combining multiple objectives may lead to optimization challenges or unintended trade-offs
- Generalization beyond MathVista and Math-V benchmarks to other multimodal reasoning tasks remains unclear

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The reported accuracy improvements on MathVista and Math-V benchmarks using the proposed approach
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of GRPO-based fine-tuning for achieving both correctness and diversity simultaneously
- **Low confidence**: The claim that the diverse solutions represent genuinely different mathematical reasoning perspectives versus superficial variations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of the diversity and discrimination reward components versus correctness-only training
2. Perform human evaluation of solution diversity to verify that multiple trajectories represent meaningfully different mathematical approaches rather than surface variations
3. Test the model on out-of-distribution mathematical reasoning problems to assess generalization beyond the benchmark datasets used in evaluation
