# TuneComp: Joint Fine-tuning and Compression for Large Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.21835

- Primary result: Joint fine-tuning and compression method for foundation models achieving higher accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than sequential approaches

## Executive Summary
TuneComp introduces a method that jointly performs fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, and pruning to compress large foundation models during adaptation to downstream tasks. Unlike sequential pipelines that fine-tune first and compress later—resulting in performance loss and unnecessary intermediate model sizes—TuneComp directly constructs a smaller model while maintaining task guidance. The approach splits each linear layer into parallel teacher and student branches, progressively replacing the pretrained teacher weights with a compressed student branch based on low-rank decomposition. It employs activation-aware low-rank approximation, extends pruning to the low-rank structures, and introduces dynamic regularization decay. Evaluated on ViT-Base for CIFAR100 classification, TuneComp significantly outperforms sequential methods, achieving higher accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, especially at high compression rates. It also shows improved initialization and regularization strategies.

## Method Summary
TuneComp addresses the challenge of adapting and compressing large foundation models for resource-constrained deployment by integrating multiple compression techniques within the fine-tuning process. The method operates by splitting each linear layer into parallel teacher and student branches, where the teacher branch uses pretrained weights while the student branch learns compressed representations through low-rank decomposition. During training, the student branch gradually replaces the teacher branch based on performance metrics, allowing for progressive compression without catastrophic performance degradation. The approach incorporates activation-aware low-rank approximation to better preserve important feature representations, extends pruning techniques to operate on the low-rank structures rather than just weight magnitudes, and employs dynamic regularization decay to balance between compression and task performance throughout the training process. This unified framework eliminates the need for separate fine-tuning and compression stages, reducing computational overhead and preserving more task-relevant information.

## Key Results
- Achieves higher accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than sequential fine-tuning-then-compression methods on CIFAR-100 classification
- Particularly effective at high compression rates where traditional sequential approaches show significant performance degradation
- Demonstrates improved initialization and regularization strategies compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by integrating compression directly into the adaptation process rather than treating them as separate sequential steps. By maintaining parallel teacher-student branches at each layer, TuneComp can leverage the pretrained knowledge while simultaneously learning compressed representations. The activation-aware low-rank approximation ensures that compression preserves the most task-relevant features by considering both weights and their activations during decomposition. Dynamic regularization decay allows the model to gradually shift from preserving pretrained knowledge to optimizing for the downstream task as compression progresses. This joint optimization prevents the information loss that typically occurs when fine-tuning is followed by compression, as the compression process is guided by task-specific gradients throughout training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfers knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model; needed to maintain task performance while reducing model size; quick check: verify KL divergence between teacher and student outputs decreases during training
- **Low-Rank Approximation**: Decomposes weight matrices into lower-dimensional representations; needed to reduce computational complexity while preserving important information; quick check: monitor singular value decay in weight matrices
- **Progressive Model Replacement**: Gradually shifts from teacher to student parameters; needed to avoid catastrophic forgetting during compression; quick check: track parameter similarity metrics between teacher and student branches
- **Activation-Aware Compression**: Considers both weights and activations during compression; needed to preserve task-relevant features; quick check: compare activation distributions between compressed and original models
- **Dynamic Regularization**: Adjusts regularization strength during training; needed to balance between preserving pretrained knowledge and optimizing for downstream tasks; quick check: monitor training/validation loss trajectories

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Teacher Branch -> Student Branch -> Output, where Teacher and Student branches operate in parallel at each linear layer

**Critical Path**: The forward pass through parallel teacher-student branches with weighted combination, followed by backward pass computing gradients for both branches with distillation loss

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Parallel branches increase memory usage during training but enable better compression quality
- Progressive replacement requires careful scheduling to avoid performance collapse
- Activation-aware methods improve compression quality but add computational overhead
- Dynamic regularization improves final performance but requires hyperparameter tuning

**Failure Signatures**:
- Student branch diverges from teacher too early, causing performance collapse
- Poor initialization of student branch leads to suboptimal compression
- Static regularization fails to balance compression and task performance
- Activation-aware approximation over-prunes important features

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare single-branch vs parallel-branch training on CIFAR-100 to verify the benefit of teacher guidance
2. Test different scheduling strategies for student branch replacement to find optimal progression rate
3. Evaluate activation-aware vs weight-only low-rank approximation to quantify the benefit of considering activations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope to a single vision task (CIFAR-100) using ViT-Base, providing no evidence for NLP or multimodal domains
- Only compared against naive sequential fine-tuning-then-compression baselines, without benchmarking against established compression methods
- Method's scalability to much larger models or higher compression ratios beyond those tested remains unproven

## Confidence
- Medium: The technical formulation is sound and CIFAR-100 results are internally consistent, but the narrow experimental scope prevents strong generalization claims

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TuneComp on additional foundation model tasks including NLP (e.g., text classification with BERT) and multimodal benchmarks to assess cross-domain generalization
2. Compare against state-of-the-art compression methods (e.g., magnitude pruning, quantization-aware training, lottery ticket-based approaches) on the same benchmarks to establish relative performance
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of activation-aware approximation, low-rank pruning, and dynamic regularization decay to quantify their individual impacts on accuracy-efficiency trade-offs
