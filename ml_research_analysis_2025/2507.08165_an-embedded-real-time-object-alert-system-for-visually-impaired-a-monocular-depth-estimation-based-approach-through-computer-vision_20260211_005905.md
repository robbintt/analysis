# An Embedded Real-time Object Alert System for Visually Impaired: A Monocular Depth Estimation based Approach through Computer Vision

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.08165
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08165
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Primary result:** Real-time object detection (mAP50 = 0.801) + depth estimation system deployed on Raspberry Pi for visually impaired navigation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of safe navigation for visually impaired individuals in densely populated urban environments, particularly in Bangladesh where street-level obstructions pose significant collision risks. The authors propose an embedded real-time alert system that combines monocular depth estimation and object detection using computer vision techniques. The system leverages transfer learning to train both depth estimation and object detection models, which are then optimized through quantization for deployment on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi. By integrating auditory alerts when objects are detected at close proximity, the system aims to enable visually impaired users to navigate safely through complex street environments without physical collisions.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach employs a dual-model architecture combining object detection and monocular depth estimation. The system uses transfer learning to train models on public datasets (RSUD20K for object detection and KITTI for depth estimation), followed by quantization optimization for embedded deployment. The object detection model achieves mAP50 of 0.801, while the depth estimation model demonstrates low error metrics (AbsRel = 0.062, SqRel = 0.222, RMSE = 2.575). The combined system processes camera input to detect objects and estimate their distances, triggering auditory alerts when objects are within proximity thresholds. The implementation targets Raspberry Pi hardware to provide an accessible, cost-effective solution for visually impaired individuals in resource-constrained settings.

## Key Results
- Object detection model achieves mAP50 of 0.801 on RSUD20K dataset
- Depth estimation model demonstrates low error rates (AbsRel = 0.062, SqRel = 0.222, RMSE = 2.575)
- Lightweight quantized models enable real-time operation on Raspberry Pi hardware
- Integrated system provides auditory alerts for nearby obstacles to assist visually impaired navigation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from combining complementary visual perception capabilities: object detection identifies what obstacles exist in the scene, while depth estimation determines their relative distances. This dual-modality approach addresses the limitations of using either technique alone. Object detection alone cannot provide distance information needed for collision avoidance, while depth estimation alone may struggle with semantic understanding of what objects pose the greatest risks. By fusing these modalities, the system can prioritize alerts based on both object type and proximity, providing more contextually relevant warnings. The transfer learning approach leverages pre-trained models to achieve good performance despite limited training data, while quantization enables real-time processing on edge devices with limited computational resources.

## Foundational Learning
**Computer Vision for Visually Impaired Navigation**
- *Why needed:* Enables automated environmental perception to compensate for visual impairment
- *Quick check:* System must accurately detect and localize common urban obstacles

**Monocular Depth Estimation**
- *Why needed:* Provides distance information from single camera input, crucial for collision risk assessment
- *Quick check:* Depth predictions should maintain <10% relative error for objects within 5m

**Transfer Learning**
- *Why needed:* Allows effective model training with limited domain-specific data
- *Quick check:* Performance should improve when fine-tuning pre-trained models on target dataset

**Model Quantization**
- *Why needed:* Reduces computational requirements for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices
- *Quick check:* Quantized models should maintain >95% of original accuracy while reducing latency

**Edge Computing for Assistive Devices**
- *Why needed:* Enables real-time processing without requiring constant internet connectivity
- *Quick check:* System should operate with <100ms end-to-end latency for safe navigation

**Critical Path**
Camera capture → Object detection inference → Depth estimation inference → Proximity check → Audio alert

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Model accuracy vs. inference speed: Higher accuracy models increase latency on Raspberry Pi
- Quantization level vs. performance: Aggressive quantization reduces model size but may degrade accuracy
- Alert frequency vs. user experience: Too many alerts overwhelm users; too few miss hazards
- Camera resolution vs. processing load: Higher resolution improves detection but increases computation

**Failure Signatures**
- False negatives: Missed obstacles result in potential collisions
- False positives: Unnecessary alerts reduce user trust and increase cognitive load
- Latency issues: Delays between detection and alert compromise safety
- Depth estimation errors: Incorrect distance calculations lead to inappropriate alert timing

**3 First Experiments**
1. Measure inference latency of object detection and depth estimation models separately on Raspberry Pi
2. Test system performance with various quantization levels to find optimal accuracy-speed tradeoff
3. Evaluate alert accuracy in controlled environment with known obstacle positions and distances

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1:** Can the proposed quantized models maintain acceptable real-time performance and accuracy when deployed on diverse smartphone architectures compared to the Raspberry Pi?
- *Basis in paper:* Authors suggest future extension to smartphones as more accessible edge devices
- *Why unresolved:* Current implementation is Raspberry Pi-specific; smartphones have different NPUs and OS constraints
- *What evidence would resolve it:* FPS and battery consumption benchmarks on Android/iOS devices

**Open Question 2:** How can Explainable AI (XAI) be integrated into the depth estimation and object detection pipeline to enhance user trust without increasing computational latency?
- *Basis in paper:* Authors identify XAI integration as future work for model interpretability
- *Why unresolved:* Current system functions as black box; lacks mechanisms to explain alert triggers
- *What evidence would resolve it:* User study comparing trust levels with/without interpretable feedback

**Open Question 3:** What is the actual frames-per-second (FPS) and end-to-end latency of the combined depth estimation and object detection pipeline on the Raspberry Pi?
- *Basis in paper:* System claims "real-time" operation but lacks specific FPS/latency measurements
- *Why unresolved:* Only accuracy metrics reported; inference speed not quantified despite quantization optimization
- *What evidence would resolve it:* Latency benchmarks for full pipeline on Raspberry Pi hardware

## Limitations
- Performance metrics evaluated on public datasets, not real-world deployment with visually impaired users
- Transfer learning approach may not generalize to Bangladesh's specific urban visual characteristics and lighting conditions
- Lacks user testing data with actual visually impaired individuals to validate practical effectiveness and alert response times
- Quantization optimization analysis incomplete without detailed performance-speed tradeoff comparisons

## Confidence
- Technical implementation approach: **High**
- Dataset-specific performance metrics: **Medium**
- Real-world effectiveness for target users: **Low**
- Deployment optimization validation: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct field testing with visually impaired users in Bangladesh's urban environments to evaluate real-world alert accuracy and user response times
2. Compare system performance across different embedded platforms (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Coral Dev Board) to establish optimal hardware configuration
3. Perform ablation studies on transfer learning performance by fine-tuning on locally collected data that better represents Bangladesh's street environments and obstruction patterns
