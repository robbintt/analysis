## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.02076
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02076
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Balanced mixtures of real and synthetic data (α ≈ 0.5) yield optimal trust in synthetic medical data for clinical AI applications

## Executive Summary
This position paper addresses the critical challenge of building trust in synthetic medical data for clinical AI adoption. The authors propose a framework for evaluating trust factors through empirical analysis of brain tumor segmentation tasks, demonstrating that the quality, diversity, and proportion of synthetic data directly impact AI model reliability. Using a Med-DDPM model to generate synthetic brain MRI images conditioned on semantic maps, the study systematically varies the proportion of real versus synthetic training data and evaluates five trust factors. The experiments reveal that balanced mixtures of real and synthetic data yield optimal trust, while synthetic data performs more consistently across tumor regions but struggles to capture fine details of smaller structures.

## Method Summary
The study uses the BraTS 2021 dataset (1251 multi-modal MRI scans) to evaluate trust in synthetic medical data. Synthetic MRIs are generated using a pre-trained Med-DDPM model conditioned on ground truth segmentation masks. The training data is mixed with varying proportions of real and synthetic data (α ∈ [0,1]), where α represents the fraction of real data. A SwinUNETR model is trained on each mixture and evaluated on both real and synthetic test sets (251 images each). Five trust factors are computed from Dice Similarity Coefficients: overall performance (T1), consistency across tumor regions (T2), alignment between real and synthetic performance (T3), performance differences (T4), and predictive variability (T5).

## Key Results
- Balanced mixtures of real and synthetic data (α ≈ 0.5) yield optimal trust alignment between real and synthetic test performance
- Synthetic data exhibits higher consistency (T2) and lower predictive variability (T5) across tumor regions compared to real data
- Trustworthiness scales with anatomical structure size, with largest discrepancies observed for small structures like necrotic tumor core

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Balanced Real-Synthetic Data Mixing Optimizes Trust Alignment
- Models trained on approximately equal proportions of real and synthetic data (α ≈ 0.5 ± 0.1) exhibit minimized performance discrepancies between real and synthetic test sets. The mixture ratio controls exposure to real-world noise versus synthetic smoothness, allowing the model to learn features that generalize across both domains.

### Mechanism 2: Synthetic Data Exhibits Lower Regional Performance Variance
- Models evaluated on synthetic test data show higher consistency (T2) and lower predictive variability (T5) across tumor regions compared to real data. Diffusion-generated images, conditioned on semantic maps, lack the acquisition noise and natural biological variability present in real MRIs, producing smoother, more uniform feature representations.

### Mechanism 3: Synthetic Data Trustworthiness Scales with Anatomical Structure Size
- Alignment between real and synthetic performance (T3) is highest for large structures (edema) and lowest for small structures (necrotic core), indicating synthetic data struggles to capture fine-grained details. Diffusion models optimize global image coherence, which favors larger structures with more voxels and clearer boundaries.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**
  - Why needed here: Med-DDPM generates the synthetic MRIs by learning to reverse a gradual noising process, conditioned on segmentation maps.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why conditioning on semantic maps ensures one-to-one correspondence between synthetic images and ground truth labels?

- Concept: **Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)**
  - Why needed here: All five trust factors (T1–T5) are computed from Dice scores measuring segmentation overlap.
  - Quick check question: Given two binary masks A and B, what does a Dice score of 0.75 indicate about their overlap?

- Concept: **Class Imbalance in Medical Imaging**
  - Why needed here: The tumor regions (ED, ET, NCR) have vastly different volumes, directly impacting trust factor outcomes.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model achieve high average Dice while performing poorly on small structures?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input MRI + ground truth masks -> Med-DDPM synthetic generator -> SwinUNETR segmentation model -> Five-factor trust evaluator -> Trust metrics

- Critical path:
  1. Load real MRI-semantic map pairs from BraTS
  2. Generate synthetic MRIs using Med-DDPM conditioned on same semantic maps
  3. Construct training sets with varying α (real:synthetic ratio)
  4. Train SwinUNETR on each mixture
  5. Evaluate on both real and synthetic test sets
  6. Compute T1–T5 trust factors per tumor region

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Real data proportion (α)**: Higher α improves real-world generalization; lower α maximizes privacy/scarcity benefits
  - **Trust factor priority**: T1 (overall performance) vs T2 (regional fairness) vs T3 (real-synthetic alignment)
  - **Region selection**: Edema-only tasks are safer for synthetic data; NCR-involving tasks require caution

- Failure signatures:
  - High T4 (performance difference) at α = 0 or α = 1 indicates domain shift
  - Low T3 for small structures signals synthetic data inadequacy
  - High T5 (variability) on synthetic test set suggests generation quality issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline sweep**: Train models at α = 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0; compute all trust factors to identify optimal mixing ratio for your specific dataset
  2. **Region-specific analysis**: Isolate Dice scores per structure (ET, ED, NCR) to determine which anatomical features your synthetic data handles reliably
  3. **Cross-modal validation**: Test whether findings generalize across MRI modalities (FLAIR vs T1 vs T2 vs T1ce) by computing trust factors separately per channel

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can synthetic data generation methods be improved to reliably capture fine-grained details of small anatomical structures, given the observed limitations in representing small tumor regions like NCR?
- Basis in paper: The paper states "synthetic data struggles to reliably and consistently capture the characteristics of smaller regions like NCR" and "synthetic data may not be as trustworthy for tasks involving regions of interest that are quite small, such as microscopic structures."
- Why unresolved: Current conditional diffusion models conditioned on semantic maps fail to capture fine-grained texture and structural details in small regions, as evidenced by lower T3 alignment and higher T4 differences for NCR compared to larger edema regions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of new conditioning mechanisms or architectural improvements demonstrating improved T3 and T4 values for small structures comparable to those of large structures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the proposed quantitative trust framework (T1-T5) correlate with actual clinician trust and adoption decisions in real-world clinical workflows?
- Basis in paper: The paper aims to "spark a discussion on the viability of synthetic medical data in clinical practice" and argues for building trust among clinicians, but does not empirically validate whether the T1-T5 metrics align with clinician perceptions of trustworthiness.
- Why unresolved: Trust is a multi-dimensional construct that may involve factors beyond the five quantitative metrics proposed, including explainability, transparency, and perceived clinical relevance.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies with clinicians correlating T1-T5 scores with their subjective trust assessments and willingness to adopt AI systems trained with synthetic data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal proportion (α) of real versus synthetic data for different clinical tasks, and does the α ≈ 0.5 ± 0.1 finding generalize across varying dataset characteristics?
- Basis in paper: The paper finds "balanced mixtures of real and synthetic data (α ≈ 0.5) yield optimal trust" but this is specific to brain tumor segmentation with the BraTS dataset.
- Why unresolved: The optimal mixing ratio may depend on dataset size, class distribution, task difficulty, and generative model quality, which were not systematically varied in the study.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies across multiple clinical tasks with varying dataset sizes, generative model types, and class imbalance ratios to identify task-specific optimal α values.

## Limitations
- Synthetic data quality dependence: All trust factor findings hinge on the Med-DDPM's generation quality without validating generation fidelity metrics
- BraTS dataset specificity: Results may not generalize beyond brain tumor segmentation to other anatomical regions or disease types
- Trust factor interpretability: The framework doesn't address downstream clinical decision-making confidence or qualitative aspects of trust

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Balanced mixing ratio (α ≈ 0.5) optimizes real-synthetic performance alignment - directly supported by experimental results showing minimized T4 values at this ratio
- **Medium Confidence**: Synthetic data exhibits lower regional performance variance - supported by T2 and T5 comparisons, but consistency on synthetic data doesn't guarantee real-world reliability
- **Low Confidence**: Trustworthiness scales with anatomical structure size - T3 results show clear patterns, but limited to three tumor regions without broader anatomical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Generation Quality Audit**: Compute Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and conduct expert visual review of synthetic vs real MRIs across all tumor regions to quantify generation fidelity before trust factor analysis
2. **Cross-Modality Generalization**: Replicate trust factor calculations separately for each MRI modality (FLAIR, T1, T2, T1ce) to identify modality-specific synthetic data limitations
3. **Small Structure Stress Test**: Design synthetic data generation experiments specifically targeting small anatomical structures (vessels, micro lesions) to validate or refute the structure-size trust hypothesis beyond tumor regions
