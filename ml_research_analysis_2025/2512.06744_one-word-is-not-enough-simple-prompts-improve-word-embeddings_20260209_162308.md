# One Word Is Not Enough: Simple Prompts Improve Word Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.06744
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06744
- **Reference count**: 12
- **Primary result**: Semantic prompts before single words improve word similarity correlations by up to +0.29 on SimLex-999, achieving ρ=0.692 on that benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that prepending semantic prompts to single words substantially improves word similarity correlations when using text embedding models designed for sentence-level tasks. Testing 7 different models (including OpenAI, Cohere, Voyage AI, and open-source options) on 3 standard benchmarks, the study finds that prompts like "meaning: {word}" or "Represent the semantic concept: {word}" can improve Spearman correlations by up to +0.29 on SimLex-999. Some models that completely fail on bare words (ρ≈0) recover significantly with prompts (+0.73 improvement). The technique requires no training and works as a zero-shot method with any text embedding model.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates whether prepending semantic prompts to single words improves word similarity correlations from text embedding models designed for sentence-level tasks. Using three standard word similarity benchmarks (SimLex-999, WordSim-353, MEN-3000) with human similarity ratings, the method applies 8 different prompt conditions to each word pair, embeds the resulting phrases, computes cosine similarities, and calculates Spearman correlation with human judgments. The evaluation is zero-shot—no training or fine-tuning is performed. The study tests 7 models including commercial APIs (OpenAI, Cohere, Voyage AI) and open-source options, comparing results against classic static embeddings like Word2Vec and LexVec.

## Key Results
- Semantic prompts improve Spearman correlations by up to +0.29 on SimLex-999 benchmark
- Some models fail completely on bare words (ρ≈0) but recover with prompts (+0.73 improvement)
- Best results achieve ρ=0.692 on SimLex-999, ρ=0.811 on WordSim-353, and ρ=0.855 on MEN-3000
- Outperforms classic static embeddings: Word2Vec (ρ=0.40) and LexVec (ρ=0.48)
- Improvement is consistent across 7 different text embedding models tested

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper hypothesizes three mechanisms for prompt effectiveness: (1) correcting training distribution mismatch, where models trained on sentences struggle with isolated words; (2) whitespace sensitivity in tokenization, where prompts standardize input format; and (3) semantic priming, where prompts explicitly signal the desired semantic interpretation. The analysis finds that whitespace sensitivity correlates with tokenizer type (BERT vs BPE), but the relative importance of each mechanism varies by model.

## Foundational Learning

**Word similarity benchmarks**
*Why needed*: Provide standardized evaluation of semantic similarity between word pairs
*Quick check*: Verify benchmark datasets (SimLex-999, WordSim-353, MEN-3000) contain human similarity ratings for word pairs

**Spearman correlation**
*Why needed*: Non-parametric measure of monotonic relationship between predicted and human similarity judgments
*Quick check*: Confirm ρ calculation between cosine similarities and human ratings, not Pearson correlation

**Text embedding models**
*Why needed*: Modern models trained on sentences need adaptation for single-word tasks
*Quick check*: Understand that models like OpenAI, Cohere, and Voyage are sentence-level embedding models

**Zero-shot evaluation**
*Why needed*: Demonstrates technique works without model training or fine-tuning
*Quick check*: Verify no gradient updates or parameter changes during evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Word pairs → Prompt templates → Text embedding model → Cosine similarity → Spearman correlation with human ratings

**Critical path**: The embedding model is the critical component—its tokenization and training distribution determine baseline performance and prompt sensitivity.

**Design tradeoffs**: The paper balances between simple handcrafted prompts (easy to implement, limited optimization) versus potential learned prompts (more complex, possibly better performance). Also balances between commercial APIs (potentially better models but version drift) versus open-source models (stable but potentially weaker).

**Failure signatures**: Near-zero correlations on bare words for some models indicate severe training distribution mismatch or tokenization issues. Inconsistent results between whitespace variations indicate tokenization sensitivity.

**First experiments**:
1. Test all-mpnet-base-v2 with "meaning: {word}" prompt on SimLex-999 to verify ρ≈0.49
2. Compare "cat" vs " cat" embeddings for BERT-based vs BPE-based models to identify tokenization sensitivity
3. Run same prompt across different commercial API versions to quantify version drift effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Does prompt-based improvement transfer to downstream tasks like word sense disambiguation and lexical entailment?
*Basis*: Study only evaluates intrinsic similarity tasks; effects on downstream applications unknown.

**Open Question 2**: Do semantic prompts improve word embeddings in languages beyond English?
*Basis*: All benchmarks and models are English-only; cross-lingual effects remain unexplored.

**Open Question 3**: Can learned or optimized prompts outperform the handcrafted templates tested?
*Basis*: Only 4 semantic prompt templates were tested; automated prompt search could discover superior prompts.

**Open Question 4**: What is the relative contribution of the three hypothesized mechanisms (training distribution mismatch, whitespace sensitivity, semantic priming)?
*Basis*: Paper identifies three mechanisms but cannot quantify their relative importance across models.

## Limitations
- Results may vary with commercial API model updates, as exact model versions used are not specified
- Only English benchmarks and models were evaluated, limiting cross-lingual applicability
- Limited set of handcrafted prompts tested—optimized prompts may yield better results
- Does not evaluate transfer to downstream tasks like word sense disambiguation or lexical entailment

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core finding that semantic prompts improve word similarity correlations for text embedding models. The effect is large, consistent across multiple models, and methodology is straightforward.

**Medium confidence**: The absolute magnitude of improvements (e.g., +0.29 for SimLex-999) due to potential API version drift and unknown preprocessing details. The relative performance rankings between models may also shift with model updates.

**Low confidence**: Replicating exact numerical results for commercial models without access to their specific model versions and configurations.

## Next Checks

1. Verify reproducibility using all-mpnet-base-v2 model with 8 prompt conditions on SimLex-999, checking if ρ≈0.49 for "meaning: {word}" matches paper
2. Test whitespace sensitivity explicitly by comparing "cat" vs " cat" embeddings for both BERT-based and BPE-based models
3. Confirm API behavior by running same prompt across different model versions (if available) to quantify sensitivity to model updates for commercial embeddings
