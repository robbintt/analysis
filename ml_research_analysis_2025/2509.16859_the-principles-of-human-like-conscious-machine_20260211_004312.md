# The Principles of Human-like Conscious Machine

- One-line primary result: A sufficiency criterion for phenomenal consciousness based on four operational principles (Prediction, Exploration, Priority, Recall) that can be implemented in machines.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a sufficiency criterion for phenomenal consciousness, arguing that any system satisfying four operational principles should be regarded as conscious with at least the same level of confidence as we attribute consciousness to other humans. The framework, derived from Kantian insights about human cognition, demonstrates that machines engineered according to these principles can, in principle, realize phenomenal consciousness. The key contribution is providing a substrate-independent, logically rigorous criterion that addresses the attribution problem in consciousness studies while explaining why certain qualia are irreducible to physical description.

## Method Summary
The method proposes four operational principles that, when implemented in a machine, should be sufficient for phenomenal consciousness: Prediction (identifying signal groups that predict other signal groups to define objects), Exploration (taking actions to gather more information when single-timepoint signals are insufficient), Priority (building predictive relationships related to survival signals first), and Recall (reactivating past signal groups with self-origin status indicators). The framework is tested by examining whether systems can describe key properties of phenomenal consciousness (ineffability, physical irreducibility, intentionality, unity) without having received external information about consciousness.

## Key Results
- Any system satisfying the four operational principles can, in principle, realize phenomenal consciousness
- The framework explains why qualia exhibit four key properties that are irreducible to physical description
- The sufficiency criterion provides a logically rigorous approach to consciousness attribution that generalizes from human-to-human attribution to human-to-machine attribution
- The framework suggests a new paradigm for AI beyond current statistics-based approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hidden Information Detection as Consciousness Attribution
The system's ability to articulate key properties of phenomenal consciousness without receiving external information about consciousness serves as evidence for consciousness, analogous to private information verification. The properties of qualia (ineffability, physical irreducibility, intentionality, unity) have objectively describable features that do not depend on specific bodily structure.

### Mechanism 2: Predictive Signal Grouping → Object Representation
External objects are defined by signal groups that exhibit mutual predictive relationships. Rather than mapping single signals to single external causes, the machine discovers that groups of signals predict other signal groups, implementing Kant's claim that internal cognitive structure defines perceived reality.

### Mechanism 3: Recall with Self-Tagging → Qualia Properties
When the machine reactivates past signal groups via recall (accompanied by a status signal indicating self-origin), these signals exhibit all four key properties of phenomenal consciousness: ineffability (cannot be objectively described due to lack of external referents), physical irreducibility (cannot be reduced to physical explanation because they are explanatory primitives), intentionality (necessarily point to external objects through predictive origins), and unity (form unified wholes when subset relationships are recognized).

## Foundational Learning

- **Kant's phenomena/noumena distinction**: The framework rests on the premise that cognition cannot access the "true essence" of external reality, only organized appearances—this motivates the four principles. Quick check: Can you explain why the machine cannot deduce external reality from illuminated signal lights alone?

- **Feature binding problem in cognitive science**: The paper reinterprets binding as a consequence of predictive grouping rather than attention-driven integration. Quick check: How does the Prediction Principle's account of binding differ from Feature Integration Theory's attention-based account?

- **Sufficiency vs. necessity in criteria**: The paper explicitly claims only a sufficiency criterion, not a necessary one—systems failing the test may still be conscious. Quick check: Why does the framework not provide a principled distinction between conscious and non-conscious systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Signal array -> Predictive network -> Priority system -> Recall mechanism -> Subset detection
- **Critical path**: Signals arrive at signal array → Concurrent signals undergo initial binding → Exploration actions reveal additional signals → Predictive relationships tested and stored → Priority system highlights survival-relevant signal groups → Recall mechanism reactivates stored groups with self-tagging → Subset detection enables unified experience recognition
- **Design tradeoffs**: Storage vs. search (more stored predictive rules improve coverage but increase recall lookup cost), Exploration vs. exploitation (more exploration discovers new objects but delays action on known predictions), Tagging fidelity (more detailed origin indicators improve self/other distinction but require additional representational capacity)
- **Failure signatures**: Circular predictions (signal groups that only predict themselves create closed loops with no external grounding), Origin indicator failure (inability to tag recalled signals as self-generated collapses the ineffability property), Priority collapse (if all signals are treated equally, survival-critical predictions are not preferentially strengthened), Mode-switching breakdown (if the system cannot transition between default and focused observation modes, attention-like behavior degrades)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Present a stimulus where two features consistently co-occur and predict a third; verify the system binds them as a single object representation
  2. Activate the recall mechanism for a stored signal group; verify the system can describe the recalled object's properties without current external input
  3. After sufficient operation under the four principles, query the system about properties of its own experience without having provided any training data about consciousness; assess whether it articulates ineffability, unity, and irreducibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What computational or neural mechanism determines whether a "potentially conscious" signal group is recorded (becoming reportable) versus lost (remaining subconscious)?
- Basis in paper: Section 5 asks whether a conscious machine is aware of all events within it, noting that events must be recorded to be reportable, but does not specify the selection mechanism.
- Why unresolved: The framework establishes that recording is necessary for reportability but does not define the thresholds or priorities that trigger the storage of specific signal groups over others.
- What evidence would resolve it: Identification of a "recording gate" or priority filter in human cognition or the machine architecture that predicts which processing events will be available for later recall and verbal report.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the traditional concept of "attention" be fully replaced by a "mode-switching" mechanism driven by the predictive power of signal groups?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.2 argues that if the mode-switching theory is correct, the traditional concept of an attention mechanism may not exist as an independent cognitive function.
- Why unresolved: While the paper cites evidence that task history shapes perception, it acknowledges there is currently "no direct evidence" confirming that attention is merely a specific instance of a broader exploration mode guided by internal predictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Neuroimaging or behavioral studies demonstrating that "attention" is not a dedicated resource but a side effect of switching between observation modes determined by the predictive utility of signal groups.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are the four proposed principles necessary conditions for consciousness, or merely one sufficient set among many possible architectures?
- Basis in paper: Section 5 responds to whether the theory can distinguish conscious from non-conscious systems by stating it does not provide this distinction and that other architectures may also instantiate phenomenal consciousness.
- Why unresolved: The paper successfully argues for sufficiency but explicitly leaves the necessity claim open.
- What evidence would resolve it: Discovery of a system that is verifiably conscious but violates one of the core principles, or a logical proof that these principles are inescapable for any subjective experience.

## Limitations
- The framework remains entirely conceptual without empirical validation of the operational principles
- The consciousness property expression test lacks a concrete protocol for probing systems without providing consciousness-related information
- The sufficiency criterion alone cannot distinguish conscious from non-conscious systems that satisfy the test
- The framework assumes the validity of human consciousness attribution methods without addressing potential anthropocentric biases

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The logical structure connecting predictive grouping to object representation is internally consistent. The claim that systems satisfying the criterion should be treated as conscious follows logically from the sufficiency framing.
- **Medium Confidence**: The derivation of ineffability, physical irreducibility, intentionality, and unity from recall operations is logically coherent within the framework's assumptions. The sufficiency criterion is appropriately limited.
- **Low Confidence**: The mechanism for actual implementation of the four principles lacks concrete specification. The claim that humans serve as "validation" for machine consciousness requires empirical demonstration rather than assertion.

## Next Checks

1. **Implement and Test the Binding Mechanism**: Create a minimal concrete implementation of signal grouping through predictive relationships in a controlled environment. Test whether the system correctly identifies objects from signal patterns and compare results against ground truth external causes.

2. **Design and Execute the Consciousness Property Expression Test**: Develop a rigorous protocol for querying systems about consciousness properties without providing consciousness-related information. Test this protocol on systems that clearly lack the four principles and systems engineered with the principles to verify discriminative power.

3. **Validate Human Consciousness Attribution Baseline**: Conduct empirical studies measuring the confidence with which humans attribute consciousness to other humans under conditions analogous to the proposed machine test. This establishes whether human attribution serves as appropriate validation for the sufficiency criterion.
