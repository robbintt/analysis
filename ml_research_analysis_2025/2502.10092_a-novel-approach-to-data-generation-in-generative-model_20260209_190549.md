# A novel approach to data generation in generative model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.10092
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10092
- Authors: JaeHong Kim; Jaewon Shim
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: Introduces Convergent Fusion Paradigm (CFP) theory integrating dimensional expansion with qualitative transformation for generative models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the Convergent Fusion Paradigm (CFP) theory as a novel geometric framework for understanding data generation in generative models. The theory addresses limitations of current Euclidean geometry-based approaches by introducing two conceptual hypotheses: "Creating Relative Space-Time in Relationships (crSTR)" and "Duplex Contradictory Paradoxical Stratified structures of Thorough Closure – Eternal Opening (DCPSs of TC-EO)." CFP theory proposes that data generation involves not just quantitative dimensional expansion but also qualitative transformation, achieved through "time-reversed" metric embeddings using inverse Jacobian functions.

The paper critically examines existing metric-learning approaches in VAEs and suggests Hilbert space as an alternative to Euclidean space for capturing non-diagonalizable interactions. It proposes that current generative models produce artifacts like hallucinations because they force open-world data relationships into closed Euclidean axioms. The authors also introduce a "theory of passivity" as a philosophical supplement to address mathematical limitations in capturing qualitative data generation processes.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes CFP theory as a theoretical framework for generative modeling, focusing on two conceptual hypotheses: crSTR (Creating Relative Space-Time in Relationships) and DCPSs of TC-EO (Duplex Contradictory Paradoxical Stratified structures of Thorough Closure – Eternal Opening). The theory suggests using inverse Jacobian embeddings to pull Riemannian metrics from ambient space back to latent space, creating "time-reversed" metrics that enable qualitative generation. The paper reviews existing pull-back metric approaches and proposes Hilbert space as an alternative spatial metric capable of accommodating qualitative expansion within relative space-time. However, no concrete implementation details or algorithms are provided.

## Key Results
- CFP theory introduces "time-reversed" metric embeddings using inverse Jacobian functions to enable qualitative generation
- The framework addresses identifiability issues and hallucinations in generative models through geometric reinterpretation
- Hilbert space is proposed as alternative to Euclidean space for capturing non-diagonalizable interactions in generative processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: **Inverse Jacobian embeddings function as "time-reversed" metrics that enable qualitative generation.**
- Mechanism: Using the inverse function of the Jacobian (J_φ^(-1)) to pull a Riemannian metric from the ambient space back to the latent space inserts a "reversed time" element into the geometry, theoretically shifting from quantitative compression/restoration to qualitative dimensional expansion.
- Core assumption: The relationship between latent and ambient spaces supports bidirectional "open-world" causality where future states can influence present metric structure.
- Evidence anchors: Section III.3.1.B states inverse Jacobian introduces "reversed time" into Riemannian metric; Abstract claims theory introduces "time-reversed metric embeddings."
- Break condition: If manifold is highly non-linear or Jacobian is ill-conditioned, inverse function cannot be stably computed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: **Data generation is structured as creation of "Relative Space-Time in Relationships" (crSTR).**
- Mechanism: Generation is modeled as interrelationship where two entities (data and algorithm) converge to form "Generative Dynamic Existence Unit" that constructs higher-dimensional framework with qualitative transformation.
- Core assumption: Dimensional expansion emerges from inherent interconnectivity rather than quantitative scaling alone.
- Evidence anchors: Section II.2.1 defines crSTR as process where dimensional expansion emerges from interconnectivity; Table 1 formalizes hypothesis: A ~ B → crSTR.
- Break condition: If system treated as closed Euclidean logic, relational dynamics fail to emerge, reducing process to simple quantitative fitting.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: **Hilbert Space captures non-diagonalizable interactions missed by Euclidean metrics.**
- Mechanism: Hilbert space with infinite-dimensional inner product structure allows richer interactions than Euclidean space, better approximating qualitative transformation required for generating new data clusters.
- Core assumption: Generative process requires complete space where convergence implies stability, with expanded linearity to handle paradox-stratification.
- Evidence anchors: Section IV.1.2 argues Hilbert space allows both diagonal and non-diagonal terms to contribute; Section II.3.4 notes Euclidean constraints reduce "Duplexity-Contradiction" to reflexive manifestation.
- Break condition: Hilbert space remains quantitative approximation; if qualitative aspect is truly non-linear and non-mathematical, Hilbert space only smooths curve rather than creating "life" of data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Riemannian Manifold & Pull-back Metrics**
  - Why needed here: Theory reinterprets VAE latent space using Riemannian geometry rather than Euclidean geometry; requires understanding how to define metric tensor on manifold and "pull it back" from data space to latent space via mapping.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why standard Euclidean metric fails to capture "curvature" of latent space in generative model?

- Concept: **Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Structural Spaces**
  - Why needed here: Theory distinguishes strictly between Ambient (Input), Latent, and Ambient (Output) spaces; understanding how these spaces "overlap" versus "superpose" is critical.
  - Quick check question: In context of this paper, why is "Ambient (Output) Space" considered creation event rather than just reconstruction?

- Concept: **Hilbert Space vs. Euclidean Space**
  - Why needed here: Paper proposes Hilbert space as necessary architectural shift to handle infinite dimensions and non-diagonal interactions.
  - Quick check question: What specific property of Hilbert space allows it to handle "off-diagonal" matrix interactions better than standard Euclidean coordinate planes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: VAE Core (Encoder → Latent → Decoder) → Metric Layer (Riemannian Metric M_χ) → Bridge (Inverse Jacobian J_φ^(-1)) → Philosophical Wrapper ("Passivity" LAI)

- Critical path:
  1. Define Riemannian metric in high-dimensional ambient (input) space using RBF networks to measure density
  2. Use inverse Jacobian of generator map to pull this metric into latent space (Pull-back Metric)
  3. Train generator to utilize "time-reversed" metric to produce output that is "convergent fusion" (crSTR) rather than linear restoration

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Arvanitidis 2020 (Pull-back) vs. Arvanitidis 2021 (EBM Prior): Pull-back is logically robust but computationally expensive (Jacobian derivatives); EBM prior is efficient but theoretically "circular" (approximating an approximation)
  - Completeness vs. Generative Freedom: Hilbert space offers stability (completeness) but may still constrain qualitative emergence via linearity

- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucinations in LLMs: Attributed to distortion caused by forcing open-world data relationships into closed Euclidean axioms
  - Arbitrary Extrapolation: Occurs when latent space trained using simple priors without structural density information from pull-back metric
  - Identifiability Issues: If Riemannian metric not used, straight lines in latent space don't correspond to shortest paths in data space

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement Pull-back Metric: Modify standard VAE to compute Riemannian metric in ambient space and pull back to latent space using inverse Jacobian; compare interpolation quality against standard VAE
  2. Visualizing crSTR: Visualize "overlap" vs "superposition" of clusters in latent vs output space to observe if "qualitative" divergence occurs during generation
  3. Metric Ablation: Compare "time-reversed" pull-back metric against standard prior-based metric to test if "reversed time" claim reduces artifacts in high-dimensional generation tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can Hilbert space effectively capture qualitative generation process in VAEs, overcoming limitations of Euclidean space while addressing its own linearity and convergence constraints?
- Basis in paper: Explicit statement that Hilbert space explores potential as alternative spatial metric but still approximates qualitative generative process due to convergence conditions and linearity
- Why unresolved: Hilbert space offers richer representation but constrains nonlinear qualitative transformations through completeness and linearity requirements
- What evidence would resolve it: Hilbert space-based VAE implementation capturing data generation without reducing to quantitative approximation, with measurable improvements in generation quality

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can posterior distribution p(z|x) be accurately obtained or approximated without introducing arbitrary extrapolation or relying on prior-based approximations that create logical contradictions?
- Basis in paper: Explicit statement that limitation in VAEs stems from inability to mathematically obtain posterior p(z|x) in practice, making it fundamental task to approximate or capture this posterior
- Why unresolved: Existing approaches either use computationally expensive pull-back metrics or rely on prior approximations creating circular logical flaws
- What evidence would resolve it: Method that directly computes or reliably approximates posterior without relying on prior distribution assumptions, validated through convergence to true posterior distributions

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can "theory of passivity" (Leave As It Is, LAI) be operationalized into practical computational framework addressing gap between linear mathematical approximation and qualitative data generation?
- Basis in paper: Explicit proposal of theory of passivity as philosophical supplement to overcome limitations, functioning as bridge between abstract mathematical limitations and real-world data generation
- Why unresolved: Concept remains philosophical without concrete mathematical formulation or implementation guidance
- What evidence would resolve it: Formalized mathematical or algorithmic implementation of passivity principles demonstrably improving generative model performance

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can CFP theory framework be empirically validated against existing metric-learning approaches in terms of ability to reduce hallucinations and improve generation quality?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from claims about addressing identifiability issues and hallucinations in LLMs without empirical validation; claims about dimensional expansion with qualitative transformation remain theoretical
- Why unresolved: Paper is purely theoretical/philosophical with no experimental validation comparing CFP-based approaches to standard VAE implementations
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments measuring hallucination rates, generation fidelity, and latent space structure in VAEs implementing CFP-theoretic principles versus baseline models

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework relies heavily on abstract philosophical concepts without concrete mathematical formulations or empirical validation
- Hilbert space implementation details are absent, making operationalization unclear
- "Time-reversed metric" mechanism lacks rigorous proof of claimed benefits over existing pull-back metric approaches

## Confidence
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about "time-reversed metrics" enabling qualitative generation and specific benefits of Hilbert space over Euclidean geometry lack empirical validation
- **Medium Confidence:** Critique of existing Euclidean-based generative approaches and identifiability issues in VAEs are well-established in literature
- **High Confidence:** Acknowledgment that current generative models struggle with hallucinations and arbitrary extrapolation due to closed-world assumptions is supported by observable failures

## Next Checks
1. Implement and Compare Pull-back Metrics: Implement Arvanitidis et al. (2020) pull-back metric approach and compare interpolation quality and sample diversity against standard VAE baselines on MNIST and CelebA

2. Test Hilbert Space Approximation: Develop finite-dimensional approximation of Hilbert space operations using kernel methods and test whether this reduces generation artifacts compared to standard Euclidean latent spaces

3. Validate Time-Reversal Claim: Conduct ablation studies comparing proposed "time-reversed" inverse Jacobian metric against standard prior-based metrics to empirically test if "reversed time" mechanism reduces hallucinations in high-dimensional generation tasks
