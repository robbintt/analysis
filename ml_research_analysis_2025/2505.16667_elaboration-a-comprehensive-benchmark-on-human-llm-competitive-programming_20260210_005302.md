# ELABORATION: A Comprehensive Benchmark on Human-LLM Competitive Programming

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.16667
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16667
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces ELABORATIONSET: 8,320 annotated competitive programming problems with human feedback

## Executive Summary
ELABORATION presents a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating human-LLM collaboration in competitive programming, addressing the challenge of assessing model performance across the complete programming workflow. The benchmark introduces a novel four-stage taxonomy of human feedback (problem comprehension, solution planning, code generation, and debugging) and includes ELABORATIONSET, a dataset of 8,320 annotated problems from Codeforces and AtCoder. Through both simulated and real human feedback studies, the research demonstrates that human guidance significantly improves LLM performance in competitive programming, particularly during the debugging stage where human feedback achieves 81% precision and 71% recall in bug identification, leading to 24% improvement in pass@1 scores.

## Method Summary
The ELABORATION benchmark introduces a four-stage taxonomy for human feedback in competitive programming: problem comprehension, solution planning, code generation, and debugging. It features ELABORATIONSET, a dataset of 8,320 annotated problems from Codeforces and AtCoder, where each problem is annotated with model-generated feedback at each stage. The framework employs a three-stage evaluation pipeline: 1) Problem Annotation - using GPT-4o-mini to generate detailed feedback on problems, solutions, and code, 2) Feedback Simulation - automatically generating simulated human feedback from annotated data, and 3) Human-LLM Collaboration - conducting human evaluation studies where participants provide feedback at different stages. The benchmark enables both large-scale simulated human feedback evaluation and real human interaction studies to assess the effectiveness of human guidance across the entire competitive programming workflow.

## Key Results
- LLMs alone struggle with competitive programming, achieving only 3.4% pass@1 on hard problems
- Human-LLM collaboration improves performance by up to 11.5% in pass@1 scores
- Human debugging achieves 81% precision and 71% recall in bug identification
- Human debugging leads to 24% improvement in pass@1 performance
- Effective human guidance requires providing feedback throughout the entire programming process, not just code generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive approach to human-LLM collaboration in competitive programming. By systematically breaking down the programming process into four distinct stages (problem comprehension, solution planning, code generation, and debugging), the framework allows for targeted human intervention where models typically struggle most. The ELABORATIONSET dataset provides rich annotations that capture the nuanced aspects of human reasoning across these stages, enabling both scalable simulation of human feedback and detailed analysis of collaboration effectiveness. The four-stage taxonomy reflects the complete competitive programming workflow, ensuring that human guidance addresses all critical aspects from understanding problem statements to identifying and fixing code errors.

## Foundational Learning
- **Competitive Programming Workflow**: Understanding the complete process from problem reading to final code submission is essential because it reveals where human intervention can be most effective
- **Human Feedback Taxonomy**: The four-stage classification (comprehension, planning, generation, debugging) is needed to systematically analyze where LLMs need assistance and how humans can provide targeted guidance
- **Simulated vs. Real Human Feedback**: Comparing automated simulation with actual human interaction helps validate the benchmark's scalability while maintaining accuracy in measuring collaboration effectiveness
- **Pass@1 Metric**: This evaluation metric measures whether a model's first attempt passes all test cases, which is crucial for assessing practical programming effectiveness in competitive settings
- **Bug Identification Precision/Recall**: These metrics are needed to quantify the effectiveness of human debugging assistance and ensure that feedback actually improves code correctness
- **Dataset Annotation Quality**: High-quality annotations are critical because they form the foundation for both simulated feedback generation and benchmark reliability

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Problem Collection -> Annotation Generation -> Feedback Simulation -> Human Evaluation -> Performance Analysis

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is Problem Collection -> Annotation Generation -> Performance Analysis, as high-quality annotations directly determine the benchmark's effectiveness and reliability.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances between scalability (using simulated feedback for large-scale evaluation) and accuracy (incorporating real human studies), though this introduces potential discrepancies between simulated and actual human reasoning patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor annotation quality leading to inaccurate simulated feedback
- Over-reliance on simulated feedback without sufficient real human validation
- Incomplete coverage of problem types or difficulty levels
- Limited generalizability beyond Codeforces and AtCoder platforms

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate baseline LLM performance on ELABORATIONSET without any human feedback to establish performance baselines
2. Test human debugging effectiveness by comparing pass@1 scores with and without human bug identification assistance
3. Analyze the impact of feedback timing by providing guidance at different stages of the programming process

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on specific programming platforms (Codeforces and AtCoder) which may not represent the broader competitive programming landscape
- Simulated human feedback methodology may overestimate collaboration benefits as it cannot perfectly replicate real human reasoning patterns
- Dataset composition may have selection bias toward certain problem types or difficulty distributions
- Evaluation metrics capture specific aspects of performance but may not fully reflect real-world programming effectiveness

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Human debugging effectiveness (81% precision, 71% recall) and its impact on pass@1 improvement (24%)

**Medium confidence**: Overall human-LLM collaboration benefits and the four-stage taxonomy of feedback

**Medium confidence**: Dataset representativeness and scalability of simulated feedback methodology

## Next Checks
1. Test the benchmark's effectiveness on problems from additional competitive programming platforms and real-world coding challenges to verify generalizability
2. Conduct head-to-head comparisons between simulated and actual human feedback in controlled studies to quantify simulation accuracy
3. Evaluate model performance on problems requiring advanced data structures and algorithms not well-represented in the current dataset
