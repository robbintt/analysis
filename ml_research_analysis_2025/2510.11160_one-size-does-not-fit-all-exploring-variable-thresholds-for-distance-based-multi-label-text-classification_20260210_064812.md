# One Size Does Not Fit All: Exploring Variable Thresholds for Distance-Based Multi-Label Text Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11160
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11160
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Label-specific thresholding achieves 46% average improvement over normalized 0.5 thresholding in distance-based multi-label text classification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in distance-based multi-label text classification: the inadequacy of uniform similarity thresholds across different semantic contexts. The authors demonstrate that similarity distributions vary significantly across models, datasets, and individual labels, making fixed thresholds suboptimal. They propose a novel method for optimizing label-specific thresholds using validation data, which adapts to the unique characteristics of each label's similarity distribution.

The experimental results show substantial performance gains, with their label-specific thresholding method achieving an average 46% improvement over normalized 0.5 thresholding and 14% improvement over uniform thresholding approaches. The method also demonstrates strong performance with limited labeled examples, making it particularly valuable for scenarios where annotated data is scarce.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel approach to threshold selection in distance-based multi-label text classification by recognizing that semantic similarity scales are not uniform across models, datasets, or labels. Instead of using a single fixed threshold, they develop a method for optimizing label-specific thresholds using a validation set. The approach involves analyzing the distribution of similarity scores for each label and determining an optimal threshold that maximizes classification performance for that specific label.

The method works by first computing similarity scores between input texts and label representations, then analyzing these distributions to find the threshold that best separates positive and negative examples for each label individually. This label-specific optimization allows the method to adapt to the unique characteristics of each label's semantic space, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all threshold across all labels.

## Key Results
- Label-specific thresholding achieves an average 46% improvement over normalized 0.5 thresholding
- The method outperforms uniform thresholding approaches by an average of 14%
- Strong performance demonstrated with limited labeled examples, making it suitable for data-scarce scenarios
- Statistical significance tests confirm that similarity distributions differ across models, datasets, and labels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works because semantic similarity is inherently contextual and varies significantly depending on the specific label, dataset characteristics, and the underlying model's semantic representation. By recognizing that different labels occupy different regions of the semantic space and have different distributions of similarity scores, the approach can optimize thresholds for each label individually rather than applying a uniform threshold across all labels. This allows for better calibration of the decision boundary for each label based on its specific characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

**Semantic similarity distributions** - Why needed: Understanding how similarity scores are distributed for different labels is crucial for effective threshold selection. Quick check: Verify that similarity scores for different labels follow distinct distributions rather than uniform patterns.

**Distance-based classification fundamentals** - Why needed: The method builds on core principles of using similarity scores as classification confidence measures. Quick check: Ensure understanding of how similarity scores map to classification decisions in multi-label settings.

**Threshold optimization techniques** - Why needed: The approach relies on finding optimal decision boundaries for each label. Quick check: Confirm familiarity with validation-based threshold optimization methods.

**Multi-label classification challenges** - Why needed: The method addresses specific challenges in handling multiple labels per instance. Quick check: Review the unique considerations in multi-label versus multi-class classification.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Text input -> Embedding model -> Similarity computation -> Label-specific threshold optimization -> Multi-label classification output

**Critical path**: The most time-consuming component is the label-specific threshold optimization process, which requires analyzing similarity distributions across all labels in the validation set.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead for improved accuracy, as label-specific optimization requires additional processing compared to uniform thresholding approaches.

**Failure signatures**: The method may underperform when similarity distributions are highly overlapping across labels or when the validation set is too small to reliably estimate optimal thresholds.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Compare label-specific thresholding against uniform thresholding on a simple binary classification task
2. Analyze similarity score distributions across different labels in a multi-label dataset
3. Test threshold optimization with varying sizes of validation sets to understand data requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability across different domain types and vocabulary structures remains uncertain
- Computational overhead of label-specific threshold optimization was not thoroughly characterized
- Limited ablation studies across different annotation budgets and domain types

## Confidence

High confidence: The core claim that similarity distributions vary significantly across models, datasets, and labels is well-supported by statistical significance tests.

Medium confidence: The 46% and 14% improvement figures may be somewhat dataset-dependent, and the scalability claims lack thorough computational overhead analysis.

Medium confidence: The assertion about value for data-scarce scenarios shows promise but needs more extensive validation across different annotation budgets and domain types.

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on domain-specific corpora with specialized vocabulary to assess generalizability beyond standard benchmarks.

2. Conduct computational overhead analysis to quantify the trade-off between improved accuracy and increased processing time.

3. Perform ablation studies across different annotation budgets to better understand the method's behavior as training data availability varies.
