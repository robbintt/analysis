# KineST: A Kinematics-guided Spatiotemporal State Space Model for Human Motion Tracking from Sparse Signals

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16791
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16791
- Reference count: 24
- Key outcome: KineST achieves 2.25 MPJRE and 2.86 MPJPE on AMASS dataset with only 11M parameters

## Executive Summary
KineST introduces a novel kinematics-guided state space model for reconstructing full-body human poses from sparse tracking signals. The method addresses the challenge of motion tracking from limited HMD data by combining a Temporal Flow Module with a Spatiotemporal Kinematic Flow Module, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The model effectively balances accuracy and temporal consistency through its innovative use of kinematics priors and spatiotemporal learning mechanisms.

## Method Summary
KineST tackles full-body pose reconstruction from sparse HMD tracking signals by introducing a novel kinematics-guided state space model architecture. The method processes input sequences of 96 frames with 54 features per frame (3D position, 6D rotation, and velocities for head and two hands) to reconstruct 22 SMPL joints. The core innovation lies in the Temporal Flow Module (TFM) and Spatiotemporal Kinematic Flow Module (SKFM), which work together to capture both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics. The model incorporates kinematic priors through a unidirectional kinematics scanning (UKS) strategy and uses a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning mechanism to couple spatial and temporal contexts effectively.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2.25 MPJRE and 2.86 MPJPE on AMASS dataset
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining only 11M parameters
- Effectively balances accuracy and temporal consistency in full-body motion reconstruction
- Demonstrates superior performance on both AMASS Protocol 1 and Protocol 2 benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly incorporating kinematic priors through the UKS scanning strategy, which respects the natural hierarchy of human body parts. The bidirectional scanning approach allows the model to capture both forward and backward temporal dependencies while maintaining spatial coherence. The geometric angular velocity loss in SO(3) space ensures smooth transitions between frames by directly modeling rotational continuity in the tangent space of the special orthogonal group.

## Foundational Learning

**State Space Models (SSMs)**: Why needed - Efficient sequence modeling with long-range dependencies; Quick check - Verify receptive field matches sequence length requirements

**Lie Algebra for SO(3)**: Why needed - Proper representation of 3D rotations avoiding gimbal lock; Quick check - Confirm rotation interpolation follows geodesic paths

**Unidirectional Kinematics Scanning**: Why needed - Preserves natural joint hierarchy during processing; Quick check - Validate scanning order maintains parent-child relationships

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Sequence -> TFM Blocks -> SKFM Blocks -> Regressor -> Output Poses

**Critical Path**: Input → Temporal Flow Module → Spatiotemporal Kinematic Flow Module → Geometric Angular Velocity Loss → Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Uses 11M parameters for balance between performance and efficiency
- Employs bidirectional scanning to capture temporal context
- Incorporates geometric losses for motion continuity

**Failure Signatures**:
- High jitter indicates geometric angular velocity loss implementation issues
- Poor lower body accuracy expected due to sparse upper-body inputs
- Unrealistic poses suggest incorrect UKS scanning order application

**First Experiments**:
1. Test UKS scanning order with synthetic data to verify node ordering
2. Validate geometric angular velocity loss computation against ground truth
3. Test full pipeline with reduced complexity to isolate implementation issues

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on specific SSM implementations (Mamba-2/SSD) without full architectural details
- Data preprocessing pipeline not fully specified, including FPS and normalization procedures
- Potential reproducibility challenges due to ambiguous LMA/GMA component configurations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core conceptual framework and reported performance metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: Architectural choices for TFM and SKFM modules
- **Low Confidence**: Geometric angular velocity loss implementation details in SO(3) space

## Next Checks
1. Verify UKS scanning order implementation by testing with synthetic data
2. Validate geometric angular velocity loss computation in SO(3) tangent space
3. Test full model pipeline with simplified data to isolate potential issues
