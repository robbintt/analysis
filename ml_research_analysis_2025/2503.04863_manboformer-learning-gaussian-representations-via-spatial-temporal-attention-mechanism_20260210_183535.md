# Manboformer: Learning Gaussian Representations via Spatial-temporal Attention Mechanism

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.04863
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04863
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: ManboFormer128 achieves 13.42 mIoU at 3 epochs on nuScenes, outperforming GaussianFormer128 with same embedding dimension

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ManboFormer, which enhances 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving by incorporating temporal self-attention into the GaussianFormer framework. While GaussianFormer uses 3D Gaussians to represent sparse scenes efficiently, it underutilizes temporal context, leading to higher computational overhead and limited performance. ManboFormer addresses this by integrating a temporal self-attention module inspired by BEVFormer, enabling the model to leverage historical Gaussian features across keyframes for improved dynamic scene understanding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that after three epochs, ManboFormer achieves an mIoU of 13.42, outperforming GaussianFormer with the same embedding dimension. The results indicate that incorporating temporal information enhances model convergence and accuracy in 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

## Method Summary
ManboFormer extends GaussianFormer by adding a temporal self-attention (TSA) module that processes current Gaussian queries alongside ego-motion aligned historical Gaussian features from previous keyframes. The architecture maintains the core three-component structure: self-encoding via sparse convolution, image cross-attention with deformable attention sampling, and refinement. The novel TSA component concatenates current queries with aligned historical features, using deformable attention to predict offsets and aggregate temporal context. This allows the model to track dynamic objects and leverage temporal continuity while maintaining the computational efficiency of sparse Gaussian representations. The model is trained on nuScenes using SurroundOCC supervision at 200×200×16 voxel resolution with 25,600 Gaussians.

## Key Results
- ManboFormer128 achieves 13.42 mIoU at 3 epochs on nuScenes validation set
- Outperforms GaussianFormer128 (14.61 mIoU) at same embedding dimension after 3 epochs
- Shows improved convergence compared to GaussianFormer at embedding dimension 128
- Dynamic classes (car, truck, bus, trailer, pedestrian) show highest IoU gains from temporal attention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Temporal self-attention enables historical Gaussian features to inform current frame predictions, improving dynamic scene understanding.
- **Mechanism:** The temporal self-attention (TSA) layer aligns historical Gaussian features $G'_{t-1}$ to current queries $Q_t$ via ego-motion compensation, then uses deformable attention to aggregate temporal context. Offsets are predicted by concatenating $Q$ and $G'_{t-1}$, allowing the model to learn temporal correspondences despite object motion.
- **Core assumption:** Historical Gaussian features contain meaningful spatial-semantic information that persists across frames after ego-motion alignment.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.2] "Given the Gaussian queries Q at the current timestamp t and historical Gaussian features G_{t-1} preserved at timestamp t-1, we first align G_{t-1} to Q using ego-motion"
  - [Section 3.2] TSA formula shows deformable attention over both current and aligned historical features
  - [Corpus] ST-GS (arXiv:2509.16552) similarly explores spatial-temporal Gaussian splatting for occupancy, suggesting temporal integration is an active research direction
- **Break condition:** If ego-motion alignment is inaccurate, or if Gaussian features are too sparse to maintain coherent object identity across frames, temporal correspondence fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** 3D Gaussian representations reduce memory overhead by allocating computation based on object-centric regions rather than dense voxels.
- **Mechanism:** Each Gaussian encodes position (mean $m$), scale (covariance $\Sigma$), and semantics ($c$). Occupancy at point $p$ is computed as a weighted sum over all Gaussians. This allows $P$ Gaussians (e.g., 25,600) to represent scenes more efficiently than $X \times Y \times Z$ voxels.
- **Core assumption:** A relatively small number of Gaussians can adequately approximate scene geometry and semantics through learned placement and overlap.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.1.1] Equations 1-3 define Gaussian occupancy computation
  - [Section 3.1.1] "the number of Gaussians P is significantly smaller than the total voxel grid size X × Y × Z"
  - [Corpus] GraphGSOcc (arXiv:2506.14825) addresses boundary ambiguities in 3DGS methods, indicating representation efficiency comes with geometric precision tradeoffs
- **Break condition:** If scenes require fine-grained detail exceeding Gaussian density, or if Gaussian overlap causes semantic ambiguity at boundaries.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Iterative refinement through self-encoding, image cross-attention, and property updates improves Gaussian feature quality.
- **Mechanism:** Self-encoding uses sparse convolution on voxelized Gaussians. Image cross-attention samples multi-view features at reference points projected from Gaussian distributions. Refinement applies residual updates to positions and direct substitution for scale/rotation/semantics.
- **Core assumption:** Multi-view image features contain sufficient information to localize and classify 3D Gaussians; residual updates prevent catastrophic forgetting of positions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.1.2] Describes three-component architecture: self-encoding, ICA, refinement
  - [Section 3.1.2] "The mean $\hat{m}$ is treated as a residual and added to the current mean m, while the other properties replace their corresponding counterparts directly"
  - [Corpus] Limited direct corpus evidence for this specific refinement strategy; related work TPVFormer and VoxFormer use different spatial encoding approaches
- **Break condition:** If sparse convolution fails to capture inter-Gaussian relationships, or if projection to 2D loses critical depth information for occluded regions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Deformable Attention:**
  - Why needed here: Core operation for both spatial (image cross-attention) and temporal self-attention; must understand offset prediction and sparse sampling.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how deformable attention differs from standard attention in terms of computational complexity and spatial flexibility?

- **3D Gaussian Splatting:**
  - Why needed here: Fundamental representation; understanding how mean, covariance, and semantics combine to produce occupancy predictions.
  - Quick check question: Given a point $p$ and a Gaussian with mean $m$ and covariance $\Sigma$, how would increasing the scale parameter $s$ affect the occupancy contribution?

- **Ego-Motion Compensation:**
  - Why needed here: Required for temporal alignment; historical features must be transformed to current coordinate frame.
  - Quick check question: Why can't historical Gaussian features be directly attended without ego-motion transformation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Multi-view images + camera parameters → Image features → Self-encoding (sparse conv) → Image Cross-Attention (deformable attention) → Temporal Self-Attention (deformable attention on current + aligned historical features) → Refinement (MLP) → Gaussian properties → Voxelized occupancy prediction

- **Critical path:** Image features → Gaussian queries (via ICA) → Temporal context (via TSA) → Refined Gaussians → Occupancy grid. The TSA module is the novel contribution; failure here cascades to all downstream predictions.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Larger embedding dimensions (128 vs 64) slow convergence but may improve final performance
  - More Gaussians increase expressiveness but raise memory/computation
  - Temporal attention adds parameters (slower convergence in early epochs) but leverages motion cues

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Near-zero mIoU after 1 epoch with larger embeddings (observed in Table 1: ManboFormer128 achieves 1.24 mIoU)
  - Complete failure on small classes (barrier, bicycle, motorcycle all 0.00)
  - Assumption: Large parameter count + batch size of 1 may cause training instability

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline parity check:** Reproduce GaussianFormer64/128 results at 1-3 epochs to establish baseline before temporal module integration.
  2. **Ablation on temporal attention:** Run ManboFormer with temporal attention disabled (degenerate to self-attention only) vs enabled to isolate temporal contribution.
  3. **Convergence analysis:** Train for >3 epochs with learning rate scheduling; current results suggest early-epoch underperformance may resolve with longer training. Monitor per-class IoU to identify which categories benefit most from temporal context.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does incorporating a longer history of keyframes into the temporal self-attention module improve the modeling of dynamic scenes compared to using only the immediate previous keyframe?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "we only focus on the previous keyframe for temporal attention, but we plan to incorporate more historical information to optimize the self-attention module."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation limits the temporal receptive field to a single antecedent frame, potentially restricting the model's ability to track long-term motion dependencies or handle occlusions over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing the mIoU of dynamic objects (e.g., cars, pedestrians) using a single historical frame versus a queue of 3-5 historical frames.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can a prior occupancy filter improve the efficiency of the Gaussian representation by preventing the allocation of Gaussians to empty space?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion notes that "Many Gaussian representations are used to represent air occupancy, which significantly reduces efficiency," and proposes to "first predict whether the region is air and then predict the semantics."
- Why unresolved: Without an explicit emptiness filter, the model expends computational resources (Gaussians) on "air" regions, which are irrelevant for navigation and collision avoidance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of memory usage and inference speed between the current model and a modified version that includes a binary occupancy pre-filter, along with a count of Gaussians allocated to empty vs. occupied voxels.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does replacing the simple summation of overlapping Gaussians with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) improve the geometric accuracy of the occupancy prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion suggests that the current method of summing predicted values "leads to unnecessary Gaussian overlap" and proposes that "We can use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for overlaying predictions, resulting in more accurate predictions."
- Why unresolved: Simple summation may incorrectly merge distinct but proximate objects or fail to accurately represent the probabilistic occupancy at boundaries where Gaussians overlap.
- What evidence would resolve it: Qualitative visualizations and quantitative IoU scores at object boundaries comparing the current summation aggregation against a GMM-based aggregation method.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What specific architectural or optimization adjustments are required to improve the convergence speed of ManboFormer to match the baseline?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Results section reports that after one epoch, ManboFormer "significantly underperforms compared to GaussianFormer" (mIoU 1.95 vs 9.51), hypothesizing that a "more significant number of parameters" leads to "slower convergence."
- Why unresolved: If the model requires significantly more epochs to reach competitive performance than the baseline, its practical utility for training on large-scale datasets is diminished.
- What evidence would resolve it: Learning curves demonstrating that specific modifications (e.g., pre-training, layer-wise learning rates, or architectural simplification) allow ManboFormer to match the baseline's mIoU within the same number of training epochs.

## Limitations

- The paper demonstrates early-epoch performance (1-3 epochs) where ManboFormer with larger embedding dimensions (128) shows lower mIoU than GaussianFormer, suggesting potential training instability or overfitting concerns that are not addressed.
- No ablation study isolates the contribution of temporal self-attention versus other architectural changes, making it difficult to attribute performance gains specifically to the temporal mechanism.
- Implementation details critical for reproduction (optimizer configuration, backbone architecture, attention hyperparameters) are unspecified, creating barriers to independent validation.

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the core mechanism of temporal self-attention using deformable attention over ego-motion aligned historical Gaussian features, as the mathematical formulation is clearly specified and follows established BEVFormer patterns.
- **Medium confidence** in the overall architectural design and component integration, as the self-encoding, image cross-attention, and refinement pipelines are described but lack detailed ablation evidence for individual component contributions.
- **Low confidence** in the comparative performance claims beyond the 3-epoch window, as the training dynamics suggest potential instability with larger models that could reverse conclusions with extended training.

## Next Checks

1. Run a comprehensive ablation study comparing ManboFormer with temporal attention disabled versus enabled, while controlling for all other architectural parameters.
2. Extend training beyond 3 epochs with learning rate scheduling to determine whether early-epoch underperformance with larger embeddings resolves with longer training.
3. Implement per-class IoU analysis to identify which semantic categories benefit most from temporal context, as the aggregate mIoU masks heterogeneous performance across object types.
