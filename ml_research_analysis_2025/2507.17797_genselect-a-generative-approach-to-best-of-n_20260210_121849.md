  While pointwise methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities and pairwise methods

# GenSelect: A Generative Approach to Best-of-N

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17797
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17797
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Generative approach that asks LLM to directly identify best solution among N candidates improves Best-of-N accuracy from 60% to 73% on competition-level math benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GenSelect, a novel method for Best-of-N selection that directly asks large language models to identify the best solution from all N candidates simultaneously. Unlike pointwise methods that underutilize comparative abilities or pairwise methods that scale inefficiently, GenSelect leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while maintaining efficient scaling across parallel sampling budgets. The approach demonstrates substantial improvements on competition-level math reasoning benchmarks, particularly when using reasoning models like QwQ and DeepSeek-R1 with simple prompting strategies.

## Method Summary
GenSelect addresses the fundamental limitations of existing Best-of-N selection methods by using a generative reward model that asks LLMs to identify the best solution from all candidates simultaneously. While pointwise methods require scoring each solution independently and pairwise methods scale quadratically with the number of candidates, GenSelect enables direct N-ary comparison through simple prompting. The method particularly excels with reasoning models, showing stable performance across different inference setups and enabling efficient scaling to larger sampling budgets without degradation.

## Key Results
- Accuracy improvement from 60% to 73% on Comp-Math-24-25 benchmark using 32 generations
- Stable performance across different inference setups and sampling budgets
- 8-way comparisons requiring only two rounds to evaluate 64 solutions demonstrates practical efficiency
- Reasoning models like QwQ and DeepSeek-R1 excel at GenSelect with simple prompting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GenSelect directly leverages the comparative reasoning capabilities of large language models by asking them to identify the best solution from all N candidates simultaneously. This approach taps into the intrinsic ability of LLMs to compare and reason about multiple solutions in context, rather than forcing them to evaluate each solution in isolation or through inefficient pairwise comparisons. The generative formulation allows models to use their full reasoning capacity to make holistic judgments about solution quality across the entire candidate set.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM reasoning capabilities**: Understanding how models like QwQ and DeepSeek-R1 perform self-correction and long reasoning is essential for appreciating why they excel at comparative tasks.
  - Why needed: The method's effectiveness depends on models' ability to reason about multiple solutions simultaneously.
  - Quick check: Compare performance of reasoning vs non-reasoning models on GenSelect tasks.

- **Best-of-N selection tradeoffs**: Recognizing the limitations of pointwise (independent scoring) and pairwise (quadratic scaling) approaches motivates the need for a more efficient N-ary comparison method.
  - Why needed: Contextualizes the innovation and performance gains of GenSelect.
  - Quick check: Measure scaling efficiency of GenSelect vs pairwise methods as N increases.

- **Generative prompting strategies**: Understanding how to formulate prompts that elicit comparative reasoning rather than isolated evaluation is key to implementing GenSelect effectively.
  - Why needed: The method's simplicity relies on finding the right prompt formulation.
  - Quick check: Test different prompt formulations for N-ary comparison effectiveness.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: N candidates -> GenSelect prompt -> LLM reasoning model -> Best solution selection

**Critical Path**: Solution generation → N-ary comparison prompt → LLM reasoning → Selection decision

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades the complexity of pairwise comparison mechanisms for the simplicity of direct N-ary prompting, sacrificing some granularity in exchange for computational efficiency and leveraging LLM comparative abilities.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when using non-reasoning models, instability with complex prompting strategies, or reduced effectiveness with non-mathematical domains.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare GenSelect performance on AIME benchmarks using QwQ-32B vs standard Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
2. Measure scaling efficiency by comparing 8-way vs 4-way vs pairwise comparison methods
3. Test GenSelect stability across different sampling budgets (8, 16, 32, 64 generations)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the GenSelect mechanism generalize to non-mathematical domains such as code generation, logical reasoning, or general language understanding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "Future work could explore extending GenSelect to other reasoning domains and general tasks."
- Why unresolved: All experiments in the paper are restricted to competition-level mathematics (AIME, HMMT).
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying GenSelect to diverse benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval for code or GPQA for science) and comparing selection accuracy against current math-only results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can reinforcement learning (RL) be used to distill the N-ary comparison capabilities of large reasoning models into smaller, more efficient models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the "GenSelect formulation is also suitable for reinforcement learning" and suggest future work could "leverage RL to learn the comparative capabilities... in smaller LLMs."
- Why unresolved: The current study relies on zero-shot prompting of large models (QwQ-32B, DeepSeek-R1) without training or fine-tuning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training a smaller model (e.g., 7B parameters) via RL on GenSelect tasks and measuring its Best-of-N selection accuracy relative to the larger teacher models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the effectiveness of GenSelect dependent on the intrinsic "reasoning" capabilities of the model, or can standard non-reasoning LLMs perform N-ary comparisons effectively?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes that "reasoning models... excel at GenSelect" and utilizes models specifically designed for long reasoning traces.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the performance gains are due to the N-ary selection format or the specific self-correction abilities inherent to models like QwQ and DeepSeek-R1.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing the GenSelect performance of standard instruct models (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct without reasoning tuning) against their reasoning-trained counterparts.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focused on competition-level math reasoning benchmarks, limiting generalizability to other domains
- Performance improvements specific to tested reasoning models may not transfer to other LLM architectures
- Stability claims across different inference setups need broader validation across more diverse hardware and computational constraints

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core methodology of using generative prompting for direct Best-of-N selection is sound and the mathematical reasoning for why this approach leverages comparative abilities more effectively than pointwise methods is well-established.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claimed efficiency improvements and stability across sampling budgets are supported by the presented results, but would benefit from testing across a wider range of model sizes, hardware configurations, and problem domains.
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization claims to domains beyond competition-level math reasoning require additional validation, and the long-term stability of performance improvements as model architectures evolve remains uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Test GenSelect performance across diverse domains including code generation, creative writing, and factual question answering to assess generalizability beyond mathematical reasoning.
2. Evaluate the method with smaller LLM models (7B-13B parameters) to determine if efficiency gains persist with reduced computational resources.
3. Conduct ablation studies varying prompt complexity, reasoning depth requirements, and comparison formats to identify optimal configurations and understand sensitivity to implementation details.
