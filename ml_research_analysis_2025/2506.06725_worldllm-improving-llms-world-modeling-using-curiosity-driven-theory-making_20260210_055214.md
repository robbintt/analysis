# WorldLLM: Improving LLMs' world modeling using curiosity-driven theory-making

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.06725
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06725
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: WorldLLM achieves higher predictive accuracy than baseline approaches without hypotheses, with oracle baselines reaching up to 0.81 normalized log-likelihood on complex transitions in a textual game environment.

## Executive Summary
WorldLLM is a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining natural language hypotheses with curiosity-driven reinforcement learning. The system uses hypotheses provided in-context to guide predictions, then employs an RL agent to collect transitions that disconfirm current hypotheses. This creates an iterative cycle where the LLM refines its understanding of environment dynamics through active exploration. The framework demonstrates that theory-based RL with active exploration can improve LLMs' ability to ground their knowledge in specific domains without gradient-based fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
WorldLLM implements a three-component system: a Statistician LLM that makes predictions conditioned on hypotheses, a Scientist LLM that generates candidate hypotheses via Metropolis-Hastings sampling, and an Experimenter that collects transitions using either oracle policies or RL with intrinsic rewards. The framework alternates between hypothesis refinement via Bayesian inference and data collection focused on transitions with low predictive likelihood. Hypotheses are provided in-context to the Statistician, enabling the LLM to apply abstract natural language rules to concrete state-action pairs without gradient updates.

## Key Results
- WorldLLM achieves higher predictive accuracy than baseline approaches without hypotheses
- RL-LogP (curiosity-driven RL) obtains results close to or better than oracle baselines, with normalized area up to 0.62 on Grow Plant transitions
- The framework generates human-interpretable theories about environment dynamics
- Oracle baselines reach up to 0.81 normalized log-likelihood on complex transitions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Natural language hypotheses provided in-context improve LLM prediction accuracy on domain-specific transitions
- **Mechanism**: The Statistician conditions its forward model P(s'|s,a,H) on hypotheses H included in the prompt, grounding general world knowledge into environment-specific rules
- **Core assumption**: LLMs can apply abstract natural language rules to concrete state-action pairs via in-context learning
- **Evidence anchors**: Performance improvements when hypotheses are provided, though limited evidence for in-context mechanism specifically
- **Break condition**: Hypotheses containing environment-specific examples rather than abstract rules fail to generalize to syntax changes

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Bayesian inference with an LLM proposal distribution iteratively refines hypotheses toward higher-likelihood explanations
- **Mechanism**: The Scientist generates candidate hypotheses via PSc(Ĥ|D, Ĥ_current) with Metropolis acceptance based on log-likelihood comparison
- **Core assumption**: LLM proposal distribution generates valid hypotheses; likelihood estimates are meaningful
- **Evidence anchors**: Retention rates show ~20% acceptance early, declining to ~2% as hypotheses improve
- **Break condition**: Single-particle Metropolis gets trapped in local optima when retention rate drops near zero

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Curiosity-driven RL with prediction-error rewards collects transitions that efficiently disconfirm current hypotheses
- **Mechanism**: Experimenter receives intrinsic reward r = -log P(s'|s,a,H) for RL-LogP, focusing data collection on poorly-predicted transitions
- **Core assumption**: Low-likelihood transitions contain information gain for hypothesis refinement
- **Evidence anchors**: RL-LogP achieves results close to oracle baselines in simple environments
- **Break condition**: RL-ALP fails when rewards become sparse as hypothesis acceptance drops

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: In-context learning / Prompt engineering
  - **Why needed here**: WorldLLM relies entirely on conditioning predictions via prompt hypotheses rather than fine-tuning
  - **Quick check**: Can you explain why adding "You know that: [rule]" to a prompt might change token probabilities for downstream predictions?

- **Concept**: Metropolis-Hastings / MCMC sampling
  - **Why needed here**: The Scientist uses Metropolis algorithm for Bayesian hypothesis search
  - **Quick check**: If the Metropolis acceptance rate is 2%, what does this suggest about the proposal distribution quality or hypothesis space convergence?

- **Concept**: Intrinsic motivation / Curiosity-driven RL
  - **Why needed here**: The Experimenter uses prediction error and learning progress as intrinsic rewards
  - **Quick check**: Why might prediction-error rewards fail in stochastic environments (the "noisy TV" problem)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Experimenter collects transitions → Scientist proposes hypotheses via Metropolis → Statistician evaluates log-likelihood → Update hypotheses → Update Experimenter policy (if RL)
- **Critical path**: Initialize H_0 → Collect 150 transitions → Run 5 Metropolis steps → Update Experimenter policy → Repeat for 400 iterations
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Oracle vs RL Experimenter: Oracles provide upper bounds but require environment knowledge; RL-LogP achieves comparable results autonomously but may not scale
  - Hypothesis length vs generalization: Current implementation favors examples over abstract rules, impairing generalization
  - RL-LogP vs RL-ALP: RL-LogP is simpler and more stable; RL-ALP tracks actual progress but suffers from sparse rewards
- **Failure signatures**:
  - RL-ALP collapse: Rewards converge to zero, policy reverts to random
  - Local optima: Single-particle Metropolis gets stuck in hypothesis space
  - Poor generalization: Hypotheses contain environment-specific syntax
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce O-Ideal vs O-Random comparison on 2 object types to verify hypothesis-conditioned prediction improvements
  2. Ablate Metropolis steps (n_steps ∈ {1, 5, 10}) to measure sensitivity to search depth
  3. Test RL-LogP vs RL-ALPEXP with α ∈ {0.6, 0.75, 0.9, 0.95} to identify stable reward configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can specific priors enable the Scientist to generate abstract hypotheses rather than memorized examples?
- **Basis in paper**: Authors note hypotheses often contain examples, impairing generalization, and suggest "richer priors" or length minimization could foster abstract theories
- **Why unresolved**: Current optimization maximizes likelihood but lacks constraints favoring succinctness or structural abstraction
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Improved performance on generalization environment and qualitative analysis showing rules apply to categories

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Does WorldLLM scale to environments where complexity does not correlate with textual length?
- **Basis in paper**: Authors highlight that Playground-Text is simple and RL-LogP relies on natural ordering that may not generalize
- **Why unresolved**: Current environment's reliance on text length as difficulty proxy may artificially boost curiosity-driven agents
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Consistent predictive accuracy in environments where transition complexity is decoupled from observation length

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can particle filters or replay buffers prevent hypothesis forgetting and local optima?
- **Basis in paper**: Current Metropolis algorithm only uses recent transitions, causing forgetting, and tracks single particle, risking local optima
- **Why unresolved**: Context window limits and computational costs restricted implementation to single particle
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Higher hypothesis retention rates and reduced variance in log-likelihoods across seeds with buffer-based inference

## Limitations
- Generated hypotheses often overfit to environment-specific syntax rather than capturing abstract rules
- Single-particle Metropolis algorithm is prone to local optima in hypothesis space
- RL-ALP's learning progress reward signal becomes sparse in complex environments, causing policy collapse
- Framework validated only in simple textual game environments with 2-4 object types

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: In-context learning improves LLM prediction accuracy when given relevant natural language hypotheses
- **Medium confidence**: Bayesian inference with LLM proposals can iteratively refine hypotheses toward higher-likelihood explanations
- **Low confidence**: Curiosity-driven RL with prediction-error rewards efficiently collects information-rich transitions in complex environments

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability Test**: Evaluate WorldLLM in environments with 8+ object types and longer episode lengths to assess scaling beyond current 2-4 object domains
2. **Hypothesis Abstraction Evaluation**: Implement and test length or abstraction priors in Metropolis acceptance criterion to encourage more general hypotheses, then measure generalization performance on syntax-varied transitions
3. **Multi-particle Hypothesis Search**: Replace single-particle Metropolis with particle filter or multiple chains to evaluate improvements in hypothesis quality and reduction of local optima trapping
