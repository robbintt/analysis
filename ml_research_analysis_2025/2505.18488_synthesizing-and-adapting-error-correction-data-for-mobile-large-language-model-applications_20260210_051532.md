# Synthesizing and Adapting Error Correction Data for Mobile Large Language Model Applications

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.18488
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18488
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Fine-tuning billion-parameter LLMs with reweighted synthetic error correction data achieves 2.47% to 7.18% relative gains on key production metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of error correction in mobile large language models by proposing a method to synthesize and adapt high-quality datasets for this domain. The authors develop a scalable data synthesis pipeline using LLM prompting with error correction domain knowledge, then adapt the synthetic data distribution to match mobile application requirements through reweighting based on A/B test metric predictions and on-device LM scores. The approach demonstrates significant improvements in both offline evaluations and live A/B tests, with 2.47% to 7.18% relative gains on key production metrics like click-through and acceptance rates when fine-tuning with a mixture of original and reweighted synthetic data.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a three-stage approach to improve error correction for mobile LLMs. First, they prompt LLMs with error correction domain knowledge to build a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates synthetic error correction examples. Second, they adapt the synthetic data distribution to the mobile application domain by reweighting samples using a model trained to predict live A/B test metrics from LLM performance and privacy-preserving on-device LM scores. Finally, they present best practices for mixing synthetic data with other sources to improve model performance. The method particularly emphasizes continue training strategies that achieve significant improvements in both offline evaluation and live A/B tests.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning billion-parameter LLMs with a mixture of original and reweighted synthetic data achieves significant improvements
- 2.47% to 7.18% relative gains observed on key production metrics including click-through and acceptance rates
- Continue training approach shows particularly strong performance compared to other fine-tuning strategies
- Improvements validated through both offline evaluation and live A/B tests

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing the data scarcity problem in error correction for mobile LLMs through synthetic data generation. By prompting LLMs with domain knowledge, the authors create a scalable pipeline that can produce high-quality error correction examples. The reweighting mechanism ensures that the synthetic data distribution matches the specific requirements of mobile applications by incorporating real-world performance signals and privacy-preserving on-device metrics. This targeted adaptation allows the model to learn error correction patterns that are directly relevant to mobile deployment scenarios, leading to improved performance on actual user interactions.

## Foundational Learning

**LLM prompting for data synthesis**: Using LLMs to generate training data by providing domain-specific instructions and examples. Needed because high-quality error correction data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. Quick check: Verify generated examples maintain semantic consistency and cover diverse error types.

**Domain adaptation through reweighting**: Adjusting the importance of training samples based on their relevance to target domain characteristics. Needed to ensure synthetic data matches mobile application requirements rather than generic error correction scenarios. Quick check: Compare distribution statistics between original and reweighted datasets.

**Privacy-preserving on-device LM scores**: Computing language model confidence scores directly on user devices without transmitting sensitive data. Needed to maintain user privacy while incorporating real-world performance signals into the training process. Quick check: Validate that score computation doesn't leak private information while maintaining accuracy.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data synthesis pipeline -> Reweighting model -> Fine-tuning module -> Evaluation system

**Critical path**: LLM prompting → Synthetic data generation → Reweighting based on on-device scores → Continue training → A/B test evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: The approach balances synthetic data quality with computational efficiency, and between privacy preservation and model performance. Using on-device scores enables privacy but may limit the richness of available signals compared to server-side processing.

**Failure signatures**: Poor A/B test performance indicates ineffective domain adaptation or synthetic data quality issues. Low improvement in offline metrics suggests problems with the data synthesis pipeline or reweighting strategy.

**First experiments**: 1) Test synthetic data generation with different prompting strategies, 2) Evaluate reweighting effectiveness on a small sample before full deployment, 3) Compare continue training versus full fine-tuning on validation metrics.
