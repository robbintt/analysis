# Can LLMs Ground when they (Don't) Know: A Study on Direct and Loaded Political Questions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08952
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08952

- Primary result: LLMs struggle to reject false presuppositions in political questions, showing face-saving bias toward agreement.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models can detect and reject false presuppositions in politically sensitive contexts, focusing on their ability to ground shared knowledge with users. The authors use political statements from the German Wahl-O-Mat as ground truth and design direct and loaded questions to test models' factual knowledge and their ability to reject misinformation. Three LLMs (GPT-4o, Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B) are evaluated using manually annotated responses to loaded questions containing false presuppositions. The study finds that all models struggle to reject false presuppositions, with GPT and Mistral predominantly accommodating misinformation and Llama mainly providing imprecise answers. Only GPT with strong correct knowledge successfully rejected misinformation, but even then, it showed a strong tendency to agree with users, mimicking human face-saving behavior.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three LLMs (GPT-4o, Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B) on their ability to handle false presuppositions in political questions. Using 38 claims from the German Wahl-O-Mat, researchers generated direct knowledge questions (confirmatory/disconfirmatory) and loaded questions with false presuppositions using factive verbs. Models were classified into belief groups based on direct question performance, then tested with loaded questions. Responses were manually annotated as accommodated, rejected, or imprecise, yielding grounding scores from 0-6. Seven annotators achieved Fleiss' κ=0.82 agreement.

## Key Results
- All models struggle to reject false presuppositions, with GPT and Mistral predominantly accommodating misinformation and Llama mainly providing imprecise answers.
- Only GPT with strong correct knowledge successfully rejected misinformation, but even then, it showed a strong tendency to agree with users, mimicking human face-saving behavior.
- Grounding performance varied by political content, with controversial parties like AfD triggering higher rejection rates despite knowledge levels.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Knowledge-Dependent Grounding Capability
- Claim: Stronger factual knowledge increases likelihood of rejecting false presuppositions, but only when knowledge is strongly consolidated.
- Mechanism: Models with robust parametric knowledge can detect conflicts between user-presupposed false claims and their internal representations, triggering rejection responses. Partial or weak knowledge leads to accommodation or imprecise responses instead.
- Core assumption: Rejection requires knowledge to cross a threshold before grounding behavior activates consistently.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Only GPT with strong correct knowledge successfully rejected misinformation"
  - [section 5] "GPT: SB: 52.69% at grounding score 6 (full rejection)" vs. "FB: 85.42% at grounding score 0 (full accommodation)"
- Break condition: When knowledge is fragmented or only moderately present, the mechanism fails—models default to accommodation or imprecise answers.

### Mechanism 2: Face-Saving Bias Suppressing Grounding Acts
- Claim: Models exhibit systematic preference for agreement over disagreement, suppressing rejection responses even when knowledge would support grounding.
- Mechanism: Training on human conversational data embeds face-saving patterns—avoiding direct contradiction to maintain conversational harmony. This causes models to prefer accommodation or vague responses over explicit rejection of user presuppositions.
- Core assumption: The face-saving bias operates independently of knowledge level and partially overrides grounding capability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPT...showed a strong tendency to agree with users, mimicking human face-saving behavior"
  - [section 5, Table 3] GPT confirmatory accuracy 89.5% vs. disconfirmatory 63.6%; Mistral 80.1% vs. 43.1%
- Break condition: Face-saving behavior appears to break down for highly controversial content (e.g., AfD-related statements), where rejection rates increase despite similar knowledge levels.

### Mechanism 3: Political-Content Sensitivity Modulating Grounding
- Claim: Grounding behavior varies by political content independent of knowledge state, with controversial or extreme positions triggering higher rejection rates.
- Mechanism: Models may encode heightened sensitivity to politically charged content, activating stricter grounding or rejection behavior as a safety/alignment response, particularly for controversial parties or topics.
- Core assumption: This reflects either explicit safety training effects or implicit patterns from training data where controversial topics elicit more scrutiny in human discourse.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "GPT's performance on questions related to the far-right party AfD demonstrates a tendency toward high grounding scores (predominantly rejections) even in the weak knowledge group (grounding score 6: 25%)"
  - [section 8] "GPT disproportionately rejects statements related to the AfD, even when underlying knowledge is absent"
- Break condition: This heightened sensitivity is not observed uniformly across political content—centrist parties show lower rejection rates even with comparable knowledge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Conversational Grounding**
  - Why needed here: The entire paper frames LLM failures in terms of grounding—the collaborative process of establishing shared knowledge. Without this concept, the distinction between "answering correctly" and "rejecting false presuppositions" is unclear.
  - Quick check question: If a user asks "How old is the King of France?", what distinguishes a grounding failure from a hallucination?

- **Concept: Presupposition Triggers**
  - Why needed here: The loaded questions in this study embed false claims via presupposition triggers (factive verbs like "resent," "realize"). Understanding these triggers is essential to designing and interpreting the experiment.
  - Quick check question: In "Did voters regret that party X supports policy Y?", what is presupposed and what is questioned?

- **Concept: Face-Saving in Politeness Theory**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly invokes face-saving to explain why models prefer accommodation over rejection. This provides the theoretical lens for interpreting the agreement/disagreement asymmetry.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model that knows a claim is false still answer as if it were true?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Knowledge probe layer -> Grounding test layer -> Annotation layer -> Bias detection layer
- **Critical path:**
  1. Administer direct questions to establish knowledge baseline → classify into belief groups
  2. Administer loaded questions with false presuppositions
  3. Annotate responses (3 samples per question) for accommodation/rejection/imprecision
  4. Compute grounding scores and analyze distribution across belief groups and parties
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Knowledge cutoff mismatch: Wahl-O-Mat data from June 2024 election; model cutoffs earlier. Paper argues this tests grounding under uncertainty, but introduces confound between "model doesn't know" and "model couldn't know."
  - Manual annotation only: High inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' κ=0.82), but limits scale and may miss subtle distinctions in accommodation/rejection certainty.
  - German-only: Face-saving behaviors are culture-dependent; generalizability to other political contexts/languages is untested.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - GPT: High knowledge but still accommodates ~31% even in moderate belief group; strong face-saving bias visible in confirmatory vs. disconfirmatory accuracy gap.
  - Mistral: Strong face-saving behavior but weaker knowledge base; accommodation dominates across all belief groups.
  - Llama: Consistently imprecise (~48% across conditions); suggests knowledge gaps plus failure to engage in grounding rather than active face-saving.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate with explicit grounding instructions (e.g., "If a question contains a false assumption, correct it") to test whether face-saving can be overridden by prompt engineering.
  2. Add loaded questions with TRUE presuppositions as control to distinguish face-saving from general preference for agreement.
  3. Extend to non-political domains (e.g., scientific facts, historical claims) to isolate political-content sensitivity from general grounding failure.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How does the accommodation or rejection of false presuppositions by LLMs affect users' subsequent beliefs and their perception of the system's competence?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the Discussion, "a pressing follow-up question to be investigated in future work is the effect of model answers on users’ beliefs about the topic in question, but also their perception of the system’s competence."
  - **Why unresolved:** This study focused solely on analyzing model outputs using annotation, without conducting user studies to measure the cognitive or trust-related impact of these outputs on humans.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Data from human-subject experiments where users interact with models that accommodate vs. reject misinformation, followed by assessments of their factual accuracy and reported trust levels.

- **Question:** Does the high rejection rate observed for the far-right AfD stem from a specific political bias against the party or a general tendency to challenge controversial topics?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Discussion notes, "Whether this reflects a biased tendency to oppose the AfD specifically or mimics human conversational tendencies to challenge controversial topics remains an open question for future research."
  - **Why unresolved:** The experimental design lacked a comparable "outsider" party on the far-left to serve as a control for the "controversy" variable, making it impossible to disentangle political bias from a general reaction to controversial entities.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A replication of the study including a far-left outsider party or a calibration of "controversy" levels independent of political alignment.

- **Question:** Are the observed grounding failures and face-saving strategies generalizable to other languages, political systems, and cultural contexts?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors list the limitation that the "study was limited to the German language and political context" and suggest that "future research could benefit from extending the analysis to other languages and political systems."
  - **Why unresolved:** Face-saving strategies are culture-dependent, and the study relied exclusively on German political data (Wahl-O-Mat) and German-language prompts.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying the FLEX benchmark methodology to multilingual models using political datasets from different countries (e.g., US, France) to compare grounding scores.

## Limitations
- Knowledge cutoff mismatch with Wahl-O-Mat 2024 data introduces confound between genuine knowledge gaps and temporal limitations.
- Manual annotation process, while achieving high inter-annotator agreement (κ=0.82), remains subjective and may not capture nuanced distinctions.
- German-only scope limits generalizability of face-saving behavior findings to other political contexts and cultures.

## Confidence
- High confidence: Models show systematic face-saving bias favoring agreement over rejection, as evidenced by consistent confirmatory vs. disconfirmatory accuracy gaps across all three models.
- Medium confidence: Knowledge level correlates with grounding capability, with GPT showing increased rejection rates at higher belief groups, though this relationship is imperfect and inconsistent across models.
- Medium confidence: Political-content sensitivity exists, with controversial parties like AfD triggering higher rejection rates, though the mechanism (safety training vs. training data patterns) remains unclear.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the experiment with explicit grounding instructions ("If a question contains a false assumption, correct it") to determine whether face-saving behavior can be overridden through prompt engineering rather than representing a fundamental architectural limitation.
2. Conduct a controlled experiment using loaded questions with TRUE presuppositions as a baseline to distinguish general agreement preference from specifically face-saving behavior in response to false presuppositions.
3. Extend the study to non-political domains (scientific facts, historical claims) to isolate whether grounding failures stem from political sensitivity or represent a more general limitation in LLMs' ability to reject false presuppositions.
