# Video Prediction of Dynamic Physical Simulations With Pixel-Space Spatiotemporal Transformers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20807
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20807
- Authors: Dean L Slack; G Thomas Hudson; Thomas Winterbottom; Noura Al Moubayed

- Key outcome: Pixel-space transformer achieves 50% longer physically accurate prediction horizon vs latent-space approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a pure transformer-based model for autoregressive video prediction of physical simulations governed by PDEs. The approach uses continuous pixel-space representations without latent compression, incorporating separated spatial and temporal attention mechanisms with intermediate FFN layers. The model demonstrates superior physical prediction accuracy while maintaining competitive performance on standard video quality metrics, extending the time horizon for accurate predictions by up to 50% compared to existing latent-space approaches.

## Method Summary
The PSViT model processes physical simulation videos through a U-Net style transformer architecture operating directly on continuous pixel values. It divides frames into 8×8 patches, embeds them with learnable positional encodings, and processes them through a stack of Local Space-Time transformer blocks followed by Global Space-Time blocks at reduced resolution. The model separates spatial and temporal attention with an intervening FFN layer, uses causal masking for autoregressive prediction, and optionally incorporates register tokens for sequence-level information. Training employs SSIM loss with Adam optimization, achieving parameter-efficient video prediction without complex architectural priors or latent feature learning components.

## Key Results
- Extends physically accurate prediction horizon by up to 50% compared to latent-space approaches
- GS+T attention strategy outperforms joint spatiotemporal attention across all datasets
- Register tokens encode sequence-level physical parameters with MAE of 0.18, generalizing to out-of-distribution parameter ranges
- Achieves competitive SSIM and PSNR scores while maintaining superior physical fidelity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Separated Spatial-Temporal Attention with Intermediate FFN
Spatial attention first aggregates intra-frame patch relationships, then an FFN transforms these representations before temporal attention traces causal dynamics. This separation prevents interference between spatial feature extraction and temporal causal modeling, improving physical prediction accuracy for factorizable spatiotemporal dependencies.

### Mechanism 2: Continuous Pixel-Space Representation Preserves Physical Fidelity
Operating directly on continuous pixel values avoids the reconstruction ambiguity and quantization artifacts introduced by latent compression (VQ-VAE, VAE). The model learns implicit physical dynamics directly from raw visual features, maintaining higher-fidelity dynamics information that compounds autoregressively.

### Mechanism 3: Register Tokens Encode Sequence-Level Physical Parameters
Dedicated register tokens aggregate non-local, sequence-level information (e.g., gravity, mass) that patches cannot easily capture locally. These tokens serve as memory slots for global state variables, with probing experiments confirming they encode extractable PDE parameters better than patch tokens and generalize to out-of-distribution parameter ranges.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Autoregressive prediction with causal masking**
  - Why needed here: The model must predict future frames conditioned on past frames without access to ground truth during inference. Causal masking prevents information leakage from future timesteps.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why teacher forcing (training with ground truth history) differs from autoregressive inference (using predicted frames as input)?

- **Concept: Patch-based vision transformers**
  - Why needed here: The model processes video by dividing frames into non-overlapping patches, each embedded as a token. This controls quadratic attention complexity relative to resolution.
  - Quick check question: Given a 128×128 image with patch size P=8, how many patch tokens are generated per frame? (Answer: 256)

- **Concept: Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses SSIM rather than L1/L2 pixel loss, as SSIM captures perceptual structure better and generalizes across datasets per their experiments.
  - Quick check question: Why might SSIM outperform L2 loss for video prediction of physical dynamics? (Answer: L2 penalizes pixel-wise differences that may not affect perceived motion trajectories; SSIM captures structural coherence)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input frames → patch partition (P=8) → linear embedding → add learnable spatial + temporal positional encodings → optional register tokens → Local Space-Time transformer blocks → patch merge → Global Space-Time transformer block → patch unmerge → Local Space-Time transformer blocks → final projection → output frame

- **Critical path**: 1) Implement patch embedding with learnable positional encodings 2) Implement separated spatial attention → FFN → causal temporal attention block 3) Implement U-Net merge/unmerge operations 4) Add causal masking for temporal attention 5) Train with SSIM loss, Adam optimizer, weight decay 1e-4, batch size 32

- **Design tradeoffs**: Patch size P=8 vs P=16 balances detail capture with sequence length; global vs local spatial attention balances long-range dependency capture with computational efficiency; register tokens add ~1-5% parameters but improve parameter estimation

- **Failure signatures**: Divergence increases sharply after t=20-30 timesteps on complex 3D datasets; object shapes distort over time especially rotation post-collision; performance degrades when context exceeds optimal window (8-12 frames often better than 16); stochastic datasets underperform compared to latent diffusion models

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Ablate attention strategy: Compare GS+T vs GS+LT vs LS+LT on Pendulum dataset 2) Ablate positional encoding type: Compare APE vs RoPE vs LPE 3) Probe internal representations: Train linear probes on frozen layer outputs to estimate simulation parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can scaling model size and input resolution improve PSViT performance on high-fidelity physical datasets?
- What evaluation metrics can better capture physical accuracy than object centroid tracking?
- Can pixel-space transformers match latent-space models in stochastic video generation?
- Can the end-to-end approach benefit from pretrained image encoders?

## Limitations

- Internal contradictions in resolution specification (128×128 stated vs 64×64 in Table V)
- Omitted critical training hyperparameters including learning rate and scheduler
- Underperformance on stochastic datasets compared to latent diffusion models
- High computational resource requirements for pixel-space prediction

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Separated spatial-temporal attention mechanism (GS+T) outperforming joint approaches; register token encoding of physical parameters with out-of-distribution generalization
- **Medium Confidence**: 50% extension in physically accurate prediction horizon claim; continuous pixel-space representation preserving physical fidelity
- **Low Confidence**: Universal applicability of continuous pixel-space representation across all video types; computational efficiency compared to latent-space approaches

## Next Checks

1. Systematically vary learning rate, batch size, and positional encoding types on a single dataset to identify optimal configurations and establish reproducibility baselines

2. Test the model on a held-out physical simulation dataset with different PDE characteristics to evaluate register token mechanism generalization beyond training distribution

3. Replace causal temporal attention with bidirectional attention to quantify impact of causal masking on prediction accuracy and determine if temporal information leakage provides training benefits
