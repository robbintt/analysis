core_contribution: iMAD addresses the inefficiency of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) by
  selectively triggering debate only when beneficial. The method uses a structured
  self-critique prompt to extract interpretable features from a single-agent response,
  then applies a lightweight classifier trained with FocusCal loss to decide when
  to trigger MAD.

# iMAD: Intelligent Multi-Agent Debate for Efficient and Accurate LLM Inference

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.11306
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11306
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** iMAD reduces token usage by up to 92% and improves accuracy by up to 13.5% vs. full-debate MAD on six QA/VQA datasets.

## Executive Summary
iMAD introduces a lightweight classifier that decides when to trigger Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) for LLM inference. By extracting interpretable features from a structured self-critique prompt, the classifier predicts whether debate will correct an initially wrong answer. This selective triggering preserves MAD's accuracy gains while reducing token usage by up to 92%. The method uses FocusCal loss to train the classifier and achieves strong zero-shot generalization across six QA and VQA datasets without dataset-specific tuning.

## Method Summary
iMAD implements a selective debate triggering mechanism that uses a single-agent self-critique response to decide whether to invoke full MAD. The method extracts 41 linguistic and semantic features from the self-critique, feeds them to a lightweight MLP classifier trained with FocusCal loss, and triggers MAD only if the classifier score indicates benefit. The FocusCal loss combines asymmetric focal loss, confidence penalty, and expected calibration error to address overconfidence and uncertainty misalignment. The system achieves zero-shot generalization by training on PubMedQA and GQA datasets and applying the classifier to six held-out datasets without retraining.

## Key Results
- iMAD achieves up to 92% token reduction compared to full-debate MAD
- Accuracy improvements of up to 13.5% over single-agent baselines
- Strong zero-shot generalization across six QA and VQA datasets without dataset-specific tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Selective Debate Triggering via Lightweight Classification
- **Claim:** Triggering MAD only when beneficial preserves accuracy gains while reducing token overhead
- **Mechanism:** A single-agent self-critique response generates 41 interpretable features that a lightweight MLP classifier evaluates to predict debate benefit
- **Core assumption:** MAD benefits are concentrated in recoverable error cases that can be identified from single-agent responses
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "iMAD reduces token usage by up to 92% and improves accuracy by up to 13.5%" [Section 5.1, Table 3] iMAD achieves higher accuracy vs. full-debate MAD while using 68-92% fewer tokens

### Mechanism 2: Structured Self-Critique Exposes Predictive Uncertainty Cues
- **Claim:** Self-critique prompts elicit hesitation signals predictive of when debate can correct errors
- **Mechanism:** The prompt forces initial CoT justification, mandatory counterargument, and confidence scores, exposing hedging, contrast, and confidence gaps
- **Core assumption:** Models express genuine uncertainty in self-critique when initial answers are wrong but correctable
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.1] "This structure stimulates a mini-debate" [Section 4.1, Appendix A.2] SHAP analysis shows uncertainty-related features are most influential

### Mechanism 3: FocusCal Loss Addresses Overconfidence and Uncertainty Misalignment
- **Claim:** Composite loss enables classifier to better identify recoverable errors by penalizing overconfident incorrect predictions
- **Mechanism:** **L_AF** emphasizes confidently incorrect predictions, **L_CP** penalizes confidence-uncertainty misalignment, ECE encourages calibration
- **Core assumption:** LLM confidence scores are miscalibrated and misaligned with semantic uncertainty
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.2] FocusCal loss defined as **L_FC = L_AF + L_CP + ECE** [Section C.2, Table 11-13] Ablation shows combined terms outperform alternatives

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) Trade-offs**
  - **Why needed here:** iMAD is designed around MAD's insight that accuracy gains are often outweighed by token costs and potential harm
  - **Quick check question:** In what percentage of cases does MAD actually correct a wrong single-agent answer?

- **Concept: Uncertainty Signals in LLM Outputs**
  - **Why needed here:** iMAD relies on extracting hesitation cues from text
  - **Quick check question:** Which feature category is most influential according to SHAP analysis?

- **Concept: Classifier Calibration and Loss Design**
  - **Why needed here:** FocusCal loss is central to iMAD's zero-shot generalization
  - **Quick check question:** What does the Confidence Penalty (**L_CP**) term penalize?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input query → Self-critique single-agent prompt → Structured response → Feature extraction (41 features) → MLP classifier with FocusCal loss → Debate trigger score → MAD if score < threshold, else single-agent answer
- **Critical path:**
  1. Prompt engineering (self-critique design)
  2. Feature extraction and selection (all 41 used; ablation shows pruning degrades performance)
  3. Classifier training on auxiliary datasets (PubMedQA, GQA) with FocusCal
  4. Threshold tuning on validation set
  5. Inference: score query, conditionally trigger MAD
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Token cost vs. accuracy: self-critique adds ~5-10% tokens but enables better decisions
  - Feature interpretability vs. potential redundancy: using all 41 features is marginally better than pruning
  - Zero-shot generalization vs. task-specific tuning: classifier trained once on diverse datasets
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Over-triggering: high token cost, potential accuracy degradation
  - Under-triggering: missed correctable errors, accuracy plateaus
  - Feature collapse: if self-critiques become formulaic, hesitation signals weaken
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablate FocusCal components: Train classifier with **L_AF**, **L_CP**, ECE alone and in pairs; measure accuracy/token tradeoff
  2. Feature importance replication: Compute SHAP values on new dataset to verify feature influence
  3. Cross-model generalization test: Retrain classifier on one LLM and evaluate on another without retraining

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can online adaptation or weak supervision strategies replace reliance on fixed, offline correctness labels to improve generalization across shifting model behaviors?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Conclusion and Appendix D suggest exploring "adaptive or online learning approaches to reduce labeling costs"
  - **Why unresolved:** Current classifier is trained offline on static datasets and remains fixed during deployment
  - **Evidence:** System that updates debate decision classifier in real-time using feedback signals from MAD process

- **Open Question 2:** Can debate-triggering decisions be made accurately during token-by-token generation rather than waiting for full self-critique response?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Appendix D suggests "monitoring token-by-token generation" could detect early signs of hesitation
  - **Why unresolved:** Current implementation relies on black-box API access requiring full structured response
  - **Evidence:** Framework using open-source models or streaming APIs that can abort generation or trigger debate mid-response

- **Open Question 3:** Does reliance on linguistic and semantic hesitation cues limit effectiveness in non-natural language tasks like code generation or structured planning?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Introduction claims applicability to code generation, but methodology extracts features designed for linguistic uncertainty
  - **Why unresolved:** Code and planning outputs often lack natural language "hesitation" cues
  - **Evidence:** Evaluation of iMAD on coding benchmarks to determine if linguistic features correlate with code correctness

## Limitations
- Classifier generalizability to specialized domains and languages beyond PubMedQA/GQA training data is uncertain
- Reliance on structured self-critique outputs may fail if models generate incoherent or formulaic critiques
- No extensive robustness testing against prompt variations, adversarial inputs, or out-of-distribution queries

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Selective triggering mechanism and reported token savings (up to 92%) are well-supported by ablation and comparative results
- **Medium Confidence:** FocusCal loss is essential for zero-shot generalization, but exact component contributions need isolation and hyperparameters may require tuning
- **Low Confidence:** Assumption that self-critique hesitation signals are universal across all LLM architectures and languages is not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Model Generalization:** Retrain classifier on one LLM (GPT-5 nano) and evaluate zero-shot on another (Qwen 3.0) without retraining. Measure accuracy drop and token usage changes.
2. **Out-of-Distribution Robustness:** Test iMAD on specialized or adversarial dataset (medical QA with novel terminology, multilingual QA, or misleading queries). Compare performance to baselines.
3. **Feature Stability Under Prompt Perturbation:** Systematically vary self-critique prompt structure and measure impact on feature extraction quality and classifier performance.
