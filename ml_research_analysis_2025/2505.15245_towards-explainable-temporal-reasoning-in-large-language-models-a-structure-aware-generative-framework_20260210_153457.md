# Towards Explainable Temporal Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Structure-Aware Generative Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.15245
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15245
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: GETER framework achieves F1 score improvements of 11.10%, 10.71%, and 7.54% across three major datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of explainable temporal reasoning in large language models (LLMs), which often struggle to generate convincing explanations for their predictions when relying solely on textual information. To bridge this gap, the authors propose GETER, a structure-aware generative framework that integrates Graph structures with text for Explainable TEmporal Reasoning. GETER leverages temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) to capture structural information and maps it into the text embedding space using a lightweight adapter. The framework then generates explanations by combining the soft graph token with instruction-tuning prompt tokens. Experimental results on five datasets covering various temporal granularities (minutes, days, and years) demonstrate that GETER achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving prediction accuracy and explanation quality.

## Method Summary
GETER integrates temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) with text through a structure-aware generative framework. The method uses a lightweight adapter to map TKG information into text embedding space, creating a "soft graph token" that captures structural information. This token is then combined with instruction-tuning prompt tokens to generate both predictions and explanations. The framework employs a two-stage approach: first, it learns temporal patterns from TKGs, then it integrates this structural knowledge with textual information for temporal reasoning tasks. GETER operates across different temporal granularities and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various datasets and model sizes.

## Key Results
- GETER with Mistral-7B-Instruct achieves F1 score improvements of 11.10%, 10.71%, and 7.54% compared to tuned-only methods across ICEWS14, GDELT, and ICEWS05-15 datasets
- Explanation quality improvements range from 5.73% to 11.06% across evaluation metrics
- Strong generalization capabilities demonstrated across different model sizes (7B, 13B, 33B parameters) and temporal encoders
- Robust performance across five datasets covering minutes, days, and years temporal granularities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GETER works by bridging the gap between structural temporal information and textual reasoning in LLMs. The framework captures rich relational patterns from temporal knowledge graphs through a soft graph token mechanism, which preserves the structural dependencies that pure text-based approaches miss. By mapping TKG information into the text embedding space via a lightweight adapter, GETER enables LLMs to reason about temporal relationships with both explicit structural knowledge and contextual understanding. The instruction-tuning approach ensures that the model not only makes accurate predictions but also generates coherent explanations by learning to articulate the reasoning process behind its decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs)**: Why needed - Capture complex temporal relationships and events that cannot be expressed through text alone; Quick check - Verify the TKG structure contains sufficient temporal granularity for the target tasks
- **Soft Graph Token Mechanism**: Why needed - Enables integration of graph structural information into text embedding space without disrupting existing LLM architecture; Quick check - Confirm the adapter layer doesn't significantly increase computational overhead
- **Instruction Tuning**: Why needed - Trains the model to generate explanations alongside predictions, making reasoning explicit; Quick check - Ensure prompts effectively guide both prediction and explanation generation
- **Graph-Text Alignment**: Why needed - Bridges the modality gap between structured graph data and unstructured text; Quick check - Validate alignment quality through downstream task performance
- **Temporal Granularity Handling**: Why needed - Different tasks require reasoning at different time scales (minutes vs. years); Quick check - Test performance across multiple temporal resolutions
- **Adapter-Based Integration**: Why needed - Provides a lightweight method to incorporate external knowledge without full model retraining; Quick check - Compare adapter performance against full fine-tuning approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: TKGs -> Temporal Encoder -> Soft Graph Token -> Adapter Layer -> LLM -> Predictions + Explanations

**Critical Path**: Temporal Knowledge Graph → Temporal Encoder → Soft Graph Token Generation → Adapter Integration → Instruction-Tuned LLM → Prediction and Explanation Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The lightweight adapter approach balances integration capability with computational efficiency, avoiding the need for full model retraining while maintaining strong performance. The soft graph token mechanism preserves structural information without requiring complex graph neural networks. Instruction tuning focuses on explanation generation capability while maintaining prediction accuracy. The framework trades some architectural simplicity for the ability to handle complex temporal reasoning across multiple granularities.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor temporal encoder performance leading to degraded soft graph token quality; adapter layer saturation causing information loss; instruction tuning prompts that don't adequately guide explanation generation; graph structure misalignment with textual context; temporal granularity mismatches between TKGs and target tasks.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. **Component Ablation**: Test GETER performance with individual components removed (no soft graph token, no adapter, no instruction tuning) to quantify each component's contribution
2. **Temporal Granularity Transfer**: Evaluate model performance when trained on one temporal granularity and tested on another to assess generalization
3. **Adapter Size Scaling**: Experiment with different adapter sizes to find the optimal balance between performance and computational overhead

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the scalability of GETER to larger, more complex temporal knowledge graphs, the impact of different temporal encoder architectures on performance, and the potential for extending the framework to handle multi-modal temporal reasoning tasks that combine text with other data types such as images or sensor data.

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize beyond tested temporal knowledge graphs and datasets
- Computational overhead of soft graph token mechanism, though described as lightweight, may impact practical deployment
- Explanation quality assessment relies on automated metrics that may not fully capture human interpretability standards

## Confidence
- **Prediction Accuracy Improvements**: High - Supported by quantitative results across multiple datasets
- **Explanation Quality Improvements**: Medium - Based on automated evaluation metrics that may not fully align with human judgment
- **Generalization Claims**: Medium-High - Demonstrated across different model sizes but limited dataset diversity
- **Computational Efficiency**: Medium - Described as lightweight but requires empirical validation in resource-constrained settings

## Next Checks
1. Test GETER on additional temporal reasoning tasks beyond the five datasets used, particularly in domains with different temporal patterns and graph structures
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of individual components (temporal encoder, soft graph token, instruction tuning) to the observed improvements
3. Perform human evaluation studies to validate that the generated explanations are indeed more interpretable and useful compared to baseline approaches
