# When One Moment Isn't Enough: Multi-Moment Retrieval with Cross-Moment Interactions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17218
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17218
- Authors: Zhuo Cao; Heming Du; Bingqing Zhang; Xin Yu; Xue Li; Sen Wang
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: FlashMMR framework achieves 3.00% improvement in G-mAP, 2.70% in mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% in mR@3 over prior SOTA on QV-M2 dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the multi-moment retrieval (MMR) task in video-language understanding, where queries require identifying multiple relevant video moments rather than just one. The authors introduce FlashMMR, a novel framework featuring a Multi-Moment Post-Verification module that refines candidate segments through temporal adjustment and semantic consistency filtering. They also construct QV-M2, the first fully human-annotated MMR dataset derived from QVHighlights, containing 2,212 queries covering 6,384 video segments.

## Method Summary
FlashMMR addresses multi-moment retrieval by first generating candidate moments through standard temporal localization, then applying a Multi-Moment Post-Verification module that refines these candidates. The verification module performs constrained temporal adjustment to better align moments with query semantics and applies semantic consistency filtering to ensure retrieved moments are coherent with each other and the query. The framework also introduces new evaluation metrics extending mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU) to handle multiple moments per query, incorporating a target number of moments parameter to better assess retrieval performance in multi-moment scenarios.

## Key Results
- FlashMMR achieves 3.00% improvement in G-mAP over prior state-of-the-art on QV-M2 dataset
- Model shows 2.70% improvement in mAP@3+tgt and 2.56% in mR@3 metrics
- QV-M2 dataset contains 2,212 queries covering 6,384 video segments, establishing first fully human-annotated MMR benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FlashMMR leverages cross-moment interactions through its post-verification module, which considers relationships between retrieved moments rather than treating each moment independently. By incorporating temporal constraints and semantic consistency checks, the framework can filter out redundant or semantically inconsistent moments while refining the boundaries of relevant segments. This holistic approach to moment retrieval better captures the complex temporal and semantic relationships that exist between multiple moments relevant to a single query.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal localization**: The task of identifying start and end times of relevant video segments given a textual query; needed to ground the MMR problem in existing single-moment retrieval techniques; quick check: verify understanding of IoU metric for moment evaluation
- **Semantic consistency**: Ensuring retrieved moments are not only relevant to the query but also coherent with each other; needed to prevent redundant or contradictory moment retrieval; quick check: examine how semantic similarity is measured between moments
- **Post-verification refinement**: The process of improving initial candidate segments through additional filtering and adjustment; needed to enhance retrieval quality beyond initial predictions; quick check: understand the difference between candidate generation and verification stages
- **Cross-moment interaction**: Modeling relationships between multiple retrieved moments rather than treating them independently; needed to capture complex query requirements that span multiple temporal segments; quick check: identify how moments influence each other during verification
- **Evaluation metric extension**: Adapting single-moment metrics (mAP, IoU) for multi-moment scenarios; needed to properly assess performance when multiple ground truth moments exist per query; quick check: compare single-moment vs multi-moment metric formulations
- **Human annotation reliability**: The quality and consistency of human-labeled moment boundaries; needed to ensure dataset validity and benchmark reliability; quick check: examine inter-annotator agreement measures

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Query Encoder -> Temporal Localization -> Candidate Generation -> Multi-Moment Post-Verification -> Refined Moments -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**: Query encoding flows through temporal localization to generate initial candidates, which then undergo post-verification refinement before final evaluation against ground truth moments.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity (additional verification step) for improved retrieval quality, balancing between over-generation of moments and missing relevant segments. The semantic consistency filtering introduces dependency between moment predictions, potentially reducing diversity but improving coherence.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may fail when moments are temporally overlapping or semantically similar, making it difficult to distinguish between separate relevant segments. It may also struggle with queries requiring moments that are widely separated in time but semantically related.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare FlashMMR performance against single-moment retrieval baselines on QV-M2 to quantify the benefit of multi-moment capability
2. Conduct ablation studies on the Multi-Moment Post-Verification module to isolate contributions of temporal adjustment vs semantic consistency filtering
3. Test evaluation metric sensitivity by varying the target number of moments parameter to understand its impact on reported performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- QV-M2 dataset construction lacks inter-annotator agreement metrics, making annotation reliability uncertain
- Proposed evaluation metrics for multi-moment scenarios lack thorough validation against alternative formulations
- Multi-Moment Post-Verification module appears heuristic without sufficient ablation studies on individual component contributions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: QV-M2 dataset existence and general performance improvements of FlashMMR are well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium confidence**: Proposed evaluation metrics are reasonable but need additional validation and comparison with alternatives
- **Low confidence**: Specific architectural contributions of verification module components lack controlled experiments to establish individual importance

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-annotator agreement analysis on QV-M2 annotations to establish reliability metrics and identify potential systematic biases
2. Perform comprehensive ablation studies isolating contributions of temporal adjustment, semantic consistency filtering, and confidence thresholding within the Multi-Moment Post-Verification module
3. Validate proposed evaluation metrics by testing against ground truth scenarios with known optimal moment counts to examine metric appropriateness for over/under-generation scenarios
