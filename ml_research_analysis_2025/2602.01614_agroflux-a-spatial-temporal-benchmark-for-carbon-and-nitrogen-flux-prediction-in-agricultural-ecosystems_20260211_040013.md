# AgroFlux: A Spatial-Temporal Benchmark for Carbon and Nitrogen Flux Prediction in Agricultural Ecosystems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01614
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01614
- Reference count: 24
- Introduces AgroFlux, the first benchmark suite for agricultural greenhouse gas flux prediction

## Executive Summary
AgroFlux establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for predicting carbon and nitrogen fluxes in agricultural ecosystems. The benchmark integrates physics-based model simulations (Ecosys, DayCent) with real-world observations from flux towers and controlled-environment facilities, creating a standardized framework for evaluating AI models in agroecosystem science. It defines three key tasks: predicting simulated fluxes, predicting observational fluxes, and transfer learning from simulations to observations, with both temporal and spatial extrapolation scenarios. The evaluation framework employs consistent metrics (R², RMSE, MAE) to enable reproducible comparison across models and datasets.

## Method Summary
The benchmark constructs a multi-source dataset by integrating physics-based model simulations from Ecosys and DayCent with observational data from AmeriFlux towers and controlled-environment experiments. Data preprocessing includes gap-filling, quality control, and standardization across different measurement protocols. The evaluation framework defines standardized temporal and spatial extrapolation scenarios, along with transfer learning tasks that bridge simulation-to-observation domains. Six deep learning architectures (LSTM, EA-LSTM, TCN, Transformer, iTransformer, Pyraformer) and two transfer learning approaches (pretrain-finetune, adversarial training) are evaluated as baselines. Performance is measured using consistent metrics (R², RMSE, MAE) across all tasks and scenarios.

## Key Results
- LSTM models excel in temporal extrapolation tasks while Transformer-based models perform best in spatial extrapolation
- Transfer learning from simulations to observations improves performance, particularly for CO₂ and GPP prediction
- N₂O flux prediction remains challenging due to episodic nature and limited observational data
- The benchmark enables reproducible comparison and advances AI-driven agroecosystem modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by creating a standardized evaluation framework that bridges the gap between physics-based models and data-driven AI approaches. By integrating multiple data sources with consistent preprocessing and quality control, it enables fair comparison of different models across temporal and spatial extrapolation scenarios. The inclusion of transfer learning tasks addresses the critical challenge of moving from well-characterized simulation domains to complex observational environments. The framework's design allows researchers to identify which model architectures and training strategies work best for different types of flux predictions and extrapolation scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

**Temporal extrapolation**: Predicting fluxes beyond the time range seen during training. Needed because climate and management practices evolve over time. Quick check: Train on 2010-2020 data, test on 2021-2022 data.

**Spatial extrapolation**: Predicting fluxes in locations different from training sites. Critical for generalizing across diverse agricultural landscapes. Quick check: Train on Midwest data, test on Pacific Northwest sites.

**Transfer learning**: Adapting models trained on simulations to make predictions on observational data. Addresses domain shift between controlled and real-world conditions. Quick check: Fine-tune simulated-trained models on small observational datasets.

**Physics-based modeling**: Using mechanistic models (Ecosys, DayCent) to generate synthetic training data. Provides consistent, gap-free datasets for training AI models. Quick check: Compare AI predictions against physics model outputs on held-out data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data Sources (Ecosys/DayCent/Observations) -> Preprocessing Pipeline -> Model Architectures (LSTM/Transformer/...) -> Evaluation Framework (Metrics/Tasks/Scenarios)

**Critical path**: Raw data integration → quality control/gap-filling → standardization → model training → temporal/spatial extrapolation evaluation → transfer learning assessment

**Design tradeoffs**: The benchmark balances comprehensive evaluation with practical feasibility by focusing on six well-established architectures while maintaining consistent metrics across all tasks. This enables direct comparison but may miss novel approaches.

**Failure signatures**: N₂O prediction failures indicate the episodic nature of nitrogen cycling and limitations of current observational networks. Large performance gaps between simulation and observation domains highlight fundamental challenges in transfer learning.

**First experiments**:
1. Compare LSTM vs Transformer performance on CO₂ prediction in temporal extrapolation scenario
2. Evaluate transfer learning effectiveness from simulated to observed CO₂ data
3. Assess spatial extrapolation performance across different flux types (CO₂, GPP, N₂O)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can AI models better capture the episodic nature of N₂O emissions in agricultural systems?
- What are the most effective strategies for bridging the simulation-to-observation domain gap?
- How can the benchmark be expanded to cover a wider range of agricultural ecosystems globally?

## Limitations
- N₂O flux prediction remains highly challenging due to episodic nature and limited observational data
- Substantial performance gaps persist between simulated and observational domains despite transfer learning
- The benchmark's current scope may not fully capture the diversity of global agricultural systems

## Confidence
- Dataset construction and integration: High
- Standardized evaluation framework: High  
- Baseline model performance claims: High
- Transfer learning effectiveness claims: Medium
- Generalizability across all agricultural systems: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of temporal versus spatial variability on model performance across different flux types
2. Test ensemble methods combining physics-based models with deep learning predictions to assess hybrid approaches
3. Evaluate model generalization across different agricultural systems (e.g., from croplands to grasslands)
