# Fairness in Graph Learning Augmented with Machine Learning: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.21296
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21296
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Identifies unique fairness challenges in Graph Learning augmented with Machine Learning systems and presents four critical fairness-aware techniques

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines fairness challenges in Graph Learning augmented with Machine Learning (GL-ML), where specialized ML techniques are integrated into traditional graph learning models. While such augmentations have achieved success in domains like federated learning and dynamic graphs, they introduce unique fairness challenges that traditional fairness methods cannot adequately address. The paper identifies two main challenges: the need to account for fairness at both local and server sides in federated settings, and the increased complexity of fairness issues due to new biases introduced by ML techniques like attention mechanisms in Graph Transformers.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology to identify and categorize fairness challenges in GL-ML systems. It analyzes existing approaches through the lens of their augmentation mechanisms and fairness implications, distinguishing between traditional graph learning methods and those enhanced with ML techniques. The methodology involves categorizing fairness-aware techniques into four groups based on their specific ML augmentation focus: fairness-aware encoding in Graph Transformers, dual fairness-aware methods for federated learning, dynamic fairness-aware methods for evolving graphs, and condensation fairness-aware methods for compressed graphs.

## Key Results
- Identifies dual-side fairness requirements in federated GL-ML settings
- Presents four critical fairness-aware techniques: FairGT, dual fairness-aware methods, dynamic fairness-aware methods, and condensation fairness-aware methods
- Highlights open challenges including novel fairness metrics, privacy-preserving fairness enhancement, and targeted fairness-aware methods for different ML mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's approach works by systematically identifying how ML augmentations introduce new fairness challenges that traditional graph learning fairness methods cannot address. By categorizing these challenges based on the specific ML mechanisms used (attention, federated optimization, dynamic adaptation, and compression), the authors can identify targeted solutions that account for both the structural properties of graphs and the behavioral characteristics of the augmentation techniques.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Neural Networks**: Deep learning architectures that operate on graph-structured data by propagating and aggregating information across nodes. Why needed: GL-ML builds upon GNN foundations. Quick check: Verify understanding of message passing and aggregation mechanisms.

**Fairness Metrics**: Quantitative measures for evaluating bias in ML systems, including demographic parity, equal opportunity, and counterfactual fairness. Why needed: Essential for assessing fairness in GL-ML augmentations. Quick check: Understand different fairness definitions and their implications.

**Federated Learning**: Distributed ML paradigm where models are trained across multiple decentralized devices without sharing raw data. Why needed: Many GL-ML applications require federated settings. Quick check: Understand local vs. server-side optimization trade-offs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: GL-ML System -> ML Augmentation Layer -> Fairness-Aware Mechanism -> Graph Learning Core
**Critical Path**: Data Input → ML Augmentation (attention/federation/dynamic/compression) → Fairness Evaluation → Model Output
**Design Tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. Fairness, Privacy vs. Fairness, Computational Efficiency vs. Fairness
**Failure Signatures**: Degraded performance on minority groups, increased variance across different graph partitions, privacy leakage through fairness mechanisms
**First Experiments**: 1) Benchmark FairGT against standard Graph Transformers on node classification tasks, 2) Evaluate dual fairness-aware federated learning on synthetic graph datasets, 3) Test dynamic fairness-aware methods on evolving social networks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Development of novel fairness metrics specifically designed for GL-ML systems
- Privacy-preserving techniques that enhance fairness without compromising data protection
- Targeted fairness-aware methods for different ML mechanisms (attention, federated learning, dynamic adaptation, compression)
- Foundational fairness methods applicable across various GL-ML approaches
- Scalability of fairness-aware augmentations to large graphs

## Limitations
- Does not provide empirical comparisons between fairness-aware techniques and baseline models
- Lacks analysis of computational overhead introduced by fairness-aware augmentations
- Does not address scalability challenges for large-scale graph datasets
- Privacy-preserving fairness enhancement remains largely theoretical

## Confidence
- General landscape identification: High
- Four fairness-aware techniques: Medium
- Open challenges comprehensiveness: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical benchmarking studies comparing the identified fairness-aware techniques against baseline GL-ML models across multiple fairness metrics
2. Evaluate the computational efficiency and scalability of fairness-aware augmentations on large-scale graph datasets
3. Develop and test concrete implementations of privacy-preserving fairness enhancement methods in federated GL-ML settings
