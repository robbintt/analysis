## Executive Summary
This paper introduces NeuronXA, a novel evaluation framework for assessing cross-lingual alignment in large language models (LLMs). Drawing inspiration from neuroscience findings that similar stimuli activate overlapping neural regions, NeuronXA leverages neuron activation states as intrinsic representations to measure alignment consistency between parallel sentences across languages. The framework provides a scalable and semantically grounded approach to evaluating multilingual capabilities without requiring extensive downstream task performance data.

NeuronXA is evaluated on seven prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, OLMo) across two transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NeuronXA achieves strong correlation with both downstream task performance (0.9556 Pearson) and transferability (0.8514) using minimal parallel data (100 sentence pairs). The framework shows particular effectiveness in semantic retrieval tasks compared to traditional embedding-based approaches, validating its utility as a robust evaluation tool for cross-lingual alignment in multilingual models.

## Method Summary
NeuronXA evaluates cross-lingual alignment by analyzing neuron activation states across parallel sentences in different languages. The framework operates on the principle that similar semantic content should activate overlapping neural patterns regardless of language. For each parallel sentence pair, NeuronXA captures the activation states of neurons across different layers of the LLM. These activation states serve as intrinsic representations of semantic content, allowing direct comparison between languages without relying on external embeddings or supervised alignment data.

The method calculates alignment scores by measuring the consistency of activation patterns between corresponding parallel sentences. By examining multiple layers of the neural network, NeuronXA identifies which layers capture the most consistent cross-lingual representations. The framework requires only a small set of parallel sentence pairs (100 in the experiments), making it computationally efficient compared to traditional downstream evaluation approaches. This neuron-level analysis provides granular insights into how different parts of the model handle cross-lingual semantic transfer.

## Key Results
- NeuronXA achieves 0.9556 Pearson correlation with downstream task performance using only 100 parallel sentence pairs
- Middle layers exhibit the highest alignment scores while lower and upper layers show the lowest alignment
- Superior performance in semantic retrieval tasks compared to embedding-based approaches
- Strong correlation (0.8514) with transferability metrics across multilingual benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NeuronXA leverages the neurological insight that similar semantic content activates overlapping neural patterns across languages. Large language models, like biological neural systems, develop distributed representations where semantic meaning is encoded across multiple neurons. When processing parallel sentences expressing the same meaning in different languages, these models activate similar patterns of neurons if proper cross-lingual alignment exists. By capturing and comparing these activation states directly, NeuronXA bypasses the need for external embeddings or supervised alignment, measuring the model's intrinsic ability to maintain semantic consistency across languages.

The framework's effectiveness stems from analyzing neuron activation at the layer level, revealing how cross-lingual alignment develops through the model's architecture. Middle layers show optimal alignment because they balance low-level linguistic features with high-level semantic abstractions, while lower layers focus on surface-level patterns and upper layers on task-specific transformations. This layer-wise analysis provides insights into where cross-lingual transfer mechanisms operate most effectively within the model's computational hierarchy.

## Foundational Learning

**Neuron Activation Patterns**: How artificial neurons fire in response to input stimuli - needed to understand the fundamental unit of measurement; quick check: verify activation patterns are consistent across similar semantic content

**Cross-Lingual Semantic Alignment**: The degree to which different languages map to equivalent semantic representations - needed to frame the evaluation objective; quick check: confirm parallel sentences activate similar patterns

**Layer-wise Representation Development**: How semantic information transforms through different network depths - needed to interpret alignment variations across layers; quick check: examine activation distribution across layers

**Distributed Representation Theory**: The concept that semantic meaning is encoded across multiple neurons rather than single units - needed to justify neuron-level analysis; quick check: validate semantic information isn't localized to individual neurons

**Transfer Learning Mechanisms**: How knowledge from one language transfers to another - needed to understand the broader context of alignment evaluation; quick check: assess alignment consistency across diverse language pairs

**Semantic Retrieval Tasks**: Information retrieval based on meaning rather than exact matches - needed to contextualize performance comparisons; quick check: measure retrieval accuracy across language pairs

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Parallel Sentences -> Neuron Activation Capture -> Layer-wise Pattern Analysis -> Alignment Score Calculation -> Cross-Lingual Alignment Assessment

**Critical Path**: The framework's critical path involves capturing neuron activations from parallel sentences, computing layer-wise alignment scores, and aggregating these into overall alignment metrics. The most computationally intensive step is the activation capture across all layers for the evaluation dataset.

**Design Tradeoffs**: NeuronXA trades computational efficiency for depth of analysis by using only 100 parallel sentences instead of full downstream evaluation. This provides rapid assessment but may miss nuanced alignment behaviors. The framework also prioritizes semantic alignment over syntactic or surface-level alignment, which may not capture all aspects of cross-lingual capability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor alignment scores across all layers may indicate fundamental cross-lingual alignment issues in pretraining. Layer-specific failures (e.g., poor alignment only in middle layers) suggest architectural or training deficiencies at particular depths. Low correlation with downstream tasks despite high alignment scores may indicate that neuron-level alignment doesn't fully capture practical cross-lingual capabilities.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test NeuronXA on a single language pair (e.g., English-French) to validate basic functionality
2. Compare alignment scores between a multilingual model and a monolingual baseline to establish baseline expectations
3. Analyze layer-wise alignment patterns on a small subset of parallel sentences to verify the middle-layer optimization hypothesis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies on only 100 parallel sentence pairs, which may not capture full complexity across diverse language pairs and domains
- Layer-wise alignment patterns (middle layers highest, lower/upper layers lowest) may vary significantly depending on model architecture and training objectives
- Superior performance in semantic retrieval tasks compared to embedding-based approaches needs further validation across different retrieval scenarios and longer text sequences
- The framework's applicability to emerging model architectures beyond the seven tested models remains uncertain

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The framework's ability to measure alignment using neuron activations with 100 parallel sentences

**Medium confidence**: The comparative advantage over embedding-based approaches in semantic retrieval

**Medium confidence**: The layer-wise alignment patterns (middle layers vs. lower/upper layers)

## Next Checks

1. Test NeuronXA on additional multilingual benchmarks with different domain distributions and language pairs beyond the current evaluation set

2. Validate the framework's effectiveness on emerging LLM architectures not included in the initial seven models, particularly those with different pretraining objectives

3. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of parallel sentence pairs (e.g., 50, 200, 500) to establish the minimum effective sample size for reliable alignment measurement
