# Microsaccade-Inspired Probing: Positional Encoding Perturbations Reveal LLM Misbehaviours

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01288
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01288
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: MIP achieves near-perfect jailbreak/backdoor detection (AUC up to 1.0) using positional encoding perturbations without fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
MIP introduces a lightweight probing framework that detects LLM misbehaviours by applying controlled perturbations to positional encodings. The method works by re-applying sinusoidal positional encodings on top of standard ones, extracting attention matrix differences and next-token distribution shifts, then classifying these features with a lightweight MLP. Experiments show MIP achieves near-perfect jailbreak and backdoor detection (AUC up to 1.0) and strong factuality discrimination (AUC up to 0.96) across Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-14B models, while requiring no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.

## Method Summary
MIP treats positional encodings as a controllable channel within frozen transformer models, applying sinusoidal perturbations to token embeddings and extracting features from the resulting attention pattern deviations and next-token distribution shifts. The framework computes Frobenius norm differences between original and perturbed attention matrices across all layers/heads, combined with L2 distance between original and perturbed next-token distributions. These features feed a lightweight MLP classifier trained on stratified 80/10/10 splits without fine-tuning the base model. The approach achieves constant-time intervention complexity versus linear baselines, making it computationally efficient for real-time deployment.

## Key Results
- Near-perfect jailbreak detection (AUC=1.0) on GCG benchmark across all tested models
- Strong factuality discrimination (AUC up to 0.96) on Questions1000, WikiData, and SciQ datasets
- Effective backdoor detection (AUC up to 0.99) on MTBA, Sleeper, and VPI datasets
- Visualization confirms localized discriminative signals in mid-to-late layers with Cohen's d effect sizes up to 0.8

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Positional Encoding as a Controllable Probe Channel
MIP applies additional sinusoidal positional encoding perturbations on top of standard PE: `encMIP(d) = PE(TE(d)) + PE_MIP(TE(d))`. This modulation amplifies deviations associated with misbehaviour by exploiting PE's disentanglement from token embeddings. The core assumption is that misbehaviours rely on atypical attention patterns sensitive to positional information.

### Mechanism 2: Attention Pattern Deviation Detection
MIP computes Frobenius norm differences between original and intervened attention matrices across all (layer, head) pairs. Misbehaviours show systematically larger perturbation effects in mid-to-late layer heads (Cohen's d up to 0.8). The assumption is that deceptive/harmful completions exhibit different attention dynamics than normal completions when positional signals shift.

### Mechanism 3: Next-Token Distribution Shift as Behavioral Signature
MIP extracts the next-token distribution P* after perturbation and computes L2 distance from original P. This "intervention effect" vector feeds an MLP classifier trained to distinguish normal from misbehaviour. The assumption is that misbehaviours and normal behaviors show divergent sensitivity to positional perturbation in their token prediction distributions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Positional Encoding (PE)**
  - Why needed: PE injects sequence order into transformers. MIP exploits PE's disentanglement from semantic embeddings to probe model behavior.
  - Quick check: What happens if you remove positional encoding from a transformer entirely? (Answer: token order becomes meaningless; the model sees a bag-of-words.)

- **Concept: Attention Matrices and Frobenius Norm**
  - Why needed: MIP quantifies attention pattern changes using Frobenius norm differences. Understanding attention matrix structure clarifies what the norm captures.
  - Quick check: What does a high Frobenius norm difference between two attention matrices indicate? (Answer: substantially different attention patterns—tokens attending to different positions or with different weights.)

- **Concept: ROC-AUC for Detection Evaluation**
  - Why needed: The paper reports AUC scores across tasks. AUC=1.0 means perfect separation; AUC=0.5 means random guessing.
  - Quick check: If a detector achieves AUC=0.85, what fraction of randomly chosen positive examples score higher than randomly chosen negatives? (Answer: approximately 85%.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input -> Token Embedding -> PE + PE_MIP -> Frozen LLM Forward Pass -> Extract P*, A*(ℓ,h) -> Compute L2(P*,P), Frobenius norms -> MLP classifier -> Binary prediction

- **Critical path:** Input → Token Embedding → PE + PE_MIP → Frozen LLM Forward Pass → Extract P*, A*(ℓ,h) → Compute L2(P*,P), Frobenius norms → MLP classifier → Binary prediction

- **Design tradeoffs:** Sinusoidal perturbation vs. Gaussian vs. uniform noise (sinusoidal shows lower variance); Single PE perturbation (O(1), efficient) vs. per-token (O(n)) vs. per-layer (O(L)); Lightweight MLP (128→64) vs. deeper models (risk overfitting).

- **Failure signatures:** Toxicity detection shows weak class separation (AUC ~0.85-0.91), minimal PCA separation, and near-zero Cohen's d across heads. Smaller models (Llama-3.2-3B) show weaker factuality detection. Gaussian/uniform perturbations show higher variance than sinusoidal.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run MIP on GCG jailbreak dataset with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Target: AUC >0.95.
  2. Compare sinusoidal vs. Gaussian noise on backdoor detection (Sleeper dataset). Measure variance across 5 random seeds.
  3. Train per-head logistic regression on attention perturbation features for aggregated backdoor datasets. Identify heads with AUC >0.7. Verify concentration in mid-to-late layers.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do LLMs inherently encode the internal evidence required to identify their own failures across all failure modes?
- Status: Partially answered—strong results for jailbreaks/backdoors but weaker for toxicity suggest not universal.
- Resolution: Consistent high-accuracy detection (AUC >0.95) across all major misbehavior categories using same methodology.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can MIP be adapted to detect subtle failure modes such as bias, misinformation, or fairness violations?
- Status: Unexplored—current scope limited to factuality, safety, toxicity, and backdoors.
- Resolution: Empirical evaluation on bias/fairness benchmarks showing significant separability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can MIP be extended from detection to active control mechanism that steers model behavior?
- Status: Future work—current implementation only observes and classifies.
- Resolution: Modified framework that alters logits during generation to reduce harmful outputs.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What mechanistic properties cause toxicity to be "diffusely encoded" compared to localized signatures of backdoors and jailbreaks?
- Status: Observed but not explained—paper hypothesizes diffuse encoding without mechanistic proof.
- Resolution: Layer-wise analysis comparing concentration of toxicity vs. backdoor features across model layers.

## Limitations

- Task-specific performance variability: Method shows dramatically different performance across misbehavior types (near-perfect for jailbreaks vs. weaker for toxicity)
- Computational overhead: Doubles inference cost requiring two full forward passes per input despite O(1) complexity claims
- Limited generalizability: Tests only three model families and doesn't validate across non-Transformer architectures or smaller models

## Confidence

- **High Confidence** - Implementation details clearly specified and reproducible; attention-based feature engineering well-grounded; method works as described on tested benchmarks
- **Medium Confidence** - Claims about PE as controllable probe channel and attention deviation detection supported empirically but lack theoretical explanation; superiority of sinusoidal perturbations demonstrated but not mechanistically explained
- **Low Confidence** - Generalizability claims across architectures, scales, and misbehavior types not fully validated; assumption that positional perturbations universally reveal misbehaviors needs broader empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on perturbation location** - Systematically test whether effectiveness depends on which positional dimension is modified. Run MIP with targeted perturbations on individual PE dimensions and measure performance degradation to identify critical positional features.

2. **Cross-architecture validation** - Apply MIP to non-Transformer architectures (Mamba, RWKV, or hybrid models) to test whether positional encoding perturbations remain effective when underlying attention mechanism differs.

3. **Real-time deployment benchmark** - Measure actual inference latency overhead in realistic serving environment, comparing MIP against simpler baselines like single-layer attention monitoring or input-level perturbations. Test whether O(1) complexity translates to meaningful efficiency gains when accounting for feature extraction and classification overhead.
