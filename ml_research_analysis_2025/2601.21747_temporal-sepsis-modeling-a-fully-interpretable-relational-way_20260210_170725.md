# Temporal Sepsis Modeling: a Fully Interpretable Relational Way

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21747
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21747
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Interpretable sepsis prediction achieving AUC up to 0.975

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a fully interpretable relational approach for sepsis prediction from temporal electronic medical records. The method models patient trajectories as multivariate logs with a star schema, then uses MDL-based propositionalization to create compact, interpretable aggregate features. A selective naive Bayes classifier is applied to these flattened features, enabling transparent decision-making while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The approach provides multiple levels of interpretability including univariate, global, local, and counterfactual analysis.

## Method Summary
The method models patient trajectories as multivariate logs with a star schema, where each patient has one case and multiple observations across variables. Temporal data is flattened using MDL-based propositionalization to construct compact, interpretable aggregate features that capture temporal patterns. A selective naive Bayes classifier is then applied to the flattened data, combining interpretability with strong predictive performance. The approach supports flexible prediction horizons and enables comprehensive interpretability through univariate, global, local, and counterfactual analysis.

## Key Results
- Achieves high accuracy with AUC scores up to 0.975
- Selected aggregated features demonstrate strong clinical relevance
- Shapley values enable interpretable local importance assessment
- Counterfactual trajectories illustrate how input changes affect predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by transforming complex temporal multivariate data into interpretable aggregate features while preserving critical information through MDL-based propositionalization. The selective naive Bayes classifier provides both strong predictive performance and inherent interpretability by modeling feature contributions probabilistically. The star schema representation captures patient trajectory patterns effectively, and the multiple interpretability layers (univariate, global, local, counterfactual) enable comprehensive understanding of model decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal multivariate logs**: Essential for capturing patient trajectory patterns over time; quick check: verify star schema properly represents patient-observation relationships
- **MDL-based propositionalization**: Needed to compress temporal information while maintaining interpretability; quick check: validate compressed features retain clinical meaning
- **Selective naive Bayes**: Provides probabilistic interpretation of feature contributions; quick check: assess independence assumptions hold in clinical data
- **Shapley values**: Enable fair attribution of prediction importance to individual features; quick check: verify values align with clinical expectations
- **Counterfactual analysis**: Illustrates how input changes could alter predictions; quick check: confirm generated trajectories are clinically plausible

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Temporal data -> Star schema -> MDL propositionalization -> Selective naive Bayes -> Interpretability analysis

**Critical Path**: Patient trajectory data flows through star schema modeling, undergoes MDL-based compression, feeds into selective naive Bayes classifier, then enables interpretability analysis through Shapley values and counterfactual generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades some potential predictive power for complete interpretability, but achieves high performance (AUC 0.975) while maintaining transparency. The MDL-based propositionalization balances information preservation with feature compactness.

**Failure Signatures**: Model may underperform if temporal patterns are too complex for propositionalization, if clinical data violates naive Bayes independence assumptions, or if feature aggregations lose critical information during compression.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test model performance on a small, well-documented sepsis dataset to validate basic functionality
2. Compare interpretability outputs (Shapley values, counterfactuals) against clinical expert expectations
3. Evaluate feature aggregation quality by checking if clinically relevant patterns are preserved

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Information loss potential during temporal data compression via propositionalization
- Naive Bayes independence assumptions may not hold in clinical settings
- Performance on imbalanced datasets and across different clinical contexts needs validation

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Interpretability framework design and methodology implementation | High |
| Clinical relevance of selected features and aggregation patterns | Medium |
| Model performance metrics (AUC scores) | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate model performance across multiple hospitals with different data collection practices to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing MDL-based propositionalization against alternative temporal feature extraction methods
3. Test model robustness on deliberately imbalanced datasets that better reflect real-world sepsis prevalence
