# Robust Bayesian Optimisation with Unbounded Corruptions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.15315
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15315
- Reference count: 40
- This paper addresses vulnerability of Bayesian Optimization to extreme outliers, proposing algorithms that tolerate unbounded corruption magnitudes when corruption frequency is bounded.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical vulnerability in Bayesian Optimization: extreme outliers can derail standard methods. Existing robust approaches assume bounded cumulative corruption budgets, making them ineffective against single large outliers. The authors propose a new adversary with a frequency-constrained corruption model that allows for unbounded magnitudes. They introduce RCGP-UCB, an algorithm combining the robust conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP) with the UCB acquisition function. Two variants are presented: FC-RCGP-UCB (fixed centering) and A2-RCGP-UCB (adaptive centering). Both achieve sublinear regret in the presence of up to O(T^1/2) and O(T^1/3) corruptions with possibly infinite magnitude, respectively. Critically, these algorithms maintain the same efficiency as standard GP-UCB when no outliers are present, providing "zero-cost" robustness.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce RCGP-UCB, which combines robust conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP) with UCB acquisition. The key innovation is the P-IMQ weight function that creates a plateau region where observations receive full weight, with decaying weights outside this region to down-weight outliers. Two variants are presented: FC-RCGP-UCB uses a fixed centering function (g=0), while A2-RCGP-UCB employs adaptive centering through a dual-model architecture. Both achieve sublinear regret under frequency-constrained corruption budgets (O(T^1/2) for FC with RBF kernel, O(T^1/3) for A2). The robust confidence multiplier √β_t = √β'_t + C_w·√T_c augments standard GP-UCB confidence parameters to maintain valid bounds despite corrupted data.

## Key Results
- RCGP-UCB variants achieve sublinear regret under frequency-constrained corruption budgets with unbounded magnitude corruptions
- Both algorithms maintain zero-cost robustness, matching GP-UCB performance in clean settings
- FC-RCGP-UCB tolerates O(T^1/2) corruptions with unbounded magnitude (RBF kernel)
- A2-RCGP-UCB tolerates O(T^1/3) corruptions with unbounded magnitude (adaptive centering)
- Empirical results demonstrate effectiveness against adversarial corruptions while maintaining performance in clean settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Plateau-IMQ Weight Function
The P-IMQ weighting achieves "zero-cost robustness"—behaving identically to standard GP-UCB when no corruptions exist, while down-weighting outliers. The weight function creates a "plateau" region around the centering function g(x) of half-width L where observations receive full weight (w = σ_noise/√2). Outside this plateau, weights decay monotonically according to the Inverse Multi-Quadric kernel, reducing outlier influence. This design ensures that within the plateau, J_w = I and m_w = 0, making the RCGP update mathematically equivalent to standard GP updates.

### Mechanism 2: Frequency-Constrained Corruption Budget
The algorithm tolerates corruptions of unbounded (infinite) magnitude as long as the number of corrupted points is bounded by O(T^1/2) or O(T^1/3). Unlike prior work bounding cumulative corruption magnitude (∑|c_t| ≤ C), this model bounds only corruption frequency: T_c = |{t : c_t ≠ 0}|. This shifts the adversarial constraint from "limited total distortion" to "limited attack opportunities," making the defense robust to catastrophic single events.

### Mechanism 3: Robust Confidence Multiplier
An inflated UCB acquisition function maintains valid confidence bounds despite corrupted data contaminating the posterior. The robust multiplier √β_t = √β'_t + C_w·√(T_c) augments the standard GP-UCB confidence parameter. Here, C_w·√(T_c)·σ_uc,t(x) bounds the maximum posterior mean deviation caused by corruptions, arising from Cauchy-Schwarz applied to the Schur complement formulation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Gaussian Process Regression** - Why needed here: RCGP modifies the standard GP posterior equations; understanding GP mean/variance updates is prerequisite to grasping how J_w and m_w perturb them. Quick check: Can you derive the standard GP posterior mean μ_t(x) = k_t(x)^T(K_t + σ²I)^(-1)y_t?

- **Concept: GP-UCB Acquisition Function** - Why needed here: The paper's RCGP-UCB builds directly on GP-UCB; understanding the exploration-exploitation trade-off via β'_t is essential. Quick check: Why does GP-UCB choose x_t = argmax[μ_{t-1}(x) + √β'_t · σ_{t-1}(x)]?

- **Concept: Maximum Information Gain γ_T** - Why needed here: Regret bounds scale with √(T·γ_T); γ_T determines kernel-dependent corruption tolerance. Quick check: How does γ_T differ for RBF vs. Matérn(ν) kernels, and why does this affect the permissible corruption budget T_c?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data → Standardization → RCGP Model (P-IMQ weighting) → Robust Posterior (μ^R, σ^R) → Robust UCB ← Robust Multiplier β_t ← Corruption Estimator T_c → Acquisition → Query x_t → Observation y_t

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize: Set L_T = B_f√κ + N_T(δ/2) for FC; for A2, also set L_R,t = √(β_A,t)·√κ + N_T(δ/2)
  2. Compute robust posterior via Eqs. 2-3 using P-IMQ weights
  3. Estimate σ_uc,t-1(x) ≈ σ^R_{t-1}(x) (practical proxy)
  4. Compute robust multiplier: √β_t = √β'_t + C_w,T·√T_c
  5. Optimize acquisition: x_t = argmax[μ^R_{t-1}(x) + √β_t · σ_uc,t-1(x)]
  6. Observe y_t; update RCGP with P-IMQ weight

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - FC-RCGP-UCB vs. A2-RCGP-UCB: FC has stronger theoretical guarantees (T^1/2 corruption tolerance) but may be inefficient if prior mean is misspecified. A2 adapts center for better empirical performance but tolerates fewer corruptions (T^1/3).
  - Plateau width L: Larger L is more conservative (guarantees plateau condition) but increases C_w linearly, worsening regret bounds. Smaller L risks violating plateau condition.
  - T_c estimation: Setting T_c = 0 avoids estimating corruption count but may under-explore; adaptive estimation (count observations outside plateau) is heuristic but practical.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Regret grows linearly: Check if corruption frequency exceeds theoretical bound (T_c > T^1/2 for FC, T_c > T^1/3 for A2)
  - Excessive exploration in uncorrupted setting: Likely T_c over-estimated; try setting T_c = 0 in β_t computation
  - Numerical instability: Ensure data standardization (zero mean, unit variance); check that kernel matrix K_t + σ²_noise·J_w remains well-conditioned
  - Conservative performance on clean data: Plateau width L may be too narrow, causing uncorrupted observations to be down-weighted

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity check—zero-cost robustness:** Run FC-RCGP-UCB and GP-UCB on uncorrupted Forrester function (T_c = 0). Verify cumulative regret curves overlap.
  2. **Corruption tolerance—bounded vs. unbounded:** Inject single infinite-magnitude corruption on Forrester at iteration 5. Compare GP-UCB (should fail catastrophically) vs. FC-RCGP-UCB (should recover). Vary corruption magnitude to confirm defense is magnitude-agnostic.
  3. **Adaptive vs. fixed center:** Run A2-RCGP-UCB and FC-RCGP-UCB on corrupted CIFAR-10 hyperparameter optimization with T^1/3 crash frequency. Measure cumulative regret over 150 iterations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework makes strong assumptions about corruption frequency bounds (T_c = O(T^α)) that may be difficult to verify in practice
- The zero-cost robustness claim relies critically on the plateau condition holding—if the centering function deviates significantly from the true function, uncorrupted observations may be erroneously down-weighted
- Empirical validation is limited to synthetic benchmarks and two real-world tasks, with no systematic evaluation across diverse function classes or noise regimes

## Confidence
- **High:** Mechanism 1 (Plateau-IMQ Weight Function), Mechanism 2 (Frequency-Constrained Corruption Budget)
- **Medium:** Mechanism 3 (Robust Confidence Multiplier), overall regret bounds
- **Low:** Empirical validation across diverse function classes, A2 variant's practical robustness

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness to centering error:** Systematically vary the gap between centering function g(x) and true function f(x) in synthetic experiments to quantify efficiency loss when plateau condition fails.

2. **Cross-function generalization:** Evaluate both variants on additional benchmark functions (Ackley, Rastrigin, Hartmann) with varying dimensionality and smoothness to test kernel-dependent guarantees.

3. **Corruption pattern sensitivity:** Test against non-uniform corruption patterns (bursty vs. random, structured vs. unstructured) to identify failure modes beyond simple frequency bounds.
