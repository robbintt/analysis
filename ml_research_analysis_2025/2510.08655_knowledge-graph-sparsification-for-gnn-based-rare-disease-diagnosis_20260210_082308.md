# Knowledge Graph Sparsification for GNN-based Rare Disease Diagnosis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08655
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08655
- Reference count: 40
- RareNet achieves 27.0% Hits@1 and 37.3% MRR on simulated rare disease data, outperforming existing methods

## Executive Summary
RareNet is a Graph Neural Network approach for causal gene prioritization in rare disease diagnosis that operates without requiring pre-defined candidate gene lists. The method extracts patient-specific subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs using only phenotypic input, then scores and ranks candidate genes within these subgraphs. RareNet can function as a standalone tool or enhance existing methods by providing compact, patient-specific gene lists for pre- or post-filtering. On simulated rare disease datasets, RareNet achieves 27.0% Hits@1 and 37.3% MRR, significantly outperforming baselines like Shepherd (13.3% Hits@1) and PhenoApt (8.8% Hits@1).

## Method Summary
RareNet extracts patient-specific subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs using phenotypic input, then applies Graph Neural Networks to score and rank candidate genes. The method operates without requiring pre-defined candidate gene lists, making it suitable for rare disease diagnosis where traditional frequency-based approaches may fail. RareNet can be used as a standalone tool or integrated with existing methods to provide compact, patient-specific gene lists for filtering. The approach is designed to be robust to noisy phenotype data and does not rely on frequency-based shortcuts that may not generalize well to rare or under-characterized genes.

## Key Results
- RareNet achieves 27.0% Hits@1 and 37.3% MRR on simulated rare disease data
- Outperforms baselines Shepherd (13.3% Hits@1) and PhenoApt (8.8% Hits@1) on simulated data
- When integrated with Shepherd, RareNet improves performance to 15.4% Hits@1
- On MyGene2 real-world dataset, RareNet achieves 13.0% Hits@1 and 20.2% MRR

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RareNet works by leveraging Graph Neural Networks to capture complex relationships within biomedical knowledge graphs. By extracting patient-specific subgraphs based on phenotypic input, the method focuses computational resources on relevant portions of the knowledge graph rather than processing the entire graph. The GNN architecture allows for learning rich representations of gene-disease relationships that go beyond simple co-occurrence statistics. This approach is particularly effective for rare diseases where traditional frequency-based methods may not have sufficient data to identify meaningful patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Why needed: To capture complex relationships in biomedical knowledge graphs. Quick check: Verify GNN can propagate information across multiple hops in the graph.
- **Knowledge Graph Sparsification**: Why needed: To reduce computational complexity and focus on patient-relevant information. Quick check: Ensure sparsification maintains critical connections for accurate gene ranking.
- **Phenotype-based Subgraph Extraction**: Why needed: To create patient-specific representations without requiring candidate gene lists. Quick check: Validate that extracted subgraphs contain relevant genes for the input phenotypes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Phenotype Input -> Knowledge Graph Sparsification -> GNN Processing -> Gene Scoring/Ranking -> Output

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are the knowledge graph sparsification and GNN processing stages, as these determine the quality of the gene representations and final rankings.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational efficiency (through sparsification) for potential loss of global context. The GNN architecture must balance model complexity with the limited data available for rare diseases.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate insufficient coverage in the knowledge graph for the target phenotypes, overly aggressive sparsification removing critical connections, or GNN architecture not capturing the relevant patterns.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test sparsification quality by comparing gene rankings with and without the sparsification step
2. Evaluate different GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE) on a small validation set
3. Measure the impact of varying subgraph extraction radius on final gene ranking accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Primary evaluation relies on simulated data which may not capture real-world complexity
- Performance still limited (13-27% Hits@1) even with improvements over baselines
- Computational overhead and clinical workflow integration details not fully explored
- Knowledge graph coverage may limit effectiveness for certain rare diseases

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation and baseline comparisons
- Medium confidence in generalization to diverse rare disease scenarios
- Medium confidence in practical clinical utility without further validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate RareNet on additional real-world rare disease datasets with different phenotypic profiles and disease categories
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the contribution of individual components in the RareNet architecture
3. Perform a comparative analysis of computational efficiency and scalability when integrating RareNet with existing clinical workflows
