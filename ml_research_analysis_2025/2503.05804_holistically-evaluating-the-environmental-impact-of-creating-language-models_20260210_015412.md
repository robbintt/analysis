# Holistically Evaluating the Environmental Impact of Creating Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.05804
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05804
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Comprehensive environmental impact analysis of language model development across hardware manufacturing, model development, and training phases

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the environmental impact of developing language models ranging from 20 million to 13 billion parameters. The authors estimate carbon emissions and water consumption across three distinct phases: hardware manufacturing, model development (including hyperparameter tuning), and final training runs. Their findings reveal that model development accounts for approximately 50% of total environmental impact, a previously unreported figure for large language models. The analysis also highlights significant variability in power consumption during training, ranging from 15% to 85% of maximum GPU capacity, and calls for greater transparency in reporting environmental impacts, particularly for model development and embodied emissions from hardware manufacturing.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive environmental impact assessment of developing a series of language models from 20 million to 13 billion parameters. They measured carbon emissions and water consumption across three phases: hardware manufacturing (using proxy data and lifecycle assessments), model development (including hyperparameter tuning and experimental runs), and final training runs. Power consumption was monitored using power meters on A100 and 3090 GPUs, with measurements taken across different utilization levels. Water consumption estimates were derived from regional grid water intensity factors. The analysis aggregated emissions and resource usage across all model variants to produce total environmental impact figures.

## Key Results
- Total environmental impact: 493 metric tons of CO2 and 2.769 million liters of water consumed
- Model development accounts for approximately 50% of total environmental impact
- Power consumption during training shows high variability (15-85% of maximum GPU capacity)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by systematically tracking resource consumption across the entire model development lifecycle, from hardware production through training completion. By measuring power draw directly with meters and using established emission factors for different grid mixes, the approach captures both direct and indirect environmental impacts. The three-phase breakdown (manufacturing, development, training) enables identification of previously overlooked contributors to environmental costs, particularly the model development phase which aggregates all experimental work and hyperparameter tuning.

## Foundational Learning

**Carbon accounting methodologies** - Understanding how to translate energy consumption into CO2 emissions using grid-specific emission factors. Why needed: Different regions have vastly different carbon intensities for electricity generation. Quick check: Verify regional emission factors used match current grid mixes.

**Life cycle assessment (LCA) principles** - Framework for evaluating environmental impacts across all stages of a product's existence. Why needed: Provides comprehensive view beyond just operational emissions. Quick check: Ensure all lifecycle stages are properly weighted and accounted for.

**Water intensity factors** - Metrics for converting energy consumption to water usage based on cooling requirements. Why needed: Water consumption is a critical but often overlooked environmental metric. Quick check: Validate regional water intensity factors against local utility data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Hardware Manufacturing -> Model Development -> Training Runs -> Total Impact Calculation

**Critical Path**: Power meter measurements during training runs feed into carbon and water consumption calculations, which are then aggregated with manufacturing and development phase data.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Direct measurement of power consumption provides accuracy but requires specialized equipment; proxy data for manufacturing introduces uncertainty but enables comprehensive lifecycle assessment.

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent power draw patterns may indicate inefficient model architectures or suboptimal hyperparameter settings; missing experimental data would bias development phase estimates.

**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Verify power meter calibration across different GPU utilization levels, 2) Test emission factor calculations against known regional grid mixes, 3) Validate water intensity factor calculations with local utility data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Hardware manufacturing phase relies heavily on proxy data and component-level analyses that may not accurately represent specific GPU models used
- Model development impact accounting aggregates multiple experimental runs without detailed breakdown of individual experiment resource usage
- Water consumption estimates depend on regional grid water intensity factors that may not capture temporal variations in cooling system efficiency

## Confidence

**High**: Total emissions figure of 493 metric tons CO2 and water consumption of 2.769 million liters (systematic measurements and established emission factors)

**Medium**: Model development accounts for approximately 50% of environmental impact (aggregation uncertainties and lack of detailed experimental breakdown)

**Low**: Causes of power consumption variability (15-85% of maximum) (observed through direct measurements but unexplained)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct detailed audit of experimental logs to quantify exact number of development runs and hyperparameter tuning iterations to validate the 50% model development impact claim

2. Perform controlled power consumption tests across multiple GPU utilization ranges to establish relationship between model architecture, batch size, and power draw

3. Implement fine-grained measurement system to track water consumption at facility level, accounting for cooling system efficiency changes over time and local water stress conditions
