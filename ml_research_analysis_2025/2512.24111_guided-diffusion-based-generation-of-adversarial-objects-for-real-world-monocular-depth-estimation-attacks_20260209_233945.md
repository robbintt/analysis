# Guided Diffusion-based Generation of Adversarial Objects for Real-World Monocular Depth Estimation Attacks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24111
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24111
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Training-free generative adversarial attack framework produces naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects that significantly outperform existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the vulnerability of monocular depth estimation (MDE) models in autonomous driving systems to adversarial attacks. Existing physical attacks rely on unnatural texture patches with limited placement flexibility, reducing their stealthiness and practical applicability in complex driving environments. The authors propose a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that produces naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The method introduces a Salient Region Selection module to identify the most influential regions for depth estimation and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism to steer adversarial gradients while preserving visual plausibility. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing attacks, achieving superior effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that produces naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects for monocular depth estimation systems. The method leverages a diffusion-based conditional generation process that introduces two key innovations: a Salient Region Selection module that identifies the most influential regions for depth estimation, and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients while preserving visual plausibility. Unlike existing patch-based attacks that apply unnatural textures with limited placement flexibility, this approach generates adversarial objects that are perceptually consistent with the scene context. The framework operates without requiring additional training, making it practical for real-world deployment. Extensive experiments validate the approach's effectiveness in both digital and physical settings, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.

## Key Results
- Proposed method significantly outperforms existing attacks in both digital and physical settings
- Generated adversarial objects maintain high visual plausibility while effectively deceiving depth estimation systems
- Physical validation demonstrates successful deployment of adversarial objects in real-world scenarios
- Training-free approach enables practical implementation without requiring model retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the inherent capabilities of diffusion models to generate realistic images while conditioning the generation process on adversarial objectives. The Salient Region Selection module identifies regions where depth estimation is most sensitive to perturbations, allowing the attack to focus computational resources on the most impactful areas. The Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism provides gradient information that steers the diffusion process toward generating objects that maximally affect depth predictions while maintaining natural appearance. This combination allows the generation of adversarial objects that are both effective in deceiving the depth estimation model and visually consistent with the scene context, addressing the key limitation of existing patch-based attacks that use unnatural textures.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Image -> Salient Region Selection -> Jacobian Guidance -> Diffusion Generation -> Adversarial Object

**Critical Path**: The diffusion generation process is the critical path, where the Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism iteratively steers the denoising process toward generating objects that maximize depth estimation errors while maintaining visual plausibility.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Training-free approach vs. potential performance gains from fine-tuning; naturalistic generation vs. computational complexity of diffusion models; scene consistency vs. attack effectiveness.

**Failure Signatures**: Attack failure occurs when generated objects appear unnatural, are placed in non-salient regions, or fail to significantly impact depth estimation predictions. Physical deployment failures manifest as objects that don't maintain adversarial properties under real-world conditions.

**First Experiments**:
1. Digital validation: Test attack effectiveness against MiDaS-v3.1 on KITTI dataset
2. Stealthiness evaluation: Conduct perceptual studies comparing generated objects to natural scene elements
3. Physical validation: Deploy adversarial objects in controlled real-world settings and measure depth estimation errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper highlights several critical directions for future research, including the need to strengthen geometric robustness in vision-based depth perception systems. The authors suggest that their approach provides a new direction for studying controllable generation under safety-critical constraints, particularly in autonomous driving applications. They also emphasize the importance of developing defense mechanisms against such sophisticated adversarial attacks, as current approaches may be insufficient against generative adversarial methods that produce physically realizable, scene-consistent perturbations.

## Limitations

- Scalability to different environmental conditions and camera perspectives beyond tested scenarios
- Physical validation conducted under controlled conditions with limited environmental diversity
- Reliance on single diffusion model architecture (Stable Diffusion v1.5) may limit generalizability
- Uncertain long-term robustness across varying lighting and weather conditions

## Confidence

- High confidence in digital attack effectiveness and comparison methodology
- Medium confidence in physical realizability claims due to limited environmental testing
- Medium confidence in stealthiness improvements over existing methods
- Low confidence in long-term robustness across varying lighting and weather conditions

## Next Checks

1. Test the physical attack effectiveness across diverse environmental conditions (rain, fog, varying lighting) and camera angles beyond the current controlled setup
2. Evaluate the attack's transferability to different monocular depth estimation architectures beyond MiDaS-v3.1
3. Conduct extensive user studies to quantify the perceptual similarity between generated adversarial objects and natural scene elements across diverse populations
