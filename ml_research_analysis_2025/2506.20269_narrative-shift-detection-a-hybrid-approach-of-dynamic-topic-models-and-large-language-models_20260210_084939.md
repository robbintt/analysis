# Narrative Shift Detection: A Hybrid Approach of Dynamic Topic Models and Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.20269
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20269
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposed hybrid method detects narrative shifts in news articles with 83.78% accuracy but hallucinates narratives in 42.65% of content shifts

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of detecting narrative shifts in large text corpora over time, which is crucial for understanding evolving media narratives. The authors propose a hybrid approach combining dynamic topic modeling with large language models (LLMs) to identify and interpret narrative changes. Their method uses RollingLDA and Topical Changes to detect shifts in topics, then filters relevant documents for LLM analysis. When applied to The Wall Street Journal articles (2009-2023), the LLM successfully explained narrative shifts in 83.78% of cases but struggled to distinguish between narrative and content shifts, achieving only 57.35% accuracy. This suggests that while LLMs can effectively interpret existing narratives, they tend to hallucinate narratives even when none exist.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a pipeline that combines dynamic topic modeling with LLMs to detect and interpret narrative shifts in temporal text data. The method first applies RollingLDA to process the corpus in time chunks (e.g., monthly), maintaining consistency with previous word-topic assignments. The Topical Changes method monitors cosine similarity of word vectors over time, flagging change points when similarity drops below a bootstrap-derived threshold. These change points trigger downstream LLM analysis using filtered documents that are particularly representative of the detected change. The LLM interprets these documents using the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF), which requires identifying setting, characters, plot, and moral. The approach was tested on 795,800 Wall Street Journal articles from 2009-2023 using Llama 3.1 8B locally to handle copyright-protected content.

## Key Results
- LLM successfully explained narrative shifts in 83.78% of cases when narratives existed
- Classification accuracy between narrative and content shifts was only 57.35%
- The method detected 68 total change points across the 14-year corpus
- LLM tended to hallucinate narratives even when only content shifts occurred

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Computational Triaging via Dynamic Topic Models
The pipeline reduces the search space for computationally expensive LLMs by using statistical topic modeling to isolate specific timeframes and documents containing potential semantic deviations. RollingLDA processes the corpus in time chunks (e.g., monthly), maintaining a "memory" of previous word-topic assignments to ensure consistency. The "Topical Changes" method then monitors the cosine similarity of word vectors over time. If similarity drops below a bootstrap-derived threshold, a change point is flagged, triggering the downstream LLM analysis only for those specific periods. The core assumption is that narrative shifts manifest as abrupt, statistically significant changes in word frequency distributions (lexical drift) within specific topics.

### Mechanism 2: Contextual Anchoring for LLM Interpretation
Providing the LLM with specific lexical artifacts ("leave-one-out word impacts") and a rigid analytical framework (Narrative Policy Framework) grounds the reasoning process, reducing random generation and improving extraction accuracy for existing narratives. The pipeline extracts keywords that contribute most to the statistical distance between time chunks. These keywords, along with 5 filtered documents, are injected into the LLM prompt. The prompt enforces the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF)—requiring a setting, characters, plot, and moral—forcing the model to map raw text to these specific schema fields. The core assumption is that the keywords identified by the statistical model are causally relevant to the narrative shift, not just incidental noise.

### Mechanism 3: Hallucination via Oversatisfaction
The LLM serves as a semantic validator but suffers from a tendency to force-fit data into requested structures (hallucination) when the input data lacks the requested properties (i.e., no narrative exists). The prompt asks the LLM to identify specific structural elements (Plot, Moral, etc.). If the underlying content shift is purely factual (non-narrative), the LLM often generates a superficial or "hallucinated" narrative structure to satisfy the JSON output requirement rather than returning "null" or "false." The core assumption is that the LLM prioritizes instruction following (providing the requested JSON fields) over strict factual verification of narrative existence.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) & Gibbs Sampling**
  - **Why needed here:** The architecture relies on RollingLDA, a variant of LDA. You must understand that LDA is probabilistic, not deterministic. It infers topics based on word co-occurrence probabilities. "LDAPrototype" is used here to mitigate the randomness inherent in standard LDA initialization.
  - **Quick check question:** If you run RollingLDA twice on the same data without setting a seed, will the topic IDs (e.g., Topic 1 vs. Topic 2) be identical?

- **Concept: Narrative Policy Framework (NPF)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the "ground truth" schema used to evaluate the LLM. The system is not looking for generic summaries; it specifically hunts for four elements: *Setting, Characters, Plot, and Moral*. The distinction between a "content shift" (facts change) and a "narrative shift" (structural story changes) is central to the paper's evaluation.
  - **Quick check question:** Does a statement "Inflation rose to 5% in 2023" constitute a 'Moral' in the NPF sense? (Hint: Does it contain a value judgment?)

- **Concept: Leave-One-Out Impact**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the heuristic used to filter documents. The system calculates which specific words cause the distance between topic vectors to increase the most when removed. These words serve as the "anchor" for finding relevant documents to feed the LLM.
  - **Quick check question:** If the word "Trump" appears frequently in both Time A and Time B, would it likely have a high "leave-one-out impact" score for a change detection between A and B?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Ingest (Time-chunked corpus) -> Model (RollingLDA + LDAPrototype) -> Detect (Topical Changes) -> Filter (Top-k document retrieval) -> Interpret (Local Llama 3.1 8B)
- **Critical path:** The **Filtering Strategy**. The prompt engineering is robust, but the system relies entirely on the filtering step to present the *right* five documents. If the statistical model selects generic articles, the LLM will produce a generic, hallucinated narrative.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Local vs. Cloud: The authors used Llama 3.1 8B locally to handle copyright-protected text (WSJ articles). This tradeoff sacrifices the reasoning power of larger commercial models (like GPT-4) for data privacy.
  - Recall vs. Precision: The system detects 68 changes but many are false positives (content shifts mislabeled as narrative shifts). The design favors finding *potential* shifts (high recall) over accuracy (low precision).
- **Failure signatures:**
  - The "Oversatisfaction" Hallucination: The LLM returns a valid JSON with a "Moral" and "Plot" for a document that is purely factual (e.g., stock price updates).
  - Topic Scope Drift: In Sample 2, the model conflates Scotland and Brazil elections because they share the "Elections" topic, failing to distinguish that they are distinct narratives.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Run the "Topical Changes" detection on a synthetic corpus where you insert a known narrative shift at time *T* to verify the change point detection accuracy before connecting the LLM.
  2. **Filter Ablation:** Compare the "leave-one-out word impact" filtering (current method) against a baseline of random document selection to quantify how much the specific filtering contributes to the LLM's 83.78% success rate.
  3. **Classification Refinement:** Modify the LLM prompt to include an explicit "None" option and a "Confidence Score" to see if the false positive rate (57.35% accuracy on classification) improves.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the pipeline be adapted to evaluate narrative shifts in a non-binary, continuous manner that accounts for degrees of subjectivity?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state in the Summary, "While we observed narratives as purely binary cases in this paper, we plan to perform a more nuanced evaluation of narrative extraction techniques in the future, considering a wider array of subjectivity at this complex task."
- **Why unresolved:** The current methodology forces a strict True/False classification for narrative shifts, which obscures the complexity and gradations of evolving media narratives.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified evaluation framework using a Likert scale or probability score for narrative intensity that correlates more strongly with expert human judgment than the current binary accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent can refined prompt engineering or alternative filtering strategies reduce the LLM's high false positive rate in distinguishing narrative shifts from mere content shifts?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors note the model achieved only 57.35% accuracy in distinguishing content from narrative shifts due to hallucinations and suggest that "An improved prompt or an additional filtering step could help to solve this issue in future research."
- **Why unresolved:** The current prompt induces a bias where the LLM "hallucinates" narrative elements (like a moral) to satisfy the prompt structure even when only a content shift exists.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study of different prompting styles (e.g., chain-of-thought vs. strict constraints) on the WSJ corpus, specifically measuring the reduction in false positive rates for narrative detection.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the LLM component behave when fed documents associated with spurious change points incorrectly identified by the Topical Changes model?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state in the Limitations section: "we didn't observe cases in which the Topical Changes model incorrectly detected a change, we therefore cannot tell, how the LLM would react to such a case."
- **Why unresolved:** The pipeline currently depends on the accuracy of the upstream topic model; if the topic model signals a change where none exists, the system's error rate and failure modes are unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A stress test where the LLM is provided documents from time periods known to have no significant topical change (false positives from the topic model) to see if it fabricates a narrative explanation.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does the granularity of time chunks and the Topical Changes mixture parameter impact the downstream accuracy of the LLM's narrative interpretation?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors admit in the Limitations section that "parameter choices such as the size of time chunks for RollingLDA and the mixture parameter for the Topical Changes can impact the number and granularity of changes detected, which could also alter the results we observed."
- **Why unresolved:** The study utilizes a single configuration (monthly chunks, 95% mixture), leaving the sensitivity of the narrative detection relative to these temporal hyperparameters unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A sensitivity analysis varying time chunk sizes (e.g., weekly vs. quarterly) and measuring the correlation between these settings and the F1 score of the narrative shift classification.

## Limitations
- The method relies on a proprietary WSJ dataset (2009-2023), making direct replication impossible
- Only 57.35% accuracy in distinguishing narrative from content shifts indicates significant hallucination problem
- Binary classification framework doesn't account for partial narratives or mixed content-narratives
- Dependence on lexical changes may miss subtle narrative shifts that evolve through context

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core finding that LLMs tend to hallucinate narratives when none exist (83.78% accuracy on existing narratives, 57.35% on classification)
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific accuracy metrics and qualitative evaluations, given they're based on expert annotators and copyright-protected data
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about generalizability beyond news media to other domains

## Next Checks
1. **Synthetic Corpus Validation**: Create a controlled dataset with injected narrative shifts to test the change detection accuracy of RollingLDA and Topical Changes independently before LLM integration.

2. **Prompt Engineering Refinement**: Test alternative LLM prompts with explicit "none" options and confidence scoring to reduce hallucination rates, comparing results against the current approach.

3. **Cross-Domain Testing**: Apply the method to a public news corpus (e.g., NYT or Guardian) to assess whether the 83.78%/57.35% accuracy rates hold outside the proprietary WSJ dataset.
