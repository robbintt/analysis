# Comparative Analysis of Image, Video, and Audio Classifiers for Automated News Video Segmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.21848
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21848
- Authors: Jonathan Attard; Dylan Seychell
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: ResNet152 image classifier achieved 84.34% accuracy, outperforming video and audio models for news video segmentation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comparative analysis of image, video, and audio classifiers for automated news video segmentation. The study evaluates multiple deep learning approaches including ResNet, ViViT, AST, and multimodal architectures to classify five distinct segment types: advertisements, stories, studio scenes, transitions, and visualisations. Using a custom-annotated dataset of 41 news videos comprising 1,832 scene clips, the experiments demonstrate that image-based classifiers achieve superior performance (84.34% accuracy) compared to more complex temporal models. Notably, the ResNet architecture outperformed state-of-the-art video classifiers while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Binary classification models achieved high accuracy for transitions (94.23%) and advertisements (92.74%). The findings advance understanding of effective architectures for news video segmentation and provide practical insights for implementing automated content organisation systems in media applications.

## Method Summary
The study uses a two-step pipeline: PySceneDetect detects scene boundaries, then classifiers label each segment. The dataset contains 41 news videos (1,832 clips) with five classes: advertisements, stories, studio scenes, transitions, and visualisations. ResNet152 uses ImageNet pretraining with 224×224px input, Adam optimizer (lr=0.0001), batch=32, and weighted sampling for class imbalance. ViViT and AST models use reduced parameters (L=6, NH=6, d=384) with Kinetics 400 and AudioSet pretraining respectively. AST processes mel spectrograms (44.1kHz, 128 mel bins). Multimodal fusion concatenates embeddings from ViViT and AST. Evaluation uses duration-weighted confusion matrices. Image dataset contains 28,817 extracted frames (16 per scene with 10-frame padding).

## Key Results
- ResNet152 achieved 84.34% accuracy, outperforming all video and audio models
- Binary classification models achieved 94.23% accuracy for transitions and 92.74% for advertisements
- Multimodal ViViT-AST fusion model achieved 72.70% accuracy, underperforming the image-only ResNet
- Image classifiers trained in under 1 hour while ViViT-AST-L took nearly 4 days

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Static Visual Features Capture News Scene Semantics
Image-based classifiers achieve superior performance when scene types have visually distinct signatures. ResNet152 extracts hierarchical spatial features from individual frames; these features are sufficient because news segment categories exhibit strong visual regularities—studio scenes have consistent anchorperson setups, transitions have distinctive graphical overlays, advertisements have production-quality visuals with logos. Core assumption: News segment classification relies more on spatial patterns than temporal dynamics.

### Mechanism 2: Audio-Visual Modality Complementarity with Class-Specific Value
Audio provides discriminative signal for specific classes (transitions) but introduces noise for others (visualisations). AST processes mel spectrograms; transitions produce distinctive recurring audio signatures enabling 94.23% binary accuracy. However, visualisation scenes interrupt visuals while audio continues unchanged, causing AST confusion. The fusion layer concatenates embeddings without adaptive weighting, diluting strong visual signal with noisy audio signal. Core assumption: Modality importance varies by class.

### Mechanism 3: Class Imbalance and Duration Skew Affect Temporal Model Generalisation
Severe class imbalance (126 ads vs. 655 studio clips) combined with duration variance (7.82s transitions vs. 78.03s stories) disadvantages temporal models that require more samples to learn spatio-temporal patterns. ViViT and multimodal models require learning temporal attention across 16-32 frame sequences. With limited samples per class and high intra-class duration variance, these models cannot learn robust spatio-temporal representations. Image classifiers, operating per-frame, effectively multiply training data (28,817 images from 1,832 clips).

## Foundational Learning

- **Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Vision Models**
  - Why needed: ResNet152 with ImageNet weights achieved 84.34% accuracy; training from scratch would require far more data and compute
  - Quick check: Can you explain why ImageNet pre-training transfers to news video frames despite domain shift?

- **Mel Spectrogram Representation for Audio**
  - Why needed: AST converts raw audio to time-frequency representations; understanding spectrograms is essential for debugging audio classification failures
  - Quick check: How does a mel spectrogram differ from a linear frequency spectrogram, and why might this matter for transition detection?

- **Two-Stage Segmentation Pipeline (Detection + Classification)**
  - Why needed: The system uses PySceneDetect for boundary detection, then classifies each segment; errors propagate between stages
  - Quick check: If PySceneDetect misses a boundary, what happens to downstream classification metrics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Video → PySceneDetect (boundary detection) → Frame Extraction (16 frames/clip + 10-frame padding) → Image Classifier (ResNet152) → Class Label Assignment
- **Critical path:** Annotation quality → Scene detection accuracy → Classifier selection → Duration-weighted evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs:** Resolution vs. annotation speed (384×216px reduced server load but may lose fine details); Model complexity vs. resource constraints (ViViT-AST-L took 4 days vs. ResNet 0.89 hours); Multimodal fusion simplicity vs. adaptivity (concatenation is efficient but cannot weight modalities per-class)
- **Failure signatures:** AST confuses visualisations (audio continues while visuals change)—diagnostic: check spectrogram similarity; ViViT underperforms despite temporal modeling—diagnostic: verify pre-trained weight compatibility; Multimodal models degrade vs. image-only—diagnostic: ablate audio branch and compare
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Establish ResNet152 baseline with ImageNet weights; 2) Ablate audio modality: train ViViT-only to isolate audio contribution; 3) Binary one-vs-all classifiers for transitions and ads to verify 94.23% and 92.74% accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance gap between image-based classifiers and complex temporal/multimodal models change when trained on a significantly larger and more diverse dataset? The current study is based on a limited custom dataset of only 41 videos, which may provide insufficient data for complex temporal models like ViViT to converge effectively.

### Open Question 2
Can alternative multimodal fusion architectures outperform single-modality image classifiers by better utilizing the synchronization between audio and visual features? The paper implemented a concatenation-based fusion that underperformed (72.70% accuracy) compared to the image-only model (84.34%).

### Open Question 3
To what extent can dedicated attention-based refinement techniques improve the identification of scene boundaries and class labels over the current two-step pipeline? The current methodology relies on a distinct separation of tasks which may lack the end-to-end temporal awareness needed to capture subtle transitions.

## Limitations

- Custom dataset of 41 news videos without public availability prevents independent validation
- Class imbalance (126 advertisements vs. 655 studio scenes) and duration-weighted evaluation may bias results
- Computational constraints prevented training full-capacity ViViT and AST models
- Simple concatenation fusion may not represent optimal multimodal combination approach

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** ResNet152 achieving 84.34% accuracy as the best-performing model - supported by multiple experimental results
- **Medium Confidence:** Image-based classifiers outperforming temporal models for news video segmentation - theoretically sound but dataset-dependent
- **Medium Confidence:** Binary classification superiority for transitions and advertisements - well-supported by results but may not generalize

## Next Checks

1. Replicate experiments on a publicly available news video dataset to verify generalizability of image classifier superiority across different news sources

2. Implement attention-based modality weighting in the multimodal architecture to test whether adaptive fusion can overcome current limitations where audio noise degrades performance

3. Train full-capacity ViViT and AST models on the same dataset to determine whether parameter reduction was the limiting factor or if image classifiers are fundamentally more suitable
