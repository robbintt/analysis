# Aesthetic Experience and Educational Value in Co-creating Art with Generative AI: Evidence from a Survey of Young Learners

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.10576
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10576
- Reference count: 7
- Most learners see AI as a creative partner rather than a passive tool

## Executive Summary
This study surveyed 112 young learners to examine how generative AI reshapes aesthetic experience and educational value in collaborative artmaking. Findings show that most participants view AI as a creative partner rather than a passive tool, experience iterative and dialogic creative workflows, and recognize the need to redefine originality in human–AI co-creation. Learning benefits center on higher-order competencies like critical judgment and cross-modal thinking rather than technical execution. The authors synthesize Dewey's aesthetics, Ihde's postphenomenology, and actor–network theory to frame role fluidity and distributed agency in AI collaboration. They recommend integrating generative AI into arts curricula, emphasizing prompt literacy, ethics, and process-based assessment to cultivate "critical co-creation" competencies.

## Method Summary
The study employed a survey of 112 young learners to investigate their experiences with generative AI in collaborative artmaking. Data collection focused on self-reported perceptions of creative roles, workflow patterns, and educational value. The analysis combined descriptive statistics with theoretical synthesis drawing from Dewey's aesthetics, Ihde's postphenomenology, and actor-network theory to interpret the findings around role fluidity and distributed agency.

## Key Results
- Most participants view AI as a creative partner rather than a passive tool
- Learning benefits center on higher-order competencies like critical judgment and cross-modal thinking rather than technical execution
- Participants experience iterative and dialogic creative workflows requiring redefinition of originality in human-AI co-creation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Generative AI transforms the creative process from a solitary technical exercise into a dialogic partnership where learners shift between director and collaborator roles. This role fluidity enables distributed agency where both human and machine contribute meaningfully to the creative outcome. The technology's capacity for rapid iteration and multimodal generation supports cross-modal thinking and critical judgment development as learners evaluate and refine AI outputs. This partnership model redefines traditional notions of originality and authorship in artistic creation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Role fluidity**: Understanding how learners shift between director and partner roles is essential because it explains the distributed agency in AI collaboration. Quick check: Observe if participants naturally transition between giving instructions and responding to AI suggestions.
- **Critical judgment development**: Higher-order thinking skills emerge through evaluating and refining AI outputs. Quick check: Measure improvement in participants' ability to articulate criteria for artistic quality.
- **Prompt literacy**: The ability to effectively communicate with AI systems through text prompts becomes a core creative competency. Quick check: Track correlation between prompt sophistication and creative outcomes.
- **Cross-modal thinking**: AI enables connections across different artistic modalities and conceptual domains. Quick check: Document instances where visual ideas inspire textual concepts or vice versa.
- **Ethical awareness**: Recognition of AI biases and limitations requires cultivation of critical awareness. Quick check: Assess participants' ability to identify and respond to stylistic homogenization.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Learner cognition -> AI model outputs -> Creative refinement cycle -> Educational outcomes
- **Critical path**: Prompt formulation → AI generation → Human evaluation → Iterative refinement → Learning consolidation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Real-time collaboration vs. reflection time; technical simplicity vs. creative control; individual expression vs. standardized tools
- **Failure signatures**: Over-reliance on AI suggestions, inability to articulate creative preferences, resistance to iterative refinement
- **First experiments**: 1) Test different prompt literacy training methods, 2) Compare individual vs. collaborative AI art creation, 3) Measure long-term retention of critical judgment skills

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How do learners' self-reported creative roles align with their actual behaviors during classroom observation?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly identify the "reliance on self-reports" as a limitation and call for future work to "triangulate with classroom observations... to validate these findings."
- Why unresolved: The current survey data captures participants' perceptions of their fluid subjectivity (e.g., director vs. partner), which may differ from their objective interaction patterns or actual agency exercised during creation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ethnographic data or interaction logs from live classroom settings correlated with survey responses to verify if perceived "critical co-creation" matches actual practice.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the shift toward higher-order competencies (critical judgment, cross-modal ideation) persist longitudinally or fade as AI novelty decreases?
- Basis in paper: The paper identifies a shift in educational value from technical execution to higher-order competencies, but the cross-sectional design (N=112 at a single time point) cannot determine if these learning outcomes are durable.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the reported educational benefits are permanent shifts in cognition or temporary outcomes driven by the initial novelty of generative tools.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study tracking the same cohort over time to measure retention of critical judgment skills and changes in creative self-efficacy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific pedagogical interventions effectively mitigate the risk of stylistic homogenization caused by AI model biases?
- Basis in paper: Participants voiced concerns about "stylistic homogenization," and the authors recommend curricula that cultivate "critical co-creation" and "prompt literacy," but do not test specific methods to achieve this.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the risk of standardization inherent in the models, it does not empirically demonstrate which educational strategies successfully preserve "human distinctiveness" in style.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing different prompt literacy curricula to see which methods best foster stylistic diversity and personal voice in student outputs.

## Limitations
- Reliance on self-reported data without observational validation
- Single time-point measurement prevents assessment of long-term learning retention
- Limited cultural context and age range generalizability

## Confidence
- Claims about role fluidity: Medium (descriptive but not empirically traced)
- Pedagogical benefits: Medium (perceived gains not objectively measured)
- Theoretical synthesis (Dewey, Ihde, ANT): High (conceptually sound)
- Claims about originality redefinition: High (richly described)
- Predictive validity of educational recommendations: Low (not tested empirically)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate survey with age-stratified samples across multiple cultural settings to test generalizability
2. Conduct think-aloud protocols or screen recordings during AI-assisted artmaking to trace actual agency distribution
3. Implement pre/post assessments of critical judgment and cross-modal thinking to measure learning gains objectively
