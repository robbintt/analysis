- Multi-view video reasoning framework for pedestrian-vehicle incidents with phase-aware cognitive analysis

## Executive Summary
MP-PVIR addresses the challenge of understanding pedestrian-vehicle incidents by moving beyond detection to provide causal, phase-aware reasoning from multi-view video streams. The framework integrates behavioral theory with vision-language models to segment incidents into cognitive phases (pre-recognition, recognition, judgment, action, avoidance) and perform synchronized analysis across overhead and vehicle perspectives. The approach employs two specialized models: TG-VLM for temporal grounding (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for multi-view reasoning, achieving 33.063 captioning score and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. A reasoning LLM synthesizes these outputs into comprehensive diagnostic reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, and prevention recommendations.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition and synchronization, (2) temporal grounding with TG-VLM to segment incidents into five cognitive phases, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning using PhaVR-VLM for captioning and visual question answering, and (4) hierarchical synthesis with a reasoning LLM to generate structured diagnostic reports. The approach fine-tunes Qwen2.5-VL-7B with LoRA for the vision-language tasks, using temporal serialization to process synchronized multi-view videos without architectural modification. Training leverages 33,603 multimodal examples from the Woven Traffic Safety dataset with synchronized overhead and vehicle perspectives.

## Key Results
- TG-VLM achieves temporal grounding mIoU of 0.4881 with phase-wise variation (Pre-recognition: 0.7887, Judgment: 0.3662)
- PhaVR-VLM scores 33.063 on composite captioning metrics and 64.70% accuracy on vehicle perspective question answering
- Reasoning LLM synthesizes multi-view, multi-phase evidence into structured causal reports with prevention recommendations
- Sequential pipeline enables modular evaluation but allows error propagation from temporal grounding to reasoning stages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Temporal serialization enables multi-view video processing without architectural modification by leveraging existing long-context attention in VLMs.
- Mechanism: Given synchronized videos V={V₁, V₂, ..., Vₙ}, concatenate visual token sequences along temporal dimension [tokens(V₁); tokens(V₂); ...; tokens(Vₙ)], allowing self-attention to learn cross-view correspondences end-to-end.
- Core assumption: The base VLM's attention mechanism can discover semantic alignment across views without explicit spatial registration or view-specific adapters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2.2] "Temporal Serialization therefore produces unified token sequence... the model exploits the long-context attention capabilities of the Qwen-2.5-VL architecture to learn cross-view correlations via self-attention"
  - [section 6.1] Baseline Qwen2.5-VL models "failed to produce valid temporal boundaries" without fine-tuning, confirming serialization alone is insufficient—task-specific adaptation is required.
  - [corpus] TrafficLens paper addresses multi-camera analysis but focuses on efficiency/coverage; corpus evidence for cross-view attention mechanisms is weak.
- Break condition: If views are not temporally synchronized or have vastly different frame rates, serialized tokens will not align semantically; cross-view attention will attend to spurious correlations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Phase-aware segmentation grounds abstract cognitive theory in measurable temporal intervals, enabling phase-specific reasoning instead of monolithic event classification.
- Mechanism: TG-VLM maps multi-view videos V and phase descriptions D to temporal boundaries B through supervised fine-tuning on expert-annotated phase labels (pre-recognition, recognition, judgment, action, avoidance).
- Core assumption: The five-phase taxonomy meaningfully captures decision-relevant transitions; boundaries are visually or contextually detectable from video alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "segmenting incidents into cognitive phases (pre-recognition, recognition, judgment, action, avoidance)"
  - [section 6.1] Phase-wise mIoU varies substantially: Pre-recognition 0.7887, Recognition 0.5091, Judgment 0.3662, Action 0.4208, Avoidance 0.3559—indicating cognitive phases with minimal visual markers (Judgment) are harder to localize than those with observable behavior.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers validate this specific phase taxonomy; assumption remains domain-specific.
- Break condition: If phase transitions are rapid, subtle, or lack visual cues (internal cognition), model will produce noisy boundaries; downstream reasoning inherits localization errors.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical synthesis with a reasoning LLM aggregates structured multi-view, multi-phase evidence into coherent causal narratives.
- Mechanism: LLM receives phase timelines B, multi-view captions C, and Q&A pairs A; applies domain prompt to infer causal chains, contributing factors, and prevention strategies in structured JSON.
- Core assumption: Intermediate outputs (captions, QA) are sufficiently accurate and that the LLM can resolve inconsistencies across views/phases without hallucinating unsupported causal links.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3.1] "Claude Opus 4... receives the complete structured dataset from previous stages"
  - [section 6.3.3] Generated causal chain example shows phase-by-phase factor attribution (e.g., "Pedestrian distraction due to smartphone use" → "Vehicle reversing without ensuring clear path").
  - [corpus] LLMs for traffic incident forecasting (arxiv 2507.04803) show promise but evaluation focuses on impact prediction, not causal explanation; corpus evidence for synthesis reliability is limited.
- Break condition: If upstream captions/QA contain errors or contradictions, LLM may produce plausible but ungrounded causal claims; no error correction feedback loop in current pipeline.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal Grounding in Video LLMs
  - Why needed here: Core capability for TG-VLM to localize phase boundaries in continuous video streams.
  - Quick check question: Given a 45-second video with phases [0-10s: pre-recognition, 10-15s: recognition, 15-20s: judgment, 20-35s: action, 35-45s: avoidance], can you compute IoU between predicted and ground-truth intervals?

- Concept: Multi-View Synchronization
  - Why needed here: Stage 1 prerequisite; without temporal alignment, serialized inputs encode meaningless temporal relationships.
  - Quick check question: Two cameras record at 30 FPS and 24 FPS respectively; if an event occurs at t=5.0s in camera A, what frame index corresponds in camera B?

- Concept: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
  - Why needed here: Enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning of 7B VLM on limited GPUs while preserving base capabilities.
  - Quick check question: If W₀ ∈ ℝ^(4096×4096) and LoRA rank r=8, how many trainable parameters are added per weight matrix?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Stage 1: Event trigger + multi-view sync → produces synchronized video clips
  - Stage 2: TG-VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-7B + LoRA) → temporal boundaries B
  - Stage 3: PhaVR-VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-7B + LoRA) → captions C + QA answers A per phase
  - Stage 4: Claude Opus 4 (reasoning LLM) → structured diagnostic report R

- Critical path: Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 4. Errors in TG-VLM boundary prediction propagate to Phase 3 clip extraction; Stage 3 evaluated with ground-truth boundaries in paper, masking this dependency.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Serialization vs. cross-attention adapters: Simpler but requires fine-tuning; no zero-shot transfer to new view configurations.
  - Sequential pipeline vs. end-to-end: Modularity enables isolated evaluation but allows error accumulation.
  - 7B vs. 32B backbone: 7B chosen for efficiency; 32B baselines showed higher QA accuracy but failed on multi-view formatting.

- Failure signatures:
  - TG-VLM outputs invalid timestamps or non-contiguous phases → check prompt formatting and LoRA checkpoint loading.
  - PhaVR-VLM produces N/A on multi-view inputs → base model used instead of fine-tuned checkpoint.
  - Stage 4 LLM hallucinates facts not in inputs → prompt lacks explicit grounding constraints; add "only use provided evidence" instruction.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce TG-VLM mIoU on WTS test split; verify phase-wise breakdown matches paper (Pre-recognition highest, Judgment lowest).
  2. Ablate temporal serialization: process views independently and compare captioning scores to confirm cross-view attention contribution.
  3. Inject noise into Stage 2 boundaries (±2s jitter) and measure Stage 4 report quality degradation to quantify error propagation sensitivity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Can end-to-end joint training of the temporal grounding and reasoning modules outperform the current sequential pipeline design?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that errors in the initial temporal grounding (TG-VLM) can propagate to the reasoning stage and suggest exploring end-to-end joint training to reduce cascading errors.
  - Why unresolved: The current MP-PVIR framework operates sequentially, isolating phase segmentation from the subsequent reasoning steps, which prevents the model from correcting early localization errors during the synthesis stage.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring the mIoU and captioning scores of a jointly trained model against the sequential baseline, specifically analyzing error propagation rates.

- Question: To what extent does the framework generalize to long-tail edge cases such as extreme weather, heavy occlusion, or erratic pedestrian behaviors?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes that while performance on the WTS dataset is strong, generalization to scenarios not represented in the training data remains a significant challenge.
  - Why unresolved: The model was evaluated on specific datasets which may not fully capture the diversity of rare, high-risk events found in uncontrolled real-world environments.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the framework on out-of-distribution datasets containing adverse environmental conditions and occluded viewpoints to evaluate robustness.

- Question: Does the integration of explicit pedestrian gaze and pose estimation data improve the accuracy of cognitive phase segmentation?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest incorporating these additional modalities to enhance granularity, specifically to address the low performance (mIoU = 0.3662) in the "Judgment" phase caused by minimal visual cues.
  - Why unresolved: The current vision-only model struggles to distinguish cognitive phases like "Judgment" because they are defined by internal processing rather than observable physical movement.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study adding synchronized 3D gaze tracking data (available in the WTS dataset) to the input to quantify performance gains in the visually ambiguous phases.

## Limitations

- Phase taxonomy validity unverified beyond staged WTS dataset; may not generalize to unscripted real-world incidents
- Cross-view attention discovery via serialization assumes synchronized, co-located cameras with similar perspectives
- Hierarchical LLM synthesis introduces black-box reasoning that cannot be directly validated for hallucination or error propagation

## Confidence

- High: TG-VLM temporal grounding performance (mIoU = 0.4881) with clear per-phase breakdown showing expected difficulty patterns
- Medium: PhaVR-VLM captioning and VQA accuracy (33.063 score, 64.70% vehicle QA accuracy) given comprehensive evaluation but limited comparison to strong baselines
- Low: Stage 4 LLM synthesis quality and reliability. The paper demonstrates capability but lacks rigorous evaluation of hallucination frequency, error propagation from earlier stages, or ablation studies on prompt design

## Next Checks

1. Conduct out-of-distribution testing on unscripted traffic incident footage to assess phase taxonomy generalization and boundary detection robustness.
2. Implement an ablation study comparing temporal serialization against explicit cross-view attention mechanisms or spatial registration to quantify architectural contributions.
3. Design a controlled experiment injecting known errors at Stage 2 and Stage 3 to measure Stage 4 LLM hallucination rates and error amplification, establishing failure mode boundaries.
