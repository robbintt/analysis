# An Out-Of-Distribution Membership Inference Attack Approach for Cross-Domain Graph Attacks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20074
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20074
- Reference count: 12
- One-line primary result: GOOD-MIA achieves 84.10% accuracy on CiteSeer with GCN backbone, outperforming baselines by 4.76%

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical privacy vulnerability in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by proposing GOOD-MIA, a method for cross-domain Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) that works even when the shadow dataset has a different distribution from the target dataset. Traditional MIAs assume identically distributed auxiliary datasets, which is often unrealistic in practice. GOOD-MIA leverages invariant learning techniques including Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB), and Risk Extrapolation (REx) to capture stable node representations that transfer across domains. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods across multiple real-world datasets, revealing privacy vulnerabilities in GNNs when dealing with data from different distributions.

## Method Summary
GOOD-MIA is a two-phase cross-domain MIA approach that trains a shadow model using invariant learning to capture stable representations, then trains an attack classifier on these representations using risk extrapolation. The shadow model is trained with IRM and GIB across multiple augmented environments created via node feature masking and DropEdge. The attack classifier is trained with V-REx to equalize risks across environments. This approach enables successful membership inference even when the shadow and target domains have different distributions, addressing a critical gap in existing MIA research.

## Key Results
- GOOD-MIA achieves 84.10% accuracy on CiteSeer with GCN backbone vs 79.34% baseline
- Significant improvements across multiple datasets: 73.81% (Cora), 72.14% (PubMed) accuracy with GCN
- Ablation studies show each component (IRM, GIB, REx) contributes 10-20% to overall performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM)
- Claim: Invariant learning enables cross-domain attack generalization by capturing stable representations across distribution shifts
- Mechanism: GOOD-MIA constructs M training environments via data augmentation (node feature masking and DropEdge), then applies IRM to learn node representations where P(Y|X_c) remains constant across environments. The penalty term β‖∇_ω R_e(f_ω)‖² forces the encoder to find representations that yield optimal classifiers in all environments simultaneously
- Core assumption: Stable, domain-invariant features exist that distinguish training members from non-members, and these features transfer across graph domains despite structural differences
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We then explore the stable node representations that remain unchanged under external influences"; [Section 3.2] Defines IRM with penalty: R_IRM = Σ R_e(f_ω) + β‖∇_ω R_e(f_ω)‖²
- Break condition: If target and shadow domains share no invariant features (e.g., fundamentally different graph generation processes), IRM will fail to find transferable representations

### Mechanism 2: Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB)
- Claim: GIB filters domain-specific noise while preserving membership-relevant signals
- Mechanism: GIB optimizes -I(Y;Z) + ξI(G;Z), compressing the graph representation Z to retain only information predictive of downstream labels while discarding environmental confounders. This is integrated into the GNN update: h^(l+1)_e,i = UPDATE(z^(l)_i, argmin h_e,i L_GIB)
- Core assumption: Membership inference signals are contained in task-relevant features rather than domain-specific structural artifacts
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "consider eliminating redundant information from confounding environments and extracting task-relevant key information"; [Section 3.3] Defines GIB_ξ(G,Y;Z) = -I(Y;Z) + ξI(G;Z)
- Break condition: If membership status is encoded in domain-specific structural patterns (e.g., degree distributions unique to target domain), GIB may over-compress and lose attack-relevant information

### Mechanism 3: Risk Extrapolation (REx)
- Claim: Risk Extrapolation (REx) enables attack model generalization by equalizing training risks across augmented environments
- Mechanism: Instead of minimizing average risk, REx maximizes over extrapolated domain weights: R_REx = max_{λ} Σ λ_e R_e. The practical implementation uses variance penalty: R_V-REx = β·Var({R_1,...,R_M}) + Σ R_e. This forces the attack classifier to perform consistently across all training environments, reducing sensitivity to distribution shifts at test time
- Core assumption: Equalizing training risks correlates with improved performance on unseen target domains
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "perform risk extrapolation to optimize the attack's domain adaptability during attack inference"; [Section 4.2] Shows V-REx formulation with variance penalty term
- Break condition: If the target domain distribution lies outside the convex hull of augmented training environments, risk equalization may not generalize

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Membership Inference Attacks (MIA)**
  - Why needed here: GOOD-MIA extends traditional MIA assumptions; you must understand that MIA treats membership as a binary classification problem using model outputs (posteriors) to distinguish training samples from unseen samples
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why GNNs are more vulnerable to MIA than standard MLPs due to topology exposure?

- **Concept: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization**
  - Why needed here: The core innovation is reframing cross-domain MIA as an OOD problem
