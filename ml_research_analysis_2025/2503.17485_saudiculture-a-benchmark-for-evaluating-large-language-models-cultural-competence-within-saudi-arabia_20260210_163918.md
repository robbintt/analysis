# SaudiCulture: A Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models Cultural Competence within Saudi Arabia

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.17485
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17485
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GPT-4 outperforms Arabic-centric models on Saudi cultural competence benchmark; all models struggle with region-specific and multi-answer questions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SaudiCulture, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the cultural competence of large language models (LLMs) in the context of Saudi Arabia. The dataset covers five geographical regions and multiple cultural categories, with questions of varying complexity. Evaluations on five LLMs, including GPT-4 and Arabic-centric models, reveal significant performance disparities, with GPT-4 outperforming others and all models struggling with region-specific and multi-answer questions. The study highlights the importance of incorporating region-specific knowledge into LLMs to improve their cultural understanding.

## Method Summary
The SaudiCulture benchmark comprises 441 questions across 5 regions (West, East, South, North, Center) plus general questions, spanning 8 cultural domains. Questions are presented in three formats: open-ended (206), single-answer MCQ (175), and multiple-answer MCQ (60). Five LLMs were evaluated: GPT-4, Llama 3.3, FANAR, Jais, and AceGPT. The evaluation protocol used accuracy as the primary metric, with open-ended questions requiring the response to contain at least one valid answer, single-answer MCQs requiring exact option matching, and multi-answer MCQs requiring all valid answers to be identified.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 achieved highest overall accuracy at 63.1%, outperforming Arabic-centric models
- All models showed significant performance decline on region-specific questions compared to general cultural questions
- Multi-answer questions proved most challenging, with models struggling to identify all valid responses
- Models performed better on questions with predefined answer choices versus open-ended formats

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Constrained output formats improve cultural evaluation accuracy by narrowing the response space and reducing ambiguity.
- Mechanism: Single-answer and multiple-choice formats provide explicit candidate answers, allowing models to leverage recognition memory rather than free-form recall. This reduces the burden on generative cultural knowledge and mitigates context interpretation errors.
- Core assumption: The accuracy improvement reflects reduced task complexity rather than deeper cultural understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "all models experience significant performance declines when faced with highly specialized or region-specific questions, particularly those requiring multiple correct responses"
  - [section 5.2] "LLMs generally perform better when provided with predefined answer choices, rather than when tasked with generating open-ended responses"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support; neighboring papers focus on benchmark design rather than format effects.
- Break condition: If open-ended performance equals or exceeds constrained formats, format-based simplification is not the driver.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: General cultural knowledge is more prevalent in LLM training corpora than fine-grained regional knowledge, creating systematic performance disparities across geographic contexts.
- Mechanism: Training data over-represents widely-documented cultural elements (national holidays, major cities, broadly-known traditions) while under-representing localized practices, dialects, and region-specific customs. Models retrieve generalized patterns more reliably than niche regional details.
- Core assumption: Performance gaps reflect training data distribution rather than architectural limitations in cultural reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "all models experience significant performance declines when faced with highly specialized or region-specific questions"
  - [section 5.1] "all models demonstrate notably better performance [on general questions] compared to their region-specific results"
  - [corpus] FarsEval-PKBETS and similar benchmarks confirm evaluation gaps in underrepresented languages/cultures, supporting the data scarcity hypothesis.
- Break condition: If models fine-tuned on regional data still show no improvement, architectural capacity limits may be the constraint.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-answer questions expose gaps in comprehensive cultural knowledge retrieval, requiring models to recognize all valid responses rather than selecting a single best answer.
- Mechanism: Open-ended and multi-answer formats require exhaustive recall and contextual integration, whereas single-answer formats allow satisficing on the most probable response. Models default to high-probability associations, missing less salient but correct alternatives.
- Core assumption: Multi-answer difficulty reflects incomplete knowledge representation, not just output formatting issues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "all models struggle with region-specific and multi-answer questions"
  - [table 3] Multi-answer accuracy drops substantially across all models (e.g., GPT-4: 77% West → 20% North)
  - [corpus] XCR-Bench addresses cultural reasoning complexity but does not specifically validate multi-answer mechanisms.
- Break condition: If providing explicit "select all that apply" instructions normalizes multi-answer performance to single-answer levels, the mechanism is primarily task framing rather than knowledge gaps.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Cultural Benchmark Design** — Structured datasets with regionally-annotated questions, multiple response formats, and verified ground truth.
  - Why needed here: SaudiCulture introduces regional granularity and question complexity as evaluation dimensions; understanding benchmark architecture is prerequisite to interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the "general" question category is methodologically distinct from regional categories?

- Concept: **Training Data Bias in LLMs** — Systematic over-representation of dominant cultures/languages in pre-training corpora.
  - Why needed here: Performance disparities between Western multilingual models (GPT-4, Llama) and Arabic-centric models (Jais, FANAR, AceGPT) may reflect training data composition rather than architectural differences.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model trained primarily on English data still outperform Arabic-native models on Arabic cultural questions?

- Concept: **Evaluation Metrics for Cultural Competence** — Accuracy, regional coverage, question type stratification.
  - Why needed here: The paper reports accuracy across regions, categories, and formats; interpreting these requires understanding how accuracy is computed for open-ended vs. constrained formats.
  - Quick check question: How should accuracy calculation differ between single-answer and multi-answer multiple-choice questions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset Layer (441 questions across 5 regions + general, 8 cultural domains, 3 format types) -> Evaluation Layer (accuracy metric with format-specific scoring) -> Model Layer (5 LLMs: GPT-4, Llama 3.3, FANAR, Jais, AceGPT) -> Validation Layer (multi-stage: Saudipedia verification, peer review, regional expert feedback, PhD-level linguistic review)

- Critical path: Question curation → Regional/categorical annotation → Format assignment → Expert validation → Model prompting → Response evaluation → Accuracy computation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Breadth vs. depth**: 441 questions provides coverage across 5 regions and 8 categories, but may lack exhaustive coverage within each cell
  - **Format diversity vs. comparability**: Three format types enable nuanced evaluation but complicate cross-format comparisons
  - **Static vs. dynamic culture**: Dataset captures culture at collection time; evolving practices not represented (acknowledged in limitations)

- Failure signatures:
  - **Over-generalization**: Models default to pan-Arab or Gulf-region answers (e.g., "Ghabqa" for western Saudi pre-Ramadan gatherings instead of region-specific "Shabna")
  - **Dialect conflation**: Confusion between Modern Standard Arabic responses and regional dialectal terminology
  - **Western-centric priors**: Models interpret gestures through non-Saudi cultural frames (e.g., interpreting shemagh-throwing as "disrespect" rather than requesting a favor)
  - **Multi-answer incompleteness**: Models identify one correct region but miss additional valid answers

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline evaluation on SaudiCulture**: Run all 5 models on the full benchmark, stratify results by region, category, and format to replicate paper findings and establish internal baselines.
  2. **Ablation by question type**: Isolate open-ended vs. constrained performance to quantify format effects; test if providing exemplar answers improves open-ended accuracy.
  3. **Regional fine-tuning pilot**: Fine-tune a smaller model (e.g., Llama 3.3) on region-specific cultural data (North or South regions showing weakest performance) and measure improvement vs. baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset unavailability: The complete SaudiCulture dataset is not publicly released, preventing independent validation of results
- Evaluation protocol underspecification: Open-ended question scoring criteria are unclear, making it difficult to reproduce the exact evaluation methodology
- Limited cultural coverage: The dataset may not capture the full diversity of Saudi cultural practices, particularly those that have evolved recently

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The general finding that LLMs struggle with region-specific and multi-answer cultural questions is well-supported by the experimental design and aligns with broader literature on cultural knowledge gaps in LLMs.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that constrained formats improve accuracy by reducing task complexity is plausible but requires additional validation, as the paper doesn't directly compare performance when multi-answer questions are presented with explicit "select all that apply" instructions.
- **Medium confidence**: The performance disparities between general and region-specific questions likely reflect training data distribution biases, though the paper doesn't provide direct evidence about the training corpora of the evaluated models.

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset accessibility validation**: Request the complete SaudiCulture dataset from authors or reconstruct it through systematic sampling of Saudipedia with native speaker validation, then replicate the evaluation pipeline to verify the reported accuracy figures across all models.

2. **Format effect isolation experiment**: Conduct controlled comparisons where identical questions are presented in both open-ended and constrained formats, measuring whether format changes alone account for the performance differences or if they reflect genuine knowledge gaps.

3. **Regional fine-tuning validation**: Implement a targeted fine-tuning experiment using the weakest-performing regional subset (North or South) to determine whether performance improvements are achievable through domain adaptation, thereby distinguishing between training data limitations and architectural constraints.
