# Quantum Bayesian Optimization for Quality Improvement in Fuselage Assembly

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22090
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22090
- Authors: Jiayu Liu; Chong Liu; Trevor Rhone; Yinan Wang
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) with quantum Monte Carlo estimation achieves lower mean absolute error and faster convergence than classical Bayesian Optimization in fuselage assembly optimization under measurement noise.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) for quality improvement in aerospace fuselage assembly, addressing the challenge of minimizing dimensional gaps between sections through optimal actuator force placement. The method leverages quantum algorithms to achieve sample-efficient optimization by using Quantum Monte Carlo estimation to reduce the number of queries needed for accurate mean response estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that QBO consistently achieves lower mean absolute error (MAE) values compared to classical Bayesian Optimization across different noise levels and initial conditions, with significant sample efficiency advantages.

## Method Summary
The method employs a weighted Gaussian Process (WGP) surrogate model with an RBF kernel to predict shape deviations from actuator forces. QBO uses Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) estimation to compute mean responses with fewer oracle queries than classical methods, leveraging quantum superposition. The algorithm employs an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function to balance exploration and exploitation, selecting force combinations that maximize μ̃ + βσ̃. Random Fourier Features (R=1024) approximate the kernel matrix to maintain computational tractability as the number of iterations grows. The optimization iteratively updates the WGP posterior and uses QMC-estimated mean deviations to guide force selection, ultimately minimizing dimensional gaps in fuselage assembly.

## Key Results
- QBO consistently achieved lower mean absolute error (MAE) values compared to classical Bayesian Optimization across 10 different initial conditions
- With 8 actuators, QBO stabilized performance after approximately 400 iterations while classical BO continued to increase in cumulative regret
- QBO demonstrated significant sample efficiency advantages, requiring fewer iterations to reach optimal solutions while maintaining comparable or better optimization results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) estimation achieves equivalent mean response accuracy with fewer oracle queries than classical Monte Carlo, enabling sample-efficient optimization.
- **Mechanism:** QMC leverages quantum superposition to estimate E[y] from a distribution with query complexity O(1/ε) versus classical Chebyshev-bound requirement of O(σ²/ε²). The quantum oracle encodes shape deviations as probability amplitudes, allowing parallel evaluation of candidate states.
- **Core assumption:** A quantum oracle can be constructed that faithfully encodes the manufacturing response distribution (from FEA or surrogate models), and the quantum hardware can execute the estimation circuit with sufficient fidelity.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "quantum algorithms can achieve the same level of estimation accuracy with significantly fewer samples than the classical Monte Carlo method"
  - [section 3.3.3] Lemma 1 provides theoretical query bounds: QMC requires at most C₁/ε log(1/δ) queries vs classical k=O(σ²/ε²)
  - [corpus] Related work on quantum estimation exists (QCardEst, Bayesian shadow tomography) but in different domains; no direct corpus validation for manufacturing applications.
- **Break condition:** If quantum oracle construction requires O(N) classical preprocessing per query (negating speedup), or if hardware noise exceeds the measurement noise the method aims to overcome.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The weighted Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function strategically balances exploration of uncertain force configurations against exploitation of known high-performing configurations.
- **Mechanism:** UCB selects next force combination F_s = argmax[μ̃_{s-1}(F) + β_s σ̃_{s-1}(F)], where β controls exploration-exploitation. The weighted formulation assigns higher influence to samples with lower uncertainty via diagonal weight matrix W_s = diag(1/σ²₁, ..., 1/σ²_s).
- **Core assumption:** The objective function lies in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) with bounded norm, and the RBF kernel appropriately captures the smoothness of the force-to-deviation mapping.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "QBO employs an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function to strategically select input values that are most likely to maximize the objective function"
  - [section 3.3.4] Eq. (8-9) define weighted posterior updates; cumulative regret upper bound of O(poly log T) is theoretically proven (Dai et al., 2023)
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; related quantum-RL work uses different acquisition strategies.
- **Break condition:** If the kernel hyperparameter (length-scale l) is misspecified for the actual force-response geometry, causing either over-exploration or premature convergence.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Random Fourier Features (RFF) approximation enables tractable posterior updates by reducing kernel matrix inversion from O(T³) to operations in O(R) where R ≪ T.
- **Mechanism:** Bochner's theorem constructs feature mapping φ: R^D → R^R approximating K(x,x') ≈ φ^T(x)φ(x'). With R=1024 features, the algorithm maintains constant-time posterior variance updates regardless of iteration count T.
- **Core assumption:** 1024 Fourier features provide sufficient approximation fidelity for the RBF kernel over the 8-dimensional actuator force space.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.3.4] "The number of RFF (R) is set as 1024" with derivation from Bochner's theorem
  - [section 4.3.2] Experiments with 8 continuous actuators show stable performance after ~400 iterations without computational scaling issues
  - [corpus] No corpus validation for RFF in quantum optimization contexts.
- **Break condition:** If approximation error from finite RFF introduces systematic bias in acquisition function rankings, causing suboptimal force selection.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Gaussian Process Regression**
  - Why needed here: GP provides the surrogate model that predicts shape deviation from untested force configurations with quantified uncertainty.
  - Quick check question: Given 10 observed force-deviation pairs, can you compute the posterior mean and variance at a new force configuration using Eq. (1)?

- **Concept: Cumulative vs. Simple Regret**
  - Why needed here: The paper optimizes cumulative regret (sum of all suboptimality) rather than simple regret (final best), relevant when each query has real cost in manufacturing.
  - Quick check question: If optimal deviation is 0.05" and your algorithm queries [0.12", 0.08", 0.06", 0.055"], what is the cumulative regret?

- **Concept: Quantum Oracle Formulation**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how classical FEA responses map to quantum state amplitudes is essential for implementing QMC.
  - Quick check question: For a force configuration with 3 possible deviation outcomes {0.02", 0.04", 0.06"} with probabilities {0.5, 0.3, 0.2}, write the quantum oracle state |ψ⟩.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Environment (FEA/surrogate) → Force input F → Displacement output U → MAE computation
  - Quantum Oracle O: |0⟩ → Σ_ω √P(ω)|ω⟩|y(ω)⟩ encoding deviation distribution
  - QMC Module: Queries oracle O(1/ε) times → returns mean estimate ŷ
  - Weighted GP: (F_s, ŷ_s) pairs → posterior μ̃, σ̃ → UCB acquisition → next F_{s+1}

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize with random force combination
  2. QMC estimates mean deviation with precision ε_s = σ̃/√λ
  3. UCB selects next force maximizing μ̃ + βσ̃
  4. Update weighted GP posterior
  5. Repeat until T queries exhausted

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Higher η (accuracy parameter): Fewer stages, larger per-stage regret, faster but coarser optimization
  - More RFF features (R): Better kernel approximation, higher memory/compute per update
  - Larger β: More exploration, slower convergence, better global optimum guarantee

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Cumulative regret continues rising after 1000+ iterations → check weight matrix conditioning or kernel hyperparameter
  - QBO underperforms classical BO in early iterations → expected behavior (wider exploration); verify convergence eventually occurs
  - MAE variance high across initial conditions → surrogate model may not capture shape diversity; consider enlarging training data

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Discrete 2-actuator validation:** Replicate Fig. 4 with 441 discrete force combinations; verify QBO cumulative regret stabilizes by ~2000 iterations while classical continues rising
  2. **Noise sensitivity test:** Run σ ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4} with 8 continuous actuators; plot iterations-to-convergence vs. noise level; expect quantum advantage to increase with noise
  3. **Ablation on RFF features:** Compare R ∈ {256, 512, 1024, 2048} on final MAE and per-iteration compute time; identify knee point where approximation error becomes negligible

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can complex physical constraints, specifically the Tsai-Wu failure criterion and residual stress limits, be integrated into the Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework to ensure actuator forces remain feasible?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states, "The current QBO does not account for complex physical constraints... Specifically, Tsai-Wu failure criterion... needs to be satisfied when applied forces."
- **Why unresolved:** The current acquisition function focuses solely on minimizing the dimensional gap (MAE) without penalizing or rejecting force configurations that might cause structural failure or damage to the composite material.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified QBO algorithm featuring a constrained acquisition function that successfully rejects infeasible solutions while maintaining the sample efficiency and regret bounds demonstrated in the unconstrained experiments.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the proposed framework maintain its sample efficiency advantage when deployed on actual Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware rather than classical simulators?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion notes, "Another important direction is to transfer the current simulator-based quantum optimization framework to a real quantum computer," acknowledging that all current experiments were performed on classical simulators.
- **Why unresolved:** Theoretical query complexity advantages (quadratic speedup) do not guarantee performance on current hardware, which suffers from decoherence, gate errors, and noise that could disrupt the Quantum Monte Carlo estimation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results from running the QBO algorithm on physical quantum processors (e.g., IBM Quantum) that demonstrate comparable or superior Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and convergence rates to the classical simulation results provided in the paper.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the accuracy of the QBO framework degrade when the linear surrogate model fails to capture non-linear structural behaviors inherent in complex composite materials?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper assumes a linear relationship between force and displacement ($Y_i = F_D \cdot U + \epsilon$) to build the environment and quantum oracle (Sec 4.2.1). However, the introduction notes composite materials have specific properties, and "real manufacturing conditions" involve uncertainties.
- **Why unresolved:** The Quantum Oracle encodes the probability distribution based on this linear approximation. If the physical system exhibits significant non-linearity not captured by the surrogate, the quantum mean estimation will optimize for an incorrect objective, potentially diverging from the true optimal force configuration.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A sensitivity analysis comparing QBO performance using the linear surrogate against a high-fidelity non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) ground truth, specifically in regimes known to induce non-linear material responses.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation on actual quantum hardware or real fuselage assembly data
- QMC oracle construction details from FEA/surrogate models are unspecified
- Hyperparameter sensitivity (β, λ, η) not thoroughly explored
- Corpus evidence for quantum optimization in manufacturing is absent

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The theoretical foundations of Quantum Monte Carlo estimation and Weighted Gaussian Process regression are well-established (Lemma 1 query bounds, Dai et al. 2023 regret analysis).
- **Medium confidence:** The integration of QMC with Bayesian Optimization in manufacturing context is novel; experimental results show consistent advantages but are limited to surrogate models without real quantum hardware validation.
- **Low confidence:** The scalability claims to 8+ actuators rely on computational experiments with 1024 RFF features; corpus lacks direct validation of this specific quantum optimization approach in aerospace manufacturing.

## Next Checks
1. **Hardware feasibility test:** Implement QMC oracle construction from surrogate model outputs and benchmark query efficiency on actual quantum processor vs classical simulator
2. **Real-world validation:** Apply QBO to physical fuselage assembly testbed with force actuators and laser scanning measurement to verify simulation-to-reality transfer
3. **Kernel sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary RBF kernel hyperparameters and RFF feature count to quantify impact on final MAE and computational scaling
