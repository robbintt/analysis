- We demonstrate how federated learning (FL) can advance machine learning (ML) in chemical engineering by enabling chemical companies to jointly train ML models without sharing proprietary data. Using two case studies, we show that FL can improve model accuracy and applicability: (1) for predicting infinite dilution activity coefficients in binary mixtures with graph neural networks, achieving a relative improvement in proximity to perfection (RIPtoP) of 62% (even data split) and 47% (uneven data split), and (2) for system identification of a distillation column using autoencoders, reducing prediction error by 91% compared to individual training. Our results indicate that FL models perform similarly to those trained on combined datasets while respecting data privacy, demonstrating strong potential for industrial applications in chemical engineering.

## Executive Summary
This perspective paper demonstrates how federated learning (FL) can enable chemical companies to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing proprietary data. Through two case studies—predicting infinite dilution activity coefficients using graph neural networks and system identification of a distillation column using autoencoders—the authors show FL can improve model accuracy while preserving data privacy. The results indicate FL models perform comparably to centralized training on combined datasets, suggesting strong potential for industrial applications in chemical engineering where data confidentiality is paramount.

## Method Summary
The paper employs two federated learning case studies to demonstrate FL's applicability in chemical engineering. Case Study I uses FedAvg and FedPer algorithms to train graph neural networks for predicting infinite dilution activity coefficients across 18,016 binary mixture samples distributed among 4 clients. Case Study II applies FedAvg to train autoencoders for system identification of a methanol-propanol distillation column, with 5 clients (4 with 192 trajectories each, 1 "target" client with 2 trajectories). Both studies use Flower 1.7 framework, with training conducted over 30 communication rounds for Case I and varying rounds for Case II, demonstrating that FL can achieve similar performance to centralized training while maintaining data privacy.

## Key Results
- FedAvg and FedPer GNN models achieved RIPtoP improvements of 62% (even data split) and 47% (uneven data split) for infinite dilution activity coefficient prediction
- Autoencoder FL models reduced prediction error by 91% compared to individually trained models for distillation column system identification
- FL models demonstrated performance comparable to centralized training on combined datasets while preserving data privacy
- The "target" client in Case II achieved accurate system identification using knowledge transferred from other clients through FL

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Neural networks that operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes. Why needed: Chemical compounds are naturally represented as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges. Quick check: Can the model distinguish between isomers with different connectivity?

- **Autoencoders:** Neural networks that learn compressed representations of input data through an encoder-decoder architecture. Why needed: For dimensionality reduction and feature extraction in system identification tasks. Quick check: Does the latent space capture meaningful dynamics of the distillation process?

- **Federated Learning (FL):** Machine learning approach where multiple clients collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. Why needed: Enables knowledge sharing across competing chemical companies while preserving proprietary data confidentiality. Quick check: Does the global model improve accuracy compared to individually trained client models?

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Loss function measuring average squared differences between predicted and actual values. Why needed: Standard metric for regression tasks in both case studies. Quick check: Does MSE decrease consistently across communication rounds?

- **Relative Improvement to Proximity of Perfection (RIPtoP):** Metric comparing model performance to a theoretical "perfect" model. Why needed: Provides interpretable measure of model quality relative to best possible performance. Quick check: Is RIPtoP consistently higher for FL models compared to individual client training?

- **FedAvg vs FedPer:** FedAvg aggregates all model parameters, while FedPer only shares specific layers (e.g., GNN layers) while keeping task-specific layers local. Why needed: FedPer enables more granular control over privacy and knowledge sharing. Quick check: Does FedPer achieve comparable performance to FedAvg while sharing fewer parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Clients -> FL Server (Flower) -> Model Aggregation -> Updated Global Model -> Clients

**Critical Path:** Data generation/simulation -> Client model training -> Parameter aggregation -> Global model update -> Performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** FedAvg offers simplicity and full parameter sharing but less privacy control, while FedPer provides granular privacy control by sharing only specific layers but may require more complex implementation and tuning.

**Failure Signatures:** Inconsistent RIPtoP scores across clients indicate poor model generalization; communication bottlenecks during parameter aggregation suggest scalability issues; divergence in client-specific metrics suggests data heterogeneity problems.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test FedAvg convergence with 2-4 clients on synthetic chemical data to establish baseline performance
2. Compare RIPtoP scores for FedAvg vs FedPer under varying data heterogeneity scenarios
3. Measure communication overhead and training time for both algorithms on a small-scale setup

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** What specific data characteristics and metrics are required to create open-source benchmarks that effectively compare federated learning (FL) approaches in chemical engineering?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.2 advocates creating open-source benchmarks to "facilitate establishing data characteristics and research needs relevant in the chemical industry."
- Why unresolved: Current research lacks standardized datasets that realistically simulate data distribution scenarios across different chemical companies, limiting the comparison of FL algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: The publication of a standardized benchmark dataset containing chemical or process data with predefined non-IID splits and evaluation metrics.

**Open Question 2:** How can federated learning frameworks be secured against adversarial attacks, such as model inversion or data poisoning, specifically at the chemical process scale?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.2 states that investigations of adversarial attacks are "lacking for FL setups, particularly at the process scale, and require further research."
- Why unresolved: While general FL security is studied, the specific vulnerabilities of chemical process models (e.g., distillation columns) to data privacy threats or bias introduction remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating the vulnerability of chemical process FL models to specific attacks, or a successful defense mechanism tailored to process data.

**Open Question 3:** How can game-theoretical approaches be adapted to determine fair incentives for chemical companies participating in FL collaborations with varying data contributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.2 notes that game theoretical approaches in FL are "restricted to a few competitors and have not been investigated for specific characteristics of the chemical industry."
- Why unresolved: Chemical companies are competitors with conflicting interests; current models do not address the specific trade-offs of cooperation versus competition in the chemical domain.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework or simulation that successfully quantifies data value and distributes rewards in a multi-company chemical FL scenario.

**Open Question 4:** Can FL provide accuracy improvements for system identification when client dynamics are highly heterogeneous or when using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.2.4 explicitly suggests future work should "investigate whether FL can also provide accuracy improvements for more heterogeneous dynamics" and test for PINNs.
- Why unresolved: The presented case study used data with similar dynamics (varying vapor flow rates), leaving the performance of FL on widely differing dynamic regimes or physics-constrained models unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing FL convergence and prediction accuracy on a dataset comprising processes with significantly different dynamic behaviors.

## Limitations
- The work relies heavily on synthetic data generation (Case II) rather than actual proprietary datasets from chemical companies
- Computational overhead of FL (communication rounds, parameter filtering) is not quantified against potential accuracy gains
- Proposed methods show strong privacy preservation but industrial relevance remains theoretical without demonstration on real-world deployment data

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** FL framework applicability to chemical engineering problems; basic implementation of FedAvg and FedPer is technically sound
- **Medium confidence:** RIPtoP metric validity and its interpretation; autoencoder performance improvements are reasonable but depend on specific process simulation assumptions
- **Low confidence:** Industrial scalability claims without real-world deployment data; generalization to other chemical processes beyond the two studied cases

## Next Checks
1. **Reimplement Case I with varying data splits:** Test RIPtoP sensitivity to different numbers of clients (2-10) and data distributions to validate robustness claims
2. **Benchmark communication costs:** Measure total training time and parameter transmission volume for FedAvg vs FedPer to quantify practical overhead
3. **Test on alternative datasets:** Apply the proposed GNN and autoencoder architectures to independent chemical engineering datasets (e.g., different property prediction tasks or process control problems) to assess generalizability
