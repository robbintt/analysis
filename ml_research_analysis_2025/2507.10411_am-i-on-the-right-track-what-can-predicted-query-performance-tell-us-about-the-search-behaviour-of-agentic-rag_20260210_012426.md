# Am I on the Right Track? What Can Predicted Query Performance Tell Us about the Search Behaviour of Agentic RAG

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10411
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10411
- Reference count: 40
- Explores using Query Performance Prediction (QPP) to analyze and potentially improve Agentic RAG systems

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the role of Query Performance Prediction (QPP) in Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, specifically examining Search-R1 and R1-Searcher architectures. The study analyzes how different retrieval configurations affect both answer quality and reasoning iterations. A key finding is that more effective retrievers lead to fewer reasoning iterations while improving answer quality. The research also demonstrates that QPP estimates of generated queries show positive correlation with final answer quality, suggesting QPP can serve as a useful signal in Agentic RAG systems. The authors emphasize the importance of the first retrieval iteration and propose that QPP could enhance the reasoning process in these systems.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted experiments on Agentic RAG systems (Search-R1 and R1-Searcher) to examine the relationship between retrieval effectiveness, reasoning iterations, and answer quality. They analyzed QPP estimates at different reasoning iterations and correlated these with final answer quality metrics. The study involved varying retrieval configurations and measuring their impact on both the number of iterations and F1 scores. The QPP methods were applied to generated queries to assess their predictive power for answer quality. The experiments were conducted on a single dataset, with the analysis focusing on post-hoc correlations between QPP estimates and answer outcomes.

## Key Results
- More effective retrievers result in fewer reasoning iterations and higher answer quality
- QPP estimates of generated queries show positive correlation with final answer quality
- The first retrieval iteration is particularly important for determining answer quality outcomes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of QPP in Agentic RAG stems from its ability to predict query performance before execution, allowing the system to make informed decisions about retrieval strategies. When QPP estimates are high, it indicates the generated query is likely to retrieve relevant documents, reducing the need for multiple reasoning iterations. Conversely, low QPP estimates signal potential retrieval issues, prompting the agent to reformulate queries. This predictive capability helps optimize the trade-off between computational cost (number of iterations) and answer quality, making the reasoning process more efficient.

## Foundational Learning
- **Query Performance Prediction (QPP)**: Predicting the effectiveness of a query before execution; needed to understand how to anticipate retrieval success and optimize reasoning paths
- **Agentic RAG**: RAG systems that can reason and make decisions about query generation and retrieval; needed to understand the context of autonomous decision-making in retrieval
- **Reasoning iterations**: Multiple cycles of query generation and retrieval in Agentic RAG; needed to analyze the efficiency of the reasoning process
- **Retrieval effectiveness**: The quality and relevance of documents retrieved; needed to measure the impact of different retrieval configurations
- **F1 score correlation**: Statistical measure of relationship between QPP and answer quality; needed to validate the predictive power of QPP
- **Closed-loop systems**: Systems where predictions influence future behavior; needed to understand potential applications of QPP in adaptive workflows

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Query Generator -> QPP Estimator -> Retriever -> Reranker -> Answer Generator -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The key flow is Query Generation → QPP Estimation → Retrieval → Answer Generation, with QPP potentially influencing subsequent query generation decisions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system balances between computational cost (fewer iterations) and answer quality (more iterations with better queries). Using QPP as a signal adds computational overhead but potentially reduces unnecessary iterations.

**Failure Signatures**: Low QPP estimates consistently across iterations indicate poor query formulation; high iteration counts with low answer quality suggest ineffective retrieval configurations; weak correlation between QPP and answer quality may indicate dataset or methodological issues.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Baseline evaluation of Search-R1/R1-Searcher without QPP signals to establish performance metrics
2. Correlation analysis between QPP estimates and answer quality across different reasoning iterations
3. Comparison of different retrieval configurations to measure impact on iteration count and answer quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can an adaptive Agentic RAG workflow that uses QPP estimates to dynamically decide whether to incorporate retrieved documents improve reasoning efficiency or final answer quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.3 states the authors leave "the exploration of an adaptive QPP based workflow for agentic RAG as future work," and Section 6 reiterates the goal of using QPP to inform the model if results are useful.
- Why unresolved: The current study only analyzes correlations between QPP and answer quality in a static, post-hoc manner; it does not implement a closed-loop system where QPP actively influences the reasoning path.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment comparing standard Agentic RAG against a modified version that skips or re-queries when QPP estimates fall below a certain threshold, measuring changes in F1 score and iteration count.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can QPP estimates serve as an effective auxiliary reward signal during the reinforcement learning training of Agentic RAG models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 suggests that "QPP estimates could serve as a reward signal during the training time to help the model learn to execute better queries," contrasting with current methods that only reward valid formatting.
- Why unresolved: Current training paradigms (like those for R1-Searcher) rely on outcome-based rewards or validity checks, not on intermediate signals of retrieval quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training a new model instance (e.g., Search-R1) with a reward function modified to include QPP scores, followed by an evaluation of the resulting model's query generation efficiency and answer accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does aggregating QPP scores across all reasoning iterations provide a stronger correlation with final answer quality than using only the first generated query?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.3 notes that the authors only considered the QPP estimate for the first query but hypothesize that "higher correlation may be observed with improved aggregation methods of the QPP estimates."
- Why unresolved: The paper limited its correlation analysis (RQ-3) to a single point in the reasoning chain (the first iteration), ignoring the cumulative effect of subsequent retrievals.
- What evidence would resolve it: A statistical analysis comparing the Spearman's $\rho$ correlation of the first-query QPP versus an aggregated metric (e.g., average or weighted sum) of QPP scores across all iterations against the final F1 score.

## Limitations
- Study focuses on Search-R1 and R1-Searcher architectures, limiting generalizability to other Agentic RAG implementations
- Experiments use a single dataset, which may not capture full variability of real-world query performance patterns
- QPP correlation with answer quality shows moderate coefficients, suggesting QPP alone may not be sufficient for reliable performance prediction

## Confidence
- **High**: Relationship between retriever effectiveness and iteration count aligns with established retrieval theory
- **Medium**: QPP correlation findings show the relationship exists but may be dataset-dependent
- **Low**: QPP's utility as a reasoning signal in Agentic RAG has limited experimental scope

## Next Checks
1. Test QPP correlation across multiple diverse datasets and domains to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate alternative QPP methods beyond those tested to determine if results hold
3. Conduct ablation studies removing QPP signals to measure their actual impact on final answer quality
