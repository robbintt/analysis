- Two novel pipelines automatically generate music videos from user-specified songs using deep learning models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two novel pipelines for automatically generating music videos from user-specified songs, leveraging off-the-shelf deep learning models. The first pipeline uses CLAP for audio analysis, extracting segment-wise and track-wide musical attributes, which are then translated into narrative scene descriptions by a reasoning LLM. The second pipeline employs a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to directly generate a coherent narrative from raw audio, bypassing explicit feature extraction. Both pipelines convert textual prompts into video clips using diffusion-based text-to-video models. A preliminary user evaluation with five participants assessed the narrative quality, visual coherence, and emotional alignment of the generated videos.

## Method Summary
The study proposes two pipelines for AI-generated music videos. Pipeline 1 uses CLAP for zero-shot audio labeling, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B for scene scripting, and mochi-1 for text-to-video generation. Pipeline 2 employs an unnamed LALM model that directly processes raw audio into narrative, followed by WAN 2.1 for video generation. Both approaches segment audio (randomly or rule-based), generate scene descriptions, create video clips, and concatenate them with audio overlay. The process runs on NVIDIA H100 (80GB VRAM) and includes a preliminary user evaluation measuring storytelling, visual impression, transitions, emotional consistency, and overall impression.

## Key Results
- CLAP-based pipeline achieved higher overall ratings (M = 2.93, SD = 1.01) compared to LALM-based pipeline (M = 2.64, SD = 0.89) in user evaluation
- Narrative concepts were well-received by participants, but visual consistency and character continuity need improvement
- Diffusion-based text-to-video models struggle with maintaining visual consistency across scenes, with each new clip often differing in style, motion, and color
- The study demonstrates potential of latent feature techniques and deep generative models for expanding music visualization beyond traditional approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) enables zero-shot extraction of semantic descriptors from audio without domain-specific training data.
- **Mechanism:** CLAP aligns audio signals and natural language in a joint embedding space, allowing classification against predefined musical attributes via similarity matching rather than explicit feature engineering.
- **Core assumption:** Musical qualities relevant to visual storytelling can be captured by a finite set of textual descriptors.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "experiment on how well latent feature-based techniques can analyse audio to detect musical qualities"; [section 2.1] "CLAP was trained on 128k audio-text pairs and evaluated on 16 downstream tasks spanning 8 different domains"
- **Break condition:** If CLAP's predefined class labels do not capture genre-specific or culturally diverse musical nuances, semantic alignment degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A reasoning-focused LLM can translate structured audio descriptors into coherent narrative scene scripts with temporal alignment to audio segments.
- **Mechanism:** The LLM receives segment-wise and track-level audio descriptors plus constraints and generates single-sentence scene descriptions structured for downstream video generation.
- **Core assumption:** Natural language provides a sufficiently expressive medium to bridge audio semantics and visual concepts.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 2.3] "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B... combines the efficiency of a distilled model with the advanced reasoning capabilities"; [section 3.1.2] Prompt includes story cues, character specifications, technical constraints, and audio-based context placeholders
- **Break condition:** If scene descriptions become too abstract or lack visual specificity, text-to-video models produce incoherent output.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Diffusion-based text-to-video models can generate visually aligned clips from single-sentence prompts, though temporal and character consistency remain limited.
- **Mechanism:** Diffusion models iteratively denoise random noise toward target distributions conditioned on text prompts; video generation extends this with temporal dimensions but struggles with persistent identity across frames.
- **Core assumption:** One-sentence prompts provide sufficient conditioning for coherent clip generation.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 2.4] "outputs to be dependent on the concise wording of the input textual prompt"; [section 5.2] "text-to-video model often struggles to maintain visual consistency across scenes... Every new clip often differs from the one before in style, motion and colour"
- **Break condition:** When prompts require recurring characters or consistent visual style across segments, output coherence degrades significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- **Contrastive Learning (CLAP architecture):**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how audio-text alignment enables zero-shot classification without task-specific training.
  - Quick check question: Given an audio clip classified as "melodic piano" with similarity 0.72 and "upbeat tempo" with 0.65, which descriptor should inform the visual prompt and why?

- **Diffusion Model Conditioning:**
  - Why needed here: Text-to-video generation quality depends on prompt engineering and conditioning strength.
  - Quick check question: If a generated video shows distorted faces despite accurate scene composition, is this a conditioning problem or a model capacity limitation?

- **Audio Segmentation Strategies:**
  - Why needed here: Cut points directly affect narrative pacing and music-video alignment.
  - Quick check question: Why might beat-synchronized segmentation produce better results than random 4-8 second segments for a song with tempo variations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Audio Input → Segmentation (random or rule-based) → CLAP Analysis (segment-wise + track-level labels) OR LALM Direct Processing → LLM Script Generation (scene descriptions) → Text-to-Video (mochi-1 or WAN 2.1) → Video Assembly (concatenation + audio overlay)

- **Critical path:** CLAP label quality → LLM prompt construction → Text-to-video prompt specificity. Errors compound: imprecise audio labels yield weak scene descriptions, which yield inconsistent video output.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - CLAP vs. LALM: CLAP offers interpretability via explicit labels; LALM offers integrated understanding but less transparency.
  - Random vs. rule-based segmentation: Random is simpler; rule-based better matches musical structure but requires beat detection.
  - One-sentence constraint: Improves parseability for video models but limits narrative depth.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Character identity shifts between scenes (reported by evaluators)
  - Visual style inconsistency (color palette, lighting)
  - Generic "stock footage" aesthetic despite audio specificity
  - Survey scores: CLAP M=2.93/7, LALM M=2.64/7 overall rating

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on segmentation strategy:** Compare random vs. beat-synchronized vs. frequency-change-based segmentation on user ratings for visual-music alignment.
  2. **Label set sensitivity analysis:** Test whether expanded CLAP class labels (adding genre-specific descriptors) improve narrative coherence in LLM outputs.
  3. **Character consistency intervention:** Inject explicit visual character descriptions in every scene prompt; measure identity persistence across clips.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can visual and character identity be maintained across generated clips to support narrative continuity?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.3 states that "improving character consistency would have a positive impact on storytelling," and Section 5.2 notes that current models struggle to maintain facial features or clothing across scenes.
- **Why unresolved:** Current diffusion models treat each scene description independently, leading to "disjointedness" and visual inconsistencies that break the narrative thread.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified pipeline that injects consistent identity embeddings or reference images, validated by user evaluations showing significantly higher narrative coherence scores.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent does incorporating lyrical analysis improve the semantic alignment and narrative depth of generated videos?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.3 proposes that "incorporating lyrics into the prompt could deepen the LLM's understanding of the track's narrative" and lead to more accurate scene descriptions.
- **Why unresolved:** The current pipelines rely solely on instrumental cues or general audio features, leaving the specific narrative contribution of lyrics unutilized and untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative user study evaluating the "storytelling" and "emotional consistency" of videos generated with and without lyrical input for the same songs.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How do AI-generated music videos compare to professionally produced human videos in terms of storytelling and artistic value?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.3 suggests that "future work could also include comparisons to professionally produced or human-curated videos to better understand how generated content is judged relative to real-world storytelling standards."
- **Why unresolved:** The current evaluation is preliminary and isolated, lacking a baseline to determine if the AI output constitutes a "high-quality" or competitive artistic product.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A "Turing Test" style evaluation where participants rate the artistic merit of AI videos alongside human-produced videos without knowing the source.

## Limitations

- The study relies on a small convenience sample (5 participants) without demographic details or music expertise assessment, limiting generalizability of the user evaluation results.
- Character and visual consistency issues across clips were noted as significant limitations, but no technical solutions were tested beyond current diffusion model capabilities.
- The LALM model used in Pipeline 2 is not explicitly named, making exact replication difficult and raising questions about reproducibility.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The overall framework combining audio analysis with text-to-video generation is technically sound and builds on established CLAP and diffusion model architectures.
- **Medium Confidence:** The comparative results between CLAP and LALM pipelines (M=2.93 vs M=2.64) are statistically weak due to the small sample size but show a meaningful directional trend.
- **Low Confidence:** Specific technical details for faithful reproduction are missing, including exact CLAP label sets, LALM model specifications, and video generation hyperparameters.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the user evaluation with 30+ participants stratified by music familiarity and demographics to assess statistical significance of the CLAP vs LALM performance gap.
2. Implement beat-synchronized audio segmentation and compare against random segmentation on narrative coherence metrics measured by automated video content analysis.
3. Test character consistency interventions by injecting explicit visual character descriptions in every scene prompt and measuring identity persistence across clips using face recognition algorithms.
