# Tactical Decision for Multi-UGV Confrontation with a Vision-Language Model-Based Commander

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.11079
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11079
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: Vision-language model-based commander achieves >80% win rate in simulated UGV confrontations through unified perception-to-decision process

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses autonomous tactical decision-making for multi-agent UGV confrontations, where traditional rule-based and reinforcement learning methods fall short in interpretability and adaptability. The authors propose a vision-language model-based commander that integrates a vision-language model (VLM) for situational understanding and a lightweight large language model (LLM) for strategic reasoning, enabling a full-chain perception-to-decision process within a shared semantic space. An expert system is introduced during training to ensure semantic alignment and guide the LLM. Experiments in simulated UGV confrontations show the proposed method achieves over 80% win rate, improves perception accuracy and recall compared to VLM-only baselines, and reduces decision time by approximately 25%. Ablation studies confirm the importance of the expert system and the synergy between VLM and LLM modules. The approach demonstrates strong adaptability, interpretability, and robustness in increasingly complex multi-agent scenarios.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage hierarchical architecture: a VLM (QWEN2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) processes bird's-eye view images to generate hierarchical semantic descriptions at unit, local, and regional levels, while a lightweight LLM (QWEN2.5-3B-Instruct) reasons about these descriptions to produce tactical commands. Training uses an expert system to generate high-quality labels for two-stage LoRA fine-tuning of the VLM (visual encoder then cross-modal layers) and supervised fine-tuning followed by DPO alignment for the LLM. The expert system computes threat scores, danger values, and attack costs using defined formulas and priority rules to ensure semantic alignment between perception and decision modules.

## Key Results
- Achieves >80% win rate in 5v5 UGV confrontations
- Reduces average decision time by approximately 25% compared to VLM-only baselines
- Improves perception precision and recall while maintaining stability in dense agent scenarios (up to 9v9)
- Ablation studies confirm critical role of expert system in training stability and performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Separating perception (VLM) from reasoning (lightweight LLM) improves both perceptual accuracy and decision speed compared to monolithic approaches.
- Mechanism: Task decomposition reduces cognitive load on each component—the VLM no longer generates long tactical outputs, allowing focused scene understanding, while the lightweight LLM operates on clean semantic abstractions rather than raw visual features.
- Core assumption: Semantic representations can serve as lossless intermediaries between visual perception and symbolic reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Abstract] "achieves unified perception and decision within a shared semantic space"
  - [Section 4.2] "our model reduced the average decision time by approximately 25%... the perception module of our model achieves higher precision and recall"
  - [Corpus] Weak corpus support; neighbor papers focus on hierarchical RL or rule-based systems, not VLM-LLM separation
- Break condition: If semantic representations lose critical spatial/temporal information needed for tactical decisions, the lightweight LLM will make strategic errors despite accurate perception.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Expert-system-generated training labels align VLM and LLM semantic spaces and improve decision stability.
- Mechanism: Rule-based expert systems provide structured, consistent tactical decisions that serve as high-quality supervision for LoRA fine-tuning and DPO alignment, teaching the models the mapping from visual scenes → semantic representations → tactical commands.
- Core assumption: The expert system's heuristic rules capture sufficient tactical knowledge to bootstrap learning; domain gap between expert rules and optimal strategies is bridgeable through generalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Abstract] "An expert system provides high-quality training labels and ensures semantic alignment"
  - [Section 3.3] "the expert system systematically processes the perceptual data by computing two essential metrics, namely the threat score for enemies and the danger value for allies"
  - [Section 4.3] "the high–quality reasoning chain supervision and preference optimization provided by the expert system are important factors in enhancing the stability"
  - [Corpus] Neighbor paper "Rule-Based Conflict-Free Decision Framework" validates rule-based approaches but highlights jitter/deadlock problems in dynamic scenarios
- Break condition: If expert system rules are too brittle or incomplete for novel tactical situations, the trained model will inherit these limitations and fail to generalize beyond the rule distribution.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical semantic abstraction (unit-level, local-level, region-level) enables scalable reasoning and tactical generalization.
- Mechanism: Multi-scale representations compress the battlefield state into interpretable chunks that match LLM reasoning patterns—unit states for individual assignments, local interactions for short-range coordination, regional summaries for strategic planning.
- Core assumption: LLMs trained on natural language have inherent capabilities for spatial reasoning and tactical planning that activate when given structured scene descriptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.2] "The output semantic space S is organized into three hierarchical levels of abstraction... unit–level grounding, local–level interaction, and region–level summaries"
  - [Section 4.2] "the LLM can tolerate such noise and make reasonable decisions relying on geometric relationships and visibility constraints"
  - [Section 4.3] "As the density of agents increases, the perception accuracy of a single VLM decreases, while the perceptron in our method always maintains an accuracy of around 75%"
  - [Corpus] Limited corpus validation; neighbor "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Low-Level MPC" shows hierarchical decomposition benefits in control but different architecture
- Break condition: If agent density exceeds the semantic representation's compression capacity (e.g., >10 agents per region), regional summaries become ambiguous and tactical decisions degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**
  - Why needed here: Forms the perception front-end that converts battlefield images into semantic descriptions. Understanding that VLMs fuse visual encoders with language decoders explains why they can output structured text from images but may hallucinate or mislocalize.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a VLM might correctly identify "3 enemy units in the northeast" but give inaccurate coordinates?

- Concept: **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses two-stage LoRA to adapt pretrained models. Understanding parameter-efficient fine-tuning explains why the authors can train domain-specific perception without full model retraining.
  - Quick check question: What gets updated during LoRA stage 1 (visual encoder) vs. stage 2 (cross-modal layers)?

- Concept: **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
  - Why needed here: Aligns the LLM planner with expert strategic priors after supervised fine-tuning. Understanding DPO explains how the model learns to prefer expert-endorsed tactical decisions over alternatives.
  - Quick check question: How does DPO differ from reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) in terms of reward model requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Perception Module: QWEN2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (fine-tuned) → Takes 30m×16m arena image → Outputs hierarchical semantic description (unit/local/region levels)
  - Decision Module: QWEN2.5-3B-Instruct (fine-tuned) → Takes semantic description → Outputs tactical commands with action types and waypoints
  - Expert System (training only): Rule-based threat/danger scoring → Generates training labels for LoRA + DPO
  - Motion Controller (downstream): Receives commands → Executes path planning (not detailed in paper)

- Critical path: Image → VLM semantic extraction → LLM tactical reasoning → Action commands → Motion controller
  - Latency bottleneck: Decision time ~15s (Table 2), dominated by VLM inference + LLM generation
  - Failure propagation: VLM localization errors → LLM receives wrong positions → Incorrect tactical assignments

- Design tradeoffs:
  - VLM-only vs. VLM+LLM: Monolithic faster to prototype but slower inference and worse scalability (Figure 6 shows sharp decision time growth)
  - 7B VLM + 3B LLM vs. larger models: Chosen for computational efficiency; paper doesn't test larger models
  - Expert system vs. human labels: Expert system scales to generate thousands of training samples but may propagate rule biases
  - Assumption: Paper uses bird's-eye view; real-world deployment would need different visual input processing

- Failure signatures:
  - **Dense clustering hallucinations**: "localization errors occur when multiple agents are clustered, especially when positioned behind obstacles" (Section 4.2)
  - **Expert rule brittleness**: Ablation shows performance drop without expert training, suggesting dependency on rule quality
  - **Scale transition gaps**: Model trained 5v5, tested 7v7 and 9v9 with some degradation; extrapolation to 20v20 unknown

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Perception validation test**: Feed the VLM module synthetic battlefield images with known ground truth positions; measure localization error vs. agent density to establish hallucination baseline before connecting to LLM.
  2. **Expert system ablation**: Train model variants with (a) full expert labels, (b) random action labels, (c) no tactical training; compare win rates to quantify label quality contribution.
  3. **Scalability stress test**: Run 5v5, 7v7, 9v9, and 12v12 confrontations; plot decision time and perception accuracy curves to identify the agent count where performance degrades nonlinearly.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the perception module be stabilized to prevent hallucinations and positioning errors in dense multi-agent environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that "in dense scenarios, the perception module may experience positioning errors and hallucinations, and probably misguide the planner."
- Why unresolved: High agent density causes clustering and occlusion, which degrades the VLM's localization accuracy and semantic grounding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of sustained low hallucination rates and high precision in simulations with significantly increased agent density (e.g., >20 agents).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the system maintain robust decision-making when transitioning from global top-down inputs to local, partial observability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The methodology relies on a "top-mounted visual sensor" to generate a global map, a constraint that differs from the local views available on individual UGVs.
- Why unresolved: The model's strategic reasoning depends on global semantic summaries that may be unattainable with local, occluded sensors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful performance (e.g., win rate >70%) in simulations where input is restricted to first-person or local onboard camera views.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the LLM planner consistently generate strategies superior to the heuristic expert system used to train it?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The model is trained on labels from an expert system (Section 3.3), yet the authors suggest it may exhibit "tactical potential beyond those of expert systems."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the LLM generalizes effectively beyond the expert heuristics or if its success is strictly bounded by the quality of the training labels.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies showing the fine-tuned LLM defeating the raw expert system policy in a statistically significant majority of matches.

## Limitations
- Expert system rule quality directly determines model performance, but rules are not validated against human expert play or optimal strategies beyond simulated win rates
- Generalization beyond 9v9 confrontations is untested; scalability to 20v20 scenarios remains unknown given observed performance degradation at 9v9
- Semantic representation's capacity for handling dense agent clustering shows failure modes that could worsen in realistic environments

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Perception accuracy improvements over VLM-only baselines, decision time reduction (~25%), and expert system contribution to stability (supported by ablation studies and quantitative metrics)
- **Medium confidence**: Win rate claims (>80%) and adaptability across 5v5-9v9 scales, as these rely on simulated confrontations with fixed parameters that may not transfer to real-world variability
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to larger confrontations (>9v9 agents), performance under different visual inputs (non-bird's-eye view), and robustness to dynamic obstacle environments

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world transfer test**: Deploy the trained model on a physical UGV platform with overhead camera input in an indoor arena with similar parameters (5v5, obstacles) to verify simulation-to-reality transfer
2. **Dynamic obstacle validation**: Introduce moving obstacles into the confrontation simulation and measure win rate and decision stability compared to static-only scenarios
3. **Human expert comparison**: Have human tactical experts play 5v5 confrontations and compare their win rates and decision patterns against the model to validate whether the expert system rules capture optimal strategies
