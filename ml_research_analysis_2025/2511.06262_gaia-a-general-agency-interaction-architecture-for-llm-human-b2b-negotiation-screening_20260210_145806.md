core_contribution: GAIA is a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B
  screening and negotiation. It addresses the challenge of safe delegation by separating
  information-gathering from bargaining, gating negotiation with a task-completeness
  index (TCI), enforcing authorization boundaries with escalation triggers, and merging
  human and AI feedback under explicit precedence rules.

# GAIA: A General Agency Interaction Architecture for LLM-Human B2B Negotiation & Screening

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.06262
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06262
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Primary result:** A governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B screening and negotiation

## Executive Summary
GAIA introduces a structured protocol for delegating business negotiations to AI agents while preserving human oversight and safety. The architecture separates information-gathering from bargaining, enforces authorization boundaries via escalation triggers, and merges human and AI feedback under explicit precedence rules. It defines three roles—Principal, Delegate, and Counterparty—and uses a state machine with information gates to prevent premature commitments. GAIA's dual learning channels integrate AI critique and human oversight, while safety layers block binding language and policy violations. The framework offers a reproducible specification for auditable, efficient AI delegation across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.

## Method Summary
GAIA is a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B screening and negotiation. It addresses the challenge of safe delegation by separating information-gathering from bargaining, gating negotiation with a task-completeness index (TCI), enforcing authorization boundaries with escalation triggers, and merging human and AI feedback under explicit precedence rules. The protocol defines three roles—Principal, Delegate, and Counterparty—and a state machine with information gates to prevent premature commitments. GAIA's dual learning channels integrate AI critique and human oversight, while safety layers block binding language and policy violations. It offers a reproducible specification for auditable, efficient AI delegation across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.

## Key Results
- Introduces a governance-first protocol for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening
- Separates information-gathering from bargaining phases to prevent premature commitments
- Enforces authorization boundaries with escalation triggers and merges human/AI feedback under explicit precedence rules
- Defines a task-completeness index (TCI) to gate negotiation progress and ensure informed decision-making
- Integrates dual learning channels for continuous improvement and safety via AI critique and human oversight

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GAIA's design ensures safe delegation by structuring negotiation into distinct phases and enforcing human oversight at critical decision points. The separation of information-gathering from bargaining prevents agents from committing prematurely, while the TCI ensures negotiations only proceed when sufficient information is gathered. Escalation triggers and safety layers enforce authorization boundaries and block policy violations, maintaining control over binding commitments. The explicit precedence rules for human and AI feedback ensure transparency and accountability, while dual learning channels enable continuous improvement through integrated oversight.

## Foundational Learning
- **Task-Completeness Index (TCI):** Measures negotiation readiness to gate bargaining; needed to ensure informed decisions before commitments; quick check: verify TCI thresholds align with negotiation complexity.
- **Escalation Triggers:** Automatic handoffs to humans when thresholds are breached; needed to maintain human control over critical decisions; quick check: test trigger sensitivity under realistic scenarios.
- **Dual Learning Channels:** Integration of AI critique and human feedback; needed for continuous improvement and safety; quick check: evaluate learning loop effectiveness after each negotiation cycle.
- **Safety Layers:** Rules blocking binding language and policy violations; needed to prevent unauthorized commitments; quick check: simulate adversarial inputs to test safety robustness.
- **State Machine with Information Gates:** Controls negotiation flow to prevent premature commitments; needed for structured, auditable interactions; quick check: trace state transitions in sample negotiation workflows.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Principal <-> Delegate <-> Counterparty (mediated by TCI, escalation triggers, and safety layers)

**Critical Path:** Information-gathering → TCI validation → Bargaining → Escalation (if triggered) → Decision with human/AI feedback merge

**Design Tradeoffs:** Separation of phases ensures safety but may slow negotiations; explicit precedence rules ensure accountability but require clear human oversight; safety layers block risky language but may limit negotiation flexibility

**Failure Signatures:** Premature commitments, escalation trigger failures, safety layer bypasses, TCI threshold misconfigurations

**First Experiments:**
1. Simulate a procurement negotiation to test TCI gating and escalation triggers
2. Conduct adversarial testing of safety layers against binding language attempts
3. Pilot GAIA in a staffing negotiation to evaluate human-AI feedback integration and decision quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Claims rely on a single primary source with no external validation or comparative benchmarks
- No quantitative performance data or documented real-world deployments provided
- TCI mechanism and escalation triggers not tested for robustness against edge cases or adversarial inputs
- Safety layers blocking binding language are asserted but not demonstrated against diverse counterparty tactics

## Confidence

**Governance and safety architecture design:** High
**Task-completeness index and escalation logic:** Medium
**Practical effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios:** Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled simulations comparing GAIA's delegation efficiency and safety against baseline LLM negotiation systems
2. Perform adversarial testing to assess the robustness of escalation triggers and safety layers under realistic counterparty tactics
3. Pilot GAIA in at least one real-world B2B negotiation setting (e.g., procurement) and document outcomes, including decision quality and human-AI interaction patterns
