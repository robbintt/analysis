# OmniCam: Unified Multimodal Video Generation via Camera Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.02312
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02312
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with LPIPS: 0.167, PSNR: 22.14, FID: 24.26

## Executive Summary
OmniCam presents a unified multimodal framework for camera-controlled video generation that addresses limitations in existing methods by supporting diverse input modalities including text and video for trajectory guidance, and images and videos for content reference. The approach combines large language models for trajectory extraction, monocular 3D reconstruction using point clouds, and video diffusion models for high-quality video synthesis. To enable this capability, the authors introduce the OmniTr dataset, containing 1000 trajectory groups with long-sequence camera movements, videos, and descriptions. OmniCam achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics and outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual quality while supporting complex camera operations like rotation, zoom, and compound movements in arbitrary directions.

## Method Summary
OmniCam integrates large language models to extract camera trajectories from text/video inputs, employs monocular 3D reconstruction using point clouds for scene understanding, and leverages video diffusion models for high-quality video synthesis. The framework supports multimodal inputs where trajectory can be guided by text or video, while content can be referenced from images or videos. A novel OmniTr dataset was created containing 1000 trajectory groups with long-sequence camera movements, videos, and descriptions to train and evaluate the system. The pipeline combines these components to generate videos with precise camera control while maintaining high visual quality across diverse camera operations including rotation, zoom, and compound movements in arbitrary directions.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art LPIPS score of 0.167
- Attains PSNR of 22.14 and FID of 24.26
- Outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual quality across diverse camera operations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its unified approach to handling multiple input modalities through a coherent pipeline. By leveraging LLMs for trajectory extraction, the system can interpret natural language or video-based camera movement instructions with semantic understanding. The monocular 3D reconstruction provides geometric grounding for camera movements, while the video diffusion model ensures high-quality synthesis. This multimodal integration allows for flexible input combinations and precise camera control, addressing the limitations of single-modality approaches that restrict user input options.

## Foundational Learning
- **Monocular 3D reconstruction**: Reconstructing 3D scene geometry from single-view images using point clouds - needed for geometric grounding of camera movements, quick check: verify depth estimation accuracy across different scene complexities
- **Video diffusion models**: Generative models that learn to synthesize video sequences through denoising diffusion processes - needed for high-quality video generation, quick check: evaluate temporal consistency and visual fidelity
- **Large language models for trajectory extraction**: Using LLMs to interpret and extract camera movement trajectories from text/video inputs - needed for flexible multimodal trajectory guidance, quick check: test trajectory accuracy against ground truth camera paths
- **Multimodal fusion**: Integrating information from different input modalities (text, video, images) into a unified representation - needed for coherent video generation, quick check: validate consistency across different input combinations
- **Point cloud processing**: Handling and manipulating 3D point cloud data for scene reconstruction - needed for accurate 3D geometry representation, quick check: assess point cloud density and completeness
- **Camera trajectory modeling**: Representing and predicting camera movement paths through 3D space - needed for precise camera control, quick check: measure trajectory smoothness and accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: LLM Trajectory Extraction -> Monocular 3D Reconstruction -> Video Diffusion Model -> Output Video

Critical path: The pipeline flows from trajectory extraction through 3D reconstruction to video synthesis, with each component building on the previous stage's output.

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances flexibility in input modalities against computational complexity, choosing to integrate multiple sophisticated components rather than simplifying to single-modality approaches.

Failure signatures: Pipeline failures may manifest as inaccurate camera trajectories from LLM extraction, depth estimation errors in 3D reconstruction, or visual artifacts in video synthesis.

First experiments:
1. Test trajectory extraction accuracy by comparing LLM outputs against ground truth camera paths on sample video clips
2. Evaluate 3D reconstruction quality by measuring depth estimation errors on synthetic scenes with known geometry
3. Assess video synthesis quality by generating short clips from simple camera trajectories and evaluating visual fidelity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Monocular 3D reconstruction from point clouds may introduce depth estimation errors, particularly for complex scenes or rapid camera movements
- The OmniTr dataset contains only 1000 trajectory groups, potentially limiting generalizability to more diverse real-world scenarios
- Integration of multiple sophisticated components creates potential points of failure where errors could compound through the pipeline

## Confidence
- Quantitative performance claims (High): The reported metrics are specific and directly comparable to stated baselines, though independent reproduction would strengthen confidence
- Technical approach validity (Medium): The methodology is well-grounded but relies on assumptions about point cloud quality and LLM trajectory accuracy that may not hold universally
- Dataset generalizability (Low): The limited size and potential domain specificity of OmniTr raise questions about performance on broader video content

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of each component (LLM trajectory extraction, 3D reconstruction, video diffusion) to quantify their individual impacts on final performance
2. Test the framework on external datasets beyond OmniTr to evaluate robustness across different video domains and camera movement complexities
3. Analyze failure cases where the pipeline breaks down, particularly focusing on scenarios with rapid camera movements or complex 3D structures that may challenge monocular reconstruction accuracy
