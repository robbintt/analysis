# An Efficient Insect-inspired Approach for Visual Point-goal Navigation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.16806
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16806
- Authors: Lu Yihe; Barbara Webb
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces insect-inspired visual point-goal navigation model combining associative learning and path integration, demonstrating comparable performance to state-of-the-art models with significantly reduced computational cost and no pre-training required.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to visual point-goal navigation inspired by insect neural systems. The model integrates a mushroom body (MB) for visual learning and a central complex (CX) for path integration and motion planning. By leveraging biological principles, the architecture achieves competitive navigation performance while maintaining computational efficiency. The approach demonstrates the potential of bio-inspired methods in robotics and autonomous navigation tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines associative learning through a mushroom body-inspired module with path integration via a central complex-inspired component. The mushroom body learns to associate visual inputs with collision experiences, enabling predictive obstacle avoidance. The central complex handles motion planning and path integration, allowing the agent to maintain spatial awareness during navigation. The model operates in an online learning paradigm, continuously updating its knowledge base without requiring extensive pre-training. This dual-component architecture mimics insect navigation strategies while remaining computationally efficient for practical implementation.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated comparable performance to state-of-the-art visual navigation models in Habitat and iGibson simulators
- Achieved significant computational efficiency with reduced training/inference requirements
- Successfully implemented online learning capabilities enabling path optimization over repeated trials
- Validated selective memory consolidation mechanism preventing performance degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's effectiveness stems from its biologically-inspired architecture that separates visual learning from path integration. The mushroom body component creates associations between visual features and collision outcomes, allowing the system to predict potential obstacles before encountering them. This predictive capability enables proactive navigation adjustments rather than reactive responses. The central complex component maintains continuous path integration, providing the agent with an internal representation of its position and orientation relative to the goal. This separation of concerns mirrors the specialized neural structures found in insects, where different brain regions handle distinct navigational tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- Mushroom Body (MB) Function: Why needed - enables associative learning between visual inputs and outcomes; Quick check - verify visual-odor associations form correctly in simulated environments
- Central Complex (CX) Navigation: Why needed - provides spatial awareness and path integration capabilities; Quick check - validate distance and direction estimates against ground truth
- Associative Learning Mechanism: Why needed - creates predictive obstacle avoidance behavior; Quick check - measure prediction accuracy before actual collisions
- Path Integration: Why needed - maintains internal position tracking without external references; Quick check - assess drift accumulation over extended navigation sequences
- Selective Memory Consolidation: Why needed - prevents catastrophic forgetting while retaining relevant navigation experiences; Quick check - evaluate performance stability across learning iterations

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Visual Input -> Mushroom Body (MB) -> Central Complex (CX) -> Motion Planning -> Actuation

Critical Path:
The critical path flows from visual input through the MB for feature extraction and association learning, then to the CX for spatial reasoning and path integration, followed by motion planning decisions, and finally to actuation commands. This sequential processing ensures that learned visual associations inform the path integration process, which in turn guides motion planning decisions.

Design Tradeoffs:
The primary tradeoff involves computational efficiency versus model complexity. The insect-inspired architecture sacrifices some representational capacity compared to deep neural networks but gains significant efficiency advantages. The online learning approach eliminates pre-training requirements but may converge more slowly than pre-trained models. The selective memory consolidation balances between retaining useful navigation experiences and preventing interference from irrelevant information.

Failure Signatures:
Common failure modes include drift accumulation in path integration leading to goal misalignment, insufficient visual feature learning resulting in poor obstacle prediction, and memory consolidation errors causing performance degradation. The model may also struggle with environments containing dynamic obstacles or requiring long-term memory of complex spatial relationships.

First Experiments:
1. Test basic path integration accuracy in simple environments with known geometries
2. Evaluate visual learning performance with static obstacle configurations
3. Assess online learning capabilities through repeated navigation trials in consistent environments
