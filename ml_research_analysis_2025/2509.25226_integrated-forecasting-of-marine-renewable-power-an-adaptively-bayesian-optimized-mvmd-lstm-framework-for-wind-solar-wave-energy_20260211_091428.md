# Integrated Forecasting of Marine Renewable Power: An Adaptively Bayesian-Optimized MVMD-LSTM Framework for Wind-Solar-Wave Energy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25226
- Reference count: 40
- Proposes Bayesian-optimized MVMD-LSTM framework achieving 1.75% MAPE for integrated wind-solar-wave power forecasting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel forecasting framework for integrated wind-solar-wave power generation on offshore platforms. The method combines Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, enhanced by Bayesian optimization for automatic parameter tuning. By jointly decomposing multi-channel power sequences, the approach preserves cross-source couplings while breaking down nonstationary signals into simpler components. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods, achieving approximately 25% lower MAPE than VMD-LSTM with 1.75% average MAPE, 1.72 RMSE, and 1.16 MAE on real offshore data from China.

## Method Summary
The framework employs MVMD to jointly decompose wind, solar, and wave power time series into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), preserving cross-source couplings. Bayesian optimization automatically determines optimal decomposition parameters (number of modes K and penalty parameter α) by modeling validation MAPE with a Gaussian process surrogate. Individual LSTM networks then model each IMF, with predictions aggregated to reconstruct the full power forecast. The system uses 5-minute-ahead forecasting with historical data from t-6 to t, employing 32 hidden neurons, batch size 64, Adam optimizer, and 100 training epochs per LSTM.

## Key Results
- Achieves average MAPE of 1.75%, RMSE of 1.72, and MAE of 1.16 on real offshore data
- Outperforms benchmark models (SVR, ANN, RF, CNN, ResNet, LSTM, VMD-LSTM) by approximately 25% lower MAPE
- Demonstrates superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and automation compared to existing approaches
- Validated on Wanshan Island offshore integrated energy platform in China

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Jointly decomposing wind, solar, and wave power sequences preserves cross-source couplings that separate decomposition loses. MVMD simultaneously processes multiple correlated variables during decomposition, enforcing aligned center frequencies across channels. This captures interactions where, for example, wind turbulence affects wave patterns with lag, which univariate VMD would miss. Core assumption: The three energy sources exhibit meaningful temporal couplings and complementary patterns that jointly modeling will exploit.

### Mechanism 2
Bayesian optimization adaptively selects decomposition parameters (K, α) better than manual or grid-search tuning. A Gaussian process surrogate models the validation MAPE as a function of (K, α). Expected Improvement acquisition balances exploration vs. exploitation, iteratively proposing parameter combinations until convergence. This avoids local optima from grid search. Core assumption: Optimal decomposition parameters are data-dependent and cannot be fixed a priori across seasons or locations.

### Mechanism 3
Decomposing nonstationary power signals into simpler IMFs before LSTM prediction improves forecasting accuracy. MVMD splits complex signals into narrowband IMFs with distinct frequency characteristics. Each IMF has lower sample entropy and nonstationarity than the original, making temporal patterns easier for LSTM to learn. Predictions are aggregated to reconstruct the full signal. Core assumption: Subsequences from decomposition are more predictable than the original signal; aggregation preserves accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)**
  - Why needed here: MVMD extends VMD to multivariate signals. You must understand how VMD iteratively extracts narrowband modes via bandwidth minimization before grasping the multi-channel extension.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why VMD uses an augmented Lagrangian and ADMM rather than direct filtering?

- **Concept: LSTM Gate Dynamics**
  - Why needed here: LSTM processes each IMF sequence. Understanding how forget/input/output gates control temporal memory is essential for debugging why certain IMFs are learned faster.
  - Quick check question: Given a high-frequency IMF, would you expect the forget gate to retain or discard long-term state?

- **Concept: Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes**
  - Why needed here: This automates (K, α) selection. You need to understand surrogate modeling and acquisition functions to diagnose slow convergence or poor exploration.
  - Quick check question: If Expected Improvement keeps exploring without exploiting, what acquisition parameter or GP kernel might be misconfigured?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Historical power data (t-6 to t) -> MVMD Module -> K IMFs per channel -> Bayesian Optimizer (tunes K, α) -> LSTM Subnetworks (one per IMF) -> Aggregation Layer -> Final forecast

- **Critical path:** Data quality -> MVMD decomposition quality -> Bayesian parameter search convergence -> LSTM per-IMF training -> aggregation accuracy

- **Design tradeoffs:** More modes (K) -> finer decomposition but more LSTM models to train and aggregate; Higher penalty (α) -> narrower bandwidth but risk of over-smoothing transients; Bayesian iterations vs. computational budget

- **Failure signatures:** Mode mixing (adjacent IMFs share similar frequencies) -> check if K is too low or α mis-tuned; Optimization stalling (Bayesian search keeps evaluating similar parameters) -> acquisition may be too exploitative; widen search space; Aggregate prediction lag (summed IMF predictions systematically under/over-shoot) -> verify reconstruction constraint in MVMD is satisfied

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce baseline comparison: Run MVMD-LSTM vs. single-model LSTM vs. VMD-LSTM on Wanshan Island dataset; confirm ~25% MAPE reduction. 2) Ablate Bayesian optimization: Fix (K, α) to common values (e.g., K=5, α=2000) and compare MAPE against adaptively tuned run; quantify automation value. 3) Test transferability: Apply optimized (K, α) to different month's data (e.g., train on May, test on August); assess if parameters generalize or require re-optimization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on single offshore platform in China, raising generalizability concerns
- No ablation studies isolating contributions of MVMD versus Bayesian optimization versus LSTM modeling
- Computational cost of Bayesian optimization iterations and number of IMFs not reported
- Assumes exploitable cross-couplings between wind, solar, and wave power at ultra-short timescales

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** MVMD-LSTM architecture is correctly implemented; LSTM per-IMF modeling is standard practice
- **Medium Confidence:** Bayesian optimization effectively tunes MVMD parameters; 25% MAPE improvement is statistically significant but context-dependent
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability to other locations/seasons; robustness under missing or noisy data; computational efficiency for real-time deployment

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Location Transferability:** Apply optimized (K, α) from Wanshan Island dataset to another offshore platform with different meteorological characteristics. Measure MAPE degradation to quantify robustness.

2. **Ablation of MVMD vs. Bayesian:** Run two ablations—(a) fix MVMD parameters (K=5, α=2000) and only tune LSTM; (b) use Bayesian optimization for all components. Compare MAPE to isolate value of MVMD joint decomposition.

3. **Robustness to Data Quality:** Inject realistic noise or simulate missing values in input time series. Assess how forecast accuracy degrades and whether model can recover with data imputation or adaptive parameter re-tuning.
