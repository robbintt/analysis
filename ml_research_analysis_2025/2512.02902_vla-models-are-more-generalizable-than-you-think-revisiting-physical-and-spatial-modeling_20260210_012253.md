## Executive Summary
This paper re-examines why VLA models fail under novel viewpoints, identifying the root cause as misalignment in spatial representations rather than in physical reasoning. To address this, the authors propose a lightweight one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual tokens via global affine modulation (FTM) or low-rank linear updates to the ViT encoder (FLA). On the Libero-V benchmark, FTM boosts viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters, while FLA achieves 90.8% accuracy with 4.7M parameters—matching LoRA-scale fine-tuning at 99× lower parameter cost. These results demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation can efficiently unlock the latent robustness of pretrained VLA models without extensive retraining.

## Method Summary
The authors diagnose VLA viewpoint brittleness as stemming from spatial representation misalignment rather than physical reasoning failure. They propose two lightweight adaptation methods: FTM (Global Affine Modulation) applies learnable γ, β scaling/shift to visual tokens post-encoder, and FLA (Feature Linear Adaptation) injects low-rank LoRA updates into the ViT's linear layers. Both methods require only a single human demonstration per task for adaptation. FTM uses 4K parameters with 5000 training steps, while FLA uses 4.7M parameters with 1500 steps. The methods are evaluated on Libero-V benchmark with four perturbation types (camera viewpoint, lighting, texture, noise).

## Key Results
- FTM improves viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters
- FLA achieves 90.8% success rate with 4.7M parameters, matching LoRA-scale fine-tuning
- Both methods require only single human demonstration per task for adaptation
- Performance gains demonstrate spatial misalignment is primary failure mode

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spatial-Physical Decomposition Hypothesis
The VLA decomposes into (1) Spatial Modeling (visual encoder constructing object positions, orientations, occlusions) and (2) Physical Modeling (VLM + action expert for reasoning/control). Viewpoint shifts distort spatial embeddings fed to an otherwise competent policy. The physical modeling module remains functionally capable under viewpoint shifts—it only receives misaligned inputs.

### Mechanism 2: Affine Token Recalibration (FTM)
Global affine transformation on visual tokens is sufficient to partially realign the embedding manifold. FTM applies F̂ = (1 + γ) ⊙ F + β with learnable γ, β ∈ R^{D_ViT}, re-centering and re-scaling distorted feature dimensions. This corrects systematic distribution shifts induced by camera changes.

### Mechanism 3: Low-Rank Feature Realignment (FLA)
Low-rank updates to ViT linear layers approximate the optimal visual correction with minimal parameters. FLA applies LoRA-style updates W′ = W + BA with rank r ≪ d, learning A ∈ R^{r×d_in}, B ∈ R^{d_out×r}. This enables deeper feature realignment than token-level modulation while remaining parameter-efficient.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept**: Vision Transformer (ViT) token embeddings
- Why needed here: FTM and FLA operate on ViT outputs/weights. Understanding patch tokens, positional embeddings, and token flow is essential.
- Quick check question: Given a 224×224 image with patch size 16×16, how many visual tokens (excluding CLS) does a ViT produce?

**Concept**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
- Why needed here: FLA is a LoRA variant applied to the visual encoder. Understanding W′ = W + BA and rank selection is critical.
- Quick check question: If a linear layer has shape 2048×2048 and LoRA rank is 16, how many trainable parameters does LoRA add?

**Concept**: Manifold alignment and representation drift
- Why needed here: The core diagnosis is embedding drift; t-SNE visualizations in Section 8 show manifold misalignment.
- Quick check question: What does it mean visually if two distributions are "aligned" in embedding space versus merely overlapping?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Image → ViT (potentially modified by FLA) → visual tokens F → FTM affine transform → F̂ → [F̂; language tokens] → VLM backbone → embeddings → Action Expert (flow matching) → action trajectory

**Critical path**: 1. Image → ViT (potentially modified by FLA) → visual tokens F 2. F → FTM affine transform → F̂ 3. [F̂; language tokens] → VLM backbone → embeddings 4. Embeddings → Action Expert (flow matching) → action trajectory

**Design tradeoffs**: FTM: Minimal params (4K), fast adaptation, but limited expressivity; suitable for mild distribution shifts. FLA: Moderate params (4.7M), deeper correction, handles larger viewpoint changes; requires more data/steps. LoRA (baseline): 467M params, full-model flexibility, but overkill if only visual module needs correction.

**Failure signatures**: FTM stagnates at ~87%: manifold shift is non-affine; escalate to FLA. FLA fails to converge: rank too low or learning rate too high; try r=32 or reduce LR. Overfitting to one-shot demo: reduce training steps (FTM: 5000, FLA: 1500 as per Table 7).

**First 3 experiments**: 1. Baseline probe: Run zero-shot π0.5 on Libero-V camera perturbation; record success rate (~48.5% expected). 2. FTM sanity check: Train FTM with one demo per task (batch=32, 5000 steps); target ~87% on Libero-Spatial. 3. FLA validation: Train FLA (r=16, 1500 steps) on same data; compare to LoRA baseline on Libero-V (target 90.8% vs. 90.3%).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can the one-shot adaptation requirement be eliminated through purely task-agnostic spatial calibration, achieving zero-shot viewpoint generalization without demonstrations? The paper shows FTM/FLA can recalibrate representations with minimal data, but does not explore whether spatial priors could substitute for demonstrations entirely.

**Open Question 2**: How does the proposed spatial adaptation perform when multiple visual perturbations (viewpoint, lighting, texture, noise) co-occur simultaneously, as they would in real-world deployments? Libero-V evaluates each perturbation type in isolation, lacking results on combined perturbations.

**Open Question 3**: What are the failure modes of FTM/FLA, and under what conditions does the assumption that "Physical Modeling remains functionally competent" break down? The paper attributes degradation primarily to Spatial Modeling but provides no analysis of residual failures or whether Physical Modeling contributes in harder scenarios.

## Limitations

- Empirical scope limited to Libero-V benchmark; claims about real-world generalizability are extrapolated
- Theoretical assumptions (spatial-physical decomposition, affine/low-rank approximations) may not capture complex non-linear manifold deformations
- Performance sensitive to hyperparameters (rank selection, learning rate schedules) that are not fully explored

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core empirical finding that lightweight visual adaptation can significantly improve VLA performance on novel viewpoints is well-supported by the Libero-V results.

**Medium Confidence**: The theoretical justification for why spatial misalignment is the dominant factor (spatial-physical decomposition) is reasonable but not definitively proven.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about the method's generalizability beyond Libero-V to other robotic platforms or real-world deployment are speculative.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation of Spatial-Physical Decomposition**: Run an experiment where both the visual encoder and the VLM/action expert are adapted (full fine-tuning) on Libero-V. Compare performance against FTM and FLA to test if spatial-physical decomposition is incomplete.

2. **Cross-Benchmark Generalization**: Evaluate FTM and FLA on a different visual adaptation benchmark (e.g., MetaWorld or custom dataset) to test whether gains on Libero-V represent a general principle.

3. **Analysis of Manifold Complexity**: Perform detailed analysis of visual embedding manifold under different perturbation types using t-SNE/UMAP to visualize token distributions and quantify non-linearity to assess FTM/FLA assumptions.
