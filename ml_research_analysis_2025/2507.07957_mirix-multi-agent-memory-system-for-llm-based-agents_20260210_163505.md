# MIRIX: Multi-Agent Memory System for LLM-Based Agents
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07957
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07957
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than RAG baseline on ScreenshotVQA benchmark with 99.9% storage reduction

## Executive Summary
MIRIX introduces a modular, multi-agent memory system for LLM-based agents that addresses limitations of flat memory architectures through six specialized memory components. The system implements Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource, and Knowledge Vault memories, each managed by dedicated Memory Managers. Unlike traditional approaches, MIRIX supports multimodal inputs and enables agents to persist, reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data. The architecture demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy while dramatically reducing storage requirements compared to existing baselines.

## Method Summary
The MIRIX architecture implements a modular memory system with six specialized components, each handling different types of information storage and retrieval. The system uses dedicated Memory Managers for Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource, and Knowledge Vault memories, enabling parallel processing and specialized handling of different data types. The architecture supports multimodal inputs and employs a sophisticated retrieval mechanism that allows agents to access relevant information across all memory types. The system is evaluated on ScreenshotVQA benchmark for information extraction from high-resolution screenshots and LOCOMO benchmark for long-form conversation tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to RAG and long-context baselines.

## Key Results
- 35% higher accuracy than RAG baseline on ScreenshotVQA benchmark
- 99.9% reduction in storage requirements compared to RAG baseline
- State-of-the-art performance of 85.4% on LOCOMO long-form conversation benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MIRIX works by distributing memory management across specialized components that handle different types of information more efficiently than flat architectures. The modular design allows each Memory Manager to optimize for specific data characteristics - Core memory handles immediate context, Episodic manages temporal sequences, Semantic processes factual knowledge, Procedural stores task execution patterns, Resource manages external tools and APIs, and Knowledge Vault maintains long-term information. This specialization enables more accurate retrieval through domain-specific indexing and querying strategies. The multi-agent coordination ensures that relevant memories are activated contextually while maintaining consistency across the system. The multimodal support allows integration of diverse data types without forcing them into a single representation space, reducing information loss during storage and retrieval.

## Foundational Learning
- Memory specialization concepts: Why needed - different data types require different storage and retrieval strategies; Quick check - verify each memory type has distinct indexing and query mechanisms
- Multi-agent coordination patterns: Why needed - ensures consistency across specialized memory components; Quick check - validate communication protocols between Memory Managers
- Multimodal data integration: Why needed - real-world applications require processing of text, images, and other data types; Quick check - confirm support for diverse input formats in all memory components
- Long-term information persistence: Why needed - agents need to maintain user context over extended periods; Quick check - measure retention accuracy over time for stored information
- Storage optimization techniques: Why needed - dramatic storage reduction is a key claimed benefit; Quick check - analyze compression and indexing methods used across memory types

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: User Input -> Memory Managers (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource, Knowledge Vault) -> LLM Agent -> Output
Critical path: Input processing -> Memory Manager selection -> Retrieval/Storage operations -> Context assembly -> LLM response generation
Design tradeoffs: Specialization vs. integration complexity; storage efficiency vs. retrieval speed; modularity vs. coordination overhead
Failure signatures: Memory Manager conflicts during simultaneous access; retrieval failures due to semantic mismatches; performance degradation with high memory volume
First experiments:
1. Single Memory Manager load testing with synthetic data
2. Cross-memory retrieval accuracy measurement
3. Storage efficiency benchmarking against baseline systems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Methodological concerns about benchmark evaluation transparency and statistical significance
- Unproven scalability with computational overhead when all six components operate simultaneously
- Qualitative claims about real-world application without empirical validation data

## Confidence
- Benchmark performance claims (Medium): Impressive results but lack methodological transparency
- Architectural innovation claims (High): Clear articulation of modular design with specialized components
- Storage efficiency claims (Low): Extraordinary 99.9% reduction requires independent verification

## Next Checks
1. Independent replication of benchmark results on ScreenshotVQA and LOCOMO datasets with statistical significance testing
2. Systematic measurement of computational overhead and latency when all six memory components are active
3. User study evaluating real-time application accuracy and user experience with memory visualization interface
