core_contribution: The paper addresses the problem of providing a general semantics
  for probabilities of counterfactuals in probabilistic causal models, particularly
  those that cannot be extended into deterministic structural causal models (SCMs)
  as required by Pearl's standard semantics. This is motivated by criticisms from
  Dawid regarding the unrealistic assumptions underlying Pearl's approach.

# Causal Counterfactuals Reconsidered

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12804
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12804
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Novel semantics for counterfactual probabilities using mutually independent potential outcome variables, proven equivalent to two other recent proposals and avoiding artificial variables required by Pearl's approach.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of providing semantics for counterfactual probabilities in probabilistic causal models that cannot be extended into deterministic structural causal models (SCMs) as required by Pearl's standard approach. The author develops a novel semantics using mutually independent potential outcome variables, which is proven equivalent to both their previous work (Beckers 2025b) and Galhotra and Halpern's recent proposal. This framework resolves criticisms from Dawid regarding unrealistic assumptions in Pearl's semantics while providing point-identification of counterfactual probabilities rather than bounds, offering a practical compromise between competing philosophical positions.

## Method Summary
The method introduces potential outcome (PO) semantics that replaces Pearl's response variables with mutually independent potential outcome variables X_paX for each variable X and parent configuration paX. The key construction is a PO-SCM where these potential outcome variables serve as exogenous variables, with each X being a deterministic function of its potential outcome variable. This allows unique identification of counterfactual probabilities without requiring artificial response variables. The framework is proven equivalent to two other recent approaches: the author's previous Beckers 2025b semantics using actualized refinements, and Galhotra and Halpern's GH-SCM construction. The approach requires causal completeness (no unmeasured confounders) and uses only realistic variables.

## Key Results
- Proves equivalence between three semantics for counterfactual probabilities: the novel PO-semantics, Beckers 2025b semantics, and Galhotra & Halpern's semantics
- Demonstrates that point-identification of counterfactuals is achievable without artificial response variables through mutual independence of potential outcome variables
- Shows that non-deterministic causal models can emerge inevitably from coarse-graining deterministic fundamental models, even when no realistic deterministic extension exists
- Provides a formal framework that resolves the debate between Pearl and Dawid by offering a semantics that avoids unrealistic variables while maintaining mathematical rigor

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Independence of potential outcome variables enables point-identification of counterfactual probabilities in non-deterministic causal models.
- Mechanism: Replace Pearl's response variables with potential outcome variables (one per parent configuration) that are mutually independent. Since the joint distribution over exogenous variables is fully determined by marginal distributions P(X|pa_X), counterfactuals become uniquely identifiable rather than requiring bounds.
- Core assumption: Causal completeness—the exogenous variables screen off endogenous variables from all remaining causes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Specifically, the author defines a semantics using potential outcome variables that are mutually independent, and shows this is equivalent to two other recent proposals."
  - [Section 6] "the independence of the PO variables was an artificial formal tool that we used to compensate for the artificial nature of the counterfactual outcome variables"
  - [corpus] "Canonical Representations of Markovian Structural Causal Models" discusses similar canonical constructions for counterfactual reasoning.
- Break condition: If the causal model is incomplete (unmeasured confounders beyond U), the independence assumption fails and point-identification is lost.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Non-deterministic causal models emerge inevitably from coarse-graining deterministic fundamental models, even when no realistic deterministic extension exists.
- Mechanism: When abstracting from fine-grained variables (e.g., U taking values 1...100) to coarser variables (e.g., Z = 1 if U ≤ 40, else 0), the abstracted model can become irreducibly probabilistic. The proof shows that realistic extensions to recover determinism would require subdividing fundamental properties, which contradicts their fundamentality.
- Core assumption: Existence of fundamental variables—maximally fine-grained properties that cannot be realistically subdivided further.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4] Example 1 demonstrates that M_2 cannot be extended into a realistic SCM because "the property expressed by U = u' corresponds to several real and distinct properties, which contradicts that U is a set of fundamental variables."
  - [Section 4] "such cases do not always allow for realistic extensions into an SCM"
  - [corpus] No directly comparable corpus papers address this abstraction-induced nondeterminism result.
- Break condition: If one rejects the notion of fundamental variables, or allows artificial/unrealistic variables in models, the result dissolves.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The actualized refinement operator provides a non-structural semantics for counterfactuals that avoids artificial variables entirely.
- Mechanism: Given actual observations (u,v), update the conditional distributions: P^(pa_X,x)(x'|pa_X) = 1 if x' = x, else 0 for the realized parent value, while leaving counterfactual parent configurations unchanged. This captures learning from actual outcomes without invoking structural equations.
- Core assumption: Assumption: Prior distributions P(X|pa_X) accurately represent counterfactual distributions—they do not update upon observing actual outcomes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 7.1] "All distributions P(X|pa_X*) with pa_X* ≠ pa_X are now to be interpreted as backward-looking, counterfactual, distributions."
  - [Section 7.1] Theorem 1 proves equivalence to PO-semantics for basic counterfactuals: "P^B(y_x|u,v) = P^N(y_x|u,v)"
  - [corpus] "Causality Without Causal Models" abstracts causal definitions for settings where counterfactuals are defined without structural models.
- Break condition: If counterfactual distributions should rationally update based on observed outcomes (violating independence), this semantics gives incorrect answers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
  - Why needed here: The paper's entire project is to show when SCMs cannot be realistically constructed and to provide alternative semantics. Understanding Pearl's deterministic formulation (Definition 5) is prerequisite to understanding what is being generalized.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why mutually independent exogenous variables guarantee causal sufficiency?

- Concept: Potential Outcomes Framework
  - Why needed here: The proposed semantics explicitly imports potential outcome notation (Y_x for outcome under intervention X=x). The paper argues this framework's assumptions are more appropriate for non-deterministic settings than Pearl's response variables.
  - Quick check question: What is the "consistency" assumption linking potential outcomes to observed outcomes, and why might it fail outside SCMs?

- Concept: Causal Markov Condition
  - Why needed here: The semantics requires Markovian models. The paper critically examines whether this condition is universally justified and shows cases where realistic complete models violate it.
  - Quick check question: What does causal sufficiency require, and why might it fail even with complete exogenous variables?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Signature S = (U, V, R)**: Exogenous variables U, endogenous V, range function R
  - **Causal Model M = (S, G, P)**: DAG G, Markovian distribution P
  - **PO-SCM M^N**: Extended model with potential outcome variables as independent exogenous
  - **Actualized Refinement M^(u,v)**: Updated model after observing (u,v)

- Critical path:
  1. Verify the base causal model is causally complete and contains only realistic variables
  2. Check whether a realistic deterministic extension exists (usually not)
  3. Construct the PO-SCM by adding independent potential outcome variables
  4. Compute counterfactuals using the unique induced SCM

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Pearlian semantics**: Maximum generality, but requires unrealistic response variables; counterfactuals often only bound-identifiable
  - **Proposed semantics**: Point-identification achieved, but restricted to causally complete models with realistic variables
  - **Actualized refinement**: No artificial variables, but complex counterfactual semantics differs from PO-semantics

- Failure signatures:
  - Counterfactual bounds are wide rather than point-identified → likely missing causal completeness
  - Markov condition violations appear → check for hidden confounders or inappropriate variable abstraction
  - Realistic extension claimed but variables lack empirical meaning → response variables may be artificial

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Example 3 (binary X→Y) computing both Pearlian bounds and the point-identified PO-semantics result to verify the framework produces different answers.
  2. Construct a coarse-grained abstraction from a known deterministic SCM and verify that no realistic deterministic extension exists (following Example 1).
  3. Test the equivalence theorem: compare P^B(y_x|z) and P^N(y_x|z) for a 3-variable model to confirm Proposition 2 holds numerically.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the semantics for counterfactuals be generalized to causal models that do not satisfy the Markov condition (semi-Markovian models)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author states: "it leaves open the possiblity that one could generalize even further to also include semi-Markovian realistic causal models."
- Why unresolved: The Markov condition is built into the definition of causal models used, and the author notes it is "not at all clear to me how to generalize it beyond this setting."
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal extension of the PO-semantics framework that handles acyclic causal models violating the Markov condition while preserving equivalence results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What criteria determine whether a choice of variables is "appropriate" such that the Markov condition can be expected to hold?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "I suggest therefore that the debate about the universality of the Markov condition be replaced with the – more useful – search for such criteria."
- Why unresolved: The standard response to Markov violations (choosing more fine-grained variables) lacks "non-question begging criteria" and thus is "of no practical use whatsoever."
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal criteria or principles that predict when a given variable choice will yield a model satisfying the Markov condition.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How should probabilities of complex counterfactuals be interpreted when the PO-semantics and Beckers' previous semantics diverge?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The author notes the equivalence between semantics "does not generalize to complex counterfactuals" and provides a counterexample, but explicitly states: "I set aside the discussion of the relative merits of each interpretation for a different occasion."
- Why unresolved: The two semantics encode different interpretations of joint counterfactual queries that are both intuitively plausible but yield different numerical results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical or conceptual analysis establishing which interpretation better captures actual counterfactual reasoning in practice.

## Limitations

- The framework requires causal completeness, excluding models with unmeasured confounders from using point-identified counterfactuals
- The independence assumption for potential outcome variables may shift artificiality from response variables to this formal construct
- The proposed semantics for complex counterfactuals differs from Beckers' previous semantics, creating ambiguity in interpretation

## Confidence

- Technical equivalence proofs: High
- Point-identification advantage over Pearl: Medium-High
- Fundamental variables assumption: Medium
- Realism of all proposed variables: Medium

## Next Checks

1. **Stress test the independence assumption**: Construct a causal model with non-Markovian structure (unmeasured confounding) and verify that the PO-semantics independence assumption breaks down as predicted.

2. **Validate against real data**: Apply the framework to an empirical domain (e.g., epidemiological counterfactuals) where realistic extensions to SCMs are known to fail, and compare the resulting counterfactual probabilities to domain-expert judgments.

3. **Formalize the fundamentality criterion**: Develop a precise mathematical definition of what makes a variable "fundamental" and test whether the abstraction-induced nondeterminism result still holds under this formalization.
