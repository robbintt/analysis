# GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.13300
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Diffusion model generates controllable, temporally consistent gait silhouettes that improve recognition under covariate variations and support privacy-constrained scenarios.

## Executive Summary
GaitCrafter introduces a diffusion model for generating biometric-preserving gait silhouette sequences. Unlike prior methods using VAEs or simulated data, it trains a video diffusion model from scratch on silhouette data, enabling controllable generation conditioned on identity, view angle, and covariates like clothing or carried objects. The method also introduces a novel identity generation mechanism via identity embedding interpolation. Experiments on CASIA-B show that synthetic data improves gait recognition performance, particularly under challenging conditions, with a 2% improvement under clothing variations and comparable performance to real data in privacy-constrained settings.

## Method Summary
GaitCrafter uses a pixel-based 3D U-Net video diffusion model trained on 30-frame binary gait silhouette sequences at 64×64 resolution. The model employs additive conditioning, where identity is encoded as one-hot tokens added to U-Net blocks, while view and covariate labels pass through separate encoders, temporally repeat, and add to the input tensor. This allows fine-grained control over output attributes. The model generates temporally consistent sequences that preserve identity-specific biometric cues. Novel identities are created by interpolating identity embeddings through multi-hot encoding, producing coherent, distinct gait patterns not present in the original dataset.

## Key Results
- Generated silhouettes improve gait recognition accuracy by 2% under clothing variations compared to real data-only baselines
- Privacy-constrained setting shows comparable performance between models trained on real vs. synthetic data
- Novel identity generation via embedding interpolation creates distinct clusters in embedding space, separate from source identities
- Additive conditioning enables controllable generation of gait sequences with specified view angles and covariate conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pixel-based video diffusion can generate temporally consistent silhouette sequences that preserve identity-specific biometric cues across a complete gait cycle.
- Mechanism: A 3D U-Net with spatial and temporal attention layers learns to denoise Gaussian noise into structured silhouette sequences. The binary nature of silhouettes reduces learning complexity compared to RGB.
- Core assumption: The standard Gaussian noise schedule is sufficient to model bimodal silhouette distributions without specialized discretization strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "trains a video diffusion model from scratch, exclusively on gait silhouette data... temporally consistent and identity-preserving"
  - [Page 3, Section 3.1] "the model learns to capture the underlying structure and temporal dynamics of silhouette sequences, showing that the original diffusion formulation is sufficient"
- Break condition: If identity embeddings cluster poorly in downstream recognition space (GBS score drops significantly), the pixel-space diffusion is failing to capture discriminative gait features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Additive conditioning on identity, view angle, and covariates enables controllable gait generation with explicit attribute disentanglement.
- Mechanism: Identity is encoded as one-hot tokens (xid) added directly to U-Net blocks. View and covariate labels pass through separate encoders, then are temporally repeated to form 3D tensors (xview, xcovariate) added to the input tensor during both training and inference.
- Core assumption: View and covariate encoders learn disentangled representations that do not interfere with identity preservation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 3-4, Section 3.1] "these tensors are added to the input... This additive conditioning allows for fine-grained control over the output video's viewpoint and covariate characteristics"
  - [Page 6, Table 1] Shows +ON (novel identities) improves CL condition by 2%, suggesting effective disentanglement.
- Break condition: If changing a covariate (e.g., clothing) alters identity clustering in embedding space, conditioning is entangled rather than disentangled.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Interpolating identity embeddings by activating multiple one-hot entries generates coherent novel identities with unique, consistent gait patterns.
- Mechanism: At inference, setting multiple ID entries to 1 creates a blended identity code. The model synthesizes a new gait pattern that is not a simple average but a coherent identity-distinct sequence.
- Core assumption: The diffusion model has learned a sufficiently smooth identity latent space where interpolations yield realistic biometric patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "introduces a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity embeddings"
  - [Page 7, Figure 6] t-SNE visualization shows novel IDs (green) form clusters distinct from known IDs (red).
- Break condition: If novel identities fail to form distinct clusters or show inconsistent gait patterns across different seeds, the interpolation mechanism is collapsing.

## Foundational Learning

- **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)**: Understanding the forward/backward process is essential before modifying the noise schedule or conditioning mechanism. *Quick check: Can you explain why the reverse process in Equation 2 requires learning to predict noise rather than directly predicting clean data?*
- **3D U-Net Architecture with Temporal Attention**: The paper builds on this architecture for video generation; understanding spatial vs. temporal attention is critical for debugging coherence issues. *Quick check: How does temporal attention differ from spatial attention in a 3D U-Net, and which would you expect to matter more for gait cycle consistency?*
- **Conditional Diffusion via Classifier-Free Guidance**: The paper uses additive conditioning; understanding how conditions are injected helps diagnose controllability failures. *Quick check: If generated samples ignore the specified view angle, which component of the conditioning pipeline would you investigate first?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Noise Tensor + Conditions → Conditioning Branches (ID: One-hot → U-Net blocks; View/Covariate: Label → Encoder → temporal repeat → add to input) → 3D U-Net (1,2,4,8 channel multipliers, spatial + temporal attention) → Output Denoised Silhouette Sequence
- **Critical path**: The identity one-hot encoding → U-Net blocks connection is the primary path for biometric preservation.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Pixel-space vs. latent-space: Pixel preserves fine details but is computationally heavier. Silhouette's binary nature mitigates this cost.
  - 30 frames vs. longer sequences: Matches one gait cycle but limits temporal augmentation options.
  - One-hot ID vs. learned embeddings: One-hot is simple but does not scale to very large identity counts.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low GBS score (<0.6): Identity not preserved; check conditioning injection.
  - Temporal flickering: Temporal attention failing; increase attention layers or reduce frame count.
  - Mode collapse in covariate control: Encoder not learning disentangled representations.
  - Novel IDs clustering with source IDs: Interpolation too close to sources.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce GBS metric: Train on CASIA-B subset (74 IDs), generate samples, compute GBS against pretrained GaitGL embeddings. Target: GBS > 0.70.
  2. Ablate conditioning: Remove view conditioning and verify generated samples show mixed/undefined angles.
  3. Novel ID validation: Generate 10 novel IDs by blending pairs of source IDs, extract embeddings, and compute pairwise distances.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can extending the synthetic sequence length beyond 30 frames close the performance gap between models trained exclusively on synthetic data versus real data?
- How does the reliance on one-hot identity encoding impact the scalability of GaitCrafter when applied to large-scale datasets with thousands of identities?
- To what extent are the covariates (e.g., view, clothing) truly disentangled from identity features in the latent space?

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation on external datasets beyond CASIA-B prevents assessment of real-world generalization
- One-hot identity encoding may not scale to datasets with thousands of subjects due to memory and optimization challenges
- Novel identity generation lacks quantitative validation of identity uniqueness and temporal consistency beyond t-SNE visualization

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Pixel-based video diffusion can generate temporally consistent silhouette sequences (well-supported by results and mechanism description).

**Medium Confidence**: Identity embedding interpolation generates coherent novel identities (supported by t-SNE visualization but lacks quantitative validation).

**Low Confidence**: GaitCrafter is scalable to real-world privacy-constrained scenarios (based on indirect evidence and extrapolation from CASIA-B results).

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Evaluate GaitCrafter on an external gait dataset (e.g., OU-ISIR or a subset of CASIA-B held out during training) to assess generalization beyond the training distribution.

2. **Novel Identity Quality Metrics**: Develop quantitative metrics to assess the quality of novel identities generated via interpolation, including identity uniqueness (distance to nearest known ID in embedding space) and temporal consistency (variance of embedding across generated samples).

3. **Real-World Privacy Simulation**: Design a controlled experiment to quantify the privacy benefit of GaitCrafter in a realistic scenario by training a gait recognition model on synthetic data and evaluating its performance on real data from a different demographic group, measuring both recognition accuracy and privacy leakage.
