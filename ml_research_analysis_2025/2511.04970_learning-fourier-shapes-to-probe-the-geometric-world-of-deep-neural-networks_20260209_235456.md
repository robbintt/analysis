# Learning Fourier shapes to probe the geometric world of deep neural networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.04970
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04970
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel Fourier-based method for geometric probing of DNNs achieves >90% shape-based classification and effective adversarial attacks on object detectors

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for probing deep neural networks' geometric understanding by learning adversarial shapes using Fourier series parameterization. The method addresses the fundamental challenge of optimizing object shapes by bridging the gap between abstract geometric parameters and pixel grids. By parameterizing closed contours with Fourier series and employing differentiable optimization techniques, the approach enables both interpretability analysis and adversarial attacks. The work demonstrates that shapes alone can serve as powerful semantic carriers, achieving high-confidence classifications without texture information while also providing a generalizable attack paradigm for evading object detectors.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a differentiable framework that parameterizes arbitrary closed contours using Fourier series coefficients, maps these coefficients to pixel images using the winding number theorem, and introduces signal energy constraints for effective optimization. The method learns shapes that can fool DNNs while maintaining high confidence predictions, effectively probing the models' geometric understanding. This approach serves dual purposes: as an interpretability tool that isolates salient regions with sharp boundaries more precisely than Grad-CAM, and as an adversarial attack method that can evade object detectors across multiple architectures with success rates increasing with shape complexity.

## Key Results
- Shapes alone achieve high-confidence classifications (over 90% success rate) across most architectures without any texture information
- The method provides high-fidelity interpretability by isolating model salient regions with sharp boundaries more precise than Grad-CAM
- Adversarial shapes constitute a generalizable attack paradigm that evades object detectors with success rates increasing with shape complexity (K), significantly degrading performance across YOLOv3, RetinaNet, and FCOS architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages Fourier series' ability to represent arbitrary closed contours through differentiable parameterization, enabling gradient-based optimization of geometric shapes. The winding number theorem provides a mathematically sound way to convert continuous Fourier representations into discrete pixel images while maintaining differentiability. Signal energy constraints stabilize the optimization process by preventing degenerate solutions. This framework effectively bridges the semantic gap between abstract geometric parameters and the pixel-based representations that DNNs process, allowing direct optimization of shape-based inputs that probe the models' geometric understanding.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Fourier Series for Shape Representation**
   - Why needed: Provides smooth, differentiable parameterization of arbitrary closed contours
   - Quick check: Verify that Fourier coefficients can accurately reconstruct complex shapes through inverse transform

2. **Winding Number Theorem**
   - Why needed: Enables conversion from continuous Fourier parameters to discrete pixel images while preserving differentiability
   - Quick check: Confirm that winding number calculation correctly identifies interior/exterior regions for various test shapes

3. **Differentiable Image Generation**
   - Why needed: Allows gradient-based optimization of geometric parameters through the DNN
   - Quick check: Test backpropagation through the image generation pipeline on simple shapes

4. **Signal Energy Constraints**
   - Why needed: Stabilizes optimization and prevents degenerate solutions in Fourier space
   - Quick check: Compare optimization stability with and without energy constraints on benchmark problems

5. **Adversarial Shape Optimization**
   - Why needed: Enables creation of shapes that fool DNNs while maintaining semantic plausibility
   - Quick check: Verify that optimized shapes achieve high confidence on target classes while being adversarial

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Fourier coefficients → Winding number mapping → Pixel image generation → DNN input → Classification/detection output → Loss computation → Gradient backprop to Fourier coefficients

**Critical Path:** The core optimization loop flows from Fourier parameterization through differentiable image generation to DNN input, with gradients flowing backward to update shape parameters based on classification or detection loss.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method balances shape complexity (K) against optimization stability and computational cost. Higher K enables more complex shapes but requires careful tuning of signal energy constraints and increases computational overhead. The choice between classification and detection objectives affects the loss function design and optimization dynamics.

**Failure Signatures:** Optimization divergence due to insufficient signal energy constraints, poor shape reconstruction from limited Fourier coefficients, and failure to maintain closed contours during optimization. Detection evasion may fail if shapes are too simple to capture detector-specific vulnerabilities.

**3 First Experiments:** 1) Validate Fourier shape reconstruction accuracy for simple geometric primitives (circles, ellipses, polygons). 2) Test optimization convergence on a single ImageNet class with increasing K values. 3) Evaluate Grad-CAM comparison by generating interpretable saliency shapes for a small set of validation images.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Fourier series parameterization has inherent constraints in representing complex shapes with sharp corners or intricate topological features
- Performance metrics are primarily validated on standard benchmarks without extensive testing on domain-specific datasets or real-world deployment scenarios
- The method's computational requirements increase significantly with higher Fourier complexity, potentially limiting practical deployment

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core technical contribution of using Fourier series for differentiable shape optimization and the basic demonstration of shape-based classification without texture are well-supported by the presented experiments.

**Medium Confidence:** The claims about improved interpretability compared to Grad-CAM and the generalizability of adversarial shapes across different detector architectures require more extensive validation across diverse datasets and real-world conditions.

**Low Confidence:** The assertion that shapes alone can serve as "powerful semantic carriers" equivalent to full images with texture information needs more rigorous testing, particularly for complex object categories where shape alone may be insufficient for reliable classification.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset robustness:** Evaluate the method's performance on domain-specific datasets (medical imaging, satellite imagery, industrial inspection) to assess generalizability beyond standard computer vision benchmarks.

2. **Shape complexity sensitivity:** Systematically vary Fourier complexity K and analyze the trade-off between shape representational capacity and optimization stability, including ablation studies on the E constraint parameter sensitivity.

3. **Real-world deployment testing:** Test adversarial shapes against object detectors in realistic scenarios with occlusions, lighting variations, and multiple object classes to validate practical attack effectiveness beyond controlled benchmark conditions.
