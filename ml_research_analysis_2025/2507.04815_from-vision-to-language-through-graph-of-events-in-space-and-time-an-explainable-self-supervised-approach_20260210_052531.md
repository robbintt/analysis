# From Vision To Language through Graph of Events in Space and Time: An Explainable Self-supervised Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.04815
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04815
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GEST generates richer, more accurate video descriptions than state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, with self-supervised teacher-student learning improving end-to-end models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GEST (Graph of Events in Space and Time), a novel approach for generating rich, natural language descriptions of videos by constructing a structured graph that captures spatio-temporal relationships between events. The method leverages multiple vision tasks—object detection, action recognition, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation—to extract frame-level information and build a global representation of video events. GEST captures spatio-temporal relationships between events, which are then converted into a proto-language and refined using a text-only large language model (LLM) to produce coherent, story-like descriptions.

The approach is validated on diverse datasets (Videos-to-Paragraphs, COIN, WebVid, VidOR, VidVRD) and shows strong performance, particularly on Videos-to-Paragraphs, which contains complex, multi-actor videos. Human evaluations and VLM-as-a-Jury rankings consistently prefer GEST-generated descriptions over state-of-the-art methods like VidIL, VALOR, and others. The method also demonstrates effectiveness in a self-supervised teacher-student framework, improving the performance of end-to-end video captioning models. Overall, GEST provides an explainable, grounded, and effective solution for video-to-language generation, addressing limitations in current datasets and evaluation metrics.

## Method Summary
GEST constructs a Graph of Events in Space and Time by integrating outputs from multiple vision tasks—action detection, object tracking, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation—at the frame level. Events are aggregated by identifying actors and objects, unifying person identities through short-term IoU matching and long-term HSV histogram re-identification, and grouping consecutive actions into coherent events. The resulting graph captures spatial and temporal relationships between events, which are then converted into a structured proto-language through breadth-first traversal. This proto-language is refined by an LLM to produce natural, story-like descriptions. The method also supports self-supervised training by using GEST-generated descriptions as pseudo-labels to pre-train end-to-end neural captioning models.

## Key Results
- GEST outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Videos-to-Paragraphs dataset across all automatic metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr, SPICE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and human evaluations.
- Human evaluators and VLM-as-a-Jury rankings consistently prefer GEST-generated descriptions over methods like VidIL and VALOR, citing better factual correctness and richness.
- Self-supervised pre-training of end-to-end models (e.g., VALOR) on GEST-generated descriptions leads to significant improvements in captioning performance across multiple datasets.
- GEST effectively captures complex, multi-actor narratives and generates descriptions that are both grounded in visual evidence and linguistically coherent.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Task Integration into Spatio-Temporal Graph
- Claim: Combining multiple vision tasks into a unified spatio-temporal graph structure captures richer story information than single-task or frame-sampling approaches.
- Mechanism: The pipeline processes every frame through action detection, object tracking, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation. Frame-level outputs are aggregated through person unification (short-term IoU matching + long-term HSV histogram re-identification), action filtering with voting windows, and event construction. Spatial and temporal edges connect events based on proximity and temporal ordering.
- Core assumption: Each vision task provides complementary information that, when properly integrated, captures the full narrative structure of a video.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GEST is built by analyzing videos through multiple tasks (action detection, object tracking, semantic segmentation, depth estimation) and integrating them into a structured graph."
  - [section 4.1]: Describes the complete frame-level to video-level aggregation pipeline with person unification thresholds empirically set from 20-25 examples.
  - [corpus]: Related work (VidIL) samples frames and concatenates descriptors, but lacks explicit spatio-temporal relationship modeling.

### Mechanism 2: Proto-Language as Grounded Intermediate Representation
- Claim: Converting GEST to structured proto-language before LLM refinement reduces hallucinations by constraining the generation space.
- Mechanism: The graph is traversed via breadth-first-search over a 3D volume (Identity, Space, Time). Events are grouped by actor and temporally sorted. A procedural grammar converts events to text, listing possible objects for the LLM to select. The LLM is explicitly instructed to pick, replace, or delete objects/actions based on context.
- Core assumption: The explicit graph structure constrains the LLM's generation, reducing hallucinations while preserving linguistic fluency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This graph is then converted into a proto-language, refined by a large language model to produce natural descriptions."
  - [section 4.2]: Details proto-language generation with special instructions allowing LLM to modify actions/objects, plus context scene classification prepended to prompt.
  - [corpus]: Limited corpus evidence on proto-language specifically; related work suggests intermediate representations improve grounding but this approach is relatively novel.

### Mechanism 3: Self-Supervised Teacher-Student Learning Pathway
- Claim: The explainable analytical pipeline can automatically generate training data to improve end-to-end neural captioning models.
- Mechanism: GEST-generated descriptions serve as pseudo-labels. A neural student network (end-to-end video captioning model) is pre-trained on these generated descriptions, then fine-tuned on human-annotated ground truth. This provides additional supervision without manual labeling.
- Core assumption: GEST-generated descriptions are sufficiently accurate and informative to serve as useful training signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "demonstrate how our automated and explainable video description generation process can function as a fully automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student pathways."
  - [section 6.8]: VALOR pre-trained on GEST descriptions shows consistent improvement across all metrics (e.g., METEOR 14.40→15.54, CIDEr 21.51→27.87).
  - [corpus]: Self-supervised learning common in vision; using structured analytical pipelines as teachers for vision-language tasks is less documented in neighbors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Scene Graphs and Spatio-Temporal Extensions**
  - Why needed here: GEST extends static scene graphs into the time domain. Understanding that scene graphs model <subject, predicate, object> triplets helps grasp how GEST generalizes to multi-actor, multi-object events with temporal relations ("next," "same time," "meanwhile").
  - Quick check question: How does a static image scene graph differ from a spatio-temporal event graph?

- **Concept: Multi-Task Vision Integration**
  - Why needed here: The approach fuses outputs from action detection, tracking, segmentation, and depth estimation. Each modality contributes different constraints (action labels, person identity, object boundaries, 3D proximity).
  - Quick check question: Given bounding boxes from tracking and depth maps, how would you determine if an object is truly near a person vs. just appearing close in 2D?

- **Concept: Pseudo-Labeling and Teacher-Student Learning**
  - Why needed here: The self-supervised component uses generated descriptions as training data. Understanding the risks of noisy pseudo-labels (confirmation bias, error propagation) is essential for evaluating results.
  - Quick check question: What quality threshold should pseudo-labels meet before being used for pre-training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
Video Input -> Frame-Level Processing (VideoMAE, YOLO, Mask2Former, Marigold) -> Frame-Level Aggregation (Actor-object proximity, Person unification, Action voting) -> Video-Level Integration (Person re-id, Event aggregation, Spatio-temporal edges) -> GEST Graph -> Proto-Language Generation (BFS traversal, Grammar-based conversion) -> LLM Refinement + Scene context -> Final Description -> [Optional: Student Pathway]

- **Critical path:** Action detection accuracy -> Person tracking consistency -> Person re-identification quality -> Event boundary detection -> Proto-language ordering -> LLM prompt design. Errors propagate forward; the graph is only as good as its inputs.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Processing cost vs. completeness: GEST processes all frames (not sampling), enabling richer temporal modeling but at higher computational cost.
  - Vocabulary limitation vs. grounding: Action detector has fixed vocabulary; LLM can override but risks hallucination. Proto-language preserves grounded constraints.
  - Explainability vs. end-to-end optimization: Analytical pipeline is fully interpretable but potentially suboptimal compared to learned end-to-end approaches.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Person count inflation: Tracker ID switches without re-identification correction -> "three people" when only one exists.
  - Object hallucination: Depth filtering fails -> proto-language includes distant objects as "involved."
  - Temporal confusion: Event aggregation threshold too low -> single action fragmented into multiple events.
  - Action vocabulary gap: Action detector lacks verb -> described as generic "holding object while walking."

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation study: Remove each module (person re-id, depth estimation, semantic segmentation) one at a time. Measure impact on VLM-as-Jury ranking. Table 7 shows segmentation removal causes largest drop (1.57→3.66).
  2. Grounding vs. richness tradeoff: Compare GEST (grounded, potentially under-specified) vs. VidIL (rich, hallucination-prone) vs. GEST+VidIL combination. Evaluate whether combination captures strengths of both.
  3. Self-supervised pre-training effect: Train same model (VALOR) with and without GEST pre-training. Measure improvement across multiple text metrics (Table 8) and verify with human/VLM ranking to ensure improvements are semantic, not just surface-level.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the GEST framework effectively describe high-level semantic actions that fall outside the fixed taxonomy of the underlying action recognition module?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge in Section 6.5 that because the method relies on an action recognizer with a "rather small and fixed set of possible actions," it lacks flexibility, often describing complex activities (e.g., mopping) as lower-level motion (e.g., holding an object while walking).
- Why unresolved: The current pipeline depends on the specific labels provided by the VideoMAE model, limiting its ability to generate nuanced narratives for actions not explicitly covered in the training set without manual updates to the recognizer.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful generation of accurate descriptions for a dataset containing out-of-distribution or highly complex activities without retraining the action detection component.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the system perform on long-duration videos where the HSV-based person re-identification fails due to significant temporal gaps or appearance changes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.1 notes that the re-identification method relies on the assumption that a person's color distribution is stable because they wear "the same clothing during the relatively short clip."
- Why unresolved: The current solution uses a simple HSV histogram, which is computationally efficient but lacks robustness for longer narratives where characters might change clothes, leave the frame for extended periods, or undergo significant lighting changes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of identity consistency in videos exceeding the "short clip" duration or involving significant costume/lighting changes, comparing HSV performance against deep feature-based re-identification.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent can the "VLM-as-a-Jury" evaluation framework replace human evaluation without reinforcing the hallucinations or biases present in the judge models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 6.3 that while the jury agreement is high (>80%), VLMs still suffer from hallucinations and "lack of generalization," raising the question of whether they can truly serve as a proxy for human preference in all cases.
- Why unresolved: Using VLMs to evaluate VLMs (or other generators) risks creating an echo chamber where the "judge" prefers fluent but hallucinated text over less fluent but factually accurate descriptions, a limitation the paper acknowledges but does not fully solve.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study correlating human judgment with VLM-as-a-Jury scores specifically on "hard negatives"—cases where fluent hallucinations contradict the visual ground truth.

## Limitations

- Action vocabulary gap: The method depends on a fixed action recognition vocabulary, limiting its ability to describe complex or out-of-distribution activities without retraining the action detector.
- HSV re-identification sensitivity: The simple HSV histogram-based person re-identification may fail on longer videos or under significant appearance/lighting changes.
- Evaluation framework concerns: While VLM-as-a-Jury shows high agreement, it may reinforce model biases and hallucinations, potentially misaligning with true human preference.

## Confidence

- **High**: GEST construction from multi-task vision pipeline, event aggregation, and spatio-temporal edge building (described in detail, validated on multiple datasets).
- **Medium**: Proto-language generation and LLM refinement quality (algorithm provided, but implementation and prompt details incomplete; human and VLM evaluations support claims but lack ablations on prompt variants).
- **Low**: Generalization of self-supervised teacher-student gains across architectures (only VALOR tested; ablation on GEST pre-training effectiveness not performed).

## Next Checks

1. Ablation study on vision modules: Remove person re-identification, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation individually; measure impact on VLM-as-Jury ranking and human evaluations (Table 7 suggests segmentation removal has largest effect).
2. Grounding vs. richness tradeoff: Compare GEST-only (grounded, possibly under-specified) against VidIL-only (rich, hallucination-prone) and GEST+VidIL combination; evaluate whether combination captures strengths of both.
3. Self-supervised pre-training robustness: Train additional end-to-end models (e.g., SimVLM, M4) with and without GEST pre-training; measure consistency of performance gains across metrics and datasets.
