# Rep Smarter, Not Harder: AI Hypertrophy Coaching with Wearable Sensors and Edge Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11854
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11854
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Real-time wrist IMU-based detection of near-failure states in resistance training with 82% F1 score on edge devices

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a wearable AI system for real-time hypertrophy coaching that uses a single wrist-mounted IMU to detect near-failure states during resistance training. The system employs a two-stage pipeline: first segmenting repetitions from 6-axis IMU data using a ResNet-based model, then classifying near-failure states using a combination of segmentation features, convolutional features, and LSTM-based historical context. Tested on preacher curl exercises from 13 participants, the system achieved 83% F1 score for repetition segmentation and 82% F1 score for near-failure classification under simulated real-time conditions, with edge deployment latency under 112 ms on Raspberry Pi 5 and 23.5 ms on iPhone 16.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a two-stage pipeline for detecting near-failure states during resistance training. First, a ResNet-based model segments repetitions from continuous 6-axis IMU data collected from a wrist-mounted sensor. Second, a classification model combines features from this segmentation, convolutional features extracted from the raw data, and LSTM-based historical context to identify when the lifter is approaching failure (RiR ≤ 2). The system was evaluated on a dataset of 631 preacher curl repetitions from 13 participants, with performance measured under simulated real-time conditions (1.6 Hz inference rate) and deployed on edge devices including Raspberry Pi 5 and iPhone 16.

## Key Results
- Repetition segmentation model achieved 83% F1 score on wrist IMU data
- Near-failure classification model achieved 82% F1 score under real-time conditions
- Edge deployment latency: 112 ms on Raspberry Pi 5, 23.5 ms on iPhone 16
- System uses only single wrist-mounted IMU sensor

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by leveraging the predictable biomechanical patterns of resistance training repetitions and the physiological indicators of fatigue that manifest in movement quality. As lifters approach failure, their movement velocity decreases and form deteriorates in detectable patterns. The wrist-mounted IMU captures these subtle changes in movement dynamics, which the neural network learns to associate with near-failure states. The two-stage approach allows for efficient processing by first identifying discrete repetitions before analyzing their characteristics for fatigue indicators.

## Foundational Learning

**Repetition segmentation** - Separating continuous IMU data into individual exercise repetitions. Needed to analyze each repetition independently for fatigue indicators. Quick check: Ensure segmentation model achieves >80% accuracy on test data.

**Near-failure state detection** - Identifying when lifter has RiR ≤ 2 (reps in reserve). Needed to provide timely coaching feedback before complete failure. Quick check: Validate classification against expert-labeled failure points.

**Edge inference optimization** - Deploying models on resource-constrained devices like smartphones and Raspberry Pi. Needed for real-time feedback during exercise without cloud dependency. Quick check: Verify inference latency stays under 200ms for real-time use.

**Wrist IMU data processing** - Extracting meaningful features from 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data. Needed as the primary input signal for all analysis. Quick check: Confirm signal quality remains stable during various exercise intensities.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Raw IMU data -> ResNet segmentation model -> Convolutional feature extraction -> LSTM historical context -> Near-failure classifier -> Edge deployment

**Critical path:** The inference pipeline must complete within ~200ms to provide real-time feedback during exercise. This requires efficient segmentation followed by parallel feature extraction and context analysis before final classification.

**Design tradeoffs:** Single wrist sensor vs. multiple sensors (reduced hardware complexity but potential accuracy loss). Real-time inference vs. cloud processing (privacy and latency benefits but computational constraints). Simulated real-time testing vs. in-field deployment (controlled validation but unknown practical performance).

**Failure signatures:** Poor segmentation leading to misattributed fatigue indicators, LSTM context errors causing false positives, edge device thermal throttling affecting inference speed, IMU signal noise during rapid movements.

**First experiments:** 1) Validate segmentation accuracy on held-out test data with different lifting speeds. 2) Test near-failure classification against ground truth from expert coaches. 3) Benchmark edge deployment latency across different device workloads.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited to preacher curls exercise only, not generalizable to other resistance training modalities
- Single wrist sensor placement may miss critical biomechanical indicators available from other locations
- Modest dataset size (631 repetitions, 13 participants) for broader claims
- No ground truth for exact failure points, relying on indirect RiR estimation

## Confidence
**High** - Feasibility of wrist-based IMU segmentation and near-failure classification demonstrated with strong F1 scores and low inference latencies on tested hardware.

**Medium** - Real-world efficacy for hypertrophy coaching remains unproven as practical user experience and long-term adherence are not yet validated.

**Low** - Generalizability across exercises, populations, and sensor placements due to narrow experimental scope and single-exercise focus.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate system performance on a larger, multi-exercise dataset (e.g., bench press, squats, deadlifts) with varied sensor placements (upper arm, torso, ankle).
2. Conduct in-field trials with resistance training participants to assess real-world accuracy, usability, and user adherence over multiple sessions.
3. Validate RiR estimates against ground truth (actual failure points) via controlled lab studies with expert coaching supervision.
