# A Graph-based Verification Framework for Fact-Checking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.07282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07282
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Graph-based fact-checking framework achieves 3.75-8.31% macro-F1 improvement over existing methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses limitations in large language model-based fact-checking by proposing GraphFC, a graph-based verification framework that converts claims into graph structures using triplets. The framework eliminates decomposition insufficiencies and resolves mention ambiguities through relational constraints. GraphFC consists of three components: graph construction, graph-guided planning, and graph-guided checking. Experiments on three datasets (HOVER, FEVEROUS, and SciFact) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over existing methods.

## Method Summary
The GraphFC framework converts textual claims into graph structures using triplet extraction from LLMs to eliminate decomposition insufficiencies. The system employs a three-component architecture: graph construction creates structured representations from claims, graph-guided planning generates verification strategies based on the graph structure, and graph-guided checking executes the verification process. The graph-based approach resolves mention ambiguities through relational constraints and enables multi-hop reasoning by following graph paths. The framework leverages both the structural advantages of graphs and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in an integrated verification pipeline.

## Key Results
- Achieves 3.75-8.31% macro-F1 improvement over existing methods on three datasets
- Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on HOVER, FEVEROUS, and SciFact datasets
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of graph-based components, particularly for complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by transforming unstructured claims into structured graph representations where entities and relationships are explicitly encoded as triplets. This graph structure eliminates the ambiguity inherent in natural language processing of claims and provides clear relational constraints that guide the verification process. By decomposing claims into graph components, the system can systematically verify each relationship and entity, enabling more precise multi-hop reasoning. The graph-guided planning component uses the structured information to generate targeted verification strategies, while the checking component executes verification along the graph paths, reducing the uncertainty and ambiguity that plague traditional LLM-based fact-checking approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Triplet extraction**: Converting claims into subject-predicate-object structures; needed to create structured graph representations from unstructured text; quick check: verify extracted triplets preserve semantic relationships from original claims
- **Graph-based reasoning**: Using graph structures to represent and navigate knowledge relationships; needed to enable systematic multi-hop verification; quick check: confirm graph traversal follows logical reasoning paths
- **Multi-hop verification**: Verifying claims that require multiple reasoning steps; needed for complex claims that cannot be verified through single-step evidence matching; quick check: test framework on claims requiring 2+ reasoning steps
- **LLM-guided planning**: Using language models to generate verification strategies; needed to bridge the gap between structured graphs and natural language evidence; quick check: evaluate quality of generated verification plans
- **Mention disambiguation**: Resolving ambiguous entity references in claims; needed to prevent confusion between entities with similar names; quick check: test framework on claims with ambiguous entity mentions
- **Relational constraint propagation**: Using graph relationships to constrain verification possibilities; needed to reduce search space and improve verification accuracy; quick check: verify constraint propagation correctly eliminates invalid verification paths

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Graph Construction -> Graph-Guided Planning -> Graph-Guided Checking

Critical Path: Claim text is first converted to graph structure through triplet extraction, then the graph guides the planning of verification strategies, and finally the checking component executes verification using the planned approach guided by the graph structure.

Design Tradeoffs: The framework trades computational complexity (graph construction and traversal) for improved accuracy and reduced ambiguity compared to pure LLM-based approaches. The reliance on LLM-generated triplets introduces potential error propagation but enables flexible handling of diverse claim structures.

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation occurs when triplet extraction produces noisy or incomplete information, when graph structures become too complex for effective traversal, or when verification evidence is sparse relative to the graph structure. The system may struggle with claims requiring reasoning beyond the graph's relational scope.

Three First Experiments:
1. Test triplet extraction accuracy on claims with nested or complex entity relationships
2. Evaluate graph-guided planning performance on claims requiring different numbers of reasoning hops
3. Assess the impact of graph structure complexity on verification accuracy across datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental results show significant performance gains but are limited to three specific datasets that may not represent real-world complexity
- Graph construction relies heavily on triplet extraction from LLMs, introducing uncertainty about consistency and reliability across domains
- Performance on multi-hop reasoning tasks, while improved, still shows significant error rates with dataset-dependent improvements (3.75% on HOVER vs 8.31% on SciFact)

## Confidence
High confidence in the core technical contribution of using graph structures for fact-checking representation and the basic three-component architecture.
Medium confidence in the claimed performance improvements due to dataset dependency and potential generalizability issues.
Low confidence in scalability and robustness claims due to limited testing across diverse domains and insufficient analysis of failure cases.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset validation by training on one dataset and testing on another to assess generalization capabilities beyond the reported in-dataset performance metrics.

2. Implement error analysis on a sample of incorrectly classified claims to identify systematic failure modes in the graph construction and reasoning components, particularly focusing on how triplet extraction errors propagate through the system.

3. Test the framework on claims requiring more than two reasoning hops or involving temporal/spatial reasoning to evaluate whether the graph-based approach maintains its advantages for genuinely complex fact-checking tasks beyond the current dataset limitations.
