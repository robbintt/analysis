# MAGE-ID: A Multimodal Generative Framework for Intrusion Detection Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03375
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03375
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: MAGE-ID couples tabular network flow features with DeepInsight-transformed images using a unified latent diffusion prior, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion baselines across fidelity, detectability, and downstream machine learning efficacy with improvements of 5-10% in precision, density, and coverage while maintaining near-perfect downstream detection performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MAGE-ID, a multimodal generative framework for intrusion detection systems that couples tabular network flow features with their DeepInsight-transformed images using a unified latent diffusion prior. The method employs modality-specific variational autoencoders (Transformer-based for tabular data and CNN-based for images) jointly trained with an EDM-style diffusion denoiser to capture cross-modal dependencies and synthesize balanced, coherent intrusion samples. Evaluated on CIC-IDS-2017 and NSL-KDD datasets, MAGE-ID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion baselines TabSyn and TabDDPM across fidelity (PRDC metrics), detectability, and downstream machine learning efficacy, achieving improvements of 5-10% in precision, density, and coverage while maintaining near-perfect downstream detection performance.

## Method Summary
MAGE-ID is a two-stage generative framework that first encodes paired tabular and DeepInsight image data into standardized latent vectors using modality-specific VAEs (Transformer-based for tabular, CNN-based for images), then jointly models these concatenated latents with an EDM-style diffusion denoiser. The framework uses β-annealed VAE training (1.0→0.1 over first 30% of epochs) to stabilize training and yield smoother latent manifolds, followed by latent-space diffusion sampling (50 steps, S_churn=3.0, S_noise=1.2) to generate synthetic multimodal intrusion samples. The DeepInsight transformation encodes pairwise feature relations spatially, providing a structural prior that anchors tabular generations to coherent visual representations.

## Key Results
- MAGE-ID achieves 5-10% improvements in precision, density, and coverage compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines TabSyn and TabDDPM across CIC-IDS-2017 and NSL-KDD datasets
- The framework maintains near-perfect downstream detection performance (MLE AUC) while significantly improving support for minority attack types
- MAGE-ID offers the fastest sampling time (3.6s) compared to TabSyn (13.2s) and TabDDPM (56s) due to its latent-space diffusion design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Modal Latent Coupling for Regularization
Jointly modeling tabular and image latents under a unified diffusion prior constrains synthetic samples to stay on-manifold while expanding coverage of underrepresented attack classes. Two modality-specific VAEs encode paired data into standardized latent vectors that are concatenated and modeled by an EDM-style denoiser. The image branch encodes pairwise feature relations spatially via DeepInsight, providing a structural prior that anchors tabular generations to coherent visual representations. This cross-modal constraint reduces off-manifold drift and improves fidelity and coverage.

### Mechanism 2: β-Annealed VAE Training for Latent Smoothness
Annealing the KL divergence weight stabilizes VAE training and yields smoother latent manifolds that support reliable diffusion sampling and interpolation. The β coefficient decays from 1.0 to 0.1 over the first 30% of training epochs. Early regularization prevents posterior collapse; later relaxation improves reconstruction fidelity. Posterior samples (K=3) are drawn, standardized per-dimension, then concatenated before diffusion training.

### Mechanism 3: EDM-Style Denoiser with Noise-Conditioned Preconditioning
An MLP denoiser trained with σ-dependent preconditioning captures the joint latent distribution more stably than score-based or GAN alternatives, enabling fast sampling and high coverage. The denoiser predicts clean latents from noised inputs using EDM preconditioning and weighting. Latent-space diffusion avoids high-dimensional reconstruction cost and provides stable denoising for heterogeneous tabular+image latent spaces.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Reparameterization**
  - Why needed here: Both modalities use VAEs to learn compressed latent representations; understanding μ, log-σ², KL divergence, and the reparameterization trick is essential for debugging reconstruction loss and latent space geometry.
  - Quick check question: If reconstruction loss plateaus high while KL drops to near-zero, what is happening and how would β-annealing affect it?

- Concept: **Diffusion Models (Denoising Score Matching / EDM)**
  - Why needed here: Stage 2 trains an EDM-style denoiser on concatenated latents; familiarity with forward noising, reverse denoising, σ-conditioning, and sampler parameters (S_churn, S_noise) is required to tune generation quality.
  - Quick check question: What happens to sample diversity if S_churn is set too low versus too high during sampling?

- Concept: **DeepInsight Tabular-to-Image Transformation**
  - Why needed here: The image modality is not raw pixel data but a t-SNE-derived spatial mapping of tabular features. Understanding how feature correlations become spatial adjacency clarifies why images regularize tabular generation.
  - Quick check question: If two highly correlated features are mapped to distant pixels in the DeepInsight output, will the cross-modal constraint strengthen or weaken, and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Tabular flow data and DeepInsight images → Transformer-VAE and CNN-VAE (Stage 1) → Concatenated standardized latents → EDM-style MLP denoiser (Stage 2) → Denoised latents → VAE decoders → Synthetic multimodal intrusion samples

- Critical path: DeepInsight mapping must be fit on training split only; VAEs must converge with stable KL before diffusion training; latent standardization must match between training and sampling; EDM hyperparameters directly control fidelity/coverage tradeoff.

- Design tradeoffs: Latent dimension (64 per modality) affects compression vs detail; K=3 posterior samples balances stability vs overhead; 50 sampling steps trades speed vs quality; S_churn=3.0 balances diversity vs precision.

- Failure signatures: High reconstruction loss + near-zero KL indicates posterior collapse; synthetic tabular values out of valid range suggests decoder not constrained; images visually incoherent indicates DeepInsight mapping or image VAE issues; MLE AUC drops suggests synthetic data not preserving task-relevant structure.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablate image modality: Train tabular-only VAE+diffusion and compare PRDC/Density/Coverage vs. full MAGE-ID. Expect Precision drop and Coverage reduction if cross-modal constraint is active.
  2. Vary β schedule: Test fixed β ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 1.0} vs. annealed 1.0→0.1. Monitor reconstruction loss, KL, and downstream MLE AUC.
  3. Sweep S_churn: Generate samples at S_churn ∈ {0, 1, 3, 5, 10} and plot Precision vs. Coverage to identify optimal operating point.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does MAGE-ID perform when extended to truly heterogeneous modalities (e.g., PCAP files, payload bytes, system logs) rather than derived image representations?
- Can MAGE-ID's multimodal diffusion framework be adapted for temporal sequence modeling and cross-dataset transfer learning?
- How does MAGE-ID generalize to attack types with less distinct flow-level signatures or highly imbalanced distributions beyond the evaluated PortScan and DDoS categories?
- What is the sensitivity of MAGE-ID's generation quality to the choice of posterior samples (K) and β-annealing schedule?

## Limitations
- Cross-modal coupling benefits are inferred but not directly isolated in ablation studies
- EDM preconditioning details are underspecified and generalization from image to multimodal spaces is assumed
- Beta-annealing schedule is a design choice with limited ablation and may not be optimal for heterogeneous modalities

## Confidence
- **High**: Downstream MLE AUC improvements on CIC-IDS-2017 and NSL-KDD; relative speed advantage over TabSyn/TabDDPM
- **Medium**: PRDC fidelity gains and detectability scores; multimodal VAE+diffusion architecture feasibility
- **Low**: Specific contribution of cross-modal regularization; optimal EDM hyperparameters for tabular+image latents

## Next Checks
1. Ablate image modality: Train tabular-only VAE+diffusion and compare PRDC/Density/Coverage vs. full MAGE-ID on same data split
2. Vary β schedule: Test fixed β ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 1.0} vs. annealed 1.0→0.1 and monitor reconstruction loss, KL, and downstream MLE AUC
3. Sweep S_churn: Generate samples at S_churn ∈ {0, 1, 3, 5, 10} and plot Precision vs. Coverage to identify optimal operating point
