# Multi-Hop Reasoning for Question Answering with Hyperbolic Representations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.03612
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03612
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Key outcome:** Hyperbolic representations consistently outperform Euclidean ones in multi-hop reasoning, with improvements of 1.57% to 5.41% in exact match scores.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the use of hyperbolic versus Euclidean representations for multi-hop reasoning in question answering tasks. The authors propose integrating a hyperbolic layer into standard encoder-decoder models and evaluate this approach across four datasets. Their findings demonstrate that hyperbolic representations consistently yield better performance than traditional Euclidean approaches, with improvements ranging from 1.57% to 5.41% in exact match scores. The study also reveals that initializing curvature using dataset-specific delta hyperbolicity produces superior results compared to random initialization, and that datasets with more hierarchical structures benefit more from hyperbolic representations.

## Method Summary
The authors modify standard encoder-decoder models by incorporating a hyperbolic layer that enables learning in hyperbolic space rather than traditional Euclidean space. This layer is designed to capture hierarchical relationships inherent in many question-answering datasets. The model is trained across four different multi
