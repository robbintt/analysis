# Persuasive or Neutral? A Field Experiment on Generative AI in Online Travel Planning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.14259
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14259
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Both enthusiastic and neutral AI tones increased user subscriptions compared to control, with enthusiastic tone driving longer prompts and distinct linguistic patterns

## Executive Summary
A field experiment on a travel planning platform investigated how AI assistant communication tone affects user engagement and subscription behavior. The study randomly assigned users to interact with AI assistants instructed to use either enthusiastic or neutral tone, compared to a control group with no tone instructions. Results showed that both enthusiastic and neutral AI tones significantly increased subscription rates compared to the control group, with enthusiastic AI prompting users to write longer, more detailed prompts. The research also revealed that AI tone influenced how users expressed themselves linguistically, with enthusiastic tone leading to more punctuation and spatial references, while neutral tone encouraged positive emotions and questions.

## Method Summary
The study employed a randomized field experiment on a travel planning platform, assigning users to three conditions: AI with enthusiastic tone instructions, AI with neutral tone instructions, or control (no tone instructions). The researchers measured subscription rates, user prompt length, and conducted linguistic analysis of user-AI interactions. The experiment tracked how different AI communication styles affected both user behavior and the linguistic patterns in their responses, providing insights into the relationship between AI tone, user engagement, and conversion outcomes.

## Key Results
- Both enthusiastic and neutral AI tones increased subscription rates compared to control group
- Users interacting with enthusiastic AI wrote significantly longer prompts, indicating higher engagement
- AI tone influenced user linguistic patterns: enthusiastic tone led to more punctuation and spatial references, while neutral tone encouraged positive emotion and interrogatives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of both enthusiastic and neutral AI tones likely stems from their ability to create appropriate psychological distance and trust with users. Enthusiastic tone may increase engagement through emotional contagion and excitement, encouraging users to invest more effort in their queries. Neutral tone may foster trust through perceived objectivity and professionalism, making users more comfortable sharing information. The distinct linguistic patterns suggest that users subconsciously mirror the communication style they encounter, adapting their self-expression to match the AI's tone. This mirroring effect, combined with the appropriate emotional framing for the task, creates conditions conducive to increased engagement and conversion.

## Foundational Learning
- **Randomized controlled trials** - Essential for establishing causal relationships between AI communication style and user behavior; quick check: verify randomization and control group design
- **Linguistic mirroring** - Users adapt their language patterns to match their conversational partner; quick check: analyze response patterns across different AI tones
- **Communication tone effects** - Different emotional registers (enthusiastic vs. neutral) can trigger distinct psychological responses; quick check: measure emotional valence and engagement metrics
- **User engagement metrics** - Prompt length and linguistic complexity serve as indicators of user investment; quick check: correlate engagement signals with conversion outcomes
- **Natural language processing analysis** - Required to quantify linguistic patterns and their relationship to behavior; quick check: validate linguistic feature extraction methods
- **Conversion optimization** - Understanding how communication style influences purchasing decisions; quick check: track subscription rates across conditions

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** User -> AI Interface -> Language Model -> Response Generator -> User Feedback Loop
**Critical Path:** User prompt → AI tone application → Response generation → User reaction → Behavioral outcome measurement
**Design Tradeoffs:** Enthusiasm vs. professionalism balance, engagement depth vs. conversion efficiency, linguistic complexity vs. accessibility
**Failure Signatures:** No tone difference effect, reversed engagement patterns, inconsistent linguistic mirroring, tone-user mismatch
**First Experiments:**
1. Test different enthusiasm levels (low, medium, high) to find optimal engagement point
2. Vary response length while maintaining tone consistency
3. Implement A/B testing with industry-specific tone variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings based on single travel planning platform, limiting generalizability
- Unclear causal mechanism linking AI tone to subscription rates
- Analysis shows correlations between linguistic patterns and behavior but cannot establish causation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Both enthusiastic and neutral AI tones increase subscriptions vs. control
- **Medium Confidence**: Enthusiastic AI prompts longer user engagement
- **Medium Confidence**: Linguistic patterns correlate with behavioral outcomes

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiment across multiple platforms and domains to test generalizability
2. Conduct controlled experiments isolating specific linguistic features to establish causality
3. Perform qualitative studies to understand user perceptions and decision-making processes
