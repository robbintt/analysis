# CoAtNeXt:An Attention-Enhanced ConvNeXtV2-Transformer Hybrid Model for Gastric Tissue Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.09242
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09242
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Hybrid ConvNeXtV2-CBAM-Transformer model achieves >96% accuracy on gastric tissue classification

## Executive Summary
This study presents CoAtNeXt, a hybrid deep learning architecture designed for automated histopathological classification of gastric tissue images. The model addresses the limitations of manual pathological evaluation, which is labor-intensive and subject to inter-observer variability. By combining ConvNeXtV2 blocks with CBAM attention mechanisms within a CoAtNet framework, CoAtNeXt leverages both local feature extraction from convolutions and global contextual modeling from transformers. The approach demonstrates exceptional performance on two large public datasets, suggesting its potential to assist pathologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload for early gastric disease detection.

## Method Summary
CoAtNeXt is a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates ConvNeXtV2 blocks with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) attention mechanisms into the CoAtNet framework. The architecture combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks for local feature extraction with transformers for global contextual understanding. The model was trained and evaluated on two public histopathological image datasets: HMU-GC-HE-30K (eight-class classification) and GasHisSDB (binary classification). The CBAM attention modules enhance feature maps by focusing on informative regions, while the ConvNeXtV2 backbone provides efficient feature extraction. The hybrid design aims to capture both fine-grained local details and broader contextual relationships in gastric tissue images.

## Key Results
- Achieved 96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1-score, and 99.89% AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K dataset
- Achieved 98.29% accuracy, 98.07% precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1-score, and 99.90% AUC on GasHisSDB dataset
- Outperformed ten CNNs and ten ViTs in comprehensive comparative evaluation
- Demonstrated robust performance across both multi-class and binary classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The CoAtNeXt architecture succeeds by effectively combining the complementary strengths of convolutional and transformer-based approaches. ConvNeXtV2 provides efficient local feature extraction with improved scaling properties, while CBAM attention mechanisms dynamically highlight diagnostically relevant regions in histopathological images. The CoAtNet framework enables seamless integration of these components, allowing the model to capture both fine-grained cellular details and broader tissue architecture patterns essential for accurate gastric tissue classification.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input images -> ConvNeXtV2 backbone -> CBAM attention modules -> Transformer blocks -> Classification head

Critical path: The model processes input images through ConvNeXtV2 layers for initial feature extraction, applies CBAM attention to enhance discriminative features, passes features through transformer blocks for global context modeling, and finally produces classification predictions through a fully connected layer.

Design tradeoffs: The architecture balances computational efficiency (via ConvNeXtV2) with expressive power (via transformers), while CBAM attention adds minimal overhead but significant performance gains. The hybrid approach trades increased model complexity for improved diagnostic accuracy.

Failure signatures: Potential failures include overfitting to specific staining patterns, sensitivity to tissue preparation variations, and reduced performance on underrepresented tissue subtypes. The model may also struggle with rare pathological findings not well-represented in training data.

3 first experiments:
1. Ablation study removing CBAM attention modules to quantify their contribution to overall performance
2. Cross-stain evaluation using different histological staining protocols to assess robustness
3. External validation on multi-institutional datasets to evaluate real-world generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability across different staining protocols and scanner types

- No external validation on independent, multi-institutional datasets

## Confidence
- Performance claims: High (comprehensive metrics and comparative evaluation)
- Clinical deployment claims: Medium (lack of external validation and real-world testing)
- Architectural contribution claims: Medium (contribution of individual components unclear)

## Next Checks
1. External validation on multi-institutional gastric histopathology datasets with varying staining protocols and scanner types to assess real-world robustness
2. Ablation study to quantify the individual contributions of CBAM attention, ConvNeXtV2 blocks, and CoAtNet integration to overall performance
3. Clinical workflow integration testing with pathologists to evaluate practical utility, including time savings and diagnostic agreement rates in a prospective setting
