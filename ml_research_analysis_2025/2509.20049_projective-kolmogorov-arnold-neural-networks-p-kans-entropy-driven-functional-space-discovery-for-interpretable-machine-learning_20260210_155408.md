# Projective Kolmogorov Arnold Neural Networks (P-KANs): Entropy-Driven Functional Space Discovery for Interpretable Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.20049
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20049
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** 80% parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity through entropy-driven functional space discovery

## Executive Summary
P-KANs address the redundancy problem in standard Kolmogorov Arnold Networks by introducing entropy-driven functional space discovery. The method guides high-dimensional spline edge functions toward lower-dimensional structured representations (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel) while maintaining flexibility. By minimizing the entropy of projection coefficients, the framework achieves up to 80% parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity and improving noise robustness. The approach demonstrates superior performance in both synthetic and industrial applications, including an AFP laser scan dataset with only 14 training samples achieving RMSE≈0.08.

## Method Summary
The P-KAN framework extends standard KANs by introducing an entropy-driven projection mechanism that guides edge functions from high-dimensional spline spaces toward structured functional representations. The unified loss function combines standard reconstruction loss with entropy regularization and edge-specific penalties. For each edge, projection coefficients are calculated across candidate functional spaces (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel), and their entropy determines optimal basis selection via softmin weighting. Edges with high R² fit to functional bases are replaced with parametric functions, followed by retraining with regret monitoring to prevent degradation. The method uses batched operations for efficient projection and implements a revert mechanism if validation loss increases beyond a tolerance threshold.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 80% parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity
- Demonstrated improved robustness to noise (validation losses < 10⁻³ across 5-30 dB SNR vs standard KANs exceeding 10¹³)
- Industrial AFP application achieved RMSE≈0.08 with only 14 training samples
- Maintained performance across diverse function types including discontinuous and oscillatory patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging information theory principles to identify and eliminate redundancy in KAN edge representations. Standard KANs use high-dimensional spline functions that can overfit and contain unnecessary parameters. By minimizing the entropy of projection coefficients, P-KANs identify when edges can be accurately represented by lower-dimensional structured functions. The softmin weighting ensures smooth transitions between functional spaces based on local functional relationships, allowing different edges to converge to different optimal representations. This selective compression preserves essential features while eliminating nuisance parameters that contribute to overfitting and computational inefficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- **Entropy-based redundancy detection:** Measures information content in projection coefficients to identify overparameterized edges
  - Why needed: Standard KANs use unnecessarily high-dimensional splines that waste parameters
  - Quick check: Verify entropy decreases during training and correlates with parameter reduction

- **Functional space projection:** Maps high-dimensional splines to structured bases (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel)
  - Why needed: Enables compression while maintaining representational accuracy
  - Quick check: Confirm R² > 0.6 threshold is consistently met before edge replacement

- **Softmin weighting mechanism:** Smoothly selects optimal functional basis based on entropy distribution
  - Why needed: Prevents abrupt transitions between functional spaces that could destabilize training
  - Quick check: Monitor entropy-weighted scores across candidate bases during optimization

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input -> KAN with splines -> Entropy calculation -> Softmin selection -> Edge replacement -> Regret monitoring -> Output

**Critical Path:** Training loop with unified loss → Projection coefficient calculation → Entropy minimization → Edge evaluation → Parametric replacement → Validation regret check

**Design Tradeoffs:** The 12.4x training time increase trades computational efficiency for parameter reduction and interpretability. The framework balances between complete spline flexibility and structured functional representation, allowing selective compression where beneficial.

**Failure Signatures:** Excessive training time due to unoptimized projection steps, premature edge fixing with low R² scores, validation loss spikes after edge replacement indicating over-compression.

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement and benchmark softmin weighting λ across range 0.1-10.0 to find optimal entropy reduction balance
2. Profile projection step to ensure batched DCT/DFT operations are used for computational efficiency
3. Systematically test R² threshold variation (0.4-0.8) to optimize parameter reduction vs accuracy tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- 12.4x training time increase creates significant computational burden that may limit practical adoption
- Effectiveness heavily depends on careful hyperparameter tuning of α, β, γ and λ scheduling
- Bessel function implementation lacks specific series truncation parameters and detailed code
- Method requires monitoring of regret metrics during retraining to prevent degradation

## Confidence
- **High:** Core entropy minimization framework and unified loss formulation (Eq. 12)
- **Medium:** Edge replacement criterion and regret function mechanics  
- **Low:** Specific implementation details for Bessel projections and hyperparameter scheduling

## Next Checks
1. Implement and benchmark the softmin weighting λ across a range of values (0.1-10.0) to determine optimal balance between entropy reduction and reconstruction fidelity
2. Profile the projection step to verify that batched DCT/DFT operations are used rather than edge-by-edge computation to avoid excessive training time
3. Systematically test the edge replacement threshold by varying R² criteria (0.4-0.8) and measuring the impact on both parameter reduction and validation loss across multiple synthetic function datasets
