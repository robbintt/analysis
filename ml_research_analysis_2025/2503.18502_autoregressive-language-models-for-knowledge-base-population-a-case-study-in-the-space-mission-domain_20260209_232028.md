# Autoregressive Language Models for Knowledge Base Population: A case study in the space mission domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.18502
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18502
- Authors: Andrés García-Silva; José Manuel Gómez-Pérez
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Fine-tuning smaller Pythia models (1B-2.8B) on synthetic KBP data achieves >90% syntactic correctness and strong semantic accuracy in the space mission domain without requiring the ontology in prompts.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates fine-tuning autoregressive language models for end-to-end knowledge base population (KBP) in the space mission domain. Instead of using large general-purpose models, the authors fine-tune smaller Pythia models (160M-12B parameters) on a synthetic dataset generated via instruction-tuning. The task involves extracting instances from a predefined ontology and serializing them in Turtle format based on mission descriptions from ESA's EOPortal. The study demonstrates that models with 1B+ parameters achieve high syntactic correctness (>90%) and strong semantic accuracy, with the 1B model offering the best cost-performance ratio.

## Method Summary
The authors generate a synthetic dataset for end-to-end KBP by using Llama3-8B-Instruct to extract ontology instances from mission summaries and serialize them to Turtle format. Invalid outputs undergo iterative correction through lexical-syntactic fixes (namespace correction, date formatting) and semantic fixes (domain/range constraint filtering) across 9 rounds. The corrected dataset is then used to fine-tune Pythia models of varying sizes (160M-12B parameters) with supervised fine-tuning (next token prediction). LoRA is applied for models ≥2.8B. The fine-tuned models are evaluated on a validation set of 172 missions using syntactic validity checks and semantic accuracy measured by ROUGE-L and LLM-based similarity against CEOS database ground truth.

## Key Results
- Pythia models with 1B+ parameters achieve >90% syntactic validity in Turtle generation
- The 1B model demonstrates competitive semantic accuracy (0.617 LLM-similarity) at significantly lower inference cost compared to the 2.8B model
- Models with 1B+ parameters perform better without the ontology in the prompt, suggesting internalization of schema during fine-tuning
- Smaller models (<410M) benefit from including the ontology in prompts, while larger models (>1B) suffer from context overflow

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Synthetic Dataset Generation with Iterative Correction
The teacher model (Llama3-8B) generates initial Turtle extractions from mission summaries, which undergo iterative correction through heuristics. This process converts 23% initial validity to 97% final validity by applying namespace fixes, date formatting, and domain/range constraint filtering. The correction pipeline is effective because teacher model errors are systematic and correctable, enabling high-quality training data for downstream fine-tuning.

### Mechanism 2: Ontology Schema Internalization
During instruction fine-tuning, models repeatedly condition on ontology descriptions paired with extraction tasks, encoding class-property constraints into weights. This internalization allows models to retrieve the schema from memory rather than reading it from context, enabling inference without explicit ontology in prompts. This mechanism is particularly effective for models with 1B+ parameters that have sufficient capacity to memorize the schema.

### Mechanism 3: Domain Specialization Compensates for Scale
Fine-tuning redirects pre-training capacity toward ontology-compliant triple generation, with the constrained output vocabulary (RDF properties, class instances) reducing the hypothesis space compared to open-ended generation. This domain-specialized approach enables competitive KBP performance at 1B parameters, achieving >90% syntactic validity versus 49% for zero-shot Llama3-8B, demonstrating that scale is not the primary determinant of success for this structured task.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: RDF/Turtle serialization** - Why needed: The model outputs extracted triples in Turtle format; understanding subject-predicate-object syntax, prefixes, and literal datatypes is essential for debugging invalid outputs. Quick check: Given `ex:Mission1 ex:launchDate "2025-01-01"^^xsd:date .`, what are the subject, predicate, and object?

- **Concept: Ontology schema (classes, properties, domain/range constraints)** - Why needed: The paper evaluates whether extracted triples satisfy ontology constraints; you must interpret Table 1's class-property mappings to assess semantic validity. Quick check: If a property has domain `Mission` and range `Instrument`, what does that constrain about valid triples using this property?

- **Concept: Instruction fine-tuning objective** - Why needed: The paper uses next-token prediction on instruction-response pairs; understanding this clarifies why ontology schema can be internalized through repeated exposure. Quick check: In instruction fine-tuning, what does the model learn to maximize during training on (instruction, response) pairs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: EOPortal mission descriptions -> Llama3-8B-Instruct teacher model -> Iterative correction pipeline -> Pythia student models -> CEOS database validation
- **Critical path**: 1) Generate synthetic training pairs from EOPortal + ontology 2) Apply iterative correction heuristics until Turtle validity >95% 3) Fine-tune Pythia models (7 steps, batch size 8, lr=2e-5, early stopping) 4) Evaluate on 172-mission validation set with CEOS ground truth
- **Design tradeoffs**: Ontology in prompt improves <1B models but harms ≥1B models by consuming context capacity; 1B offers best cost-performance ratio while 2.8B yields marginal accuracy gains at 3× inference cost; LoRA reduces trainable parameters for ≥2.8B but may underfit complex ontologies
- **Failure signatures**: Invalid Turtle (missing semicolons, malformed dates, undefined prefixes); semantic violations (triples with subject not in property's domain or object not in range); entity drift (generated instrument/orbit names not grounded in input text)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate synthetic data generation on 50 missions; validate Turtle correctness after 3 correction iterations 2) Fine-tune Pythia-1B with and without ontology in prompt; compare ROUGE-L on 20 held-out missions 3) Measure inference latency and memory for 1B vs 2.8B models on 100-mission batch; quantify cost-accuracy tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can entity canonicalization be effectively integrated into an end-to-end autoregressive KBP framework to map extracted entity mentions to pre-existing Knowledge Base IDs?
- Does the fine-tuning approach generalize to other domain-specific ontologies or natural language datasets without requiring the generation of new synthetic training data?
- Why does the exclusion of the ontology from the prompt yield better performance for models with 1B+ parameters?
- To what extent do the heuristic corrections applied during synthetic data generation limit the semantic accuracy of the fine-tuned models?

## Limitations
- The approach relies on synthetic training data quality, where residual noise and hallucinations in teacher outputs could propagate subtle errors into fine-tuned models
- Evaluation is constrained to a single space mission ontology (CEOS) and dataset (EOPortal), limiting generalizability to other domains
- The study does not benchmark against larger frontier models like GPT-4 or Gemini, leaving absolute performance ceilings untested

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The syntactic correctness (>90%) of fine-tuned models (≥1B) is strongly supported by structured evaluation against CEOS ground truth
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that domain-specialized fine-tuning compensates for model scale is plausible but based on a limited domain and single benchmark
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism of ontology internalization through fine-tuning is theoretically sound but lacks direct empirical validation
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the correction heuristics and synthetic data generation pipeline to other domains or ontologies is untested

## Next Checks
1. **Synthetic Data Quality Audit**: Replicate synthetic data generation on a held-out subset of 50 missions. After 3 correction iterations, validate Turtle correctness using an RDF parser and compare against ground truth to quantify residual noise.
2. **Generalization Probe**: Test the best fine-tuned model (2.8B or 1B) on a different domain (e.g., biomedical mission summaries) with a modified ontology. Measure syntactic and semantic validity to assess transfer learning capability.
3. **LLM-Judge Prompt Analysis**: Implement and test multiple variations of the LLM-as-judge similarity prompt to determine sensitivity to prompt phrasing and establish a standardized evaluation protocol.
