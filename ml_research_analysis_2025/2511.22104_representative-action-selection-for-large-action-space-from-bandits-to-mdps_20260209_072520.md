# Representative Action Selection for Large Action Space: From Bandits to MDPs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22104
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22104
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: A simple epsilon-net algorithm achieves regret comparable to full action space under a relaxed sub-Gaussian process model.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of selecting a small, representative action subset from an extremely large action space shared across a family of reinforcement learning environments. The core method extends a previous meta-bandit framework to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), proving that a simple epsilon-net algorithm achieves performance comparable to using the full action space. The primary result shows that under a relaxed, non-centered sub-Gaussian process model, the expected maximum regret is bounded by the maximum Gaussian width of action clusters plus a term that decreases as the sample size increases.

## Method Summary
The method takes a family of MDPs with shared state space and action space, partitions the environment parameter space to induce action space clusters, and uses Algorithm 1 (an epsilon-net) to sample environments and collect optimal actions into representative action sets. The performance is theoretically bounded by combining cluster regret analysis with a penalty term that decays exponentially with sample size. The approach requires solving K MDPs exactly to build the representative action set, trading computational cost for a reduced action space during deployment.

## Key Results
- Expected maximum regret is bounded by cluster regret plus a diminishing penalty term under sub-Gaussian assumptions
- The penalty term scales as (∑pℓ(1-pℓ)²ᵏ)^(1/2) · E[(max(x,a)∈Z Q*(x,a))²]^(1/2) and decays exponentially with sample size K
- Increasing sample size K exponentially increases the probability of covering all important action clusters
- CartPole experiments show runtime reduction while maintaining comparable performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cluster Regret Bounding via Sub-Gaussian Structure
The algorithm constructs a reference action set by sampling environments. The regret analysis decomposes total expected regret into cluster-level regret plus a penalty term for missed clusters. The sub-Gaussian assumption on Q*-values enables concentration inequalities like Borell-TIS to bound the maximum regret. The penalty term shrinks exponentially with sample size K due to independent sampling.

### Mechanism 2: Action Space Partitioning via Environment Parameter Clustering
Partitioning the environment parameter space induces a natural partition of the action space for each state. Each action cluster contains optimal actions for environments in corresponding parameter clusters. Compactness of these clusters ensures bounded diameters, which controls intra-cluster regret. Selecting one representative action from each cluster forms the reference action set.

### Mechanism 3: Sample Complexity and Coverage Trade-off
The algorithm samples K environments i.i.d. The probability of missing any cluster with probability pℓ in all K samples is (1-pℓ)^K. The regret bound includes a term scaling with √(∑pℓ(1-pℓ)²ᵏ) that decreases exponentially with K, providing a direct trade-off between computational cost and performance loss.

## Foundational Learning

- **Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the Optimal Q-Function (Q*)**: Why needed: The framework is built on optimal state-action value functions for a family of MDPs. Quick check: If I have an MDP with two states and two actions, how is Q*(x,a) related to immediate reward and future values?

- **Gaussian and Sub-Gaussian Random Processes**: Why needed: The theoretical guarantee relies on Q*-values forming a sub-Gaussian process. Quick check: What does it mean for a random process to be sub-Gaussian? Why is the "tail bound" property crucial for bounding the maximum of many random variables?

- **Measure-Theoretic Epsilon-Nets**: Why needed: The algorithm's goal is finding a small representative subset, justified by measure-theoretic epsilon-nets that guarantee high-probability regions are covered. Quick check: How does a measure-theoretic epsilon-net differ from a geometric epsilon-net? Why is the measure-theoretic version preferred for high-dimensional spaces?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: 
  - Meta-RL Environment Family (parameterized MDPs with θ ~ p) 
  - Feature Map φ(x,a) (maps state-action pairs to R^n) 
  -> Environment Partition (finite partition {Θℓ} of parameter space) 
  -> Action Clusters (r_{x,ℓ} = optimal actions for environments in Θℓ) 
  -> Algorithm 1 (epsilon-net sampling and optimal action collection) 
  -> Reference Action Set (theoretical ideal baseline)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Define problem and assumptions (family of MDPs, feature map, environment distribution, sub-Gaussian Q*)
  2. Partition action space using environment partition to derive action clusters
  3. Analyze cluster regret using Gaussian width and sub-Gaussian tail property
  4. Run Algorithm 1 with chosen sample size K to obtain representative action set
  5. Apply Theorem 6.1 to bound expected maximum state regret

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Sample size K vs. performance: Higher K yields tighter bounds but increases computational cost
  - Partition granularity (m) vs. regret bound tightness: Finer partitions create smaller clusters but require more samples to cover all clusters
  - Exact vs. approximate Q*: Using approximate Q-functions reduces computational burden but introduces additional error terms

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High, non-decreasing regret despite increasing K suggests violated sub-Gaussian assumption or non-compact clusters
  - Performance worse than random baseline indicates sparse optimal actions across environments
  - High sensitivity to partition choice suggests poor cluster separation or localization

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement Algorithm 1 on synthetic tabular MDPs and compare observed loss against theoretical upper bound
  2. Replicate CartPole experiments with systematic variation of environment partition granularity
  3. Test robustness to sub-Gaussian violation by using heavy-tailed Q-values and comparing performance decay

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can approximation errors be effectively controlled in infinite-dimensional feature spaces where Gaussian width of a Euclidean ball is infinite?
- Basis: Remark 6.1 states the current argument fails for n=∞ because G(B) is infinite
- Why unresolved: Requires replacing Euclidean ball with ellipsoid but specific theoretical guarantees not derived
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical bound for infinite-dimensional case using ellipsoidal constraints

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the sample complexity required to learn representative action subset when optimal Q* functions are initially unknown?
- Basis: Algorithm 1 assumes access to argmax Q* but practical RL requires estimation
- Why unresolved: Corollary 6.1 bounds fixed approximation error δ but doesn't analyze cost of reducing it
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of sample complexity for meta-training phase accounting for exploration

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does choice of environment partition {Θℓ} influence tightness of regret bounds and algorithm's convergence?
- Basis: Section 4.2.1 defines partition but assumes fixed structure without optimization guidance
- Why unresolved: Bounds depend on cluster diameters and probabilities pℓ determined by partition choice
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis showing how different partitioning strategies affect subset size and price term

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees critically depend on sub-Gaussian assumption for Q*-value process
- Method's effectiveness requires compact action clusters which may be challenging in high-dimensional spaces
- Requires solving K MDPs exactly (or approximately), potentially prohibitive for complex environments

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core regret bound structure and decomposition are mathematically sound assuming stated assumptions hold; CartPole experimental results are robust
- **Medium Confidence**: Sub-Gaussian assumption may not hold in all practical scenarios; partitioning scheme's effectiveness depends heavily on problem structure
- **Low Confidence**: Performance in domains with highly sparse optimal actions or poorly aligned action space partitions; sensitivity to approximation error δ not fully characterized

## Next Checks

1. **Sub-Gaussian Robustness Test**: Construct synthetic meta-MDP with heavy-tailed Q-values and measure how regret bound degrades compared to Gaussian case as K increases

2. **Cluster Compactness Stress Test**: Design high-dimensional action space with scattered optimal actions across environments and analyze whether cluster diameter term dominates regret bound

3. **Approximation Error Characterization**: Implement Algorithm 1 with known approximation error δ and empirically measure additional regret compared to theoretical bound in Corollary 6.1
