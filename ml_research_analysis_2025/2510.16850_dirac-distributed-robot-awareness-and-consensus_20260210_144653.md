# DiRAC - Distributed Robot Awareness and Consensus

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16850
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16850
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Scalable distributed framework for large robotic swarms with zone-partitioned architecture, tick-synchronized consensus, and force-based path planning

## Executive Summary
DiRAC is a distributed framework for coordinating large robotic swarms that integrates task assignment, consensus, and collision-free path planning. The system partitions the operational map into zones with dynamically elected leaders and uses a tick-synchronized protocol to maintain strong consistency. A novel force-based, decentralized planner resolves real-time collision conflicts across multiple types (vertex, edge, static, deadlock). Preliminary ROS 2 simulations validated leader election, consensus synchronization, and stable inter-zone communication while achieving O(G log G) complexity for path planning.

## Method Summary
The system uses a zone-partitioned architecture where agents subscribe to zone-specific topics and coordinate through locally elected leaders. A Super-Leader manages global load balancing while Zone Leaders handle local consensus and job assignment. The framework implements a RAFT-inspired consensus protocol with logical ticks, where leaders advance the global clock only after receiving acknowledgments from all agents. Agents use A* with Manhattan heuristic for initial path intent, then apply force-based modifications to resolve collisions in real-time. The planner handles vertex, edge, static, and deadlock collisions through a physics-inspired approach with exponential force ramping for deadlock resolution.

## Key Results
- Achieves O(G log G) complexity for path planning where G is agents per zone
- Validates leader election, tick synchronization, and inter-zone communication in ROS 2 simulations
- Supports scalability to thousands of agents through zone partitioning
- Resolves multiple collision types (vertex, edge, static, deadlock) with force-based planning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Tick-Synchronized State Consensus
If agents share a logical clock and block state progression until acknowledgments are received, the system maintains strong consistency and deterministic collision avoidance. The system implements a RAFT-inspired protocol where a zone leader advances a `global_tick` only after receiving acknowledgments on `/state_ack` and `/tick_ack` topics. This creates a "stop-the-world" effect where no agent acts on stale data.

### Mechanism 2: Force-Based Reactive Path Planning
If agents treat intended paths as physical forces, they can resolve collision conflicts (vertex, edge, deadlock) locally without global replanning. Agents calculate a resultant force vector $\vec{F}(q_i)$ based on their intent ($\vec{I}$) and the intent/position of conflicting neighbors. For deadlocks, the system applies "force ramping" (exponential scaling via a stuck counter $s$) to break symmetry.

### Mechanism 3: Zone-Partitioned Hierarchical Scaling
If the operational map is divided into static zones with overlapping boundaries, communication overhead scales with local density rather than total swarm size. A Super-Leader handles global load balancing (daisy-chaining agents between zones), while Zone Leaders manage local consensus and job assignment. Agents subscribe only to topics relevant to their current zone.

## Foundational Learning

- **RAFT Consensus Protocol**: Understanding leader election, log replication, and CP vs AP trade-offs is required to debug tick-blocking behavior. Quick check: What happens to the `global_tick` progression in a zone if 51% of agents suffer network packet loss?

- **Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) Types**: The planner distinguishes between Vertex, Edge, and Static collisions. Debugging force vectors requires identifying which conflict type is triggering the calculation. Quick check: If Agent A moves to B's current spot while B moves to A's current spot, is this a vertex or edge collision?

- **Computational Complexity in Distributed Systems**: The paper claims O(G log G) complexity. Understanding that G is agents per zone highlights why partitioning is critical for scaling. Quick check: If the zone size doubles but the number of zones stays the same, how does the theoretical path-planning latency change?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Super-Leader -> Zone Leaders -> Agent Nodes
- **Critical path**: Job Injection (Controller publishes job → Super-Leader routes to Zone) → Assignment (Zone Leader identifies lowest-cost agent → Agent accepts) → Sync (Leader pauses tick → Agents acknowledge state → Tick advances) → Planning (Agents calculate A* intent → Apply force modifications → Move)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Consistency vs. Latency (prefers stopping movement over moving with stale state data); Optimality vs. Speed (force-based planner is sub-optimal but ensures O(G log G) speed)
- **Failure signatures**: Zombie Agents (marked "dead" but still moving), Consensus Hang (global_tick stops incrementing), Deadlock Loop (agents oscillate or remain stationary)
- **First 3 experiments**: Baseline Consensus Test (kill Leader node mid-tick to verify leader promotion); Conflict Type Validation (setup specific scenarios and log force vectors); Scalability Limit (incrementally increase agents per zone and measure tick duration)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does DiRAC performance change when transferring from ROS 2 simulation to physical robotic hardware?
- Basis: The Conclusion states the current work lays the groundwork for deployment and lists "real-world deployment" as a key next step.
- Why unresolved: Validation was conducted entirely in preliminary simulation using RViz; physical latency, sensor noise, and actuator dynamics are not addressed.
- Evidence needed: Empirical data from hardware-in-the-loop testing or a physical warehouse pilot study.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can adaptive, density-aware zoning strategies effectively prevent zone saturation in highly dynamic environments?
- Basis: The Conclusion identifies "enhancing scalability through adaptive, density-aware zoning strategies" as a specific direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: Current architecture relies on static zone partitioning, which may lead to congestion if job distribution is highly asymmetrical.
- Evidence needed: Simulation results comparing static vs. dynamic zoning under non-uniform, high-density workload conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the framework maintain its claimed theoretical scalability (thousands of agents) given the experimental limitation to only 30 agents?
- Basis: The Abstract claims support for "scalability to thousands of agents," but the Experimental Setup only validated populations of 5, 10, 20, and 30 agents.
- Why unresolved: Large gap between theoretical complexity analysis (O(G log G)) and limited scale of empirical validation.
- Evidence needed: Benchmarking results showing stable consensus and path planning latency with agent counts in the hundreds or thousands.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the impact on system throughput when sacrificing availability for consistency (CP design) during network partitions?
- Basis: The Methodology states the consensus mechanism "sacrifices availability in favor of consistency," but the operational cost of this downtime is not quantified.
- Why unresolved: While the system guarantees safety, the frequency and duration of availability loss could render the system inefficient in noisy, real-world network conditions.
- Evidence needed: Metrics quantifying system downtime and job completion rate degradation under simulated packet loss or network partitioning.

## Limitations
- Performance under real-world network conditions remains untested; simulation assumes bounded latency within zones
- Force-based path planning may degrade in highly constrained environments where local minima are common
- Scalability to thousands of agents is theoretical; current validation is limited to small-scale ROS 2 simulations
- Load balancing via daisy-chaining may be too slow for dynamic, high-throughput job environments

## Confidence

- **High**: Zone-partitioned architecture improves scalability; tick-synchronized consensus ensures strong consistency
- **Medium**: Force-based collision resolution works in sparse-to-moderate density scenarios; leader election via proximity is effective
- **Low**: Real-world performance under packet loss, latency spikes, and high agent density is unverified

## Next Checks
1. **Network Stress Test**: Simulate 30% packet loss in a single zone to measure impact on tick synchronization and agent marking
2. **Deadlock Resilience**: Place 15 agents in a narrow corridor and record frequency of successful force ramping resolution
3. **Cross-Zone Scaling**: Deploy 100+ agents across multiple zones and measure Super-Leader migration response time under rapid job injection
