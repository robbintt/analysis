# Toward using explainable data-driven surrogate models for treating performance-based seismic design as an inverse engineering problem

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00286
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00286
- Reference count: 0
- This study presents a methodology to treat performance-based seismic design as an inverse engineering problem, where design parameters are directly derived to achieve specific performance objectives

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a methodology that treats performance-based seismic design as an inverse engineering problem by using explainable machine learning surrogate models to directly map design variables to performance metrics. The approach addresses computational inefficiencies in traditional performance-based design by implementing surrogate models as evaluation functions within a genetic optimization algorithm. The methodology is applied to steel and concrete moment frames in Los Angeles and Charleston to optimize sectional properties for minimizing expected annualized seismic loss.

The research demonstrates that this data-driven approach can achieve high accuracy (R² > 90%) across diverse building types, geometries, and seismic conditions while identifying optimal member properties consistent with engineering principles. By integrating explainable machine learning with genetic optimization, the methodology offers a promising alternative to computationally intensive traditional workflows in seismic design.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs machine learning surrogate models trained on performance data to predict structural responses, which are then integrated into a genetic optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem of determining design parameters that meet specific performance objectives. The approach directly maps design variables to performance metrics, bypassing computationally expensive traditional analyses. The surrogate models are trained on datasets generated from structural simulations, enabling rapid evaluation of design alternatives during optimization.

The genetic algorithm searches for optimal sectional properties of frame members while maintaining fixed geometric variables, with the surrogate model serving as the fitness function to minimize expected annualized seismic loss. This workflow is applied to two building inventories in different seismic regions, demonstrating the approach's ability to produce solutions consistent with engineering principles while achieving computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- Surrogate models achieved R² > 90% accuracy across diverse building types, geometries, and seismic conditions
- Genetic optimization successfully identified optimal member properties consistent with engineering principles
- Methodology demonstrated computational efficiency gains compared to traditional performance-based design workflows
- Applied successfully to both steel and concrete moment frames in Los Angeles and Charleston seismic regions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by replacing computationally expensive structural analyses with surrogate models that can rapidly predict performance metrics, enabling iterative optimization processes that would be impractical with traditional methods. The genetic algorithm efficiently explores the design space by using these surrogate models as evaluation functions, converging on optimal solutions without requiring full structural analyses at each iteration.

## Foundational Learning
- Surrogate modeling - Why needed: Reduces computational burden of performance evaluations; Quick check: Verify surrogate accuracy against full simulations
- Genetic algorithms - Why needed: Efficiently explores complex design spaces with multiple objectives; Quick check: Confirm convergence to global optimum
- Explainable ML - Why needed: Provides interpretability for engineering decisions; Quick check: Validate feature importance aligns with engineering intuition
- Performance-based design - Why needed: Framework for meeting specific performance objectives; Quick check: Ensure compliance with design codes
- Inverse problem formulation - Why needed: Enables direct determination of design parameters from performance goals; Quick check: Verify constraint satisfaction

## Architecture Onboarding
The methodology follows a component map of: Data Generation -> Surrogate Model Training -> Genetic Algorithm Optimization -> Performance Evaluation -> Optimal Design Identification. The critical path involves training accurate surrogate models that can reliably predict performance metrics, as the optimization algorithm's success depends entirely on these predictions.

Key design tradeoffs include balancing surrogate model complexity against computational efficiency, and between exploration and exploitation in the genetic algorithm. Failure signatures include surrogate model overfitting leading to suboptimal designs, and premature convergence of the genetic algorithm to local optima. Three first experiments would be: 1) Train surrogate models with varying complexity to identify optimal balance between accuracy and speed, 2) Test genetic algorithm performance with different population sizes and mutation rates, 3) Validate surrogate predictions against full structural analyses for diverse design scenarios.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Validation limited to steel and concrete moment frames in only two seismic regions (Los Angeles and Charleston)
- Limited comparative analysis with traditional performance-based design workflows and other surrogate modeling approaches
- Potential biases in training data and model performance when extrapolating beyond parameter ranges

## Confidence
High: Surrogate model accuracy (R² > 90%) and successful application to real building inventories
Medium: Computational efficiency gains and generalizability to other structural systems
Low: Claims about broader applicability without extensive validation across diverse conditions

## Next Checks
1. Apply the methodology to additional structural systems (e.g., braced frames, shear wall structures) and seismic regions with varying hazard characteristics to assess generalizability
2. Conduct a comparative analysis of computational efficiency gains against traditional performance-based design approaches and other surrogate modeling techniques
3. Perform extensive sensitivity analyses to identify potential biases in the training data and evaluate the models' performance when extrapolating beyond the initial parameter ranges
