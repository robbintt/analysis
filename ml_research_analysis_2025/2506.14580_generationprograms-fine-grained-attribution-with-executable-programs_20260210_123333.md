# GenerationPrograms: Fine-grained Attribution with Executable Programs
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14580
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14580
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces GenerationPrograms to attribute fine-grained LLM generation behaviors via executable programs

## Executive Summary
GenerationPrograms proposes a novel framework for attributing fine-grained generation behaviors in large language models by translating them into executable programs. The method aims to bridge the gap between model behaviors and human-interpretable explanations by providing executable, fine-grained attribution. It leverages program synthesis to map complex generation patterns into interpretable, executable representations.

## Method Summary
The approach uses program synthesis to convert LLM generation behaviors into executable programs, enabling fine-grained attribution. It assumes that complex generation decisions can be adequately represented by executable programs, which are then analyzed to attribute specific behaviors. The framework is tested in controlled settings, with scalability and generalizability to real-world scenarios remaining open questions.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates that GenerationPrograms can attribute fine-grained behaviors in controlled experiments
- Shows executable programs can represent generation behaviors, though validation is limited
- Highlights potential for bridging model behaviors and human interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GenerationPrograms works by translating complex LLM decision processes into executable programs, which can then be analyzed for fine-grained attribution. This mechanism assumes that program-based representations can capture the semantics of generation behaviors, enabling interpretable explanations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Program Synthesis**: Needed to translate LLM behaviors into executable programs; quick check: verify synthesized programs match target behaviors.
- **Attribution Methods**: Required to map programs back to generation decisions; quick check: test attribution accuracy on known behaviors.
- **Interpretability in LLMs**: Essential for aligning program-based explanations with human understanding; quick check: compare program outputs to human annotations.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: LLM outputs -> Program synthesis -> Executable programs -> Attribution analysis
**Critical Path**: Program synthesis is the bottleneck; errors here propagate to attribution quality.
**Design Tradeoffs**: Balances program granularity with interpretability; overly complex programs may reduce usability.
**Failure Signatures**: Poor synthesis leads to inaccurate attributions; lack of scalability limits real-world applicability.
**First Experiments**:
1. Test program synthesis accuracy on synthetic generation tasks.
2. Validate attribution quality on known LLM behaviors.
3. Evaluate scalability with increasing task complexity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can executable programs fully capture complex LLM decision processes?
- How well do program-based attributions align with human interpretability?
- Is the approach scalable to large, real-world datasets and state-of-the-art models?

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation of program-based representations.
- Narrow experimental scope restricts generalizability.
- Scalability to real-world scenarios remains unproven.

## Confidence
- **Fine-grained attribution claim**: Medium (methodologically sound but limited validation).
- **Executable-program representation**: Low (insufficient empirical evidence).
- **Scalability and generalizability**: Low (narrow experimental scope).

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate GenerationPrograms on diverse, large-scale real-world datasets and state-of-the-art LLMs.
2. Conduct human studies to compare program-based attributions with human-interpretable explanations.
3. Test the approach on tasks beyond controlled settings, such as multi-step reasoning or open-ended generation.
