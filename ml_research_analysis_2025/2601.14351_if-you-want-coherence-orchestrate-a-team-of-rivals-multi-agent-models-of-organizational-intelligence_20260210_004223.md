## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an AI Office architecture that improves reliability in multi-agent LLM systems by implementing organizational principles such as role-based specialization, hierarchical veto authority, and pre-declared acceptance criteria. The system employs specialized agents—planners, executors, critics, and experts—organized into teams with distinct roles, coordinated through a remote code executor that maintains clean separation between reasoning and data transformation. Evaluation on 522 production financial analysis sessions shows a 92.1% success rate, reducing error rates from 75% to 7.9% through cascaded critique layers.

## Method Summary
The architecture implements hierarchical veto authority where independent critics can reject outputs entirely, triggering team-internal retry loops without requiring full re-planning. A remote code executor separates reasoning from execution, preventing context contamination and enabling processing of datasets larger than context windows. The system uses cascaded orthogonal critique with sequential, specialized validation layers (Code, Chart, Output) that function as a Swiss cheese model to catch errors. Agents are organized into teams with distinct roles and coordinated via FSM-based routing with pre-declared acceptance criteria before execution.

## Key Results
- 92.1% success rate across 522 production financial analysis sessions
- Error rate reduction from 75% to 7.9% through cascaded critique layers
- 38.6% computational overhead traded for reliability gains
- Individual critic catch rates: Code (86.0%), Chart (1.8%), Output (14.6%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Veto Authority
Reliability improves when independent critics hold absolute veto power rather than relying on consensus voting or self-review. Producers and validators are separated by strict role boundaries, with critic rejections triggering immediate, localized retry loops within the execution team. Assumes agents have sufficiently distinct failure modes such that critics catch errors producers ignore; assumes retry loops converge rather than oscillate. Break condition: If critics and writers share the same blind spots, veto authority fails to catch systematic errors.

### Mechanism 2: Context Isolation via Remote Execution
Separating reasoning (LLM) from execution (code/data) prevents context contamination and enables processing datasets larger than context window. Agents generate code executed in remote sandbox; raw data remains in execution layer while only summarized results return to agent context. Assumes summarization layer successfully extracts all decision-relevant information needed for next reasoning step. Break condition: If summarization discards subtle nuances critical for complex reasoning, agent will hallucinate based on incomplete summaries.

### Mechanism 3: Cascaded Orthogonal Critique
Stacking multiple specialized validation layers with misaligned holes reduces error propagation more effectively than single monolithic review. Sequential, specialized critics catch mutually exclusive error sets, requiring errors to escape all layers to reach user. Assumes failure modes of different critics are conditionally independent. Break condition: If residual errors are correlated across all critics, adding more layers yields diminishing returns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Swiss Cheese Model (Reason)**
  - Why needed: Theoretical safety model the architecture relies on; defense-in-depth works only if holes don't align
  - Quick check: If Code Critique and Output Critique both miss a missing currency conversion, which assumption has been violated?

- **FSM (Finite State Machine) Orchestration**
  - Why needed: Paper contrasts FSM-based routing with free-chat systems; understanding deterministic state transitions is key to debugging flow
  - Quick check: Why use deterministic FSM routing rather than letting Planner dynamically decide who to talk to next?

- **Channel Capacity (Shannon)**
  - Why needed: Paper uses this to justify redundancy in inter-agent communication; frames reliability as tradeoff against bandwidth
  - Quick check: What "cost" is paid to achieve reliable communication over noisy LLM inter-agent messaging?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User Request -> Planner (DAG + Acceptance Criteria) -> User Approval Gate -> [Inner Loop: Writer -> Remote Executor -> Critic (Retry if Veto)] -> Output Critic -> User
- **Critical path:** User request flows through planner to create DAG, passes user approval gate, enters inner loop of writer execution and critic validation, exits through output critic to user
- **Design tradeoffs:** Reliability vs. latency (38.6% compute overhead for 67 percentage point error reduction), complexity vs. monoculture (50+ specialized agents vs single provider risk), structure vs. autonomy (rigid FSM prevents infinite loops but limits adaptive problem-solving)
- **Failure signatures:** Level 3 Recovery (28% of sessions consume 68% of credits), 7.9% residual errors always requiring human escalation, context leaks if raw data appears in planner context
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Calibrate the Veto: Run known-bad code through Code Critic to verify 100% veto success
  2. Isolation Verification: Trace request with large dataset to confirm raw data never enters agent context
  3. Diminishing Returns Test: Disable Chart Critic on visualization-heavy batch to test orthogonality assumption

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Cross-domain evaluation:** Can architecture maintain reliability in domains with subjective outputs like legal or medical fields? Paper notes current evaluation limited to financial analysis with clear correctness criteria.
- **False positive rate:** What is the false positive rate of cascaded critique layers and do unnecessary rejections inflate 38.6% overhead? Paper identifies this as limitation without ground-truth labels.
- **Adaptive critic selection:** Can learning which critic configurations optimize for different task types reduce overhead? Paper proposes this as future work to address static pipeline costs.
- **Parallel critique:** Can independent critics operate in parallel to reduce latency without sacrificing error coverage? Paper identifies sequential critique as limitation adding latency.

## Limitations

- Evaluation limited to financial analysis tasks with specific data types (invoices, expenses, matching problems)
- 7.9% residual error rate still requires human intervention for requirement ambiguity and subjective preferences
- 38.6% computational overhead represents substantial cost increase
- Orthogonality assumption not directly tested; complementary error detection doesn't prove independence

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Architectural principles clearly specified; error reduction from 75% to 7.9% well-documented
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that orthogonality drives 7.9% residual rate assumes independence not directly tested
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability to non-financial domains untested; performance on different task types unknown

## Next Checks

1. **Orthogonality Stress Test:** Systematically generate error types that fool specific critic combinations to test Swiss cheese model breakdown
2. **Context Isolation Verification:** Instrument system to log actual token counts flowing to each agent to verify raw data never enters contexts
3. **Domain Transfer Experiment:** Apply identical architecture to fundamentally different task domain (legal document analysis or software debugging) to measure generalizability
