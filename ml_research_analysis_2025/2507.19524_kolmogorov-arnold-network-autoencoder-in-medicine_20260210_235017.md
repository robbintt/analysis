# Kolmogorov Arnold Network Autoencoder in Medicine

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.19524
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19524
- Authors: Ugo Lomoio; Pierangelo Veltri; Pietro Hiram Guzzi
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: KCN-based autoencoder achieves 0.15498 MSE with 0.87M parameters on AbnormalHeartbeat dataset, outperforming standard CAE (0.2423 MSE, 1.48M params)

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) autoencoders for medical signal analysis, comparing traditional autoencoder architectures (AE, CAE) with their KAN counterparts (KAE, KCAE) on the AbnormalHeartbeat dataset. The key innovation replaces fixed activation functions with learnable univariate functions on edges, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. KCAE achieves superior reconstruction quality (MSE 0.15498) while maintaining computational efficiency (0.87M parameters), outperforming both standard and KAN-based autoencoders. Latent space visualization reveals that KCAE provides clearer class separation compared to CAE's more compact clusters.

## Method Summary
The study benchmarks four autoencoder architectures on five unsupervised tasks using cardiological signals from the UCR AbnormalHeartbeat dataset. AE uses linear layers with SiLU activation, KAE replaces initial linear blocks with KAN layers, CAE employs Conv1d blocks with Tanh activation, and KCAE uses KCN1d layers combining 1D convolutions with edge-learnable activations. All models are trained to minimize reconstruction MSE, with performance evaluated through reconstruction quality, latent space visualization via UMAP, and parameter efficiency metrics.

## Key Results
- KCAE achieves best test reconstruction MSE of 0.15498 using only 0.87M parameters
- CAE achieves 0.2423 MSE with 1.48M parameters, while KAE achieves 0.2261 MSE with 4.01M parameters
- UMAP visualization shows KCAE provides clearer class separation with more flexible latent representations
- KCN-based architectures offer superior reconstruction quality and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Learnable univariate functions on edges improve representation capacity compared to fixed activation functions
- Mechanism: Each edge carries a parameterized spline or polynomial function ψij(xj) instead of scalar weight, enabling more flexible approximation of complex input-output mappings
- Core assumption: Target function can be decomposed into compositions of univariate functions (Kolmogorov–Arnold theorem), and learning these jointly yields better data-adaptive representations
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states replacing fixed activations with learnable univariate functions; Section 2.1 explains KANs align with theoretical decomposition; limited corpus validation for autoencoders
- Break condition: If function family is too restrictive or over-regularized, expressivity collapses toward linear-like behavior

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining local receptive fields with edge-learnable activations yields better generalization on time series
- Mechanism: KCN layers apply 1D convolutions to capture local temporal patterns while replacing post-linear activations with learned univariate functions
- Core assumption: Biomedical signals exhibit local structure where nonlinearities vary across time contexts, and jointly learning both convolutional filters and activation functions improves latent encoding
- Evidence anchors: Abstract reports KCAE MSE 0.15498 vs CAE 0.2423; Results emphasize synergistic benefits of combining local receptive fields with adaptive kernel-based nonlinearities
- Break condition: If training data is insufficient to constrain both convolutional filters and edge functions, model may overfit or produce unstable learned activations

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Edge-based parameterization enables parameter-efficient latent space encoding with improved class separability
- Mechanism: Shifting expressivity from dense weight matrices to edge-wise function parameters achieves comparable reconstruction with fewer total parameters while producing more structured latent spaces
- Core assumption: Kolmogorov–Arnold decomposition provides more compact basis for representing multivariate signal structure than standard MLP weight matrices
- Evidence anchors: Abstract reports KCAE 0.15498 MSE with 0.87M parameters; Results UMAP shows clear separation between abnormal and normal heartbeat instances
- Break condition: If regularization on spline parameters is too weak, edge functions may grow in complexity without improving latent structure

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Autoencoder latent space structure
  - Why needed here: Models evaluated via reconstruction error and UMAP latent visualization; understanding encoder-decoder compression affects separability
  - Quick check question: Given a 2D UMAP plot with two overlapping clusters, can you identify whether the encoder has learned discriminative features or collapsed class structure?

- Concept: Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem
  - Why needed here: Theorem justifies why univariate function compositions can replace multivariate weight matrices
  - Quick check question: Can you state in one sentence why the theorem implies that any continuous multivariate function can be approximated using only univariate functions and addition?

- Concept: 1D convolution for time-series feature extraction
  - Why needed here: CAE and KCAE rely on Conv1d and ConvTranspose1d; understanding receptive fields, stride, and padding is necessary to implement and debug
  - Quick check question: Given a 187-sample input and Conv1d layer with kernel size 7, stride 2, padding 3, what is the output length?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input (187-sample heartbeat time series) -> Encoder (convolutional or linear projection) -> Latent representation (compressed vector) -> Decoder (transpose convolution or linear upsampling) -> Reconstruction

- Critical path:
  1. Input (187-sample heartbeat time series) → encoder (convolutional or linear projection)
  2. Latent representation (compressed vector)
  3. Decoder (transpose convolution or linear upsampling) → reconstruction
  4. Loss: MSE between input and reconstruction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Parameter efficiency vs. speed: KCAE uses ~41% fewer parameters than CAE but forward pass is up to 10x slower than MLP layers
  - Latent compactness vs. flexibility: CAE produces tighter clusters; KCAE yields more diffuse but separable embeddings—choice depends on downstream task
  - Spline resolution vs. overfitting risk: Higher-order splines increase expressivity but require more data and regularization

- Failure signatures:
  - High test MSE with low training MSE → overfitting to training distribution
  - Overlapping latent clusters in UMAP → encoder not learning discriminative features
  - Large loss spikes on specific test samples → sensitivity to distribution shift or artifacts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce KCAE vs. CAE reconstruction MSE on AbnormalHeartbeat test set; confirm parameter counts and training stability
  2. Ablate edge-learnable activations: replace KAN edge functions with fixed ReLU to measure contribution of adaptivity
  3. Visualize learned edge functions (ψij) across layers to assess whether they converge to meaningful shapes or remain near-linear

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How can the computational efficiency of Kolmogorov layers be optimized to mitigate the reported 10x latency overhead during the forward pass?
  - Basis in paper: Authors state that the "tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency presents a compelling direction for future optimization" and note that the forward pass is up to 10x slower than conventional layers
  - Why unresolved: Current KAN implementations are computationally expensive compared to standard CNNs/MLPs, hindering real-time clinical deployment despite accuracy advantages
  - What evidence would resolve it: Development of hardware-aware implementations or sparse optimization techniques achieving inference speeds comparable to standard CNNs

- Question: Can the learned univariate functions in KCAE be explicitly mapped to physiological biomarkers to verify the theoretical interpretability claims?
  - Basis in paper: Introduction emphasizes that KANs offer "potential" for interpretable models by learning functions on edges, but results focus primarily on reconstruction MSE and UMAP clustering rather than analyzing semantic meaning of learned splines
  - Why unresolved: "Black-box" nature remains partially unresolved as specific clinical significance of learned edge functions was not extracted or visualized in analysis
  - What evidence would resolve it: Study successfully correlating specific learned spline shapes or activation patterns with known pathological features in heartbeats

- Question: Do the efficiency and accuracy benefits of KCAE generalize to medical datasets with different modalities or higher dimensionality?
  - Basis in paper: Study limits validation to AbnormalHeartbeat dataset (audio signals), leaving performance on other modalities mentioned in background (e.g., ECG, EEG) unstated
  - Why unresolved: Unclear if superior parameter-to-performance ratio holds for signals with different noise profiles, frequencies, or dimensional structures
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking KCAE performance on diverse biomedical datasets (e.g., 12-lead ECG or MRI data) showing consistent improvements over CAE

## Limitations
- Lacks critical implementation details necessary for reproduction including exact architectural hyperparameters and training configurations
- Focuses exclusively on one dataset (AbnormalHeartbeat), limiting generalizability claims to broader medical signal domains
- No ablation studies isolate contribution of edge-learnable activations versus architectural changes

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core experimental setup (comparing four autoencoder variants on AbnormalHeartbeat with reconstruction MSE as primary metric) is clearly specified and internally consistent
- Medium confidence: Mechanism explaining why edge-learnable activations improve performance is theoretically grounded but lacks direct empirical validation
- Low confidence: Generalizability of results beyond the single dataset and practical deployment considerations given computational overhead

## Next Checks
1. Implement systematic ablation studies replacing KAN edge functions with fixed activations to quantify contribution of learnable univariate functions versus architectural changes
2. Validate results across multiple medical time series datasets (e.g., ECG, EEG, PPG) to assess generalizability beyond AbnormalHeartbeat
3. Measure training dynamics and convergence behavior for KCN-based architectures versus standard convolutions to understand practical trade-off between accuracy and computational cost
