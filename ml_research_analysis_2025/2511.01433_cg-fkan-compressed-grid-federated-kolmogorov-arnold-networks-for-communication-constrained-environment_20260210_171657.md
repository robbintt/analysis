# CG-FKAN: Compressed-Grid Federated Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Communication Constrained Environment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01433
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01433
- Authors: Seunghun Yu; Youngjoon Lee; Jinu Gong; Joonhyuk Kang
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Proposed method achieves up to 13.6% lower RMSE than fixed-grid KAN while using significantly fewer bits than grid-extended KAN, saving 2,170-76,410 bits per round in federated learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses communication overhead in federated learning when using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with grid extension. The authors propose CG-FKAN, which compresses extended grid coefficients by sparsifying and transmitting only the most informative ones under a communication budget. They derive an upper bound on approximation error showing CG-FKAN approaches optimal sparsification. Experiments demonstrate that CG-FKAN achieves up to 13.6% lower RMSE than fixed-grid KAN while using significantly fewer bits than grid-extended KAN.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes CG-FKAN, a compressed-grid approach for federated Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks that addresses communication bottlenecks in federated learning. The method extends the standard KAN grid to improve approximation accuracy, then applies sparsification to compress the coefficients before transmission. CG-FKAN uses a greedy sparsification algorithm that selects the most informative coefficients based on their magnitude while respecting a communication budget. The approach includes an error bound showing that the approximation error of CG-FKAN approaches the optimal sparsification error asymptotically as the optimal error approaches zero. The method is evaluated on four mathematical functions (Feynman equations, Bessel, Legendre) with 100 clients and Dirichlet non-IID data distributions.

## Key Results
- CG-FKAN achieves up to 13.6% lower RMSE than fixed-grid KAN on benchmark functions
- Saves 2,170-76,410 bits per round compared to grid-extended KAN while maintaining performance
- Outperforms alternative sparsification strategies including magnitude-based and random selection
- Maintains comparable performance to grid-extended KAN even under non-IID data distributions (α ∈ {1.0, 10.0, 100.0})

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CG-FKAN works by extending the standard KAN grid to increase the approximation power of individual spline functions, then compressing this extended representation through selective sparsification. The key insight is that while grid extension improves approximation accuracy, it also increases communication costs exponentially. By greedily selecting the most informative coefficients based on their magnitude and importance, CG-FKAN achieves a favorable trade-off between approximation quality and communication efficiency. The theoretical analysis shows that as the optimal sparsification error approaches zero, the approximation error of CG-FKAN vanishes asymptotically, providing a theoretical foundation for the empirical success.

## Foundational Learning

### Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)
- **Why needed**: KANs replace fixed-weight matrix multiplications in MLPs with learnable spline functions, offering better interpretability and potentially superior approximation properties for certain functions.
- **Quick check**: Verify that KANs use univariate spline functions along edges rather than weight matrices, and that these splines are parameterized by coefficients on a grid.

### Grid Extension in KANs
- **Why needed**: Extending the spline grid increases the approximation power of each univariate function, allowing better representation of complex target functions.
- **Quick check**: Confirm that grid extension increases the number of coefficients per spline function exponentially with the grid size.

### Federated Learning Communication Constraints
- **Why needed**: In federated learning, clients must transmit model updates to a central server, and communication costs often dominate training time, especially with mobile or edge devices.
- **Quick check**: Verify that communication overhead is a primary bottleneck in federated learning and that coefficient sparsification directly reduces transmitted bits.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Client devices -> KAN with extended grid -> Coefficient sparsification -> Compressed coefficient transmission -> Server aggregation -> Updated global model

### Critical Path
1. Local training on client devices with extended grid KAN
2. Greedy sparsification of spline coefficients based on magnitude
3. Transmission of compressed coefficients to server
4. Aggregation of sparsified coefficients across clients
5. Update of global model with compressed information

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Grid extension vs. communication cost**: Larger grids improve approximation but increase transmission overhead exponentially
- **Sparsification ratio vs. accuracy**: Higher sparsification reduces communication but may degrade model quality
- **Greedy selection vs. optimal selection**: Greedy approach is computationally efficient but may not find the globally optimal subset

### Failure Signatures
- Performance degradation when sparsification ratio is too high
- Communication savings diminish when grid extension is minimal
- Convergence issues under extreme non-IID conditions (α < 1.0)
- Theoretical bounds becoming loose for higher-order splines (exponential dependence on order)

### First Experiments to Run
1. Vary sparsification ratio ρ to find the optimal balance between communication savings and accuracy
2. Test with different grid extension factors to quantify the trade-off between approximation power and communication cost
3. Evaluate under extreme non-IID conditions (α < 1.0) to assess robustness to data heterogeneity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can tighter approximation error bounds be derived that avoid the exponential dependence on spline order (o·2^o)?
- Basis in paper: The authors state "Rather than raising concerns over the exponential term o·2^o, we observe that as the optimal error e_opt approaches zero, the proposed approximation error e_top consequently vanishes asymptotically," acknowledging this as a limitation of their bound.
- Why unresolved: The current bound becomes loose for higher-order splines, and the asymptotic argument requires e_opt to approach zero, which may not hold in practice during early training or with limited communication budgets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A refined theoretical analysis showing polynomial or constant-factor bounds, or empirical validation that the gap remains small across varying spline orders in practical settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does CG-FKAN perform on real-world classification tasks beyond synthetic regression benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: The introduction mentions applications in healthcare (ECG classification), defense, and traffic prediction, but experiments are limited to four mathematical functions (Feynman equations, Bessel, Legendre).
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates CG-FKAN on regression tasks where KAN excels, but the communication-accuracy trade-off may differ for classification with cross-entropy loss, larger datasets, or more complex network architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on real-world federated datasets (e.g., medical imaging, ECG signals) comparing CG-FKAN against baselines under practical communication constraints.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would adaptive or layer-wise sparsification strategies outperform the uniform ratio ρ across all layers?
- Basis in paper: The current approach selects a single sparsification ratio ρ applied uniformly to all spline functions across layers, but different layers may have varying importance for function approximation.
- Why unresolved: Uniform sparsification ignores potential differences in coefficient sensitivity across layers or edges, which could lead to suboptimal use of the communication budget.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing uniform vs. layer-adaptive sparsification, or analysis of coefficient importance distributions across layers during training.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does CG-FKAN scale with larger numbers of clients and higher degrees of non-IID data heterogeneity?
- Basis in paper: Experiments use N=100 clients with Dirichlet α ∈ {1.0, 10.0, 100.0}, but real-world FL deployments may involve thousands of clients with more extreme heterogeneity (α < 1.0).
- Why unresolved: The aggregation of sparsified coefficients from many clients with diverse data distributions may introduce noise or bias not captured in the current experimental setup.
- What evidence would resolve it: Scaling experiments with N ∈ {500, 1000, 5000} clients and α < 1.0, analyzing convergence behavior and final model quality.

## Limitations
- Theoretical error bounds exhibit exponential dependence on spline order, becoming loose for higher-order splines
- Experiments limited to synthetic regression tasks rather than real-world classification problems
- Evaluation on moderate-scale federated settings (100 clients) without testing extreme non-IID conditions (α < 1.0)
- Current approach uses uniform sparsification across all layers without adaptive strategies

## Confidence
- **Communication efficiency claims**: High - Theoretical analysis provides rigorous error bounds and experimental results show consistent improvements over baselines
- **Approximation accuracy claims**: Medium - Results are promising but limited to specific datasets and tasks
- **Generalizability to diverse FL scenarios**: Low - Narrow scope of current evaluations leaves questions about performance on classification problems and very large-scale federated systems

## Next Checks
1. Test CG-FKAN on large-scale KAN architectures with thousands of neurons to assess scalability limits and identify performance degradation points
2. Evaluate performance on diverse classification tasks beyond the current regression focus, including real-world federated datasets with cross-entropy loss
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components (sparsification, grid extension, coefficient selection) to overall performance, including comparisons with adaptive vs. uniform sparsification strategies
