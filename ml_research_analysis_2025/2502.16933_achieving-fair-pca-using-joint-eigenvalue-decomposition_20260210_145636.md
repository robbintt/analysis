# Achieving Fair PCA Using Joint Eigenvalue Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.16933
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16933
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces JEVD-PCA method achieving fair dimensionality reduction with O(d³) time complexity, outperforming baseline methods in fairness metrics while maintaining comparable reconstruction error

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) when dealing with demographic attributes by introducing a method based on Joint Eigenvalue Decomposition (JEVD). The proposed JEVD-PCA approach balances data structure preservation and fairness across diverse groups by jointly diagonalizing group-specific matrices to find a shared eigenbasis. Experimental results demonstrate that JEVD-PCA outperforms baseline methods in fairness metrics, particularly in Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD2), while maintaining comparable reconstruction error and variance explained.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a fair PCA method using Joint Eigenvalue Decomposition (JEVD) to ensure equitable data representations across demographic groups. The approach computes group-specific matrices $M_k$ for each demographic group $k \in \{A, B\}$ by centering the data and subtracting the average variance contribution. These matrices are then jointly diagonalized to find a shared eigenbasis $U$ that minimizes the off-diagonal norm of $U^{-1}M_k U$. The optimization uses an iterative update rule with a correction matrix $V$ derived from first-order Taylor expansion. This method aims to balance reconstruction error across groups while preserving data structure, with a computational complexity of O(d³).

## Key Results
- JEVD-PCA achieves lower Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD2) compared to baseline methods, indicating better fairness across groups
- The method maintains comparable reconstruction error and variance explained relative to standard PCA
- Computational complexity of O(d³) makes JEVD-PCA more scalable than existing SDP-based approaches for fair PCA

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The JEVD-PCA method works by jointly diagonalizing group-specific scatter matrices to find a common basis that equalizes information retention across demographic groups. By minimizing the off-diagonal elements of transformed matrices, the method ensures that each group experiences similar reconstruction quality when projecting to the reduced dimension space. The joint diagonalization process inherently balances the principal components across groups, preventing the dominance of one group's variance structure over another's. This shared basis approach naturally enforces fairness by construction rather than through post-processing or penalty terms.

## Foundational Learning
- **Joint Eigenvalue Decomposition**: Simultaneous diagonalization of multiple matrices to find a common basis; needed to align variance structures across groups; quick check: verify diagonalization reduces off-diagonal norms
- **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD2)**: Metric measuring distributional differences between groups; needed to quantify fairness in representations; quick check: compute MMD2 between original and transformed group distributions
- **Scatter Matrix Construction**: Group-specific matrices incorporating variance information and regularization; needed to capture group-specific data structure; quick check: verify matrix symmetry and positive semi-definiteness
- **First-order Taylor Expansion Optimization**: Used for efficient update rules in JEVD; needed for scalable convergence; quick check: monitor cost function decrease during iterations
- **Reconstruction Error**: Measure of information loss when projecting back to original space; needed to ensure dimensionality reduction quality; quick check: compare original vs. reconstructed data norms

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Preparation -> Matrix Construction -> JEVD Optimization -> Fair Representation
**Critical Path**: The core computational pipeline involves: (1) computing group-specific scatter matrices, (2) applying JEVD algorithm to find shared basis, (3) projecting data onto fair components
**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades some reconstruction accuracy for fairness guarantees, choosing scalability (O(d³)) over potentially more precise but computationally expensive SDP approaches
**Failure Signatures**: Non-convergence of JEVD iterations, increased reconstruction error, or failure to reduce MMD2 across groups
**First Experiments**:
1. Apply JEVD-PCA to a simple synthetic dataset with known group disparities to verify fairness improvement
2. Compare reconstruction error and MMD2 across different target ranks to understand the accuracy-fairness tradeoff
3. Test the algorithm on a binary-split version of a standard dataset (e.g., gender-split MNIST) to validate performance on familiar data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Missing convergence parameters (threshold $\epsilon$, max iterations) make exact reproduction challenging
- Datasets used are not publicly available through standard repositories, limiting independent verification
- Method only demonstrated for binary demographic attributes, raising questions about generalization to multi-group scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in mathematical framework and fairness objective formulation
- **Medium confidence** in experimental claims due to limited dataset accessibility and missing implementation details
- **Low confidence** in method's generalizability beyond binary demographic attributes

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence Sensitivity Analysis**: Reproduce JEVD algorithm with varying $\epsilon$ and max iteration values to verify stability and sensitivity of results to hyperparameters
2. **Synthetic Data Testing**: Generate controlled synthetic datasets with known group disparities to validate that JEVD-PCA correctly balances reconstruction error while maintaining variance explained
3. **Multi-group Extension**: Test the binary-group JEVD approach on datasets with multiple demographic categories to assess limitations and potential adaptations needed for real-world scenarios
