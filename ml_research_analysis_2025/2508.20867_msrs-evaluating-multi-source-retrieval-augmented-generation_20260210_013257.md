# MSRS: Evaluating Multi-Source Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.20867
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20867
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces MSRS benchmark for multi-source RAG systems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MSRS, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multi-source retrieval-augmented generation systems. Unlike existing RAG evaluations that assume single-source retrieval or short-form answers, MSRS-S TORY and MSRS-M EET datasets require synthesizing information from multiple complementary documents to answer realistic queries. The benchmark addresses a critical gap in RAG evaluation by focusing on complex information needs that require multi-document synthesis, demonstrating that current systems struggle significantly with these tasks.

## Method Summary
The MSRS benchmark is constructed by transforming existing query-focused summarization datasets into multi-source retrieval scenarios. The authors developed MSRS-S TORY using the WikiStories dataset and MSRS-M EET using the QMSum dataset, ensuring high-quality annotations and realistic queries. The transformation methodology converts single-document summarization tasks into multi-source retrieval-augmented generation challenges by identifying complementary information sources needed to answer complex queries. Extensive experiments were conducted using various RAG pipelines to evaluate retrieval quality, generation performance, and the impact of different model architectures on multi-source synthesis tasks.

## Key Results
- Retrieval quality significantly impacts generation performance in multi-source RAG systems
- Reasoning models outperform standard LLMs in multi-source document synthesis tasks
- Current RAG systems show substantial room for improvement in handling complex multi-document information needs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by creating realistic multi-source information needs through systematic transformation of existing summarization datasets. By requiring systems to synthesize information from multiple complementary documents rather than single sources, MSRS exposes the limitations of current RAG approaches in handling complex queries. The methodology ensures that successful responses require genuine multi-document understanding and synthesis, rather than simple retrieval and reproduction of information from single sources.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-source RAG Systems: Why needed - Handle complex queries requiring information from multiple documents; Quick check - Can system synthesize information from 3+ sources effectively
- Document Synthesis: Why needed - Real-world queries often require combining information from complementary sources; Quick check - Does generated answer integrate information cohesively across sources
- Retrieval Quality Metrics: Why needed - Critical for understanding system performance bottlenecks; Quick check - Are retrieval metrics correlated with final answer quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Query -> Retriever -> Document Selector -> Generator -> Final Answer

**Critical Path:** The retriever must successfully identify complementary documents that together provide complete information for answering the query. Failures at this stage cascade to generation, regardless of generator quality.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Multi-source systems face a fundamental tradeoff between retrieval breadth (finding all relevant documents) and precision (avoiding irrelevant documents that confuse the generator). The paper shows that retrieval quality is more critical than generator sophistication for multi-source tasks.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failure modes include: (1) missing critical documents in retrieval, (2) retrieving redundant or irrelevant documents, (3) generator inability to synthesize across multiple sources, and (4) over-reliance on single dominant document.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Evaluate retrieval performance using standard IR metrics on MSRS datasets
2. Compare single-source vs multi-source generation performance using the same generator
3. Test different retriever-generator combinations to identify performance bottlenecks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark focuses primarily on English-language documents and queries
- Transformation methodology may not fully capture naturally occurring multi-source information needs
- Limited coverage of document types, focusing mainly on stories and meeting transcripts

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Need for multi-source RAG evaluation benchmarks is well-established
- Retrieval quality significantly impacts generation performance in multi-source settings
- Reasoning models show advantages over standard LLMs for multi-document synthesis

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Transformation methodology produces high-quality, realistic multi-source queries
- MSRS datasets comprehensively represent multi-source information needs
- Current RAG systems struggle specifically with multi-source synthesis

## Next Checks
1. Apply MSRS evaluation methodology to documents from different domains (medical, legal, technical) to assess benchmark robustness across specialized content areas.
2. Conduct detailed error analysis correlating specific retrieval failures with generation errors using MSRS datasets to identify patterns in multi-document retrieval challenges.
3. Collect and evaluate naturally occurring multi-source queries from actual users to validate that MSRS datasets accurately represent practical information needs.
