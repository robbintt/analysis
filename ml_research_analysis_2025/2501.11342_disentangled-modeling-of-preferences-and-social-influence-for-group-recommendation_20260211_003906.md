# Disentangled Modeling of Preferences and Social Influence for Group Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.11342
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11342
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Key result:** DisRec achieves 4.92% and 4.29% HR@5 improvements, and 6.52% and 7.72% NDCG@5 improvements on Mafengwo and Yelp datasets respectively.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the problem of preference bias in group recommendation, where existing models overemphasize majority preferences rather than actual interaction items. The proposed DisRec model disentangles user preferences and social influence through separate embedding propagation schemes based on (hyper)graph convolution networks. It introduces a social-based contrastive learning strategy that selectively excludes user nodes based on their social importance to enhance group representations and alleviate data sparsity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that DisRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

## Method Summary
DisRec addresses group recommendation by disentangling user preferences and social influence through separate embedding propagation schemes. The model constructs three graphs: a User Preference Graph from user-item interactions, a User Social Hypergraph integrating user-item hyperedges and user-user social edges, and a Group Co-occurrence Graph connecting groups with shared members. It employs a gate aggregator to fuse user-level and group-level representations, and introduces a social-based contrastive learning strategy that selectively excludes users based on their social importance to enhance group representations and alleviate data sparsity.

## Key Results
- DisRec achieves 4.92% and 4.29% improvements in HR@5 metrics on Mafengwo and Yelp datasets respectively
- DisRec achieves 6.52% and 7.72% improvements in NDCG@5 metrics on Mafengwo and Yelp datasets respectively
- The model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in group recommendation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works by disentangling user preferences from social influence through separate embedding propagation schemes. The User Preference Graph captures individual item preferences, while the User Social Hypergraph models social influence through hyperedges representing user-item interactions and edges representing user-user relationships. The social-based contrastive learning strategy enhances group representations by selectively excluding users based on their calculated social importance, which helps alleviate data sparsity and reduces preference bias toward majority opinions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hypergraph convolution networks**: Needed to model complex group interactions where users collectively interact with items. Quick check: Verify hyperedge construction captures all users in a group interaction.
- **Attention mechanisms for social influence**: Required to weigh different social connections appropriately. Quick check: Test if attention weights reflect intuitive social hierarchies.
- **Contrastive learning in graph settings**: Essential for learning discriminative group representations. Quick check: Confirm positive/negative pairs are well-separated after training.
- **Disentangled representation learning**: Critical for separating intrinsic preferences from social influence. Quick check: Validate that preference embeddings remain stable when social influence is removed.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** User Preference Graph -> Social Hypergraph -> Group Co-occurrence Graph -> Gate Aggregator -> Prediction

**Critical path:** User-item interactions → Preference embeddings → Social influence aggregation → Group-level representation → Recommendation

**Design tradeoffs:** The model trades computational complexity for better disentanglement of preferences and social influence. Using hypergraph convolution allows modeling group interactions but increases computational overhead compared to simple graph convolution.

**Failure signatures:** If attention weights in the social hypergraph are uniform, the social influence modeling fails. If the co-occurrence graph has too few connections, group-level learning degrades to user-level aggregation only.

**Three first experiments:**
1. Validate hypergraph construction by checking that hyperedges correctly capture all users in group interactions
2. Test the attention mechanism by verifying that social importance scores reflect intuitive hierarchies
3. Run an ablation study with and without the SSL component to measure its impact on preference bias

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** How does DisRec's social-based contrastive learning strategy perform in groups characterized by flat social hierarchies or uniform member contributions? The strategy assumes distinguishable variance between the most and least influential members, but may be ineffective when attention weights are uniform.

**Open Question 2:** To what extent do the disentangled "preference" embeddings remain contaminated by latent social conformity effects inherent in the historical user-item interaction data? The model assumes user-item interactions represent "pure" preferences, but these may be driven by social conformity rather than intrinsic preference.

**Open Question 3:** How robust is the Group-Level Preference Network when applied to strictly ephemeral groups that share no members with other groups in the dataset? Groups with no shared members become isolated nodes in the co-occurrence graph, potentially reducing the model to user-level aggregation only.

## Limitations
- Data splitting strategy was not explicitly defined, making fair comparison difficult
- Early stopping mechanism and embedding initialization method were not detailed
- The contrastive SSL component's effectiveness depends on correctly identifying important users, which may not generalize to all social structures

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core architecture and general training procedure are clearly specified
- **Medium Confidence:** Hyperparameters are provided but optimal values and tuning process are unclear
- **Low Confidence:** Data preprocessing steps, especially co-occurrence graph construction and SSL importance definition, are underspecified

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the exact data split strategy used in the original experiments to ensure fair baseline comparison
2. Implement a unit test for the hypergraph propagation that verifies the attention mechanism correctly aggregates social influence
3. Perform an ablation study that trains DisRec with and without the SSL component on a small validation set to empirically confirm its contribution to overcoming preference bias
