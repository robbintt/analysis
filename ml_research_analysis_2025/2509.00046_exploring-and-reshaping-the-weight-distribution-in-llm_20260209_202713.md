# Exploring and Reshaping the Weight Distribution in LLM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.00046
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00046
- Authors: Chunming Ye; Songzhou Li; Xu Xu
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Method improves LoRA training effectiveness by reshaping initialization weights based on reference model distribution characteristics, with better results using larger models as references.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates weight distribution characteristics in large language models (LLMs) and proposes a method to improve LoRA training effectiveness. The authors analyze cosine distances between weight matrices' singular values across different layers, finding these distances exhibit power-law distribution characteristics. They develop a qualitative method to describe model distribution features and design a data generator combining Gaussian processes and Pareto distributions to simulate weights conforming to specific distribution patterns.

The method is applied to reshape LoRA initialization weights, particularly the low-rank matrices A and B. Experiments on SmolLM2-135M and LLaMA3.2-1B models using GPQA Diamond Zero-Shot, Arc_Challenge, and HellaSwag benchmarks show performance improvements compared to standard LoRA training and pretrained models. The approach achieves better results particularly when larger models with more weights are used as reference models for weight reshaping, demonstrating that aligning smaller models' weight distributions with those of larger models can enhance fine-tuning effectiveness without altering model architecture or training processes.

## Method Summary
The method extracts weight matrices from all projections (Q, K, V, O, gate, up, down) across layers, performs SVD to extract top-r singular values, builds MSV matrices per projection type, and computes pairwise cosine distances. These distances are classified as power-law or non-power-law distributions to group projections into referenced weights and members. A distribution generator using Gaussian templates with Pareto/Gaussian perturbation functions creates initialization weights that are applied to LoRA A and B matrices. The approach is trained using unsloth with specific hyperparameters and evaluated on standard benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Using larger reference models (LLaMA3-8B) improves GPQA performance from 0.2222 to 0.2879 for SmolLM2-135M
- Cross-family references (LLaMA as reference for SmolLM) show better improvement than same-family references
- Distribution reshaping method consistently outperforms standard LoRA training across multiple benchmarks
- Larger models exhibit more distinctive distribution characteristics that transfer benefits to smaller models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Cosine distances between singular value matrices (MSV) across layers exhibit power-law distribution characteristics across diverse LLMs.
- **Mechanism:** Weight matrices contain many numerically similar values; their mutual differences become tiny relative to total weight counts. Singular value vectors (SV) derived from these matrices exhibit concentrated pairwise cosine distances near 0, producing power-law distributions in distance probabilities.
- **Core assumption:** The concentration of similar weight values directly causes power-law character in DSV distributions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "the cosine distances between weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution"
  - [Section 2.2]: "The probability distribution exhibits power-law distribution pattern for the DSV between all SV...all retain a clearly visible power-law distribution characteristics"
  - [corpus]: Weak/no direct corpus support for this specific MSV cosine-distance power-law claim
- **Break condition:** When DSV distributions between specific MSV pairs deviate from power-law (e.g., DSVV-gate approaches normal distribution; DSVgate-up, DSVgate-down)

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Reshaping LoRA initialization weights (A and B matrices) based on reference model distribution characteristics improves fine-tuning effectiveness.
- **Mechanism:** Distribution generator combines Gaussian process (template weights) with Pareto-distributed perturbation counts. When Func()=Pareto, DSV between generated matrices exhibits power-law; when Func()=Gaussian, DSV approaches normal distribution. This allows controlled initialization matching target distribution patterns.
- **Core assumption:** Models with more weights possess "more reasonable" weight distributions that transfer benefits to smaller models through initialization alignment.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "reshaping smaller models' weight distributions with those of larger models can enhance fine-tuning effectiveness"
  - [Section 3.2]: "When Func() is Pareto distribution function, the DSV between A and B exhibits power-law distribution pattern"
  - [corpus]: ConsNoTrainLoRA supports data-driven LoRA weight initialization; DoRAN addresses training stability
- **Break condition:** When reference model lacks distinctive distribution characteristics (e.g., SmolLM2-135M: all DSV follow power-law, no usable differentiation)

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Using larger models as reference models yields better LoRA training improvements than same-sized or smaller references.
- **Mechanism:** Larger models encode structural distribution patterns (specific non-power-law MSV relationships) that smaller models lack. Initialization alignment transfers these patterns without architectural changes.
- **Core assumption:** Larger parameter count correlates with more "learned" distribution structure worth transferring.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "better results particularly when larger models with more weights are used as reference models"
  - [Section 4.2]: SmolLM135M-(LLaMA3-8B) achieves best results (GPQA: 0.2879 vs 0.2222 baseline); same-family SmolLM2-1.7B reference shows minimal improvement
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for cross-model distribution transfer mechanism
- **Break condition:** When reference model distribution is poorly characterized (LLaMA3-3B shows similar performance to LLaMA3-1B as reference); when reference is same-family small model

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for Weight Analysis**
  - Why needed here: Core dimensionality reduction technique extracting r singular values from weight matrices to construct SV vectors and MSV matrices for distribution analysis
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper extract only top-r singular values rather than using all non-zero singular values?

- **Concept: Power-Law vs Normal Distribution Identification**
  - Why needed here: Determines MSV grouping strategy and which projection types serve as template weights for different member groups
  - Quick check question: Given a DSV distribution plot, what visual/features distinguish power-law from normal distribution?

- **Concept: LoRA Low-Rank Adaptation (A and B Matrices)**
  - Why needed here: Target application—understanding that W' = W + BA where A and B are low-rank trainable matrices is essential for understanding what gets reshaped
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper reshape both A and B initialization rather than keeping one fixed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Weight extractor → SVD processor → Distribution analyzer → Qualitative characterizer → Distribution generator → LoRA initializer
- **Critical path:** 1. Extract MSV from reference model → 2. Run qualitative characterization (identify RW and members) → 3. Generate template weights with appropriate Func() → 4. Apply distribution generator to produce initialization values → 5. Initialize LoRA A/B matrices → 6. Train and evaluate
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Rank r selection: Higher rank (256) captures more information but increases SVD computation; lower rank (16) faster but coarser representation
  - Reference model size: Larger models may offer better distributions but increase analysis overhead; cross-family references may misalign architecturally
  - Func() choice: Pareto produces power-law DSV (close matrix relationships); Gaussian produces normal DSV (independent matrices)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - No improvement: Reference model has undifferentiated characteristics (all power-law DSV)
  - Minimal improvement: Same-family reference with similar scale (SmolLM2-1.7B for SmolLM2-135M)
  - Unexpected plateau: Reference distribution poorly characterized (LLaMA3-3B performs similarly to LLaMA3-1B)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Run DSV power-law analysis on LLaMA3.2-1B with r=16, verify alpha≈1.78 Pareto fit
  2. **Rank sensitivity:** Compare r=16, 64, 256 on same model to observe distribution characteristic stability
  3. **Cross-reference test:** Train SmolLM2-135M LoRA with LLaMA3-8B vs SmolLM2-1.7B reference, measure GPQA/Arc_Challenge/HellaSwag delta

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Core mechanism linking weight matrix similarity to power-law DSV distributions lacks strong empirical justification and rigorous statistical testing
- Distribution generator design choices are underspecified with missing key parameters for Gaussian templates and Pareto sampling
- Mapping from 1D generated arrays to LoRA matrix initialization shapes is unclear regarding which initialization strategy to apply

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The empirical observation that using larger reference models improves LoRA fine-tuning performance is well-supported by experimental results (GPQA: 0.2879 vs 0.2222 baseline when using LLaMA3-8B as reference).

**Medium confidence:** The proposed mechanism explaining why power-law DSV distributions emerge from similar weight values is plausible but not rigorously proven.

**Low confidence:** The specific design choices in the distribution generator (Pareto vs Gaussian perturbation function selection, exact parameter settings) lack sufficient justification.

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical validation of power-law claims:** Apply rigorous goodness-of-fit tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, likelihood ratio tests) to verify whether DSV distributions genuinely follow Pareto distributions versus alternative heavy-tailed distributions.

2. **Parameter sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary the rank r (16, 64, 256) and distribution generator parameters to determine which choices most influence performance improvements.

3. **Cross-architectural validation:** Test the method beyond the LLaMA family by using reference models from different architectures (e.g., Mistral, Gemma) to verify whether the distribution transfer mechanism generalizes across architectural differences.
