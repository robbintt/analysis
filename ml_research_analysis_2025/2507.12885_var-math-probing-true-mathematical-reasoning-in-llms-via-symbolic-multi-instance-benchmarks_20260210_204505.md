# VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in LLMS via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.12885
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885
- Authors: Jian Yao; Ran Cheng; Kay Chen Tan
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: RL-finetuned models show substantial performance drops (47.9%-72.9%) on variabilized math benchmarks, revealing memorization rather than reasoning.

## Executive Summary
VAR-MATH introduces a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe true mathematical reasoning in LLMs by transforming fixed numerical problems into parameterized templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each. This approach addresses two key limitations in existing benchmarks: contamination from publicly available problems and evaluation fragility due to single-instance assessments. By enforcing consistency across structurally equivalent variants, VAR-MATH mitigates memorization effects and improves robustness through bootstrapped metrics.

The framework converts problems from AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25 into variabilized versions (VAR-AMC23, VAR-AIME24, VAR-AIME25) with multiple instantiations per template. Experiments show substantial performance drops for RL-finetuned models—especially smaller ones—with average declines of 47.9% on AMC23, 58.8% on AIME24, and 72.9% on AIME25. These findings reveal that some RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms, underscoring the need for principled evaluation protocols that distinguish genuine reasoning from pattern exploitation.

## Method Summary
VAR-MATH transforms fixed numerical math problems into symbolic templates with variable parameters, requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each problem. The framework employs a four-stage pipeline: structural analysis to identify constants for replacement, symbolic parameterization with constrained domains, parametric solution formulation verified by humans and models, and variant sampling with 1-5 instantiations per problem. Evaluation uses two metrics—loose (average accuracy) and strict (all-or-nothing)—computed via bootstrap resampling (N=1000 rounds, M=16 generations per variant). The approach tests whether models demonstrate consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent problems rather than memorizing specific numerical solutions.

## Key Results
- RL-finetuned models show dramatic performance drops on variabilized benchmarks: 47.9% decline on VAR-AMC23, 58.8% on VAR-AIME24, and 72.9% on VAR-AIME25
- Smaller models experience more severe degradation, indicating weaker generalization and heavier reliance on memorization
- Strict consistency scores are significantly lower than loose scores, revealing that models often solve some variants but fail to maintain reasoning across all instantiations
- Performance gaps between original and variabilized problems suggest current RL methods prioritize pattern matching over genuine mathematical reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by exposing the gap between memorization and reasoning through structural invariance testing. By replacing fixed constants with symbolic parameters and requiring consistent solutions across multiple instantiations, VAR-MATH forces models to demonstrate understanding of underlying mathematical relationships rather than exploiting specific numerical patterns. The multi-instance evaluation captures the reliability of reasoning processes, while bootstrap metrics provide statistical confidence in consistency measures.

## Foundational Learning
- Symbolic parameterization: Why needed - to create structurally equivalent variants; Quick check - verify all variants have same solution structure
- Multi-instance evaluation: Why needed - to detect memorization and test consistency; Quick check - compare performance across variants for each template
- Bootstrap statistics: Why needed - to provide robust confidence estimates; Quick check - ensure stable metrics across resampling rounds
- Feasible domain constraints: Why needed - to maintain problem difficulty and validity; Quick check - verify domains exclude trivial or invalid solutions
- Parametric solution verification: Why needed - to ensure ground truth consistency; Quick check - cross-validate human and model-derived solutions

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Original problems → Symbolic templates → Variable instantiations → Model responses → Bootstrap metrics

**Critical path:** Template transformation → Variant generation → Inference → Consistency scoring

**Design tradeoffs:** 
- Template complexity vs. problem difficulty maintenance
- Number of variants vs. evaluation efficiency
- Strict vs. loose scoring for sensitivity vs. leniency

**Failure signatures:** 
- High variance in bootstrap estimates indicates unstable model reasoning
- Large loose-strict score gaps reveal inconsistency despite partial success
- Performance drops suggest memorization rather than generalization

**3 first experiments:**
1. Apply VAR-MATH to a small subset of problems to validate transformation pipeline
2. Compare original vs. variabilized performance on non-RL baseline models
3. Test sensitivity of results to different feasible domain constraints

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance claims depend on proprietary VAR-MATH dataset not publicly available for exact reproduction
- Transformation process relies on subjective expert decisions about variable selection and domain constraints
- Bootstrap procedure assumes variant independence, which may not hold due to structural similarities
- Framework measures consistency rather than absolute reasoning capability, limiting interpretability

## Confidence
- High confidence in methodological soundness of multi-instance evaluation approach
- Medium confidence in reported performance drops without access to original dataset
- Low confidence in specific model behavior claims without full variant distributions

## Next Checks
1. Release complete VAR-MATH dataset with symbolic templates, feasible domains, and parametric solutions for community benchmarking
2. Conduct ablation studies on transformation pipeline by varying domain constraints and measuring impact on performance gaps
3. Test framework on broader model set including non-RL baselines and smaller reasoning-specific models to characterize generalization limits
