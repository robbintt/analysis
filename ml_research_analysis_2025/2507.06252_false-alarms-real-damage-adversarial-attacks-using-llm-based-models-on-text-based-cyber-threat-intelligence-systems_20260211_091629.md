# False Alarms, Real Damage: Adversarial Attacks Using LLM-based Models on Text-based Cyber Threat Intelligence Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06252
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06252
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Evasion attacks achieve 97% FPR on specialized binary classifier and 75% FPR on ChatGPT-4o; poisoning reduces F1 score to 0.57

## Executive Summary
This study reveals significant vulnerabilities in text-based cyber threat intelligence (CTI) pipelines through systematic adversarial attacks using LLM-generated content. The research demonstrates that current CTI systems relying on lexical patterns are susceptible to high false positive rates from evasion attacks and substantial performance degradation from poisoning attacks. By leveraging attention-based adversarial text generation with ChatGPT-4o, the authors show how attackers can successfully evade detection or poison training data, undermining the reliability of threat intelligence systems. The findings emphasize the critical need for semantic validation and early-stage verification components to maintain pipeline integrity against evolving adversarial threats.

## Method Summary
The study employs a novel attention-based method that uses LLM chatbots, specifically ChatGPT-4o, to generate adversarial cybersecurity-like texts designed to mislead machine learning classifiers. The attack framework targets three attack vectors: evasion (generating benign-looking texts that trigger false positives), flooding (overwhelming systems with malicious content), and poisoning (corrupting training data through iterative retraining). The method focuses on manipulating lexical patterns rather than semantic content to bypass detection mechanisms. Experiments are conducted on a specialized binary classifier and the ChatGPT-4o model itself, measuring performance degradation through metrics such as False Positive Rate and F1 score across multiple attack scenarios.

## Key Results
- Evasion attack achieves 97% False Positive Rate on specialized binary classifier
- Evasion attack achieves 75% False Positive Rate on ChatGPT-4o
- Poisoning attack reduces F1 score to 0.57 over successive retraining rounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The attacks succeed because CTI pipelines rely heavily on lexical patterns and surface-level text features rather than deep semantic understanding. Adversarial texts generated by LLMs mimic the vocabulary and structure of legitimate threat intelligence while lacking actual malicious content, exploiting the classifiers' inability to distinguish between form and substance. The attention-based generation method strategically crafts inputs that trigger false classifications by emphasizing specific lexical cues that the models have learned to associate with threats, regardless of actual semantic meaning.

## Foundational Learning
- Lexical pattern reliance: CTI classifiers depend on word frequencies and patterns rather than understanding context, making them vulnerable to adversarial text that mimics threat vocabulary
  - Why needed: Explains the fundamental weakness that enables these attacks
  - Quick check: Analyze classifier feature importance to confirm lexical pattern dependence
- LLM adversarial generation: Using attention mechanisms to craft texts that exploit classifier vulnerabilities by manipulating input structure
  - Why needed: Demonstrates how modern AI can be weaponized against traditional ML systems
  - Quick check: Test generated samples against multiple classifiers to verify transferability
- Pipeline verification components: Early-stage filters that validate semantic content rather than just lexical features
  - Why needed: Provides a defense mechanism against the demonstrated attack vectors
  - Quick check: Implement basic semantic validation and measure false positive reduction

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data Ingestion -> Text Preprocessing -> Feature Extraction -> Classifier -> Output Validation

Critical path: The attack primarily targets the Feature Extraction and Classifier stages, where lexical patterns are identified and decisions are made based on learned associations rather than semantic understanding.

Design tradeoffs: The study highlights the tradeoff between detection sensitivity (catching actual threats) and specificity (avoiding false positives). Current systems favor sensitivity through lexical matching, which creates vulnerabilities that sophisticated adversarial attacks can exploit.

Failure signatures: High false positive rates on benign content containing threat-like vocabulary, gradual performance degradation in poisoning scenarios, and successful evasion of detection through semantically valid but adversarial text.

First experiments to run:
1. Test the same attack methodology against a multi-class CTI classifier to assess attack generalizability
2. Implement and evaluate a basic semantic validation layer before the classifier to measure defensive effectiveness
3. Conduct cross-LLM testing to determine if attack success transfers between different language models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on one specialized binary classifier and ChatGPT-4o, limiting generalizability to other architectures
- The attention-based adversarial generation method may not represent the full spectrum of real-world attack capabilities
- Does not address potential defenses beyond basic verification components or explore operational tradeoffs

## Confidence

High confidence: The demonstration of high false positive rates (97% on binary classifier, 75% on ChatGPT-4o) under the evasion attack scenario is methodologically sound and reproducible.

Medium confidence: The poisoning attack results showing F1 score degradation to 0.57 are credible but may be sensitive to specific retraining assumptions and dataset composition.

Medium confidence: The general conclusion about lexical pattern reliance being a vulnerability is well-supported, though the proposed verification solutions need more rigorous validation.

## Next Checks
1. Test the same attack methodology against diverse CTI classifiers (multi-class, ensemble methods, different feature representations) and multiple LLM APIs to assess robustness of the findings
2. Evaluate the proposed early-stage verification components in an operational pipeline with realistic throughput and latency constraints to measure practical impact
3. Conduct red team exercises using domain experts to generate more sophisticated adversarial examples that incorporate genuine threat intelligence knowledge rather than relying solely on LLM-generated content
