# Evaluating Cultural Knowledge Processing in Large Language Models: A Cognitive Benchmarking Framework Integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.01649
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01649
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Key outcome:** Introduces a cognitive benchmarking framework that integrates Bloom's Taxonomy with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on minority cultural knowledge, using the Taiwanese Hakka digital archive as a testbed.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a cognitive benchmarking framework that integrates Bloom's Taxonomy with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on minority cultural knowledge, using the Taiwanese Hakka digital archive as a testbed. The framework systematically assesses model performance across six cognitive domains—Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating—measuring semantic accuracy and cultural relevance. Results show that RAG-enhanced models significantly outperform baseline models in lower and mid-level tasks, with Gemini-2.5 (RAG) achieving the highest overall accuracy (92.53%). However, even with RAG, models struggle with higher-order creative tasks, highlighting the need for further advances in culturally nuanced generation. The framework offers a structured approach for assessing and improving AI systems' cultural competence, supporting minority heritage preservation and digital archival quality.

## Method Summary
The framework combines Bloom's Taxonomy with RAG to evaluate LLMs on Taiwanese Hakka cultural knowledge using a 10,158-question multiple-choice benchmark. The RAG pipeline chunks a Hakka cultural knowledge base (~4,000 entries) into 150-token passages, embeds them, and retrieves context based on cosine similarity thresholds (70% for top-3 passages, reranking if below threshold). Three models (GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-2.5-flash, Llama-4-maverick) are tested in both closed-book and RAG-enhanced modes across six cognitive domains, measuring accuracy percentages for each domain and overall performance.

## Key Results
- RAG-enhanced models significantly outperform baseline models in lower and mid-level cognitive tasks (Remembering, Understanding, Applying)
- Gemini-2.5 (RAG) achieved the highest overall accuracy (92.53%) across all cognitive domains
- Higher-order creative tasks showed the most significant performance gap even with RAG enhancement, highlighting challenges in culturally grounded generative synthesis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Contextual Grounding via Dynamic Retrieval
RAG enhances performance in lower-order cognitive tasks (Remembering, Understanding) by bypassing the "knowledge sparsity" inherent in pre-trained parametric memory for underrepresented cultures. The system converts user queries into vectors and retrieves semantically matched passages from a curated Hakka cultural database before generation, shifting the model's function from recalling internal weights to synthesizing external, verified context.

### Mechanism 2: The Retrieval-Creativity Inversion
While retrieval improves factual accuracy, it constrains "creative" synthesis because models tend to parrot retrieved context rather than integrate it into novel cultural artifacts. The "Creating" domain requires generative abstraction, but current RAG implementations prioritize semantic similarity, anchoring the model to existing text and inhibiting the "leaps" required for creative cultural design.

### Mechanism 3: Hierarchical Similarity Filtering (The 70% Threshold)
A tiered retrieval strategy optimizes the balance between precision and recall in specialized domains. The system checks if the top-3 retrieved passages exceed a 70% similarity score. If yes, it uses them directly (high confidence). If not, it triggers a reranking algorithm on the top 30 results (broader search), minimizing noise for simple queries while maximizing coverage for complex ones.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bloom’s Taxonomy Applied to AI**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses this educational framework not just for categorization, but as a diagnostic tool to measure *where* the model fails (e.g., it passes "Memory" but fails "Creating").
  - Quick check question: If a model can recite a historical fact (Remembering) but cannot explain its social impact (Analyzing), which level of the taxonomy has failed?

- **Concept: Knowledge Sparsity in Pre-training**
  - Why needed here: This is the problem RAG solves. LLMs are "diluted" regarding minority cultures (Hakka) because these cultures represent a tiny fraction of the training tokens.
  - Quick check question: Why does increasing model parameters (e.g., moving from 7B to 70B) not necessarily solve the "hallucination" issue for specific, underrepresented cultural rituals?

- **Concept: Hybrid Retrieval Strategy (Vector + Keyword/Rerank)**
  - Why needed here: The paper details a specific "retrieve-then-rerank" logic. Understanding this is crucial for debugging why a model retrieved a specific document.
  - Quick check question: In this architecture, what triggers the "reranking" process versus direct context injection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Hakka Culture Encyclopedia & MoE Knowledge Base (PDFs → OCR) → Chunking (150 tokens) → Embedding Model → Vector Database → Similarity Threshold Filter (70%) → Reranker (if below threshold) → LLM (Gemini/GPT/Llama) + Context Prompt → JSON Output

- **Critical path:** The quality of the OCR and Chunking strategy. If the PDF-to-text conversion is poor or chunks cut off mid-sentence, the 70% similarity threshold mechanism will fail, leading to low retrieval scores and irrelevant context being injected.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Multiple Choice vs. Open Generation: The paper uses Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) for standardized scoring (high reliability) at the cost of measuring true generative "creativity" (low validity for the "Creating" domain).
  - One-Retrieval Limit: The system allows only one retrieval per question to save cost/latency, which risks failure on multi-hop questions requiring synthesis of two distant facts.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Content Errors": Mislabeling customs (non-RAG mode)
  - "Creativity Deficiencies": Recycling the retrieved text verbatim rather than synthesizing a new design (RAG mode)
  - Threshold Miss: The model answers generically because the specific cultural retrieval failed to hit the 70% similarity score

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Run the benchmark in "Closed-Book" mode to confirm the paper's finding that base models fail specific cultural recall (validate "Knowledge Sparsity")
  2. Threshold Sensitivity Analysis: Adjust the 70% similarity threshold (e.g., down to 50% or up to 85%) to observe the change in the "Understanding" vs. "Creating" trade-off
  3. Ablation on "Creating": Modify the prompt for the "Creating" domain to explicitly forbid verbatim copying of the retrieved context, measuring if "creativity" scores improve or if hallucination increases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does shifting from multiple-choice to open-ended tasks affect LLM performance in the "Creating" domain of cultural knowledge?
  - Basis in paper: The authors state that the multiple-choice design "inevitably restricts the expressive and generative range of the models" and recommend future research incorporate open-ended formats to better capture creative reasoning.

- **Open Question 2:** To what extent do these cognitive performance patterns generalize to other architectures (e.g., Claude, Mistral) and multilingual minority cultures?
  - Basis in paper: The paper notes that excluding other leading models "limits generalizability" and explicitly calls for future work to incorporate "multilingual, multimodal, and community-curated datasets."

- **Open Question 3:** Can specific hybrid architectures overcome the "creativity deficiency" observed in RAG systems for cultural synthesis?
  - Basis in paper: The conclusion notes that while RAG aids retrieval, "performance in higher-order domains such as Creating remains limited," suggesting a need for "culturally adaptive generation strategies" beyond standard retrieval.

## Limitations
- The evaluation framework's reliance on multiple-choice questions for the "Creating" domain constrains our ability to capture true generative creativity in cultural synthesis
- The proprietary nature of the evaluation corpus prevents independent verification of the reported performance gains
- The specific embedding model used for retrieval remains unspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** RAG's effectiveness for lower-order cognitive tasks (Remembering, Understanding) - supported by consistent accuracy improvements across all tested models with minimal variance
- **Medium Confidence:** The retrieval-creativity inversion hypothesis - while the data shows RAG constraining creative performance, the MCQ format makes it difficult to definitively separate this from fundamental model limitations
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about the 70% similarity threshold's optimality - the corpus provides insufficient detail on threshold tuning or sensitivity analysis

## Next Checks
1. **Corpus Transparency Test:** Attempt to recreate a subset of the benchmark using publicly available Hakka cultural resources, measuring if the same accuracy patterns emerge with a synthetic dataset
2. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary the similarity threshold (40%, 60%, 80%) and measure the precision-recall tradeoff across cognitive domains to validate the 70% default
3. **Open-Ended Creativity Validation:** Replace 10% of multiple-choice "Creating" questions with open-ended prompts requiring cultural design, evaluating responses through blinded human review to assess if MCQ constraints masked genuine creative capability
