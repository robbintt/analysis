# On the accuracy of implicit neural representations for cardiovascular anatomies and hemodynamic fields

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20970
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20970
- Reference count: 40
- This paper evaluates the accuracy of implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling cardiovascular anatomies and hemodynamic fields

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates nine state-of-the-art implicit neural representation architectures for compressing and accurately representing cardiovascular simulation data. The research focuses on both geometric representations through signed distance functions and hemodynamic field reconstructions for blood flow simulations. Results demonstrate that INRs achieve remarkable compression ratios (up to 230x) while maintaining clinically relevant accuracy levels, with pressure errors under 1 mmHg and velocity errors between 5-10 cm/s for pulsatile flows. The work provides critical insights into which INR architectures perform best for cardiovascular applications and establishes benchmarks for future developments in this rapidly evolving field.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive evaluation of nine INR architectures on cardiovascular applications, including MLP with positional encoding, SIREN, multiplicative filter networks, and multiresolution hash encoding. They tested these architectures on simulated blood flow data and patient-specific aortic geometries, using metrics such as normalized mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index. The study employed both idealized flow simulations and 48 patient-specific aortic models to assess geometric and hemodynamic representation accuracy. Performance was evaluated across different parameter counts and compression ratios to determine the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.

## Key Results
- INRs achieved compression ratios up to 230x with clinically acceptable errors (pressure < 1 mmHg, velocity 5-10 cm/s)
- For anatomical representations, signed distance functions yielded average errors below 0.5 mm and maximum errors under 1.6 mm across 48 patient-specific aortic models
- SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE architectures demonstrated the best overall performance for cardiovascular applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Implicit neural representations work effectively for cardiovascular applications because they can learn continuous, differentiable mappings between spatial coordinates and field values, enabling smooth interpolation and high compression ratios. The success stems from their ability to capture the smooth, continuous nature of both anatomical structures and hemodynamic fields, which exhibit gradual variations rather than sharp discontinuities. These architectures excel at representing complex geometries and physical fields with relatively few parameters compared to traditional grid-based approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Implicit Neural Representations**: Learn continuous functions that map coordinates to field values, enabling efficient compression and smooth interpolation - needed for representing continuous cardiovascular geometries and flow fields, quick check: verify function continuity at boundaries
- **Signed Distance Functions**: Mathematical representations that encode geometric shapes by measuring distance to surface boundaries - essential for accurate anatomical modeling, quick check: confirm SDF gradients point toward surface
- **Pulsatile Flow Dynamics**: Time-varying blood flow patterns driven by cardiac cycles - critical for realistic hemodynamic simulations, quick check: validate flow reversal during diastole
- **Multiresolution Hash Encoding**: Spatial hashing technique that partitions space into grids at multiple scales - enables efficient high-frequency detail capture, quick check: verify hash table collision rates
- **Positional Encoding**: Technique that transforms input coordinates into higher-dimensional space - improves representation of high-frequency features, quick check: confirm frequency spectrum coverage
- **SIREN (Sinusoidal Representation Networks)**: Neural networks using sinusoidal activation functions - particularly effective for representing periodic and smooth signals, quick check: validate frequency response characteristics

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Coordinates -> Positional Encoding -> INR Backbone -> Output Field Values

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves transforming spatial coordinates through positional encoding (if used), processing through the INR backbone architecture (MLP, SIREN, or hash-based), and producing the desired field values (geometry or hemodynamic quantities).

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoffs involve balancing accuracy against parameter efficiency, choosing between global representations (MLP-based) versus local representations (hash-based), and selecting activation functions appropriate for the target signal characteristics. Global architectures offer better compression but may struggle with high-frequency details, while local approaches handle fine features better but require more parameters.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include artifacts at sharp features or boundaries, poor representation of high-frequency details, and numerical instability during training. MLP-based architectures may exhibit smooth but incorrect interpolation between distant points, while hash-based methods can show block artifacts if grid resolution is insufficient.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test basic coordinate-to-field mapping on simple geometric primitives (sphere, cylinder) to verify network functionality
2. Evaluate convergence behavior with increasing parameter counts on a representative anatomical dataset
3. Compare interpolation accuracy between training and unseen test regions to assess generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to idealized flow simulations and aortic geometries, lacking validation on other vessel types or pathological conditions
- Performance comparison focuses on specific INR architectures without exploring hyperparameter optimization that might yield different results
- Study does not address temporal consistency in hemodynamic fields across multiple cardiac cycles or potential generalization to different flow regimes
- Computational efficiency metrics are not thoroughly characterized beyond compression ratios

## Confidence

**High confidence** in INR accuracy for aortic geometry representation (based on 48 patient-specific models with quantified error metrics)

**Medium confidence** in hemodynamic field accuracy (limited to specific simulation parameters and flow conditions)

**Medium confidence** in architectural comparisons (SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE performance, but without exhaustive hyperparameter tuning)

## Next Checks
1. Validate INR performance on diverse vascular anatomies beyond the aorta, including stenotic and aneurysmal geometries
2. Test generalization to different hemodynamic conditions and flow regimes not included in the original training data
3. Evaluate temporal consistency and generalization across multiple cardiac cycles for pulsatile flow simulations
