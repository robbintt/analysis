# A preliminary data fusion study to assess the feasibility of Foundation Process-Property Models in Laser Powder Bed Fusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16667
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16667
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Data fusion between 17-4 PH and 316L stainless steels does not improve predictive accuracy for LPBF process-property models

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether data fusion techniques can enable transfer learning between different materials in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) by examining the feasibility of foundation process-property models. The authors conduct controlled experiments using Gaussian processes to model the relationship between five process parameters and two mechanical properties (porosity and hardness) for both 17-4 PH stainless steel and 316L stainless steel. Through extensive cross-validation studies and analysis of interpretable GP hyperparameters, they find that combining datasets from different materials does not significantly improve predictive accuracy, suggesting that material system compatibility is crucial for successful transfer learning in LPBF.

## Method Summary
The authors collect 270 process parameter combinations (laser power, scan speed, layer thickness, hatch spacing, scan rotation) for both 17-4 PH SS and 316L SS, measuring porosity (image thresholding) and hardness (median of 6×6 microindentation grid). They implement single-output Gaussian processes (SOGPs) and multi-task Gaussian processes (MTGPs) with Gaussian kernels, optimizing hyperparameters via maximum likelihood estimation. For data fusion, they augment inputs with categorical material indicators and use one-hot encoding. Models are evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation with RMSE as the primary metric, and GP lengthscale hyperparameters are analyzed to assess transferability.

## Key Results
- Fused data models do not outperform single-material models for either material or property
- GP lengthscale for material indicator substantially exceeds process parameter lengthscales, indicating effective independence
- Cross-property correlation (porosity vs. hardness) does not improve predictions in MTGP framework
- Analysis of interpretable hyperparameters confirms materials behave as nearly independent datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GP lengthscale parameters can indicate when datasets are too dissimilar for effective fusion.
- Mechanism: The Gaussian kernel's lengthscale hyperparameters (ω) quantify how rapidly correlations decay as input features vary. When the lengthscale for a categorical source variable (material type) substantially exceeds those of process parameters, it signals that the data sources are nearly independent—correlations die quickly across materials even when process parameters match.
- Core assumption: Lengthscale magnitude faithfully reflects underlying data structure and is not an artifact of optimization or limited data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "analysis of interpretable GP hyperparameters" used to assess transferability
  - [Section 3.3]: "the lengthscale parameter corresponding to the categorical source indicator variable (i.e., s) in the bi-material models is significantly larger than the largest lengthscales corresponding to the process parameters. For example, in the SOGP HV model the lengthscale for s is 1.30 while for p is −0.98. Such a difference indicates that the two materials are effectively independent"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct support; neighbor papers focus on process optimization rather than fusion diagnostics.
- Break condition: If lengthscales for categorical and process variables converge, or if MLE optimization fails to converge due to multimodality, the diagnostic becomes unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Data fusion can be implemented by converting multi-source data into a latent space learning problem via categorical variable augmentation.
- Mechanism: Each input is augmented with a categorical source indicator (e.g., material type). These indicators receive quantitative priors passed through a parametric embedding function to generate low-dimensional latent representations. The GP then learns on the augmented input space, allowing the kernel to capture both within-source and cross-source correlations.
- Core assumption: The embedding function dimensionality and parameterization are sufficient to capture meaningful differences without overfitting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.4]: "we follow [14] where data fusion is converted to a latent space learning problem. This conversion is achieved by augmenting each input with an additional categorical variable, s, which represents the source of the input"
  - [Section 2.4]: "Since we only have two types of material in this paper, our assigned priors are only one-dimensional (e.g., one-hot encoding) which reduces the parameter number of the embedding function to one"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus support for this specific fusion technique in LPBF context.
- Break condition: If the number of sources grows substantially without corresponding increase in embedding capacity, or if sources share no common input features, the latent representation may fail to capture transferable structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-task GPs can jointly model correlated properties through a Kronecker-structured covariance, but cross-property correlation does not guarantee improved prediction.
- Mechanism: MTGPs define joint covariance as cov(y_g, y_g') = c(x, x') × C_T[g,g'], where C_T is a learned task correlation matrix. This allows information sharing between properties (porosity and hardness) that share the same input space. However, if task-specific noise dominates or the shared signal is weak, MTGP may not outperform independent SOGPs.
- Core assumption: Properties that are physically correlated (e.g., porosity inversely affects hardness) will yield predictive gains when modeled jointly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.3]: "cov_MT(y_g(x), y_g'(x')) = c(x, x'; σ², θ) × c_gg'" and "C_MT = C ⊗ C_T where ⊗ denotes Kronecker product"
  - [Section 3.3]: "the off-diagonal term of C_T...is negative and it indicates a negative correlation between the two properties...Nonetheless, this cross-property correlation does not improve the performance of the model"
  - [Section 3.2]: "MTGP does not consistently outperform SOGP and vice versa; suggesting that the correlations between ϕ and HV are either very small, or cannot be learned via our MTGPs"
  - [corpus]: Weak support; corpus papers focus on single-task process modeling.
- Break condition: If task correlation is purely spurious (non-causal), or if measurement noise differs substantially across tasks, MTGP fusion may degrade rather than improve predictions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Gaussian Process Regression**
  - Why needed here: GPs are the core modeling framework for process-property relationships; understanding their mean/covariance functions, hyperparameter estimation via MLE, and predictive distributions is essential to interpret all results.
  - Quick check question: Given a GP with RBF kernel, what does a large lengthscale for feature x_i imply about the response's sensitivity to that feature?

- **Concept: Transfer Learning and Data Fusion**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central question is whether knowledge transfers across materials; distinguishing between naive data concatenation and principled transfer (e.g., physics-informed priors) is critical for interpreting the negative findings.
  - Quick check question: Why might simply concatenating datasets from two materials fail to improve predictions even when both materials share identical process parameter ranges?

- **Concept: Covariance Kernel Design for Mixed Variables**
  - Why needed here: The data fusion approach augments continuous process parameters with categorical material indicators; understanding how kernels handle mixed variable types (via latent maps or embedding functions) is necessary to implement and debug such models.
  - Quick check question: When using a categorical variable s in a GP kernel, what does the learned lengthscale ω_s indicate about cross-category correlation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Sobol-sampled process parameters (5 inputs) → material type (categorical) → porosity/hardness measurements → GP model (SOGP or MTGP) → cross-validation evaluation

- **Critical path:**
  1. Collect paired (X, y) data for both materials under identical process conditions
  2. Choose model configuration (SOGP vs. MTGP, single vs. fused)
  3. Initialize hyperparameters; optimize marginal likelihood
  4. Extract lengthscales to diagnose fusion feasibility
  5. Run cross-validation; compare RMSE across configurations

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Parsimonious kernels (Gaussian) reduce overfitting risk on small data but may underfit complex process-property relationships
  - One-dimensional embedding for binary categorical variable limits expressiveness but prevents overfitting; higher-capacity embeddings needed for >2 sources
  - MTGPs increase parameter count (C_T matrix) which may hurt more than help when cross-property signal is weak

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Fused model RMSE exceeds single-material baseline → datasets likely independent; abandon naive fusion
  - Lengthscale for categorical variable >> process parameter lengthscales → sources effectively uncorrelated
  - MTGP C_T off-diagonal near zero or inconsistent with physical intuition → cross-property learning failing

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train SOGP on 17-4 PH SS alone; record RMSE and lengthscales for each process parameter. Establish single-material baseline.
  2. Train SOGP on fused data (both materials with categorical augmentation); compare RMSE to baseline and inspect lengthscale for material indicator. If ω_s >> ω_process, fusion is not learning shared structure.
  3. Train MTGP on single material (joint ϕ and HV); verify C_T off-diagonal sign matches expected physical correlation (negative for porosity-hardness). If MTGP RMSE ≈ SOGP RMSE, cross-property learning provides no marginal benefit.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the negative findings regarding uninformed data fusion between 17-4 PH and 316L stainless steels be generalized to other material systems in Laser Powder Bed Fusion?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "the analysis is limited to two materials and the generalizability of our findings across a broader range of materials must be explored."
- Why unresolved: The study focused exclusively on two specific stainless steel alloys; it remains unknown if other material pairs with different degrees of physical similarity might yield successful transfer learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Repeating the cross-validation data fusion experiments on distinct material pairs (e.g., different aluminum or titanium alloys) to see if fused models outperform single-material models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would utilizing more flexible machine learning kernels or significantly larger datasets overcome the limitations observed with the parsimonious Gaussian processes used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion notes, "Leveraging more flexible kernels or ML models with larger datasets should be considered in the future studies."
- Why unresolved: The authors deliberately used parsimonious kernels to avoid overfitting on the relatively small dataset (270 samples per material), leaving the potential of higher-capacity models untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of deep Gaussian processes or neural networks to a larger fused dataset to determine if increased model complexity allows the model to capture shared patterns that the simpler GPs missed.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can physics-informed priors or hierarchical modeling be integrated to create "structured learning" approaches that successfully enable data fusion where uninformed methods failed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Abstract and Conclusion explicitly call for "structured learning approaches that incorporate domain knowledge" rather than "uninformed data fusion."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that simply concatenating data fails but does not construct or test the proposed alternative solution involving domain knowledge or physics constraints.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing a multi-task GP framework that encodes known physical relationships (e.g., thermal properties) as priors and demonstrating that this structured fusion improves predictive accuracy over the baseline.

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to two specific stainless steel alloys (17-4 PH and 316L), limiting generalizability to other material systems
- Relatively small dataset (270 samples per material) may not capture subtle transferable patterns
- Gaussian kernel assumes stationarity and smoothness which may not reflect sharp transitions in LPBF process-property relationships

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation of GPs and data fusion mechanics (Mechanism 2)
- **Medium confidence**: Diagnostic value of lengthscale analysis (Mechanism 1) due to limited corpus support
- **Low confidence**: MTGP failure indicates no cross-property learning is possible—optimization may have converged to poor local minima

## Next Checks
1. Perform sensitivity analysis on GP hyperparameters to verify lengthscale magnitudes are not artifacts of initialization or optimization instability
2. Test alternative kernels (e.g., Matérn) to assess whether Gaussian stationarity assumptions contribute to fusion failure
3. Apply the same fusion methodology to materials with stronger expected transferability (e.g., different heat treatments of the same alloy) to establish a positive control
