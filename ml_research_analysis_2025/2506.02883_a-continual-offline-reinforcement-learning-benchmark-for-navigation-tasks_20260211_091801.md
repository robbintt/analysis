# A Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Navigation Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02883
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02883
- Authors: Anthony Kobanda; Odalric-Ambrym Maillard; Rémy Portelas
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Introduces Continual NavBench benchmark for CRL navigation tasks with standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and method comparisons

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Continual NavBench, a novel benchmark for Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning (CRL) in navigation tasks within video game environments. The benchmark addresses the challenge of evaluating CRL algorithms that must adapt to changing tasks without catastrophic forgetting. The authors provide standardized offline datasets from 10 hours of human gameplay across diverse Godot mazes, evaluation protocols, and metrics. They evaluate various CRL methods including PNN, HiSPO, EWC, L2 regularization, and replay-based approaches on these datasets.

## Method Summary
The authors present a comprehensive framework for evaluating CRL algorithms in navigation tasks. The benchmark consists of standardized datasets collected from 10 hours of human gameplay in Godot maze environments, evaluation protocols measuring performance across task sequences, and a suite of CRL methods for comparison. The evaluation includes both performance metrics and computational overhead analysis, providing a holistic assessment of method capabilities and limitations.

## Key Results
- PNN achieves the highest performance but with significant memory and computational costs
- HiSPO shows good performance with moderate overhead compared to other methods
- The benchmark provides reproducible framework for comparing CRL methods in navigation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its standardized datasets and evaluation protocols that enable fair comparison of CRL methods. The use of human gameplay data provides realistic task distributions, while the maze navigation tasks create meaningful continual learning challenges requiring spatial reasoning and path planning.

## Foundational Learning
- Continual Learning: Prevents catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new tasks
  - Why needed: CRL algorithms must maintain performance on previous tasks while learning new ones
  - Quick check: Methods should show stable performance across task sequences

- Offline Reinforcement Learning: Learns from fixed datasets without environment interaction
  - Why needed: Realistic scenarios where online data collection is expensive or dangerous
  - Quick check: Algorithms should learn effectively from static datasets

- Navigation Tasks: Requires spatial reasoning and path planning
  - Why needed: Tests CRL algorithms in complex, sequential decision-making scenarios
  - Quick check: Performance should scale with task complexity and maze size

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Data Collection -> Benchmark Framework -> CRL Methods -> Evaluation Metrics
- Critical Path: Dataset collection and preprocessing must complete before method training and evaluation
- Design Tradeoffs: Performance vs. computational overhead, generalization vs. specialization
- Failure Signatures: Catastrophic forgetting, poor adaptation to new tasks, excessive memory usage
- First Experiments:
  1. Baseline performance comparison without continual learning
  2. Single-task offline RL performance as upper bound
  3. Memory and computational overhead analysis for each method

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to maze navigation tasks within Godot environment, limiting generalizability
- Human gameplay dataset may introduce biases based on human decision-making patterns
- Performance comparisons lack statistical significance testing across multiple random seeds
- Memory/computational cost analysis incomplete for real-world deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- Benchmark design and dataset collection: **High** - Clear methodology and reproducible
- Comparative performance rankings: **Medium** - Clear trends but no statistical validation
- Memory/computational cost analysis: **Medium** - Overhead metrics reported but incomplete

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing across at least 5 random seeds for all evaluated methods to confirm robustness of performance differences
2. Expand evaluation to include at least two additional navigation environments to test generalizability
3. Implement comprehensive inference-time efficiency benchmarking, including memory usage during deployment and real-time performance constraints for top-performing methods
