# A General Approach to Visualizing Uncertainty in Statistical Graphics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.00937
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00937
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: A general method for visualizing uncertainty in 2-D statistical graphics by treating visualizations as functions of uncertain quantities, implemented as an open-source Python library with theoretical coverage guarantees.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a general method for visualizing uncertainty in 2-D statistical graphics by treating visualizations as functions of their underlying uncertain quantities. The core innovation is that uncertainty in these quantities induces a distribution over images, which can be aggregated to represent uncertainty. The approach is implemented for independent and identically distributed (IID) data using resampling, provided as an open-source Python library. Through several examples, the paper demonstrates how both familiar and novel forms of uncertainty visualization can be created, with standard representations like confidence intervals emerging with their usual coverage guarantees without explicit quantification.

## Method Summary
The method treats a visualization as a deterministic function M mapping data values to images. When the input data has uncertainty (modeled as a distribution F), M produces a distribution over images. By sampling from F and applying M repeatedly, we generate multiple images that are pixel-wise averaged to create a single visualization representing uncertainty. For IID data, the implementation uses bootstrap resampling to generate the distribution over data values. The aggregation includes an intensity transformation using a Beta CDF to maintain perceptibility while preserving ordering. The theoretical coverage guarantee is (n-1)/(n+1) for n samples, meaning 39 samples provide 95% coverage.

## Key Results
- The approach can generate a wide range of uncertainty visualizations including univariate distributions, bivariate distributions, distributions over functions, and distributions over probability simplices
- Standard representations such as confidence intervals and bands emerge with their usual coverage guarantees without being explicitly quantified or visualized
- The implementation provides a simple interface requiring only a base visualization function and dataset, producing raster images with theoretical coverage guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Image Distribution from Uncertainty
- Claim: Treating a visualization as a function of uncertain quantities induces a distribution over images, which can be aggregated to represent uncertainty
- Core assumption: The base visualization is a deterministic, well-defined function that produces consistent outputs for the same inputs
- Break condition: If the base visualization is non-deterministic (e.g., uses random layout, auto-scaling dependent on data range), the functional mapping breaks down and the aggregate becomes meaningless

### Mechanism 2: Pixel-wise Aggregation Yields Coverage Guarantees
- Claim: Averaging pixel intensities across sample images creates visual uncertainty representations with formal coverage guarantees derived from order statistics
- Core assumption: Visual elements vary along interpretable dimensions (position, length) that correspond monotonically to the underlying uncertain quantity
- Break condition: When visual channels are not injective (e.g., 3+ colors mapping to same aggregate color), or when dependent quantities interact (pie chart slices affecting each other's positions), the coverage guarantees become difficult to interpret

### Mechanism 3: Intensity Transformation for Perceptual Visibility
- Claim: A Beta CDF-based transformation adjusts relative frequencies to maintain perceptibility while preserving ordering
- Core assumption: Human perception has limited sensitivity to low intensities; a monotonic transformation can preserve ordering while improving visibility
- Break condition: Over-aggressive transformation (τ→0.5 or k→extremes) yields solid colors, losing all uncertainty information

## Foundational Learning

- **Order Statistics and Range Coverage**
  - Why needed here: The theoretical guarantee that n samples produce (n-1)/(n+1) coverage depends on understanding order statistics—specifically, the probability that a new observation falls within the min-max range of previous observations
  - Quick check question: If you draw 19 independent samples from any distribution (continuous, no ties), what is the probability that a 20th independent sample falls within the observed range? (Answer: 18/20 = 90%)

- **Bootstrap Resampling (Non-parametric)**
  - Why needed here: The `bootplot` implementation generates the base distribution by sampling with replacement at the original dataset size, approximating the sampling distribution of the quantity of interest
  - Quick check question: Why does resampling with replacement at size n approximate drawing new datasets from the same population? (Answer: The empirical distribution function converges to the true distribution; resampling from it simulates drawing from the population.)

- **Injectivity of Visual Channels**
  - Why needed here: Not all visual encodings preserve uncertainty information. Position is injective (each position uniquely identifies a value), but color blending with 3+ colors is not (different distributions can produce identical aggregate colors)
  - Quick check question: Why does a grayscale gradient fail to distinguish between "certain value 0.5" and "uncertain value with mean 0.5 symmetrically distributed"? (Answer: Both produce identical mid-gray in the pixel aggregate; the mapping from distribution to color is not injective.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input layer (user provides dataset + base visualization function) -> Sampling layer (bootstrap resampler generates n resampled datasets) -> Rendering layer (base visualization executed n times) -> Aggregation layer (pixel-wise averaging across all n images) -> Post-processing layer (intensity transformation using Beta CDF) -> Output layer (single aggregated PNG image)

- **Critical path**:
  1. User defines base visualization with consistent layout (fixed axis limits, color mappings, element ordering)
  2. System resamples data n times using non-parametric bootstrap
  3. Each resample rendered to raster at identical resolution and bounds
  4. All n images aggregated pixel-by-pixel across RGB channels
  5. Intensity transformation applied to improve perceptibility
  6. Result saved as PNG

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Raster-only output: Pixel aggregation is fundamentally incompatible with vector graphics; acceptable for static publication figures but limits interactivity
  - Sample size vs. runtime: O(n × C_base) where n is fixed by coverage, not data size; typical runtime ~1 second with parallelization
  - IID assumption in current implementation: Simplifies interface but limits direct application; extensible to other sampling schemes with interface changes
  - Ad-hoc intensity transformation: Improves visibility but introduces parameters (τ, k) that may require tuning for edge cases

- **Failure signatures**:
  1. Inconsistent axes: Auto-scaling causes each sample image to have different limits → misaligned, unusable aggregate
  2. Non-deterministic base visualization: Random internal state → different images for identical resampled data → non-reproducible results
  3. Anti-aliasing blur: Sub-pixel rendering creates faint borders that disappear in aggregate (recommend disabling anti-aliasing)
  4. Color non-injectivity: 3+ categorical colors blend to identical aggregates → uncertainty unreadable
  5. High variance, low visual area: Points/lines over large variation range → imperceptibly faint aggregate without intensity transformation

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce Figure 6 (point estimate CIs): Load a univariate dataset, write a base visualization that plots the group mean as a single point with fixed xlim/ylim, run `bootplot` with n=39, and verify the horizontal spread visually matches a 95% CI computed via standard bootstrap percentile method
  2. Empirically validate coverage: Generate synthetic data from a known distribution, create the uncertainty visualization with n=19 (90% coverage), repeat the entire process 1000 times with fresh data, and verify that approximately 90% of new sample means fall within the visualized bounds
  3. Demonstrate axis inconsistency failure: Create a base visualization without explicit `ax.set(xlim=..., ylim=...)`, run `bootplot`, observe the garbled output, then add fixed axis bounds and re-run to see the corrected result

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can theoretical coverage guarantees be established for convex hulls and simultaneous confidence bands within this framework? (Basis: Section 7.1 states this exploration is left to future work; requires knowledge of dependency structure among quantities of interest)

- **Open Question 2**: Is the approach effective as a teaching tool, and are novel outputs like "blurry text" valuable for practical interpretation? (Basis: Section 7.1 notes uncertainty about whether this general approach would serve as an effective teaching or practical tool and how valuable novel techniques like blurry text are; lacks empirical user studies)

- **Open Question 3**: Can the implementation be adapted to complex sampling schemes like hierarchical models while preserving simplicity? (Basis: Section 7.1 emphasizes the need to investigate how it can be adapted to more complex scenarios while preserving simplicity and usability; current implementation is limited to IID data)

## Limitations

- Raster-only output: The pixel aggregation approach fundamentally requires raster images, making the method unsuitable for interactive visualizations or situations requiring vector graphics
- Layout consistency requirement: The method demands strict consistency in base visualization layout (fixed axes, colors, element ordering), significantly limiting the range of base visualizations that can be used
- IID assumption in current implementation: While the theoretical framework extends to other sampling schemes, the open-source implementation only supports non-parametric bootstrap for IID data

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of image distribution from uncertainty and the coverage guarantees from pixel-wise aggregation are mathematically sound and well-supported by the theoretical analysis
- **Medium Confidence**: The intensity transformation works in practice for improving visibility, but the parameter choices appear somewhat ad-hoc and may need adjustment for different visualization types
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that "standard representations emerge without being explicitly quantified" is demonstrated through examples but lacks systematic validation across diverse visualization types and statistical scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Coverage validation experiment**: Generate synthetic data from known distributions, create uncertainty visualizations with different sample sizes, and empirically verify that the actual coverage matches the theoretical (n-1)/(n+1) guarantees across multiple distribution families

2. **Layout consistency stress test**: Systematically test the failure modes by creating base visualizations with intentional inconsistencies (random colors, auto-scaling, random element ordering) and document how the aggregates break down

3. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Vary the intensity transformation parameters (τ, k) across a wide range and quantify their effects on both perceptual visibility and the preservation of uncertainty information in the aggregate
