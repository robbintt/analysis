# Zero-Shot Forecasting Mortality Rates: A Global Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13521
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13521
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: CHRONOS foundation model outperformed traditional methods for short-term mortality forecasting

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated zero-shot time series forecasting models for mortality rate prediction across 50 countries and 111 age groups. Two foundation models, TimesFM and CHRONOS, were tested alongside traditional and machine learning methods across 5-, 10-, and 20-year horizons. CHRONOS delivered competitive short-term forecasts, often outperforming traditional models like ARIMA and Lee-Carter. TimesFM consistently underperformed. Fine-tuning CHRONOS on mortality data significantly improved long-term accuracy. A Random Forest model trained on mortality data achieved the best overall performance.

## Method Summary
The study employed a comprehensive evaluation framework testing foundation models (TimesFM, CHRONOS) against traditional statistical methods (ARIMA, Lee-Carter) and machine learning approaches across multiple forecast horizons. Models were evaluated on historical mortality data spanning 50 countries and 111 age groups, with performance measured across 5-, 10-, and 20-year forecasting horizons. The methodology included fine-tuning experiments on foundation models using mortality-specific training data.

## Key Results
- CHRONOS foundation model achieved competitive short-term (5-year) forecasting accuracy, often outperforming traditional ARIMA and Lee-Carter models
- TimesFM consistently underperformed across all forecast horizons and geographic regions
- Fine-tuning CHRONOS on mortality-specific data significantly improved long-term (20-year) forecasting accuracy
- Random Forest trained on mortality data achieved the best overall performance across all metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Zero-shot forecasting leverages pre-trained foundation models that have learned general temporal patterns from diverse time series data. These models can generate forecasts without task-specific training by recognizing underlying patterns and structures in mortality data. The success of CHRONOS suggests it captures relevant temporal dynamics and demographic patterns that transfer effectively to mortality forecasting tasks, particularly for shorter horizons where general temporal patterns remain more stable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time series decomposition** - Understanding trend, seasonal, and residual components is essential for interpreting mortality patterns and model behavior
- **Demographic transition theory** - Provides context for mortality patterns and helps validate model predictions against expected population dynamics
- **Cross-validation for time series** - Critical for reliable performance estimation without data leakage, particularly important when evaluating zero-shot approaches
- **Foundation model transfer learning** - Understanding how pre-training on diverse time series enables zero-shot forecasting capabilities

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: TimesFM/CHRONOS foundation models -> Fine-tuning layer -> Forecasting output
**Critical Path**: Input time series → Foundation model embedding → Temporal attention mechanisms → Forecast generation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Zero-shot approaches offer rapid deployment without task-specific training but sacrifice accuracy compared to fine-tuned models; foundation models provide generalization but may miss domain-specific patterns
**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation with longer forecast horizons; underperformance in regions with limited historical data; inability to capture sudden demographic shifts or unprecedented events
**First Experiments**:
1. Test CHRONOS performance on mortality data from a single country with known demographic patterns
2. Compare zero-shot vs. fine-tuned CHRONOS performance on 5-year forecasts
3. Evaluate TimesFM on mortality data with different preprocessing pipelines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Historical mortality data may not capture unprecedented future scenarios such as novel pandemics or extreme climate events
- Evaluation focused on prediction accuracy metrics without extensive exploration of interpretability or uncertainty quantification capabilities
- Performance differential between models highly sensitive to forecast horizon length, with foundation models showing marked degradation beyond 10-year projections

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Short-term (5-year) forecasting performance of CHRONOS relative to traditional models; effectiveness of fine-tuning foundation models on mortality-specific data
- **Medium confidence**: Long-term (20-year) forecasting reliability of any tested model; generalizability across diverse demographic contexts with limited historical data
- **Low confidence**: TimesFM's absolute underperformance without additional hyperparameter tuning; the stability of relative model rankings across different geographic regions

## Next Checks
1. Implement uncertainty quantification methods for all models and assess prediction interval coverage across forecast horizons
2. Test model performance on mortality data from countries experiencing demographic transitions or data quality changes during the evaluation period
3. Conduct ablation studies on foundation model fine-tuning approaches, varying the amount of mortality-specific training data and transfer learning strategies
