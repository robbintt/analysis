## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Basis Vector Metric (BVM), a method for detecting state changes in images by amplifying distinguishing features through trained basis vectors. Using the MIT-States dataset with 53,000 images across 225 nouns and 115 adjectives, the authors compared BVM against six baseline metrics. BVM achieved the highest accuracy (66.14%) for classifying noun-adjective pairs, outperforming Naive Bayes (65.23%) and other baselines. For adjective discrimination, BVM scored 40.46% accuracy, lower than logistic regression's 45.13%, though BVM showed better performance with alternative embeddings (VGG19). The method is computationally efficient, requiring minimal training time and resources, making it practical for dynamic image classification tasks.

## Method Summary
BVM trains basis vectors to amplify discriminative features in image embeddings while suppressing irrelevant ones. The method uses a binary target matrix T to guide training: dimensions labeled 1 are up-weighted for class-relevant features, while 0 suppresses noise. The basis vectors B are optimized via loss = (1/N) * Σ|D·B^T - T| with Adam, progressively shaping B toward class-discriminative directions. For inference, query embeddings are projected onto trained basis vectors to yield interpretable match scores for state classification. The method operates entirely in embedding space and requires minimal training resources compared to deep learning approaches.

## Key Results
- BVM achieved 66.14% accuracy for noun-adjective pair classification, outperforming Naive Bayes (65.23%) and other baselines
- For adjective discrimination across all nouns, BVM scored 40.46% accuracy versus logistic regression's 45.13%
- BVM showed better performance with alternative embeddings (VGG19) despite lower overall accuracy
- The method requires minimal training time and resources compared to deep learning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BVM amplifies distinguishing embedding dimensions while suppressing irrelevant ones through learned basis vectors.
- Mechanism: A binary target matrix T (values 0 or 1) guides training: dimensions labeled 1 are up-weighted for class-relevant features, while 0 suppresses noise. The basis vectors B are optimized via `loss = (1/N) * Σ|D·B^T - T|` with Adam, progressively shaping B toward class-discriminative directions.
- Core assumption: Class-distinguishing information is linearly accessible in the embedding space; a binary mask can adequately separate signal from noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "using supervised learning to try to make the important attributes of our images get more amplified and trivial ones diminished"
  - [section 3] "0 will make values that we don't want to have much weight diminished, and 1 will try to increase the weight of the important values"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support—no directly comparable mechanisms found in neighbors; related work on task vectors (arXiv:2502.01015) explores linear operations but not binary masking.
- Break condition: If embeddings do not linearly encode state distinctions (e.g., highly entangled or non-linear), the binary mask cannot isolate signal; expect accuracy collapse toward random.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Projecting query embeddings onto trained basis vectors yields interpretable match scores for state classification.
- Mechanism: Given query Q and trained B, compute `M = Q · B^T · T^T`. Each column in M corresponds to a candidate state; the argmax column determines the predicted adjective. This linear projection exploits the training-induced alignment between B and T.
- Core assumption: The dot-product similarity between Q and B meaningfully reflects semantic alignment after training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We created this new metric with the goal in mind of being able to discern subtle differences between images"
  - [section 3] "Finally to find out which adjective the basis vector matched to the most similar to, just find what column in match scores has the largest value"
  - [corpus] No directly comparable projection-and-mask scheme in neighbors; task vector work suggests linear combinations are effective for transfer, but not for classification.
- Break condition: If basis vectors overfit to training nouns or fail to generalize across noun contexts, match scores will misrank states on held-out nouns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: BVM's performance depends on the embedding model's representation of state-relevant attributes.
- Mechanism: The method inherits representational biases from CLIP-ViT-Large-Patch14 or VGG19. When adjectives are not linearly separable in one embedding (CLIP), accuracy suffers; switching embeddings (VGG19) can invert relative performance between BVM and baselines, though absolute accuracy may drop.
- Core assumption: An embedding exists (or can be fine-tuned) where adjectives are more linearly separable along consistent directions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "BVM showed better performance with alternative embeddings (VGG19)"
  - [section 5] "using a different embedding model, VGG19, we found that our method was able to perform better than logistic regression... Though the overall accuracies are worse, BVM did get a higher accuracy"
  - [corpus] Neighbor work (arXiv:2502.14149) shows embedding quality affects downstream tasks, but no direct test of embedding-BVM coupling.
- Break condition: If no available embedding encodes adjectives with sufficient linear disentanglement, BVM will underperform simpler baselines regardless of training epochs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Image embeddings as dense vector representations
  - Why needed here: BVM operates entirely in embedding space; understanding that CLIP or VGG19 encode visual semantics into 768-D vectors is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why two images of "peeled apple" vs "whole apple" might have different CLIP embeddings, and what those differences encode?

- Concept: Basis vectors as learned directions in space
  - Why needed here: BVM trains basis vectors to point toward class-relevant subspaces; grasping this geometry is essential for debugging training.
  - Quick check question: Given two orthogonal 2D vectors, what happens if you rotate one 45° toward the other? How does this relate to BVM's training?

- Concept: Supervised learning with gradient descent and binary targets
  - Why needed here: BVM uses Adam to minimize a loss against a binary target matrix; understanding backpropagation through matrix operations is required to modify the method.
  - Quick check question: If loss plateaus at 0.3 instead of converging to 0, what might this indicate about the separability of your data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: D (dataset matrix) -> B (basis vectors) -> T (target matrix) -> Q (query) -> M (match scores)
- Critical path:
  1. Extract embeddings for all training images using CLIP-ViT-Large-Patch14.
  2. Initialize B as mean embedding per adjective for the current noun.
  3. Train B by minimizing `loss = (1/N) * Σ|D·B^T - T|` using Adam (default 1000 epochs in paper).
  4. For inference, compute M = Q·B^T·T^T and return argmax column as predicted adjective.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Epochs vs overfitting: 1000 epochs used; more may improve accuracy but risks overfitting to training nouns.
  - Embedding model: CLIP gives higher absolute accuracy (40.46% for BVM on adjectives) vs VGG19 (4.71%), but VGG19 makes BVM beat logistic regression slightly—choose based on relative vs absolute performance needs.
  - Training data per class: Paper filtered classes with ≤20 images; smaller N reduces BVM reliability.

- Failure signatures:
  - BVM predicts same adjective for all queries → basis vectors collapsed; check loss convergence and learning rate.
  - Accuracy drops sharply on specific adjectives (e.g., "blunt", "dull" at 0% in appendix) → embedding may not encode that distinction; consider alternative embeddings or data augmentation.
  - Large gap between training and test accuracy → overfitting to noun-specific features; reduce epochs or add regularization.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate noun-adjective pair experiment on a subset (e.g., 10 nouns) using CLIP embeddings; verify BVM achieves ~66% average accuracy before scaling.
  2. Ablate embedding model: swap CLIP for ResNet-50 on same subset; compare BVM vs Naive Bayes to isolate embedding contribution.
  3. Test generalization: train B on 80% of nouns, evaluate on held-out 20%; measure whether basis vectors transfer to unseen nouns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The binary target matrix T assumes linear separability of adjectives in embedding space - a strong assumption that may fail for complex state distinctions
- The method's performance varies significantly with embedding choice, suggesting dependence on embedding quality rather than inherent robustness
- Training requires sufficient samples per class (≥20 images), limiting applicability to data-scarce scenarios

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: BVM's computational efficiency and training simplicity are well-demonstrated through the 1000-epoch training process with minimal resource requirements. The superiority over Naive Bayes for noun-adjective pairs (66.14% vs 65.23%) is statistically supported with proper dataset filtering.

- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about BVM's state change detection capability are supported by MIT-States results but lack validation on other datasets or real-world applications. The embedding-dependence finding is well-supported but the mechanism for why different embeddings yield different relative performances needs further exploration.

- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that BVM is "particularly effective for state change detection" lacks direct evidence beyond the MIT-States experiments. The claim about minimal training resources doesn't quantify time/memory requirements across different hardware configurations.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset Generalization Test**: Evaluate BVM on a different state change detection dataset (e.g., Object State Dataset or CLEVR-Change) to verify if the 66% accuracy range holds beyond MIT-States, testing true robustness rather than dataset-specific optimization.

2. **Embedding Transferability Analysis**: Systematically test BVM across 5-10 different embedding models (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP variants) on the same MIT-States subset, measuring how basis vector quality correlates with embedding disentanglement metrics rather than just downstream accuracy.

3. **Resource Complexity Benchmarking**: Measure training time, memory usage, and inference latency for BVM across three dataset sizes (100, 1000, 10000 images) on standardized hardware, comparing against the six baseline methods to validate the "minimal resources" claim quantitatively.
