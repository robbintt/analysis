# Proof-of-TBI -- Fine-Tuned Vision Language Model Consortium and OpenAI-o3 Reasoning LLM-Based Medical Diagnosis Support System for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.18671
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18671
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Fine-tuned VLM consortium + OpenAI-o3 reasoning achieves improved diagnostic accuracy for mild TBI from MRI scans compared to baseline models

## Executive Summary
Proof-of-TBI is a medical diagnosis support system that addresses the challenge of diagnosing mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) from MRI scans using a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) and OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM. The system integrates three VLMs (Llama-Vision, Pixtral, Qwen2-VL) fine-tuned on labeled TBI MRI datasets using QLoRA for efficient deployment, then employs OpenAI-o3 to synthesize predictions from these models into a final diagnosis through consensus-based decision-making. Developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research team, the platform demonstrates improved diagnostic accuracy over traditional image classification approaches while maintaining deployability on consumer hardware.

## Method Summary
The system fine-tunes three pre-trained VLMs (Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, Pixtral-12B-2409, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct) using QLoRA with 4-bit quantization on labeled TBI MRI datasets formatted in Unsloth conversation structure. Fine-tuning is performed using the Unsloth library on Google Colab Tesla GPUs, with models deployed via Ollama for efficient inference. An LLM Agent layer orchestrates queries to all VLMs using LangChain/LlamaIndex, aggregates their predictions into structured prompts, and passes them to OpenAI-o3 for final reasoning-based diagnosis synthesis. The architecture includes data lake storage, VLM layer, LLM Agent layer, reasoning LLM layer, and mentions blockchain integration for data integrity.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned VLMs provide significantly more accurate predictions compared to baseline models
- OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM effectively synthesizes VLM predictions to produce reliable final diagnoses
- System demonstrates improved diagnostic accuracy over traditional image classification approaches like ResNet50
- QLoRA fine-tuning enables efficient deployment on consumer-grade hardware without sacrificing performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Domain-Adaptive Transfer via QLoRA Fine-Tuning
- Claim: Fine-tuning general-purpose VLMs on labeled TBI MRI datasets with QLoRA enables specialized diagnostic capability while maintaining deployability on consumer hardware
- Mechanism: Pre-trained VLMs possess general visual-linguistic representations from large-scale pre-training. QLoRA freezes base model weights and trains only low-rank adapter modules with 4-bit quantization, reducing memory requirements while adapting visual encoders to MRI-specific patterns and language heads to medical terminology
- Core assumption: The labeled TBI MRI dataset contains annotations of sufficient quality and consistency for effective transfer; subtle TBI features are learnable from available training data
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The system fine-tunes multiple vision-language models...uses quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA) for efficient deployment on consumer hardware"; [section 3.2] "Fine-tuning is conducted using the Unsloth library...integrates Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA), incorporating 4-bit quantization"

### Mechanism 2: Consortium-Based Error Mitigation Through Model Diversity
- Claim: Aggregating predictions from multiple independently fine-tuned VLMs reduces the impact of individual model biases and improves diagnostic robustness
- Mechanism: Each VLM architecture has different pre-training data, visual encoders, and attention mechanisms. When fine-tuned on the same TBI dataset, they develop complementary diagnostic patterns. Disagreement across models signals uncertainty; agreement signals higher confidence
- Core assumption: Architectural differences between VLMs produce meaningfully uncorrelated errors rather than systematic shared failures on difficult cases
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "employing OpenAI-o3 to synthesize predictions from these models into a final diagnosis through a consensus-based decision-making process"; [section 1] "leveraging a single vision-language model for diagnosis has inherent limitations, including model biases and the potential for inconsistent predictions"

### Mechanism 3: Reasoning LLM as Meta-Synthesizer
- Claim: OpenAI-o3's reasoning capabilities enable it to evaluate and synthesize multiple VLM predictions into a more reliable final diagnosis than simple voting or averaging
- Mechanism: The LLM Agent collects structured predictions from all VLMs—including diagnostic labels, confidence indicators, and observation text—and constructs a custom prompt for OpenAI-o3. The reasoning LLM evaluates consistency, identifies outliers, considers clinical plausibility, and produces an explained final diagnosis
- Core assumption: OpenAI-o3's reasoning capabilities generalize sufficiently to medical image interpretation meta-analysis without domain-specific fine-tuning; the prompt format adequately conveys diagnostic nuance
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Evaluation shows that the fine-tuned vision-language models provide significantly more accurate predictions compared to baseline models, with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM effectively synthesizing these predictions to produce reliable final diagnoses"; [section 4.2] "Figure 13 illustrates the predictions made by different vision-language models for an MRI scan, along with the final diagnosis reasoning provided by OpenAI-o3"

## Foundational Learning

- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**
  - Why needed here: The system depends on understanding how VLMs fuse visual encoders (for MRI processing) with language decoders (for diagnostic text generation). Unlike pure classifiers, VLMs produce interpretable textual observations
  - Quick check question: Explain why a VLM might be preferable to ResNet50 for medical diagnosis support, and one limitation it introduces

- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (QLoRA/LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the memory-accuracy trade-off in QLoRA is essential for deploying on consumer hardware. LoRA adds trainable low-rank decomposition matrices rather than updating full weight matrices
  - Quick check question: What specific components of a VLM remain frozen during QLoRA fine-tuning, and what gets updated

- **LLM Agents and Prompt Engineering**
  - Why needed here: The LLM Agent Layer orchestrates all model interactions. Understanding how to structure prompts that convey multi-model predictions with appropriate context is critical for reliable synthesis
  - Quick check question: What key information must a prompt include for OpenAI-o3 to effectively synthesize conflicting VLM predictions

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Lake Layer -> VLM Layer (3 fine-tuned VLMs) -> LLM Agent Layer (LangChain/LlamaIndex) -> Reasoning LLM Layer (OpenAI-o3) -> Blockchain/Smart Contract Layer
- **Critical path:** MRI scan input -> LLM Agent constructs VLM prompts -> Each VLM analyzes and returns prediction -> Agent aggregates predictions into structured prompt -> OpenAI-o3 synthesizes final diagnosis with reasoning
- **Design tradeoffs:** Consortium (3 VLMs) vs. single model: +Robustness, +inference cost ×3; QLoRA (4-bit) vs. full fine-tuning: +Hardware accessibility, -potential accuracy ceiling; OpenAI-o3 (proprietary) vs. open-source reasoning: +Reasoning quality, -cost/dependency/vendor lock-in
- **Failure signatures:** Training/validation loss divergence during fine-tuning (overfitting or data quality issues); All VLMs return identical predictions on diverse inputs (insufficient model diversity); OpenAI-o3 final diagnosis contradicts all VLM predictions without explanation (prompt failure or reasoning breakdown); QLoRA models fail to detect subtle TBI features visible in baseline comparison
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate fine-tuned VLM consortium + OpenAI-o3 against ResNet50 classifier on held-out TBI MRI test set; measure accuracy, precision, recall per TBI category; 2. Ablation study: Compare three configurations—(a) single VLM, (b) VLM consortium with majority voting, (c) VLM consortium + OpenAI-o3 synthesis—to quantify contribution of each component; 3. Error analysis on OpenAI-o3 synthesis: Identify cases where OpenAI-o3 output disagrees with VLM majority; manually review whether synthesis improved or degraded accuracy to assess reasoning quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does the diagnostic accuracy of Proof-of-TBI compare to human expert radiologists in a blinded clinical validation study?
- **Open Question 2:** What is the minimum dataset size and diversity required to achieve stable fine-tuning performance for TBI diagnosis across different patient populations?
- **Open Question 3:** How robust is the OpenAI-o3 reasoning mechanism when VLM consortium predictions conflict, and can the consensus process be made explainable?
- **Open Question 4:** Which open-source reasoning LLMs could effectively replace the proprietary OpenAI-o3 while maintaining diagnostic accuracy?

## Limitations

- The system's performance is contingent on access to high-quality labeled TBI MRI datasets with consistent annotations that may not reflect real-world diagnostic complexity
- The consortium approach assumes architectural diversity produces uncorrelated errors, but this hasn't been empirically validated across medical domains
- The blockchain integration mentioned in the architecture lacks implementation details, raising questions about its actual contribution to system functionality

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Domain-adaptive transfer via QLoRA fine-tuning enables specialized diagnostic capability while maintaining deployability on consumer hardware
- **Medium confidence:** OpenAI-o3 effectively synthesizes VLM predictions into reliable final diagnoses through consensus-based decision-making
- **Medium confidence:** Fine-tuned VLM consortium provides significantly more accurate predictions compared to baseline models

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-institutional validation:** Test the Proof-of-TBI system on TBI MRI datasets from different hospitals/institutions with varying acquisition protocols to assess real-world generalizability and identify potential dataset-specific overfitting

2. **Expert clinician comparison:** Conduct a blind study where board-certified radiologists review the same MRI scans and compare their diagnostic accuracy and confidence against the Proof-of-TBI system's predictions, including detailed error analysis on disagreements

3. **Ablation study on reasoning quality:** Systematically evaluate OpenAI-o3's synthesis by creating controlled test cases where VLM predictions are intentionally manipulated (e.g., introducing conflicting predictions) and measuring whether the reasoning LLM correctly identifies and resolves these conflicts versus simply defaulting to majority voting
