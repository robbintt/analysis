# C-MTCSD: A Chinese Multi-Turn Conversational Stance Detection Dataset

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.09958
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09958
- **Reference count**: 16
- **Primary result**: Largest Chinese multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset (24,264 instances), achieving 64.07% F1 in zero-shot settings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces C-MTCSD, the largest Chinese multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset containing 24,264 instances from Sina Weibo. The dataset addresses the challenge of detecting stance in Chinese social media conversations and is 4.2 times larger than the only prior Chinese conversational stance detection dataset. The authors evaluate both traditional models and large language models on this dataset, finding that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 64.07% F1 score in zero-shot settings. Performance degrades significantly with increasing conversation depth, and traditional models particularly struggle with implicit stance detection, achieving below 50% F1 score.

## Method Summary
The authors created C-MTCSD by collecting conversational threads from Sina Weibo, focusing on five target topics: iPhone 15, Apollo Go, Non-marriage Doctrine, Naked Resignation, and Pre-made Meals. The dataset includes conversations with depths ranging from 1 to 6 turns and is split into 70/15/15 train/validation/test sets. They evaluate a comprehensive set of baselines including traditional models (TAN, CrossNet, BERT variants), prompt-based methods (KEPrompt, TSCOT), and large language models (LLaMA 3 70b, GPT-3.5, GPT-4). The primary evaluation metric is F_avg (mean F1 across "against" and "favor" classes), tested across three settings: in-target, cross-target, and zero-shot.

## Key Results
- C-MTCSD contains 24,264 annotated instances from Sina Weibo, 4.2x larger than prior Chinese datasets
- State-of-the-art models achieve only 64.07% F1 score in zero-shot settings
- Performance degrades by 20-30% as conversation depth increases from shallow (1-2 turns) to deep (5-6 turns)
- Traditional models struggle with implicit stance detection, achieving below 50% F1 score

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-turn conversational stance detection**: Understanding how stance evolves across conversation turns requires tracking context dependencies and viewpoint changes. Why needed: Stance in conversations is context-dependent and may shift across turns. Quick check: Verify dataset includes conversation depth information and context history.
- **Chinese pre-trained language models**: Models like bert-base-chinese, chinese-roberta-wwm-ext, and chinese-xlnet-base are optimized for Chinese linguistic patterns. Why needed: Chinese text has different tokenization and semantic structures than English. Quick check: Confirm model names include "chinese" prefix.
- **Zero-shot and cross-target transfer**: Evaluating models on unseen targets tests generalization beyond specific topics. Why needed: Real-world applications require stance detection across diverse topics. Quick check: Compare in-target vs. zero-shot performance gaps.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Conversation context -> Stance classifier -> Output (Against/Favor/None)
**Critical path**: Conversation history aggregation → Stance detection → Label assignment
**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Token limit vs. context preservation: Long conversations may exceed model limits
- Implicit vs. explicit stance handling: Implicit requires deeper contextual understanding
- Cross-target generalization vs. in-domain performance: Tradeoff between specificity and adaptability
**Failure signatures**:
- Performance drops with conversation depth indicate context window limitations
- Below 50% F1 on implicit stances suggests insufficient contextual reasoning
- Large gaps between in-target and zero-shot performance reveal overfitting to specific topics
**First experiments**:
1. Evaluate baseline Chinese BERT on shallow conversations (depth 1-2) to establish performance floor
2. Test conversation depth impact by stratifying evaluation into depth groups (1-2, 3-4, 5-6)
3. Compare explicit vs. implicit stance performance to quantify model limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can models maintain stance detection accuracy at deeper conversation depths (5-6 turns) where performance drops 20-30% compared to shallow conversations?
- What techniques can improve implicit stance detection performance, currently below 50% F1 with traditional models?
- How can cross-target stance transfer be improved between targets with limited contextual similarity, where best models achieve only 41.74% F1?
- Can approaches developed on Weibo data generalize to other Chinese social media platforms with different conversation structures?

## Limitations
- Dataset construction methodology lacks transparency in how conversational threads were selected and stance labels assigned
- Model evaluation lacks critical implementation details including hyperparameters and input formatting specifications
- Findings are based exclusively on Chinese Sina Weibo data, limiting cross-linguistic generalizability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Dataset contains 24,264 instances, 4.2x larger than prior datasets, achieves 64.07% F1 in zero-shot settings, with clear 70/15/15 split specification
- **Medium confidence**: Performance degrades with conversation depth and traditional models struggle with implicit stance (below 50% F1)
- **Low confidence**: Specific model comparisons (e.g., GLAN 66.10% vs XLNet 65.33%) cannot be independently verified without implementation details

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary learning rate, batch size, and max sequence length for GLAN to determine performance sensitivity and report ranges
2. **Cross-linguistic pilot**: Apply best Chinese model (GLAN or XLNet) to English conversational stance data (SemEval 2016) to assess generalizability of depth-related performance degradation
3. **Annotation consistency validation**: Calculate inter-annotator agreement or perform consistency checks on dataset subset to identify systematic labeling patterns affecting model training
