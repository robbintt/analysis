# Exploring the encoding of linguistic representations in the Fully-Connected Layer of generative CNNs for Speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.07726
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07726
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel interpretability techniques reveal that the FC layer in ciwGAN encodes lexically-invariant sublexical representations that can be manipulated to produce interpretable phonological outputs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces interpretability techniques for analyzing the fully-connected (FC) layer in generative CNNs for speech. The authors demonstrate that variable-specific weight matrices in the FC layer can be used to explore the latent space by comparing their average magnitudes, which reflect the relative importance of latent variables. They also show that these weight matrices can be passed directly into convolutional layers to produce interpretable waveform outputs, bypassing the need for latent space manipulation. In Experiment 2, the authors extract vowel-specific columns from weight matrices and show that lexically-invariant sublexical structures are encoded similarly across different lexical items, providing evidence of compositional learning.

## Method Summary
The study uses ciwGAN, an extension of WaveGAN with a Q-network for InfoGAN-style latent code estimation. The model is trained on 5,803 tokens from TIMIT corpus comprising 9 lexical items. The latent space consists of 91 uniform z-variables plus 9 one-hot latent codes. The FC layer projects 100 values to 16,384, reshaped to a 1024×16 feature map. Training runs for 500 epochs (45,000 steps). Interpretability techniques include analyzing average weight magnitudes per latent variable, passing weight matrices directly through convolutional layers, and extracting and correlating vowel-specific weight columns.

## Key Results
- Variable-specific weight matrices in the FC layer can be used to explore the latent space by comparing average magnitudes, which reflect variable importance
- Weight matrices passed directly through convolutional layers produce interpretable lexical outputs without latent space manipulation
- Lexically-invariant sublexical structures (e.g., vowels) are encoded similarly across different lexical items, demonstrating compositional learning
- Recombining extracted vowel columns yields predictable phonological outputs, supporting their compositional nature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Variable importance in the latent space correlates with average weight magnitude in the fully-connected layer
- Mechanism: In ciwGAN, the generator projects 100 latent variables through the FC layer to produce a 1024×16 feature map. Because all latent variables are scaled to the same range during training, variables with larger average absolute weights have greater influence on the FC output, and thus on the final waveform. The Q-network's classification pressure causes lexically-informative latent codes to develop higher weight magnitudes than random noise variables
- Core assumption: Uniform latent variable scaling during training permits direct comparison of weight magnitudes as proxies for variable influence
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "demonstrate how the distribution of learned weights varies between latent variables in systematic ways"; [section 3.2] "latent codes in ciwGAN exhibit greater average weights than the uniformly distributed z variables"
- Break condition: If latent variables are not normalized to comparable ranges during training, weight magnitude comparisons become uninformative

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The FC layer's feature map structure permits temporal localization of sublexical representations
- Mechanism: The FC layer outputs a 1024×16 feature map where the 16 columns correspond to temporal regions of the output waveform. Individual columns can be extracted and passed through the convolutional layers to generate isolated segments (e.g., single vowels). Weight magnitudes are concentrated in columns corresponding to where lexical material occurs in training data
- Core assumption: The temporal alignment between feature map columns and output regions is preserved through the convolutional upsampling
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "variable-specific weight matrices are temporally structured"; [section 4] "we leverage the temporal feature map structure of the variable-specific weight matrices, to pinpoint the column in the weight matrix that best corresponds to a particular vowel"
- Break condition: If convolutional layers use non-uniform upsampling or skip connections that bypass temporal alignment, column-to-segment mapping degrades

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Similar sublexical units (e.g., vowels with similar phonetic features) are encoded with correlated weight patterns across different lexical items
- Mechanism: When ciwGAN learns to generate multiple lexical items sharing phonetic features (e.g., high vowels /i/ in both "greasy" and "beer"), the FC-layer weight columns that generate these vowels exhibit positive correlations. The model does not encode each lexical item independently; instead, it develops lexically-invariant sublexical representations that are reused compositionally
- Core assumption: Correlation of weight columns reflects shared representational substrate rather than coincidental similarity
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "lexically-specific latent codes have shared lexically-invariant sublexical representations in the FC-layer weights"; [section 4.1] "the correlation matrix of FC codes shows that codes for high vowels tend to be more correlated with each other than with codes for low vowels"
- Break condition: If the latent space dimension is insufficient or training data lacks phonetic overlap across items, shared representations may not emerge

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Latent space models and the information bottleneck principle
  - Why needed here: The paper's central claim depends on understanding how a compact latent space forces the model to learn efficient, generalizable encodings rather than memorizing training data
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a smaller latent space encourages generalization over memorization?

- Concept: GAN training dynamics (generator-discriminator competition)
  - Why needed here: CiwGAN extends WaveGAN with a Q-network; understanding the adversarial training loop is necessary to interpret why the generator develops structured latent codes
  - Quick check question: What is the generator optimized to maximize, and how does the discriminator's objective differ?

- Concept: Mutual information maximization (InfoGAN/Q-network)
  - Why needed here: The Q-network's task—predicting the latent code from generated outputs—creates pressure for the generator to encode interpretable, disentangled information in specific latent variables
  - Quick check question: How does adding a Q-network change what the generator learns compared to a vanilla GAN?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Latent input (91 uniform z-variables + 9 one-hot codes) → FC layer (100→16384, reshaped to 1024×16) → 5 transposed convolutional layers → 1.024s audio output

- Critical path: Latent code selection → FC layer weight scaling → feature map column extraction → convolutional synthesis → waveform output. Manipulations at the FC layer (column selection, channel masking) bypass latent space entirely

- Design tradeoffs:
  - One-hot latent codes vs. continuous: One-hot forces discrete lexical mapping but reduces flexibility for sublexical variation
  - FC layer size (16,384): Larger feature maps permit finer temporal resolution but increase parameters and redundancy (paper notes substantial channel redundancy)
  - No activation after FC layer: Simplifies interpretability (weights directly interpretable) but may limit non-linear encoding capacity

- Failure signatures:
  - Latent codes not mapping to distinct lexical items: Q-network loss not converging; generator not sufficiently pressured to produce informative outputs
  - Weight columns not yielding isolated segments: Temporal alignment broken (e.g., data preprocessing mismatch) or FC-to-conv mapping corrupted
  - No correlation between similar vowels: Training data lacks sufficient phonetic overlap, or latent space too large (no pressure to share representations)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Experiment 1a: Train ciwGAN on TIMIT subset, extract FC weights, plot average absolute weights per latent variable. Verify latent codes have higher magnitudes than z-variables
  2. Replicate Experiment 1b: Pass each latent code's weight matrix through convolutional layers without latent space sampling. Confirm each yields a distinct lexical item
  3. Pilot Experiment 2a: Extract vowel-corresponding weight columns for two items sharing a vowel. Compute correlation; verify positive correlation for matching vowel qualities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Can the fully-connected layer manipulation techniques developed for ciwGAN be effectively applied to other latent space frameworks, such as auto-encoders?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "Future work should extend these techniques for model evaluation in other frameworks that rely on latent spaces, such as auto-encoders"
  - Why unresolved: The current study focused exclusively on the ciwGAN architecture, leaving the transferability of these specific interpretability methods untested
  - What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the weight matrix analysis and column-splicing methods on trained auto-encoder models to determine if they yield comparable interpretable sublexical units

- Question: Does reducing the number of parameters or the size of the latent space bottleneck in ciwGAN hinder or improve the model's ability to form abstract linguistic generalizations?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion notes that channel sampling revealed redundancy and suggests, "Similar work should explore whether shrinking the number of parameters of ciwGAN... is costly or beneficial to the model’s ability to form abstract-like linguistic generalizations"
  - Why unresolved: The current study utilized a fixed architecture, though results suggested that information might be distributed redundantly across channels
  - What evidence would resolve it: Training ciwGAN variants with progressively smaller fully-connected layers and evaluating the degradation or persistence of the compositional sublexical representations found in the original model

- Question: Do the observed lexically-invariant sublexical representations scale to larger vocabularies or continuous speech corpora?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The study draws broad conclusions about "lexically-invariant" structure based on a training set of only 9 specific lexical items
  - Why unresolved: It is unclear if the compositional reuse of vowel representations (e.g., /i/ in "greasy" vs. "beer") is a robust feature of the architecture or an artifact of the small, constrained training dataset
  - What evidence would resolve it: Training the model on the full TIMIT corpus or a large-scale vocabulary and testing if the correlation between phonetically similar vowels persists across a wider range of lexical contexts

## Limitations

- The interpretability claims hinge on the assumption that uniform latent variable scaling permits direct comparison of weight magnitudes, but exact normalization procedures are not specified
- The temporal alignment between FC layer feature map columns and output waveform regions is asserted but not empirically validated through ablation studies
- The claim that correlation between weight columns indicates shared sublexical representations assumes correlations cannot arise by chance, yet this is not tested

## Confidence

- High confidence: The empirical finding that weight matrices passed through convolutional layers generate interpretable lexical outputs
- Medium confidence: The correlation analysis showing similar vowels have positively correlated weight patterns
- Low confidence: The interpretation that weight magnitude differences directly reflect variable importance in the latent space

## Next Checks

1. **Temporal Alignment Validation**: Systematically shift the input to the convolutional layers relative to the FC output feature map and measure degradation in waveform quality. This would confirm the assumed temporal correspondence between FC columns and output segments

2. **Correlation Significance Testing**: Perform permutation tests where vowel columns are randomly reassigned across lexical items and recomputed correlations. This would establish whether observed correlations exceed chance levels given the small sample size

3. **Latent Variable Scaling Ablation**: Train models with different latent variable distributions (e.g., Gaussian vs. uniform, different ranges) and measure whether weight magnitude patterns remain consistent indicators of variable importance. This would validate the core assumption about weight magnitude interpretability
