# Efficient Conversational Search via Topical Locality in Dense Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.21507
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21507
- **Reference count:** 27
- **Primary result:** TopLoc achieves 8.7× speedups for IVF and 10.4× for HNSW while maintaining retrieval quality on TREC CAsT datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the efficiency bottleneck in conversational search systems by exploiting the topical locality inherent in conversational queries. The proposed method, TopLoc, leverages query embedding similarities to dynamically restrict the search space to semantically relevant document clusters, reducing computational complexity without compromising retrieval quality. TopLoc can be seamlessly integrated with two state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, IVF and HNSW.

The research demonstrates that conversational queries exhibit strong topical locality, making it possible to significantly reduce the search space while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. The method achieves substantial speedups of up to 8.7× for IVF and 10.4× for HNSW on TREC CAsT 2019 and 2020 datasets using Dragon and SnowFlake dense retrieval models, while preserving comparable retrieval quality to standard ANN indexes.

## Method Summary
TopLoc exploits topical locality in conversational queries by analyzing query embedding similarities to dynamically identify semantically relevant document clusters. The method works by first clustering documents using their embeddings, then for each conversational query, identifying which clusters are topically relevant based on the query's embedding similarity to cluster centroids. During retrieval, instead of searching the entire document collection, TopLoc restricts the search to only those clusters deemed topically relevant for the current query context. This approach can be integrated with both IVF and HNSW approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, requiring minimal modifications to existing dense retrieval pipelines while achieving substantial efficiency gains.

## Key Results
- Achieves speedups of up to 8.7× for IVF and 10.4× for HNSW algorithms
- Maintains retrieval quality comparable to standard ANN indexes on TREC CAsT 2019/2020 datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness with two leading dense retrieval models (Dragon and SnowFlake)
- Successfully exploits topical locality inherent in conversational queries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Conversational queries exhibit strong topical locality because users tend to ask related questions within the same context or topic. This creates natural clusters of semantically similar queries that can be mapped to corresponding document clusters. By leveraging this inherent structure, TopLoc can dynamically restrict the search space to only the most relevant document clusters for each query, dramatically reducing the number of distance computations required during retrieval while maintaining effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning

**Query embedding similarity** - Measures semantic relatedness between queries using their vector representations; needed to identify topically related queries in a conversation; quick check: compute cosine similarity between consecutive query embeddings.

**Document clustering** - Groups semantically similar documents using their embeddings; needed to create the topical partitions that enable search space reduction; quick check: verify cluster coherence using silhouette score or similar metric.

**ANN algorithms (IVF/HNSW)** - Approximate nearest neighbor search methods that trade some accuracy for significant speed gains; needed as the underlying search infrastructure that TopLoc optimizes; quick check: measure baseline recall@k for your dataset.

**Topical locality** - The property that related queries tend to focus on similar document subsets; needed to justify the search space restriction approach; quick check: analyze query-document interaction patterns in your conversational dataset.

**Cluster centroid similarity** - Measures distance between query embeddings and cluster centroids; needed to determine which clusters are topically relevant for each query; quick check: plot similarity distributions to identify natural thresholds.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Query embeddings -> Cluster relevance scoring -> Dynamic cluster selection -> ANN search (IVF/HNSW) -> Retrieved documents

**Critical path:** Conversational query processing -> Embedding generation -> Cluster relevance assessment -> Search space restriction -> ANN retrieval -> Ranking

**Design tradeoffs:** Speed vs. recall (controlled by number of clusters searched), computational overhead of cluster relevance scoring vs. savings from reduced search space, static vs. dynamic cluster selection strategies.

**Failure signatures:** Degradation in NDCG when queries deviate from expected topical patterns, inconsistent speedups across different query types, increased memory usage due to maintaining multiple cluster structures.

**First experiments to run:** 1) Baseline ANN performance comparison (IVF vs HNSW) on your dataset, 2) Cluster coherence analysis using your document embeddings, 3) Query embedding similarity analysis to verify topical locality patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

The method's effectiveness relies on the assumption of strong topical locality in conversational queries, which may not hold for all domains or query types. The evaluation is limited to TREC CAsT datasets and two specific dense retrieval models, potentially limiting generalizability. The paper does not address potential negative impacts on recall for queries requiring broader document coverage.

## Confidence

- Speedup claims (8.7× for IVF, 10.4× for HNSW): **Medium** - Impressive but based on controlled experimental conditions
- Generalizability across domains: **Medium** - Validated on TREC CAsT but not diverse real-world scenarios
- Robustness to multi-topic conversations: **Low** - Not explicitly evaluated in the paper

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate TopLoc's performance on conversational search datasets from different domains (e.g., e-commerce, medical queries) to assess cross-domain robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of different cluster granularity levels on both efficiency gains and retrieval quality
3. Measure actual memory and computational overhead of the dynamic cluster selection process across varying document collection sizes
