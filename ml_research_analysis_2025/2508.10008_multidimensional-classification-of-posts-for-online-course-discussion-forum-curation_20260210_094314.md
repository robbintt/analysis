core_contribution: The paper tackles the problem of online course forum curation,
  where frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly and impractical.
  To address this, it proposes a Bayesian fusion method that combines multidimensional
  classification scores from a pre-trained generic LLM with those from a classifier
  trained on local course data.

- Primary result: Bayesian fusion of LLM and local classifier scores achieves competitive performance with LLM fine-tuning while avoiding costly retraining

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of forum post curation in online courses where frequent LLM retraining is computationally expensive. The proposed solution uses Bayesian fusion to combine probability scores from a pre-trained generic LLM with those from a classifier trained on local course data. This approach maintains competitive classification performance (up to F1=0.78) without the resource burden of continuous fine-tuning. The method demonstrates robustness across different evaluation scenarios including within-course, within-domain, and cross-domain settings.

## Method Summary
The approach fuses multidimensional classification scores using Bayesian product rule under conditional independence assumption. A generic pre-trained LLM provides probability vectors for 6 classification dimensions, while a local classifier trained on course-specific data provides complementary probability scores. These are combined via P(ωj|x1,...,xL) ∝ ∏l Cj,l(xl) to produce fused predictions. The method avoids expensive LLM fine-tuning while leveraging both the specialization of local models and generalization of generic LLMs. Evaluation uses the Stanford MOOC dataset with 29,604 posts across 11 courses in 3 domains.

## Key Results
- Intra-course fusion achieves F1=0.78, matching the best individual classifier performance
- Cross-domain fusion maintains F1=0.67 with higher precision (0.73) than the local classifier alone
- Bayesian fusion consistently outperforms individual classifiers and matches LLM fine-tuning performance
- The approach reduces computational costs by avoiding frequent LLM retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Measurement-Level Bayesian Score Fusion
Combining probabilistic confidence scores from a generic LLM and locally trained classifier via Bayesian product rule yields performance competitive with full LLM fine-tuning. Under conditional independence, fused posterior is proportional to the product of individual classifier outputs, aggregating both sources' confidence. Core assumption: classifiers are conditionally statistically independent given the class label. Evidence shows fusion F1=0.78 intra-course and 0.67 cross-domain. Break condition: high correlation between classifiers reduces fusion gains.

### Mechanism 2: Specialization-Generalization Complementarity
Bayesian fusion improves robustness across domain shift by combining specialized local classifier (strong in familiar contexts) with generalized LLM (strong in unfamiliar contexts). Local MD classifier excels in known contexts (F1=0.78), while generic LLM maintains higher precision under distribution shift (P=0.84). Fusion inherits both: local expertise for known contexts, LLM generalization for novel contexts. Core assumption: different error patterns are sufficiently uncorrelated. Evidence: fusion achieves balanced performance across all scenarios. Break condition: extreme domain shift may cause both classifiers to fail simultaneously.

### Mechanism 3: Multidimensional Label Dependency Modeling
Treating forum post classification as multidimensional (6 class variables) rather than independent binary tasks captures inter-label correlations that improve decision boundaries in ambiguous regions. A post can simultaneously be a question, express confusion, and indicate urgency. These dimensions are correlated (e.g., questions more likely to express confusion). MDC exploits these dependencies. Core assumption: label dependencies exist and are learnable. Evidence: multidimensional approach differs from standard multi-label classification. Break condition: sparse training data per dimension makes dependency estimation unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Bayesian Classifier Fusion (Measurement Level)**
  - Why needed here: Core technique enabling score combination without black-box ensembling. Requires understanding how to extract calibrated probabilities and apply product/sum rules.
  - Quick check question: Given two classifiers outputting probabilities [0.7, 0.3] and [0.6, 0.4] for binary classification, what is the fused posterior under the product rule (unnormalized)?

- Concept: **Multidimensional Classification vs. Multi-Label Classification**
  - Why needed here: Task structure differs from standard multi-label. Each dimension has its own class space, requiring heterogeneous output handling.
  - Quick check question: In multi-label classification, labels come from a single shared space. In MDC, what makes dimensions "semantically distinct"?

- Concept: **LLM Fine-Tuning Cost-Benefit Analysis**
  - Why needed here: Motivation hinges on fine-tuning being "resource-intensive" for frequent retraining. Understanding when fine-tuning is justified vs. fusion alternatives is critical.
  - Quick check question: If a forum's topic distribution shifts monthly, and fine-tuning takes 24 hours on 8 GPUs, what is the annual computational budget? How does fusion's cost compare?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Forum Post Input -> Generic LLM -> Probability Vector (6 dims) -> Local MD Classifier -> Probability Vector (6 dims) -> Bayesian Fusion (product rule) -> Fused Prediction (6-dimensional) -> Curation Engine Decision (confidence > threshold?) -> Auto-respond (via LLM/KB) or Refer to Human (< 2% target)

- Critical path:
  1. Extract calibrated probability scores from generic LLM (may require prompt engineering)
  2. Train local MD classifier on labeled forum data (29K+ posts across 6 dimensions)
  3. Implement Bayesian fusion (product rule) for combining score vectors
  4. Set confidence threshold for human referral (target <2% escalation)
  5. Route to response generation (LLM prompt or knowledge base retrieval)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Product rule vs. sum rule: Product is more sensitive to disagreement, sum is more forgiving
  - Generic LLM choice: Larger models may have better calibration but higher latency/cost
  - Local classifier architecture: Tradeoff between accuracy and inference speed
  - Independence assumption: Violation reduces fusion gains; consider hierarchical models if correlation is high

- Failure signatures:
  - Cross-domain collapse: F1 drops from 0.78 to 0.67 when test domain differs from training
  - Miscalibration cascades: Uncalibrated LLM scores amplify errors through product rule
  - Threshold misconfiguration: Incorrect auto-responses or excessive human referrals
  - Sparse dimension labels: Imbalance (e.g., urgency: 6,418 urgent vs. 23,186 non-urgent) may bias toward majority class

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline replication: Implement product-rule fusion on Stanford MOOC subset. Confirm F1 ≈ 0.78 intra-course. Compare product vs. sum vs. max rules.
  2. Calibration audit: Extract raw probability scores. Compute Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Apply temperature scaling before fusion and measure F1 change.
  3. Correlation analysis: Measure classifier agreement on validation set (Cohen's kappa per dimension). If correlation > 0.7, test alternative fusion rules or weighted combinations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can local knowledge bases be optimized to significantly improve LLM classification performance in forum curation tasks? The study observed that domain-specific fine-tuning yielded unexpectedly small performance gains, but the analysis did not determine the root cause or identify characteristics of more effective knowledge bases.

- Does the Bayesian fusion approach maintain its efficiency and accuracy when applied to languages other than English, specifically Portuguese? Current validation is restricted to English-based Stanford MOOC dataset, leaving generalizability to morphologically distinct languages unproven.

- Can modeling the explicit correlation between the generic LLM and local classifier improve fusion results beyond the current conditional independence assumption? The current implementation relies on product rule derived from independence assumptions, potentially ignoring useful error correlations between the generic and local models.

## Limitations

- Conditional independence assumption: Fusion relies on questionable independence assumption between classifiers that may not hold in practice, potentially limiting effectiveness.
- Limited validation scope: Only tested on single MOOC dataset with three evaluation scenarios, lacking validation for extreme domain shifts or different forum types.
- Unverified calibration: No evidence that LLM confidence scores are properly calibrated before fusion, which can undermine reliability.

## Confidence

- High confidence: Theoretical framework for Bayesian fusion (product rule under independence) is mathematically sound and well-established in ensemble literature.
- Medium confidence: Experimental results showing fusion outperforming individual classifiers are internally consistent but rely on assumptions lacking external validation.
- Low confidence: Claims about robustness to cross-domain shifts (F1=0.67) are based on single dataset and may not generalize to more extreme distribution shifts.

## Next Checks

1. Correlation audit: Measure pairwise classifier agreement (Cohen's kappa per dimension) on validation data. If correlation > 0.7 on any dimension, test weighted fusion rules instead of product rule.

2. Calibration verification: Extract raw probability scores from both classifiers on held-out set. Compute Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and apply temperature scaling. Re-run fusion with calibrated scores and measure F1 improvement.

3. Extreme domain shift test: Apply fusion method to completely different domain forum dataset (e.g., technical support, social media). Compare performance degradation against MOOC results and identify which dimensions are most sensitive to domain shift.
