# MiTa: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework with Memory-integrated and Task Allocation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22974
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22974
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Achieves 54-68% reduction in task completion steps compared to baselines in VirtualHome-Social environment

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MiTa, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses inefficiencies in LLM-based multi-agent collaboration through centralized task allocation and episodic memory summarization. The framework organizes agents into a manager-member hierarchy where the manager coordinates tasks globally and maintains long-horizon context. By reducing inter-agent conflicts and preserving relevant historical information, MiTa improves coordination efficiency. Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines, particularly when member agents use weaker models.

## Method Summary
MiTa implements a two-tier architecture with a manager agent overseeing member agents. The manager uses specialized allocation and summary modules to distribute tasks based on member capabilities and maintain contextual awareness through episodic memory. The allocation module analyzes task requirements and member expertise to optimize task distribution, while the summary module condenses historical interactions into actionable memory units. This design enables effective long-term coordination while minimizing redundant communication between agents.

## Key Results
- Reduces task completion steps by 54-68% compared to baseline methods
- Maintains robust performance even when member agents use weaker models (GPT-3.5)
- Demonstrates effective coordination through hierarchical task allocation and memory integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by addressing two critical bottlenecks in multi-agent LLM systems: coordination inefficiency and context loss. The centralized manager eliminates redundant negotiations between members by making informed allocation decisions based on capability matching. Episodic memory summarization prevents context fragmentation that typically occurs in long-horizon tasks, allowing agents to build upon relevant historical information rather than starting from scratch. This combination enables sustained performance across extended task sequences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hierarchical task allocation**: Why needed - prevents communication overhead and conflicts between member agents; Quick check - verify manager can effectively distribute diverse task types without member feedback loops
- **Episodic memory summarization**: Why needed - maintains long-term context across extended task sequences; Quick check - test memory recall accuracy after varying time gaps
- **Centralized coordination**: Why needed - enables global optimization of task distribution; Quick check - measure performance degradation as member count increases
- **Capability-aware assignment**: Why needed - matches tasks to appropriate member expertise; Quick check - validate task completion rates across different member skill profiles
- **Context preservation**: Why needed - prevents repetitive information gathering in long tasks; Quick check - compare task initiation time with and without memory summaries

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Manager -> Allocation Module -> Member Agents
Manager -> Summary Module -> Memory Store
Member Agents -> Manager (Feedback)
Memory Store -> Summary Module -> Manager

Critical Path:
Task arrival → Manager analysis → Allocation decision → Member execution → Memory update → Summary generation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Centralized manager provides efficient coordination but creates single point of failure
- Memory summarization reduces context size but may lose granular details
- Hierarchical structure simplifies communication but limits peer-to-peer learning

Failure Signatures:
- Poor task allocation causing repeated failures
- Memory summaries becoming too generic to be useful
- Manager bottleneck under high task arrival rates
- Member agents unable to handle allocated tasks despite capability assessment

Three First Experiments:
1. Single-agent vs. MiTa comparison on identical task sequences
2. Memory ablation: run with memory disabled vs. enabled
3. Member capability stress test: gradually reduce member model strength

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single benchmark (VirtualHome-Social) without cross-domain validation
- Robustness claims only tested against GPT-3.5, not diverse model families
- Scalability concerns for manager module with larger agent populations untested
- Memory contribution effectiveness not isolated from task allocation benefits

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Improved coordination efficiency and task completion step reduction claims are well-supported by quantitative results
- **Medium Confidence**: Robustness across different member capabilities partially supported but limited to GPT-3.5 testing
- **Medium Confidence**: Episodic memory benefits plausible but not fully isolated from hierarchical allocation in ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct scalability experiments with agent populations exceeding current scope (10+ members) to test manager performance under increased coordination load
2. Perform ablation studies isolating episodic memory summarization from hierarchical task allocation to quantify independent contributions
3. Validate framework performance across multiple multi-agent environments beyond VirtualHome-Social with different task structures and communication patterns
