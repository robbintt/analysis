# Interpretable Machine Learning in Physics: A Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.23616
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23616
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Comprehensive review of interpretable machine learning applications across physics domains

## Executive Summary
This review paper systematically examines interpretable machine learning (ML) in physics, addressing the critical challenge of making AI-driven scientific discoveries comprehensible to human researchers. The paper provides a structured categorization of interpretability approaches and surveys their applications across diverse physics domains, from quantum systems to astrophysics. The review demonstrates how interpretable ML bridges the gap between AI capabilities and human understanding, enabling scientific discoveries while maintaining transparency and trust in results.

The authors organize the field into mechanistic vs. functional, local vs. global, verifying vs. discovering, low-level vs. high-level features, and intrinsic vs. post-hoc approaches. They then comprehensively cover ML algorithms applied to quantum systems, condensed matter, high energy physics, astrophysics, complex systems, and general physics applications. The paper showcases successful implementations of symbolic regression, autoencoders, and attention mechanisms in extracting meaningful physical insights from data.

## Method Summary
The review employs a systematic categorization framework to organize interpretable ML approaches in physics, distinguishing between different types of interpretability (mechanistic vs. functional, local vs. global, etc.) and application domains. The authors conduct an extensive literature survey across multiple physics subfields, identifying common themes and methodologies. The review methodology involves classifying existing works based on their interpretability approach and physics application, then synthesizing patterns and insights across these classifications to provide a comprehensive overview of the field.

## Key Results
- Interpretable ML successfully bridges AI capabilities and human understanding across diverse physics domains
- Symbolic regression extracts analytical equations from data, enabling discovery of physical laws
- Autoencoders identify physical parameters and reveal underlying structure in complex systems
- Attention mechanisms uncover interaction strengths and physical relationships in quantum and classical systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Interpretable ML works in physics by translating complex model behaviors into human-understandable representations that align with physical intuition and established scientific principles. The mechanisms succeed because they leverage the inherent structure and symmetries in physical systems, allowing ML models to discover patterns that map directly to interpretable physical concepts. This alignment between ML representations and physical understanding enables researchers to verify, trust, and build upon AI-generated insights.

## Foundational Learning

**Mechanistic vs. Functional Interpretability**
- Why needed: Different physics problems require different levels of model transparency
- Quick check: Determine if the research question requires understanding internal mechanisms or just input-output relationships

**Local vs. Global Interpretability**
- Why needed: Physics phenomena may need explanation at both specific data points and system-wide levels
- Quick check: Assess whether the interpretation should apply to individual cases or entire datasets

**Symbolic Regression**
- Why needed: Converts black-box model outputs into human-readable mathematical expressions
- Quick check: Verify that generated equations match known physical laws or propose new testable hypotheses

**Attention Mechanisms**
- Why needed: Reveals which input features most influence model predictions in physical systems
- Quick check: Confirm that attention weights correspond to physically meaningful interactions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input Data -> ML Model -> Interpretability Layer -> Human-Readable Output

**Critical Path**
Data preprocessing → Model training → Interpretability method application → Validation against physical principles

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Model complexity vs. interpretability: More complex models may capture physics better but be harder to interpret
- Accuracy vs. transparency: Highly interpretable methods may sacrifice some predictive performance
- Domain specificity vs. generality: Specialized interpretability methods work better for specific physics domains but lack broad applicability

**Failure Signatures**
- Misinterpretation of noise as physical signal
- Overfitting to spurious correlations in training data
- Generation of mathematically correct but physically meaningless expressions

**3 First Experiments**
1. Apply symbolic regression to a well-understood physics problem (e.g., harmonic oscillator) to verify method reliability
2. Test attention mechanisms on a system with known interaction strengths to validate interpretability
3. Compare different interpretability approaches on identical physics datasets to establish relative effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Rapidly evolving field may render some discussed methods outdated quickly
- Categorization framework may oversimplify nuanced relationships between interpretability approaches
- Potential incompleteness in coverage of specialized applications in emerging physics subfields

## Confidence

**Interpretability Classification Framework**: High - Well-established distinctions in the literature
**Physics Domain Coverage Completeness**: Medium - May not capture all specialized applications
**Generalizability of Framework**: Medium - Requires empirical validation across diverse datasets

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of the proposed interpretability framework across diverse physics datasets to test its generalizability
2. Comparison of different interpretability methods on identical physics problems to establish relative effectiveness
3. Longitudinal study tracking the evolution of interpretability techniques in physics over time to identify emerging trends and gaps
