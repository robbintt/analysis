# Use the Online Network If You Can: Towards Fast and Stable Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02590
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02590
- Reference count: 40
- MINTO achieves consistent performance improvements across diverse RL benchmarks through minimum estimate computation

## Executive Summary
MINTO (MINimum of Online and Target) addresses the fundamental tradeoff between stability and efficiency in deep reinforcement learning by computing target values using the minimum estimate between online and target networks. This approach mitigates overestimation bias while incorporating fresher online estimates, leading to improved performance across multiple domains. The method achieves significant gains on Atari benchmarks (+18% AUC with CNN, +24% with IMPALA+LayerNorm), distributional RL (IQN +7%), and offline RL (CQL +125% with CNN), while maintaining negligible computational overhead and requiring no additional hyperparameters.

## Method Summary
MINTO introduces a novel target computation mechanism that takes the minimum value between online and target network estimates during Q-value updates. This simple yet effective modification addresses the moving-target problem inherent in standard target network approaches while simultaneously reducing overestimation bias. The method maintains the stability benefits of delayed target network updates but incorporates fresher information from the online network through the minimum operation. Unlike prior approaches that require complex hyperparameter tuning or architectural modifications, MINTO integrates seamlessly into existing algorithms with minimal implementation effort.

## Key Results
- +18% AUC improvement on Atari with CNN architecture
- +24% AUC improvement with IMPALA+LayerNorm
- +125% performance gain in offline RL (CQL) with CNN architecture
- +7% improvement in distributional RL (IQN) settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core insight is that taking the minimum between online and target estimates provides a more conservative yet up-to-date value estimate. Standard target networks suffer from delayed updates, causing the target to lag behind the online network and creating instability. Conversely, using only online estimates introduces excessive variance and overestimation bias. By computing the minimum, MINTO effectively bounds the target value from above while incorporating fresher information, creating a sweet spot between stability and responsiveness. This mechanism is particularly effective because overestimation bias tends to be more problematic than underestimation bias in value-based RL.

## Foundational Learning
- **Target network stabilization**: Target networks prevent moving targets during Q-learning updates, crucial for stable training. Quick check: Compare learning curves with and without target networks.
- **Overestimation bias**: Q-learning tends to overestimate action values due to maximization over noisy estimates. Quick check: Measure value distribution skewness during training.
- **Temporal difference learning**: TD error drives parameter updates, requiring careful target computation. Quick check: Monitor TD error magnitude and variance.
- **Value function approximation**: Neural networks approximate Q-values, introducing approximation errors. Quick check: Compare tabular vs. neural network performance.
- **Actor-critic architecture**: Separate actor and critic networks learn policies and value functions. Quick check: Verify actor and critic learning rates.
- **Distributional RL**: Learning full value distributions rather than expectations. Quick check: Visualize value distribution evolution.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Environment -> Agent (Online Network + Target Network) -> Experience Replay -> Online Network update -> Target Network update (periodic) -> Minimum operation for target computation
- **Critical path**: Experience collection → Online network Q-value prediction → Target network Q-value prediction → Minimum operation → TD error computation → Parameter update
- **Design tradeoffs**: Stability vs. efficiency, computational overhead vs. performance gain, hyperparameter simplicity vs. tuning requirements
- **Failure signatures**: Increased variance in value estimates, divergence of learning curves, persistent overestimation of Q-values
- **First experiments**: 1) Compare MINTO vs. standard DQN on simple Atari games, 2) Test MINTO with different target network update frequencies, 3) Evaluate MINTO's sensitivity to learning rate variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focused on DQN-based architectures, limiting generalization to actor-critic methods
- Distributional RL experiments with IQN involve fewer comparisons than value-based results
- Claims of seamless integration may oversimplify practical implementation considerations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core minimum estimate mechanism, negligible computational overhead, basic stability improvements on Atari with CNN
- **Medium confidence**: Generalization across IMPALA+LayerNorm, distributional RL (IQN), and offline RL (CQL) settings
- **Medium confidence**: Sample efficiency claims in continuous control tasks

## Next Checks
1. Test MINTO's performance when integrated with actor-critic methods like PPO or SAC to verify cross-architecture generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of fresher online estimates versus the minimum operation
3. Evaluate MINTO's behavior under extreme hyperparameter settings (very high learning rates or target network update frequencies) to assess robustness
