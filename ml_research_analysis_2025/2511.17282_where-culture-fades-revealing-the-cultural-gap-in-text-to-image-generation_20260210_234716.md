- Key outcome: Multilingual text-to-image models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased outputs due to insufficient activation of culture-related representations, not missing knowledge. Lightweight strategies improve cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.

## Executive Summary
This paper reveals that multilingual text-to-image models exhibit cultural bias not due to missing cultural knowledge but insufficient activation of existing representations. Through a novel probing framework, the authors localize culture-sensitive signals to specific neurons in transformer layers by contrasting attention patterns and Top-K SAE activations. They demonstrate that amplifying these neurons at inference-time or fine-tuning the culture-sensitive layer substantially improves cultural consistency across 15 countries while maintaining image quality.

## Method Summary
The method operates in three stages: (1) culture layer detection via attention contrast (ΔCA) identifies specific transformer layers where cultural modifiers strongly influence target nouns; (2) sparse neuron identification uses Top-K SAE weighted frequency scores to pinpoint culture-specific neurons within these layers; (3) cultural activation either amplifies identified neurons at inference (zero-training) or fine-tunes a small residual adapter at the culture layer (fine-tuned). The approach requires no additional training data beyond CultureBench, a 15-country benchmark with 7,932 samples.

## Key Results
- CultureVQA accuracy improves by 12.32-14.98 absolute points compared to PEA-Diffusion baseline
- Zero-training achieves 33.91 CultureVQA with no additional training
- Fine-tuned layer enhancer achieves 36.63 CultureVQA with 2000 training steps
- Ablation studies confirm targeted interventions outperform random activation/fine-tuning
- Improvements maintain CLIPScore, ImageReward, and LPIPS metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Culture-Sensitive Layer Localization via Attention Contrast
Cultural semantics concentrate in specific transformer layers rather than distributing uniformly. The method computes ΔCA(l) — the difference in attention from cultural modifiers to target nouns between "culture-style modifier + noun" and "noun-only" prompts. Layers where this difference peaks indicate where cultural grounding occurs. For PEA-Diffusion, this peaks at layer 16; for AltDiffusion, layer 14.

### Mechanism 2: Sparse Neuron Identification via Top-K SAE Activation Contrast
A small subset of neurons within the culture-sensitive layer encodes culture-specific information, identifiable via weighted frequency scores (WFS). Sparse Autoencoders decompose attention features into interpretable neurons. WFS = f(m) × μ(m) combines activation frequency and magnitude. Top-K neurons with high WFS_cult but low WFS_noun are designated culture-sensitive.

### Mechanism 3: Cultural Activation via Neuron Amplification or Layer-Specific Fine-Tuning
Amplifying culture-sensitive neurons at inference-time, or fine-tuning only the culture-sensitive layer, improves cultural consistency without degrading fidelity. Zero-training multiplies identified neuron activations by (1 + λ). Fine-tuning adds a residual transformation h̃ = h + g(W₂σ(W₁h)) only at layer l_c, trained with MSE loss against culturally-grounded reference images.

## Foundational Learning

- **Cross-attention in diffusion models**: Why needed here: The layer detection mechanism relies on analyzing attention from text tokens (cultural modifiers) to other text tokens (nouns) within the text encoder. Quick check: Can you explain why attention from modifier tokens to noun tokens (rather than noun-to-modifier) indicates cultural grounding strength?
- **Sparse Autoencoders for feature decomposition**: Why needed here: The neuron detection method uses Top-K SAE to decompose dense attention features into sparse, interpretable dimensions. Quick check: Given SAE hidden dimension 4096 and sparsity coefficient α=1/32, what happens to reconstruction quality if α increases by 10×?
- **Residual adapters / parameter-efficient fine-tuning**: Why needed here: The Fine-Tuned Layer Enhancer adds a small trainable module (W₁, W₂) to one layer while freezing the backbone. Quick check: Why does the fine-tuning formula h̃ = h + g(·) use a residual addition rather than replacing h entirely?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text Encoder (CLIP-style) -> Top-K SAE -> Neuron Amplifier or Layer Enhancer -> Diffusion Generator
- **Critical path**: 1) Run paired prompts through text encoder 2) Extract attention maps A(l) for all layers; compute ΔCA(l) to find l_c 3) At l_c, feed attention features through SAE; compute WFS for all neurons 4) Select Top-K neurons with high WFS_cult and low WFS_noun 5) For inference: amplify these neurons by λ before SAE decode 6) For training: insert Layer Enhancer at l_c, train with MSE vs. ground-truth image
- **Design tradeoffs**: Zero-training vs Fine-tuned: Zero-training requires no compute-intensive training but needs manual λ tuning; Fine-Tuned is adaptive but requires GPU hours and reference images. K selection: Too few neurons miss cultural features; too many include noise. λ sensitivity: λ=6–7 optimal; λ=8 shows decline.
- **Failure signatures**: Random-mask-level degradation when amplifying neurons → neurons misidentified; re-run detection with larger neuron-detection split. Semantic drift → λ too high; reduce to 3–5. No cultural improvement → culture-sensitive layer wrong; verify ΔCA peaks with visualization. Stereotyped outputs → dataset contains biased annotations.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce layer detection on PEA-Diffusion: Plot ΔCA(l) for layers 1–24 and confirm peak at layer 16. 2) Ablate neuron detection: Mask Top-K vs random neurons on a held-out culture. Report CultureVQA gap to validate transfer. 3) Sweep λ from 0–10 on a 100-sample subset: Plot CultureVQA, CLIPScore, and LPIPS vs λ to find Pareto-optimal point.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does amplifying culture-specific neurons inevitably reinforce visual stereotypes by collapsing diverse intra-cultural variations into single prototypical representations? The current optimization targets cultural recognition accuracy (CultureVQA), which may favor distinct archetypes over nuanced diversity. Experiments on datasets with high intra-cultural variance would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Can the identified culture-sensitive neurons be proven to have a strict causal, mechanistic role in cultural generation, rather than merely correlating with cultural tokens? Current interventions show functional effects but don't fully isolate the neuron circuits from confounding activation pathways. Causal tracing or intervention experiments would verify necessity and sufficiency.

### Open Question 3
Does the "insufficient activation" hypothesis hold for low-resource languages or cultures that were severely underrepresented in the pre-training data? The current study covers 15 well-represented regions; it's unknown if the "knowledge exists but is dormant" principle applies where training data is likely absent rather than just unactivated. Probing experiments on cultures with minimal training corpus presence would determine if failure is activation-based or knowledge-absence based.

## Limitations
- CultureBench dataset creation process introduces potential annotation bias through web search, GPT annotation, and human filtering
- Layer detection method requires manual inspection of ΔCA curves, introducing potential subjectivity
- Top-K SAE neuron identification depends on visual elbow detection rather than automated thresholds
- Method's performance on truly out-of-distribution cultures or languages remains untested beyond mentions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Layer localization mechanism (ΔCA analysis showing distinct peaks at specific layers) and CultureVQA metric improvements (+12.32 to +14.98 absolute gains) are well-supported by ablation studies and quantitative results.
- **Medium confidence**: The SAE-based neuron identification method is theoretically sound and shows strong ablation effects, but lacks direct corpus validation and depends on subjective elbow detection.
- **Medium confidence**: Generalization across cultures and languages is demonstrated on the 15-country CultureBench, but performance on out-of-distribution cultures remains untested.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Apply the ΔCA layer detection method to a third multilingual T2I model (e.g., SDXL or Hunyuan) to verify that culture-sensitive layers consistently localize to specific positions across architectures.
2. **Neuron detection ablation**: Systematically vary K (Top-K selection) from 10 to 100 neurons and measure CultureVQA degradation when masking identified vs. random neurons to quantify the optimal trade-off between coverage and noise.
3. **Out-of-distribution stress test**: Evaluate both zero-training and fine-tuned interventions on cultures not represented in CultureBench (e.g., African or Southeast Asian cultures) using human evaluation to assess generalization beyond the benchmark's 15 countries.
