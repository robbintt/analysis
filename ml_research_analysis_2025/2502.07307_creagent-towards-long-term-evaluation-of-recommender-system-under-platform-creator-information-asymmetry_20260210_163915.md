# CreAgent: Towards Long-Term Evaluation of Recommender System under Platform-Creator Information Asymmetry

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.07307
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07307
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** CreAgent simulates creator behavior under information asymmetry using belief mechanisms and fast-and-slow thinking, achieving realistic long-term RS evaluation.

## Executive Summary
CreAgent introduces a novel simulation framework for long-term recommender system evaluation by modeling content creators as LLM-powered agents operating under platform-creator information asymmetry. Traditional RS evaluation methods ignore how creators adapt their behavior based on limited feedback, leading to unrealistic assessments. CreAgent addresses this by incorporating game-theoretic belief mechanisms and dual-process thinking to simulate strategic creator decisions. The framework is fine-tuned using PPO to enhance creator understanding of limited feedback and improve content generation quality.

## Method Summary
CreAgent uses an LLM (Llama3-8B) with specialized modules for profile, memory, belief, and creation. Creators maintain separate feedback and creation memories with forgetting, and update skill/audience beliefs based only on their own limited feedback. The slow thinker performs strategic analysis using beliefs and profile to decide explore/exploit actions, while the fast thinker generates concrete content using retrieved creation history. PPO fine-tuning updates the policy based on delayed rewards from user interactions. The simulation runs for 100 steps with 100 users and 50 creators, evaluating RS algorithms' long-term impact on user welfare, creator retention, and content diversity.

## Key Results
- CreAgent aligns well with real-world creator patterns in preferences, diversity, activity, and content generation
- Demonstrates bounded rationality and prospect theory-consistent behavior under information asymmetry
- Achieves higher cumulative rewards and better alignment with human behavior compared to baseline simulators
- Enables assessment of fairness- and diversity-aware RS algorithms, revealing their long-term benefits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Belief-Based Strategic Behavior Under Information Asymmetry
- **Claim**: CreAgent enables creators to make strategic decisions using only partial feedback, better approximating real-world conditions than full-information simulators.
- **Mechanism**: A game-theoretic belief module tracks two internal states per creator: (1) skill belief (confidence per genre based on creation history) and (2) audience belief (expected user preference per genre inferred from limited feedback). These beliefs are updated incrementally from the creator's own feedback memory, not platform-wide data.
- **Core assumption**: Creators form and update beliefs consistent with bounded rationality under partial feedback; LLMs can emulate this belief update process when prompted with structured belief states.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "By incorporating game theory's belief mechanism... CreAgent effectively simulates creator behavior under conditions of information asymmetry."
- **Break condition**: If creators had access to full platform-wide user feedback (violating asymmetry), belief-driven strategy would no longer reflect the constrained decision-making CreAgent is designed to model.

### Mechanism 2: Fast-and-Slow Thinking for Hierarchical Content Decision and Generation
- **Claim**: Separating strategic analysis (slow thinking) from content generation (fast thinking) improves both decision quality and output realism.
- **Mechanism**: At each creation step, the slow thinker (LLM with Chain-of-Thought prompting) evaluates utility, beliefs, and profile to decide explore vs. exploit actions. The fast thinker then generates concrete content (title, genre, tags, description) by retrieving relevant creation history from memory.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs can emulate dual-process cognition when explicitly prompted with separate reasoning and generation stages; retrieved experience improves content coherence.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "...incorporating... the fast-and-slow thinking framework to simulate realistic creator behavior."
- **Break condition**: If slow and fast thinking are merged into a single-step prompt without intermediate action decision, strategic coherence degrades and content may not align with intended explore/exploit strategy.

### Mechanism 3: PPO Fine-Tuning to Align Creator Behavior with Platform Feedback
- **Claim**: Fine-tuning with Proximal Policy Optimization improves the agent's ability to interpret limited feedback and generate higher-quality content.
- **Mechanism**: The platform environment provides delayed rewards based on weighted utility (exposure + clicks). PPO updates the LLM policy to maximize reward while staying close to the initial policy via KL-divergence penalty.
- **Core assumption**: Reward signals from simulated user feedback are sufficiently informative to shape creator strategy; delayed reward accumulation mirrors real-world feedback latency.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "fine-tuning it using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enhance understanding of limited information and improve analytical and creative capabilities."
- **Break condition**: If reward signals are noisy or delayed beyond the replay buffer horizon, credit assignment fails and policy updates become unstable.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Information Asymmetry in Two-Sided Platforms**
  - **Why needed here**: CreAgent's core premise is that creators see only their own feedback while the platform has global data; understanding this asymmetry is essential to interpreting belief updates and strategic behavior.
  - **Quick check question**: If a creator sees only their own item feedback, how might they misestimate overall user preferences?

- **Concept: LLM-Based Agent Simulation**
  - **Why needed here**: CreAgent relies on LLMs for both strategic reasoning (slow thinking) and content generation (fast thinking); familiarity with prompting, memory retrieval, and agent profiles is prerequisite.
  - **Quick check question**: What are two ways an LLM agent can retrieve relevant past experiences before generating new content?

- **Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - **Why needed here**: CreAgent uses PPO to fine-tune creator behavior based on platform feedback; understanding reward shaping, replay buffers, and KL penalties is needed to debug training instability.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does PPO include a KL-divergence penalty between the current and initial policy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Profile Module -> Memory Module (Feedback/Creation) -> Belief Module (Skill/Audience) -> Creation Module (Slow Thinker -> Fast Thinker) -> PPO Fine-Tuning Loop -> Platform Environment

- **Critical path**:
  1. Initialize profiles, memories, beliefs from real-world dataset (YouTube)
  2. Creators with activity probability enter slow thinker → compute explore/exploit action using beliefs + profile + utility
  3. Fast thinker retrieves relevant creation history → generates content (title, genre, tags, description)
  4. Content uploaded to platform item pool
  5. RS generates recommendations; user agents click/skip/exit
  6. Feedback logged; creator feedback memory updated; beliefs recomputed
  7. After delay N_r, reward computed; PPO updates policy if N_u steps elapsed

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Realism vs. scale: Small agent counts (100 users, 50 creators) improve fidelity but limit ecosystem-scale dynamics
  - Belief complexity vs. interpretability: Simple frequency-based beliefs are interpretable but may miss nuanced preference inference
  - PPO fine-tuning vs. frozen LLM: Fine-tuning improves alignment but adds training cost and potential overfitting to simulated feedback

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Collapsed diversity: All creators converge to same genre (belief or reward design issue)
  - Incoherent content: Fast thinker generates irrelevant tags/descriptions (retrieval failure or insufficient prompt constraints)
  - Unstable training: PPO loss spikes (reward scaling, KL penalty, or replay buffer misconfiguration)
  - Creator churn: High exit rates (unfair exposure or overly strict retention thresholds)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline alignment check: Run 100-step simulation with frozen LLM; compare genre distribution, diversity, and activity against real-world YouTube dataset
  2. Ablation on belief modules: Disable skill belief or audience belief independently; measure Jensen-Shannon divergence for preference and diversity alignment
  3. Fairness algorithm stress test: Deploy fairness-aware re-ranking on top of DIN base model; track creator retention rate and content genre diversity over 90 evaluation steps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be extended to model real-world creator behaviors that involve multi-modal content generation and non-strategic randomness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion: "Real creator behaviors may involve randomness (not entirely strategic) and multi-modality. We will consider these aspects in the future work."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies on text-based generation and strategic "fast-and-slow" thinking modules. Incorporating multi-modal outputs and stochastic behavioral noise requires architectural changes.
- What evidence would resolve it: An updated version of CreAgent that generates multi-modal content and demonstrates behavior patterns that statistically account for random variance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do inherent LLM biases and hallucinations distort the simulated ecosystem dynamics, and can they be decoupled from the agent's learned strategic behavior?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 6.2.1 notes that preference misalignments are "attributed to the influence of the LLM's pre-trained knowledge."
- Why unresolved: The simulation results conflate the agent's strategic learning with the base LLM's static pre-training biases.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring behavioral divergence when CreAgent is initialized with different foundation models or specific debiasing techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of foundation model (e.g., Llama-3 vs. Mistral vs. Qwen) impact the agent's adherence to behavioral economic principles like prospect theory?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix B.2 evaluates different LLMs but notes that "not all base models achieved rewards comparable to LLama3-8B."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that the framework works best with Llama-3, but the specific architectural features that enable effective strategic simulation are not isolated.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic ablation across various open-source LLMs correlating specific model capabilities with the fidelity of simulated prospect theory behaviors.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the simulation framework effectively generalize to non-media platforms, such as e-commerce, where information asymmetry and creator incentives differ significantly?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses exclusively on a YouTube dataset (media consumption).
- Why unresolved: E-commerce creators face different costs and feedback signals than content creators.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the CreAgent architecture to an e-commerce dataset, demonstrating alignment with seller behaviors.

## Limitations

- Small agent pool (100 users, 50 creators) limits scalability and may not capture ecosystem-scale dynamics
- Belief mechanism assumes simple frequency-based updates that may miss nuanced preference inference
- Reward design heavily influences observed behavior; alternative reward structures not experimentally validated
- LLM pre-training biases may conflate with strategic learning, making it difficult to isolate the contribution of belief mechanisms

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Alignment of CreAgent's output with real-world genre distributions, diversity metrics, and activity patterns (Section 6)
- **Medium Confidence**: Demonstration of bounded rationality and prospect theory-consistent behavior under information asymmetry (Section 6.4)
- **Low Confidence**: Claim that PPO fine-tuning substantially improves long-term evaluation fidelity lacks ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. **Belief Ablation Study**: Disable the audience belief module (but keep skill belief) and re-run the 90-step evaluation. Measure changes in Jensen-Shannon divergence for preference and diversity alignment.

2. **Reward Structure Sensitivity**: Replace the utility-based reward with a purely diversity-focused reward. Run PPO fine-tuning and compare the resulting genre distribution and diversity metrics.

3. **Agent Pool Scaling Test**: Increase the number of creators from 50 to 200 while keeping the same RS and user count. Measure the stability of diversity, creator retention, and fairness-aware algorithm performance.
