# PostHoc FREE Calibrating on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.01195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01195
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Temperature-Scaled Loss (TSL) significantly reduces calibration errors (ECE, AdaECE, Classwise ECE, Smooth ECE) in KANs while maintaining competitive accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the calibration challenges in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which tend to be overconfident in dense data regions and underconfident in sparse areas due to their spline-based architecture. The authors introduce Temperature-Scaled Loss (TSL), a novel method that integrates a learnable temperature parameter directly into the training objective, dynamically adjusting predictive distributions. Unlike post-hoc calibration, TSL updates both network parameters and temperature jointly during training. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that TSL significantly reduces calibration errors compared to standard loss functions, while maintaining competitive test accuracy.

## Method Summary
The Temperature-Scaled Loss (TSL) method introduces a learnable temperature parameter τ that rescales logits during training, improving calibration in KANs. TSL wraps any base loss (e.g., cross-entropy, Brier score) and applies it to temperature-rescaled logits. Both the network parameters θ and temperature τ are jointly optimized using Adam, with τ projected to remain positive. This approach differs from post-hoc temperature scaling by optimizing τ during training rather than on a held-out validation set after training completes.

## Key Results
- TSL significantly reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and its variants (AdaECE, Classwise ECE, Smooth ECE) compared to standard cross-entropy loss
- Maintains competitive test accuracy across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, etc.)
- Demonstrates loss-agnostic behavior, working with both cross-entropy and Brier score objectives
- Provides insights into how KAN hyperparameters affect calibration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TSL works by introducing a learnable temperature parameter τ that rescales logits before softmax, effectively controlling the sharpness of the predictive distribution. By optimizing τ jointly with network parameters during training, TSL can dynamically adjust the confidence calibration based on the training data distribution. This addresses KANs' tendency to be overconfident in dense regions and underconfident in sparse areas by allowing the model to learn an optimal temperature that balances these tendencies. The theoretical foundation rests on strict proper scoring rules, ensuring that TSL preserves the desirable properties of base loss functions while improving calibration.

## Foundational Learning
- Concept: Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
  - Why needed here: ECE is the primary metric for quantifying miscalibration, partitioning predictions into bins and measuring the gap between confidence and accuracy.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why ECE uses binning and name two variants that address its limitations?
- Concept: Temperature Scaling (Post-Hoc)
  - Why needed here: Standard temperature scaling optimizes τ on a held-out validation set after training; TSL contrasts by integrating τ into training.
  - Quick check question: How does post-hoc temperature scaling differ from TSL in terms of when and how τ is optimized?
- Concept: Strictly Proper Scoring Rules
  - Why needed here: The theoretical justification for TSL relies on preserving the strict properness of base losses (e.g., cross-entropy, Brier score).
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a loss function to be "strictly proper," and why does temperature scaling preserve this property?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input → KAN layers (B-splines) → Logits g → Temperature scaling (g/τ) → Softmax → Probabilities → Loss computation
- Critical path:
  1. Forward pass: Input → KAN layers (spline transformations) → Logits g → Rescale by τ → Softmax probabilities
  2. Loss computation: Apply base loss L_base to temperature-scaled probabilities
  3. Backward pass: Compute gradients ∂L_TSL/∂θ and ∂L_TSL/∂τ; update θ and τ with projection to ensure τ > 0
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Hyperparameter sensitivity: KAN calibration is sensitive to grid order, grid range, layer width, and shortcut functions. Coarse grids increase overconfidence risk.
  - Implementation complexity: Joint optimization of τ with network parameters requires careful gradient management and parameter projection to maintain τ > 0.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does TSL interact with other calibration techniques like label smoothing or mixup augmentation?
- What are the effects of TSL on out-of-distribution detection and robustness to adversarial examples?
- Can TSL be extended to other architectures beyond KANs, such as transformers or graph neural networks?

## Limitations
- Computational overhead: TSL adds minimal computational overhead compared to standard training, but requires careful tuning of the learning rate for the temperature parameter.
- Theoretical guarantees: While TSL preserves strict properness of base losses, theoretical bounds on calibration improvement remain to be established.
- Dataset dependence: The effectiveness of TSL may vary across different data distributions and architectures, requiring further empirical validation.

## Confidence
High confidence in the methodology and results, though some limitations exist regarding theoretical guarantees and generalization to other architectures.

## Next Checks
- Verify the implementation details of temperature projection during optimization
- Examine the sensitivity analysis of TSL to learning rate choices for τ
- Investigate the interaction between TSL and other regularization techniques
