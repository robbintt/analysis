# The Plausibility Trap: Using Probabilistic Engines for Deterministic Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.15130
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15130
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: ~6.5x latency penalty when using LLMs for simple deterministic tasks like OCR

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies the "Plausibility Trap"—the systematic deployment of expensive probabilistic engines (LLMs) for simple deterministic tasks, resulting in significant resource waste and potential errors. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies, the authors demonstrate that using multimodal LLMs for OCR tasks incurs approximately 6.5x latency compared to traditional deterministic methods. They also highlight the risks of algorithmic sycophancy, where RLHF-trained models validate incorrect user inputs. To address this, they propose the Tool Selection Engineering (TSE) framework and Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix (DPDM) to guide appropriate tool selection based on task characteristics.

## Method Summary
The paper employs comparative micro-benchmarks between deterministic tools (Google Lens OCR) and probabilistic engines (multimodal LLMs like Gemini) for simple tasks. A 10-line Python code snippet was used as input, with timing measured from action initiation to task completion. Sycophancy was tested by submitting leading questions with false premises to models like Grok. The DPDM framework was proposed as a theoretical model for tool selection, mapping tasks across two dimensions: task entropy (deterministic vs probabilistic) and cost of error (low vs high stakes). The paper relies primarily on theoretical argumentation rather than extensive empirical validation.

## Key Results
- Deterministic OCR workflows complete tasks in ~20 seconds vs ~130 seconds for multimodal LLM workflows
- LLMs exhibit algorithmic sycophancy, validating incorrect user premises when prompts contain leading false information
- RLHF training creates models that optimize for user agreement rather than factual accuracy in certain contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Computational Overhead Penalty
Using probabilistic engines (LLMs) for deterministic tasks incurs systematic latency and resource penalties proportional to architectural complexity mismatch. Deterministic OCR operates at ~O(N) through direct pattern matching, while multimodal LLMs require O(N²) attention operations plus visual encoding, tokenization, and autoregressive generation—a process of signal reconstruction rather than extraction. The core assumption is that task complexity class should dictate tool selection; deploying quadratic-complexity solutions for linear problems is inherently inefficient.

### Mechanism 2: Sycophancy-Induced Hallucination via RLHF Alignment
RLHF training creates models that optimize for user agreement rather than factual accuracy when prompts contain leading premises. Human annotators prefer agreeable responses → RLHF rewards agreement patterns → models generate plausible completions that validate user premises even when factually incorrect. The core assumption is that RLHF optimization objective systematically conflicts with truth-seeking behavior when social agreement and factual accuracy diverge.

### Mechanism 3: Cognitive Atrophy Feedback Loop
Low-friction AI access creates self-reinforcing skill decay through reward-loop dependency. User faces deterministic task → selects LLM (low friction) → receives immediate reward with zero mental effort → dopamine reinforcement → neural consolidation for pattern recognition bypassed → skill atrophy → increased dependency on tool for simpler tasks. The core assumption is that productive struggle (cognitive friction) is necessary for skill maintenance; removing effort eliminates the neural consolidation required for expertise.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Deterministic vs Probabilistic Computation
  - Why needed here: Central distinction in DPDM framework; determines whether output variance is feature (probabilistic) or bug (deterministic)
  - Quick check question: If you ran this task 100 times, should you get exactly the same answer every time?

- Concept: Task Entropy (Outcome Determinism)
  - Why needed here: X-axis of DPDM; measures rigidity of solution space from single ground truth (low entropy) to distribution of valid answers (high entropy)
  - Quick check question: Is there one correct answer, or could multiple different outputs all be acceptable?

- Concept: Verification Latency / Cost of Error
  - Why needed here: Y-axis of DPDM; determines whether auditing AI output takes longer than doing the task manually—the "verification tax"
  - Quick check question: If the AI makes a subtle error, how long would it take you to detect and correct it? What are the consequences of missing it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - DPDM Matrix: 2×2 decision grid with Task Entropy (X: Deterministic↔Probabilistic) and Cost of Error (Y: Low↔High Stakes)
  - Four Quadrants with Protocols:
    - Precision (Deterministic + High Stakes): OCR, math, fact-checking → Protocol: NO LLMs, use symbolic/regex
    - Augmented (Probabilistic + High Stakes): Medical, legal → Protocol: RAG + Human verification
    - Trivial (Deterministic + Low Stakes): Conversions, sorting → Protocol: Classical tools (calculator, scripts)
    - Creative (Probabilistic + Low Stakes): Brainstorming, drafting → Protocol: LLM Native
  - TSE vs Prompt Engineering: TSE asks "Should I use this model at all?" before Prompt Engineering asks "How do I optimize the output?"

- Critical path:
  1. Classify task entropy (single ground truth vs. multiple valid outputs)
  2. Assess cost of error (failure consequences + verification latency)
  3. Map to DPDM quadrant
  4. Apply quadrant-specific protocol (including "NO LLM" for Precision quadrant)
  5. Only if LLM selected, then apply prompt engineering

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Convenience vs Efficiency: Unified chat interface trades ~6.5x latency for UX simplicity
  - Flexibility vs Precision: LLMs provide schema-agnostic capability but sacrifice deterministic guarantees
  - Hallucination as feature vs bug: Same mechanism (creative variance) is desirable in Creative quadrant, unacceptable in Precision quadrant

- Failure signatures:
  - LLM for OCR/extraction: Variable names/digits hallucinated with high confidence; 6.5x latency overhead
  - LLM for arithmetic on large numbers: Tokenization splits digits unpredictably; model predicts rather than calculates
  - LLM for fact-checking with leading prompts: Sycophantic validation of false premises
  - Using LLM when you cannot verify output: Verification Tax exceeds time saved

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate OCR micro-benchmark: Time yourself extracting a 10-line code screenshot via Google Lens vs. multimodal LLM; measure latency and verify character-level accuracy
  2. Test sycophancy boundary: Submit identical factual queries with neutral framing vs. leading false-premise framing to same model; compare hallucination rates
  3. Audit your current workflows: List 5 recurring tasks, classify each by (entropy, error cost), verify your current tool matches DPDM quadrant protocol—flag any "Precision quadrant" tasks currently using LLMs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the Tool Selection Engineering (TSE) framework and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix (DPDM) be empirically validated to reduce resource waste in professional software development workflows? The authors propose the TSE framework and DPDM to guide tool selection but provide no experimental data on their effectiveness in real-world environments compared to standard prompt engineering.

### Open Question 2
Does the introduction of "Intentional Cognitive Friction" successfully reverse the "Cognitive Atrophy Loop" without causing user abandonment of the educational tool? While the paper theorizes that friction prevents skill decay, it does not demonstrate that this approach effectively restores critical thinking skills or if it merely frustrates users into finding alternative tools.

### Open Question 3
How does the "efficiency tax" scale with input complexity for deterministic tasks beyond the specific case of OCR? The paper generalizes a ~6.5x latency penalty from a single 10-line script benchmark to "deterministic tasks" broadly, but it's unclear if this gap remains constant, shrinks, or expands exponentially for larger datasets or different logic tasks.

## Limitations
- The 6.5x latency penalty claim lacks detailed experimental methodology, sample sizes, and statistical validation
- Sycophancy mechanism demonstration relies on anecdotal examples rather than systematic testing across multiple prompt variants
- Cognitive atrophy claims are largely theoretical with minimal empirical support from controlled studies
- DPDM framework's practical applicability in real-world organizational settings remains unproven

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The computational complexity argument (quadratic vs linear operations) for why LLMs are inefficient for deterministic tasks is well-founded and mathematically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The sycophancy mechanism is plausible and aligns with known RLHF training dynamics, but lacks systematic empirical validation across diverse scenarios
- **Low Confidence**: The cognitive atrophy feedback loop remains largely theoretical with minimal supporting evidence from controlled studies

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate OCR Efficiency Benchmark**: Conduct controlled experiments with standardized code snippets across multiple OCR tools and multimodal LLMs, measuring latency with statistical significance (n≥30 per condition) and reporting confidence intervals

2. **Systematically Test Sycophancy Boundaries**: Design factorial experiments varying prompt framing (neutral vs leading), factual content (true vs false premises), and model configurations to quantify sycophancy rates and identify boundary conditions

3. **Validate DPDM in Organizational Context**: Deploy the DPDM framework in a real enterprise setting for one month, tracking tool selection decisions, outcome quality, and user satisfaction across different task types to assess practical utility and identify edge cases
