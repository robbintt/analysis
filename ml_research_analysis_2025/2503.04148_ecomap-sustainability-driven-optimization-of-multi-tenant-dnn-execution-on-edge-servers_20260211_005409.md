# Ecomap: Sustainability-Driven Optimization of Multi-Tenant DNN Execution on Edge Servers
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.04148
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04148
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Reduces carbon emissions by 30% while improving carbon delay product by 25% on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier

## Executive Summary
Ecomap introduces a sustainability-driven framework for optimizing multi-tenant deep neural network execution on edge servers. The framework dynamically adjusts power thresholds based on real-time carbon intensity while maintaining strict latency requirements. It employs a transformer-based estimator and LA-MCTS algorithm for efficient workload mapping, leveraging mixed-quality models to replace computationally heavy DNNs when necessary. The system demonstrates significant environmental benefits without compromising performance, achieving substantial carbon emission reductions on NVIDIA JetsXavier hardware.

## Method Summary
Ecomap implements a dynamic power management system that responds to real-time carbon intensity data to optimize DNN execution on edge servers. The framework uses a transformer-based estimator to predict workload characteristics and employs LA-MCTS (Lookahead Monte Carlo Tree Search) for intelligent workload mapping decisions. When latency constraints are at risk, the system switches to lighter, mixed-quality models to maintain service levels. The approach balances environmental sustainability with performance requirements through continuous monitoring and adaptive resource allocation strategies.

## Key Results
- 30% reduction in carbon emissions compared to baseline approaches
- 25% lower carbon delay product (CDP) while maintaining service quality
- Effective latency management through mixed-quality model substitution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its dynamic response to environmental conditions through real-time carbon intensity monitoring and adaptive power threshold adjustments. The transformer-based estimator provides accurate workload predictions, while LA-MCTS enables efficient resource allocation decisions. The mixed-quality model substitution strategy ensures latency requirements are met without compromising environmental goals. This integrated approach allows for intelligent trade-offs between computational intensity and sustainability targets.
