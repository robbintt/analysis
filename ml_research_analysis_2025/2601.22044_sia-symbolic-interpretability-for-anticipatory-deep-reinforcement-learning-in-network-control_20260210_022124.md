# SIA: Symbolic Interpretability for Anticipatory Deep Reinforcement Learning in Network Control

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.22044
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22044
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** SIA achieves sub-millisecond explanation generation (0.65 ms mean latency) for anticipatory DRL agents in network control, revealing hidden design flaws and enabling targeted fixes without retraining.

## Executive Summary
SIA is a novel interpretability framework that enables real-time understanding of how forecast-augmented deep reinforcement learning agents operate in network control. The key innovation is combining symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI knowledge graphs to disentangle the influence of current observations from future predictions, addressing the critical transparency gap in anticipatory network agents. SIA achieves sub-millisecond explanation generation speed (0.65 ms mean latency) - over 200× faster than existing methods like SHAP and LIME. In evaluations across three networking use cases (adaptive bitrate streaming, massive MIMO scheduling, and RAN slicing), SIA revealed hidden design flaws including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward function biases that triggered counter-productive policies. These insights enabled targeted fixes: a redesigned ABR agent achieved 9% higher average bitrate, while SIA's online Action Refinement module improved RAN slicing reward by 25% without retraining.

## Method Summary
SIA combines symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI knowledge graphs to provide real-time interpretability for anticipatory DRL agents. The framework converts raw numerical KPIs into symbolic tuples (predicate, category, trend) through a Symbolizer module, then maintains independent knowledge graphs for each KPI to track state-action-reward relationships. The Influence Score metric uses KL divergence to quantify how specific KPI states shift action distributions away from baseline behavior. An optional Action Refinement module can override agent decisions by querying the KG for historically optimal actions given forecasted state transitions. The system achieves sub-millisecond latency through per-KPI factorization that reduces complexity from exponential to linear scaling.

## Key Results
- SIA generates explanations in 0.65 ms mean latency, over 200× faster than SHAP and LIME
- Revealed temporal misalignment in ABR agent design, enabling a 9% bitrate improvement after redesign
- Action Refinement module improved RAN slicing reward by 25.7% without retraining
- Identified reward function biases in MIMO scheduling that caused JFI saturation exploitation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Converting raw numerical KPIs into symbolic tuples (predicate, category, trend) allows the system to disentangle the influence of current observations from future predictions. The Symbolizer module maps continuous time-series data into discrete First-Order Logic (FOL) constructs—e.g., `inc(tput, High, Dropping)`. This abstraction creates distinct symbolic states for "current category" versus "future trend," enabling the Influence Score (IS) metric to identify which temporal component drove a specific decision. Core assumption: The network dynamics can be losslessly compressed into a limited set of discrete categories and trends without losing the critical signals required for the control task.

### Mechanism 2
Factorizing the state space into independent per-KPI Knowledge Graphs (KGs) reduces complexity from exponential to linear, enabling sub-millisecond real-time interpretation. Instead of building a single monolithic state graph, SIA maintains a separate directed attributed graph for each KPI. This limits the node count per graph (max 45 nodes) and allows the system to compute the Influence Score via efficient marginal probability lookups rather than joint probability calculations. Core assumption: The influence of KPIs on the agent's action can be sufficiently analyzed individually (or via simple aggregation), and complex, non-additive interactions between multiple KPIs do not dominate the policy logic.

### Mechanism 3
An Action Refinement module can correct reactive agent behaviors by querying the Knowledge Graph for the historically optimal action given a forecasted state transition. The refiner identifies the symbolic transition from the current state $s_{current}$ to the forecasted state $s_{future}$. It queries the KG to find the action $a_{best}$ with the highest historical reward for this specific transition. If the expected reward gain exceeds a threshold $\tau$, it overrides the agent's original choice. Core assumption: The environment is sufficiently stationary so that historical reward estimates for symbolic transitions remain valid predictors of future outcomes.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Temporal Myopia in DRL
**Why needed here:** SIA is designed specifically to fix or interpret the "blindness" reactive agents have toward exogenous KPIs (like bandwidth drops). You must understand that standard DRL agents only learn $V(s_t)$ based on current/past data, lacking inherent foresight.
**Quick check question:** Why can a standard DRL agent manage a buffer (controllable) but fail to anticipate a bandwidth drop (exogenous)?

### Concept: First-Order Logic (FOL) Symbolization
**Why needed here:** The core "Symbolizer" module relies on mapping network states to predicates (inc/dec/const) and categories.
**Quick check question:** How does the system represent a throughput of 15.7 Mbps that is rising but predicted to fall? (Answer: `inc(tput, High, Dropping)`).

### Concept: KL Divergence for Influence Scoring
**Why needed here:** The Influence Score (IS) quantifies how much a specific KPI shifts the action distribution away from the baseline (average) behavior.
**Quick check question:** If a specific KPI state results in an action distribution identical to the baseline average, what would the Influence Score be? (Answer: Zero/Minimal).

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Raw KPIs -> Symbolizer -> KG Update -> IS Calculation

### Critical path:
The data flow moves from Raw KPIs to Symbolizer to KG Update to IS Calculation. The efficiency of the Symbolizer's percentile mapping determines the quality of the KG, which in turn determines the fidelity of the explanation.

### Design tradeoffs:
- **Buckets vs. Granularity:** Fewer buckets (e.g., 3) generalize better but lose resolution; more buckets (e.g., 7) increase the "cold start" time of the KG.
- **Threshold $\theta$:** A low change-detection threshold increases noise (treating minor fluctuations as signals); a high threshold misses gradual shifts.

### Failure signatures:
- **Cold Start:** Initial explanations are unreliable because KGs are sparse (counts are low).
- **Symbolic Brittleness:** Forecast errors cause the Refiner to select actions for the wrong symbolic state (e.g., preparing for a "Dropping" trend that never happens).
- **Reward Hacking:** As seen in the MIMO use case, the agent may exploit the reward function (JFI saturation) in a way that looks like a bug but is technically optimal for the flawed reward.

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Latency Stress Test:** Measure the Symbolizer + KG update time under high KPI dimensionality to verify the <1ms constraint holds for your specific deployment.
2. **Symbolic Stability Analysis:** Inject noise into the input KPIs to see if the symbolic output flips frequently between categories (threshold tuning).
3. **Refinement Robustness:** Deliberately degrade the forecaster's accuracy to identify the error margin at which the Action Refiner starts reducing (rather than increasing) reward.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the symbolic categorization parameters (bucket count, sensitivity threshold) be automatically optimized online to adapt to changing network dynamics? The authors manually tuned these parameters for the evaluation but did not develop a mechanism for the system to adjust them autonomously in response to data volatility.

### Open Question 2
How robust is the Action Refinement module's performance when forecast errors are large enough to consistently shift KPIs across category boundaries? The paper demonstrates robustness to "moderate" inaccuracies but explicitly identifies category boundary crossing as a failure mode without quantifying the performance degradation in that regime.

### Open Question 3
What are the most effective strategies for pre-populating Knowledge Graphs to eliminate the cold-start phase in production deployments? The paper mentions the mitigation strategy but does not implement or evaluate specific methods for transferring offline historical data into the initial KG structure.

## Limitations
- The symbolic abstraction approach may lose subtle but important information through discretization, particularly in highly dynamic environments.
- The per-KPI factorization assumes independence between KPIs, which may not hold for complex interactions in real network scenarios.
- The Action Refinement module's effectiveness depends heavily on the accuracy of the forecaster, with performance degrading when forecast errors cause symbolic misalignment.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The core mechanism of using symbolic abstractions to enable real-time interpretability, the sub-millisecond latency achievement (0.65ms), and the general framework architecture are well-supported by the evidence provided.
- **Medium confidence:** The specific numerical improvements (9% bitrate gain, 25% reward boost) are demonstrated but may be sensitive to implementation details, dataset variations, and the specific agent architectures used.
- **Medium confidence:** The identification of specific design flaws (temporal misalignment, reward function biases) is compelling but relies on the particular agents and reward structures tested, which may not generalize to all DRL agents.

## Next Checks
1. **Symbolic stability under noise:** Systematically inject varying levels of noise into the input KPIs and measure how frequently the symbolic predicates (inc/dec/const) flip-flop to validate threshold appropriateness.
2. **Discretization granularity sensitivity:** Repeat experiments with different numbers of percentile buckets (e.g., 3, 7, 10) to quantify the tradeoff between explanation resolution and computational efficiency.
3. **Multi-KPI interaction testing:** Design a controlled experiment where agent decisions depend on specific combinations of KPI states to measure whether SIA's per-KPI approach can detect and explain conditional dependencies.
