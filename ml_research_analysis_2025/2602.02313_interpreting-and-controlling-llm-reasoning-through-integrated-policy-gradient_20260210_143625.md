# Interpreting and Controlling LLM Reasoning through Integrated Policy Gradient

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.02313
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02313
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Training-free IPG framework achieves 1.4-2.0% accuracy gains on reasoning benchmarks by attributing outcomes to internal components

## Executive Summary
Large language models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This paper introduces Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a training-free framework that attributes reasoning behavior to internal components by back-propagating outcome-based signals through inference trajectories. By integrating policy gradients with path integration, IPG captures long-horizon effects and identifies components driving reasoning performance. Experiments show IPG achieves superior control over reasoning capabilities across diverse models including Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Llama3.1-8B, with consistent component identification across datasets and effective transfer to distilled reasoning models.

## Method Summary
IPG combines policy gradient methods with path integration to attribute reasoning outcomes to internal model components without requiring training. The framework back-propagates reward signals (e.g., answer correctness) through the model's inference trajectory to identify which neurons or features contribute most to successful reasoning. Unlike traditional interpretability methods that struggle with sequential dependencies, IPG integrates long-range effects through its path integration component. The method works by computing attributions for each step in the reasoning process and then aggregating these attributions across the entire trajectory, allowing identification of components that influence final outcomes even when their effects manifest over multiple steps.

## Key Results
- IPG achieves 1.4-2.0% accuracy improvements on GSM8K and MATH500 reasoning benchmarks
- Components identified by IPG transfer effectively to distilled reasoning models, validating their fundamental role
- IPG demonstrates consistent identification of reasoning components across different datasets and model architectures
- The framework provides fine-grained insights at both component and process levels, revealing aspects of reasoning mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
IPG works by leveraging policy gradient methods to attribute outcome-based rewards back through the model's inference process. Traditional gradient-based attribution methods fail to capture long-range sequential dependencies in reasoning tasks, where early decisions can have cascading effects on final outcomes. By integrating policy gradients with path integration, IPG accumulates attribution scores across the entire reasoning trajectory, properly weighting components that may have delayed or amplified effects. This approach allows the framework to identify neurons and features that are critical for reasoning success even when their direct contribution to immediate outputs is small, but their influence on downstream reasoning steps is substantial.

## Foundational Learning
- **Policy gradients**: Optimization technique that directly optimizes expected reward by computing gradients of the reward with respect to policy parameters. Needed to connect final outcomes back to internal components; quick check: verify gradients flow from reward to intermediate representations.
- **Path integration**: Mathematical technique for accumulating effects over sequential steps. Needed to capture long-range dependencies in reasoning; quick check: confirm cumulative attributions match observed outcome sensitivity.
- **Attribution methods**: Techniques for assigning responsibility for model outputs to internal components. Needed as foundation for interpretability; quick check: compare IPG attributions to baseline methods.
- **Reward signal design**: Framework for quantifying reasoning success. Needed to provide supervision for attribution; quick check: validate reward correlates with actual reasoning quality.
- **Cross-dataset transfer**: Method for validating component importance across different tasks. Needed to establish fundamental reasoning mechanisms; quick check: measure control effectiveness when transferring components.
- **Model distillation**: Process of transferring knowledge to smaller models. Needed to validate component transferability; quick check: compare reasoning performance before/after component transfer.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input -> Encoder Layers -> Attention Mechanisms -> MLP Layers -> Output Head -> Reward Computation -> Attribution Backpropagation -> Component Identification

**Critical Path:** Reward signal → Backpropagation through reasoning trajectory → Attribution accumulation → Component ranking → Behavioral control application

**Design Tradeoffs:** Training-free vs. end-to-end optimization capability; coarse reward signals vs. fine-grained supervision; uniform scaling factors vs. component-specific optimization

**Failure Signatures:** Inconsistent attributions across inference runs; components that affect performance but receive low attribution scores; transfer failures indicating dataset-specific rather than fundamental components

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Apply IPG to a simple arithmetic reasoning task and verify attributions align with known solution paths
2. Test component transfer from a large model to its distilled version and measure reasoning performance changes
3. Compare IPG attributions against integrated gradients on the same reasoning examples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can IPG effectively identify and control reasoning-related components in domains that lack step-wise, differentiable supervision, such as emotional intelligence or creativity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Conclusion states: "Future work includes extending our IPG framework to interpret domains where behaviors lack step-wise, differentiable supervision, such as the emotional intelligence and creativity in LLMs."
- Why unresolved: IPG was evaluated only on reasoning benchmarks with outcome-based rewards. Emotional and creative outputs are harder to quantify with discrete reward signals.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating IPG's effectiveness on established emotional intelligence or creative writing benchmarks with appropriate reward model adaptations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would component-specific scaling factors (individual γ per neuron/feature) yield more precise behavioral control than the current uniform scaling approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section D.5.3 states: "A promising future work is to adopt component-specific scaling, allowing each neuron or feature to be steered by an individually optimized factor."
- Why unresolved: Current implementation applies identical γ across all selected components, ignoring potential differences in their functional roles and intervention sensitivity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing learned, per-component scaling factors improve accuracy gains or suppression effectiveness over uniform scaling.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would integrating process reward models (PRMs) or step-level verifiers improve IPG's attribution precision compared to rule-based or outcome-only reward signals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section D.5.3 notes: "More sophisticated approaches, such as process reward models (PRMs) or step-level verifiers, could provide finer-grained supervision that better aligns with reasoning quality."
- Why unresolved: Current reward signals (rule-based correctness, reward model scores) are coarse and may fail to capture subtle reasoning improvements or intermediate step quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments replacing current J(·) with PRM-based rewards, measuring changes in identification consistency and control effectiveness.

### Open Question 4
- Question: To what extent do IPG-identified reasoning components transfer across fundamentally different model architectures beyond the tested Qwen/Llama families?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates cross-dataset and distillation-based transfer within Qwen family, but architectural diversity is limited. Table 3 shows Qwen→Qwen distillation transfer; cross-architecture transfer remains untested.
- Why unresolved: Different architectures may encode reasoning in distinct representational spaces, potentially limiting transferability of discovered components.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying components identified in one architecture (e.g., Llama) to steer reasoning in another (e.g., Mistral/Gemma), reporting control effectiveness metrics.

## Limitations
- Claims rest heavily on controlled experimental settings using specific mathematical reasoning benchmarks
- Training-free nature may miss opportunities for end-to-end optimization available to supervised approaches
- Focus on mathematical reasoning may not fully capture breadth of reasoning capabilities in language models
- External validity of findings limited by narrow scope of evaluated benchmarks

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core technical contribution of IPG as training-free interpretability framework is well-supported
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about component transferability across datasets and models require further validation across diverse architectures
- **Medium Confidence**: Reported accuracy improvements should be interpreted cautiously given limited benchmark diversity

## Next Checks
1. Apply IPG to non-mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., commonsense reasoning, logical inference) to assess generalization beyond mathematical problem-solving
2. Compare IPG's performance against other gradient-based attribution methods (e.g., integrated gradients, saliency maps) on the same reasoning tasks
3. Track consistency of IPG-identified components and attribution scores across multiple inference runs and different model checkpoints
