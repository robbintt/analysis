# A deep learning and machine learning approach to predict neonatal death in the context of São Paulo

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.16929
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16929
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LSTM model achieved 99% accuracy in predicting neonatal mortality from 1.4 million São Paulo births

## Executive Summary
This study applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict neonatal mortality using a dataset of 1.4 million newborns from São Paulo (2012–2018). After preprocessing and addressing class imbalance via Near Miss undersampling, seven algorithms were trained: logistic regression, KNN, SVC, XGBoost, random forest, CNN, and LSTM. The study demonstrates that deep learning approaches, particularly LSTM, can achieve exceptional predictive accuracy for neonatal death prediction.

## Method Summary
The research utilized a comprehensive dataset of 1.4 million newborns from São Paulo covering the period 2012-2018. The methodology involved extensive preprocessing to handle missing values and class imbalance through Near Miss undersampling. Seven different machine learning and deep learning models were implemented and compared: logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, support vector classifier, XGBoost, random forest, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory networks. Model performance was evaluated using standard metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curves.

## Key Results
- XGBoost and random forest achieved 94% accuracy
- LSTM achieved 99% accuracy, outperforming all other models
- The study demonstrates the potential of deep learning for neonatal mortality prediction
- LSTM model is recommended for real-world deployment to enable early interventions for high-risk newborns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The high accuracy of LSTM models for neonatal mortality prediction likely stems from their ability to capture temporal dependencies and complex patterns in sequential health data. LSTM networks excel at learning long-range dependencies in time series data, which is crucial for understanding the progression of risk factors leading to neonatal death. The model's ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of clinical features allows it to identify subtle patterns that may not be apparent through traditional statistical methods.

## Foundational Learning
- **Near Miss undersampling**: A technique to handle imbalanced datasets by selecting samples from the majority class that are closest to the minority class. Needed to address the imbalance between live births and neonatal deaths. Quick check: Verify that the undersampling preserves representative samples of the majority class.

- **LSTM networks**: A type of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data. Essential for capturing temporal patterns in neonatal health progression. Quick check: Confirm that the LSTM architecture includes appropriate gating mechanisms to prevent vanishing gradients.

- **Class imbalance handling**: Critical in medical prediction tasks where positive cases (neonatal deaths) are rare compared to negative cases. Needed to prevent models from being biased toward the majority class. Quick check: Evaluate multiple imbalance handling techniques and compare their impact on model performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Performance Evaluation -> Model Selection

**Critical Path**: The most critical path is Data Preprocessing → LSTM Model Training → Performance Evaluation, as the quality of preprocessing directly impacts LSTM's ability to learn meaningful patterns, and LSTM's performance determines the final model selection.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice between LSTM and traditional ML models involves tradeoffs between interpretability and predictive accuracy. While LSTM achieves superior accuracy, it sacrifices interpretability compared to tree-based models like XGBoost and random forest.

**Failure Signatures**: Overfitting is a primary concern given the 99% accuracy achieved by LSTM, which may indicate the model has memorized training patterns rather than learned generalizable features. This could manifest as poor performance on unseen data.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and check for overfitting
2. Perform feature importance analysis on the LSTM model to identify key predictors
3. Conduct ablation studies by removing individual features to assess their impact on model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The extremely high LSTM accuracy (99%) appears suspiciously perfect for a complex clinical outcome prediction task and may indicate overfitting
- Use of Near Miss undersampling could have introduced selection bias by disproportionately removing healthy cases
- Absence of external validation on independent datasets from other regions or countries significantly limits real-world performance assessment

## Confidence

**Major Claim Confidence:**
- Model performance metrics: **Medium** confidence (accuracy appears too high for clinical prediction)
- LSTM superiority over other algorithms: **Medium** confidence (needs external validation)
- Clinical utility for early intervention: **Low** confidence (no prospective validation or implementation study)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct external validation on independent neonatal datasets from different geographic regions and healthcare systems
2. Perform feature importance analysis to identify key predictors and assess clinical interpretability
3. Implement cross-validation with multiple random seeds to assess model stability and check for overfitting
