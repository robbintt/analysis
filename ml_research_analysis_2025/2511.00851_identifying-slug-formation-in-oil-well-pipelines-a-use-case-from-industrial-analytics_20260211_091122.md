- One-line primary result: Interactive ML tool for slug detection with event-level IoU evaluation and persistence-based alerting

## Executive Summary
This work presents an interactive, end-to-end tool for detecting slug formation in oil well pipelines using machine learning. The system integrates data exploration, manual labeling, configurable model training (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), timeline-based result visualization, and real-time inference with persistence-based alerting to suppress false alarms. A key innovation is the combination of event-level evaluation (IoU-based), chronological data splitting, and confidence trace visualization for interpretable, actionable insights. Tested on a four-month simulated dataset, the tool demonstrates improved operational reliability and safety by enabling real-time slug detection and alert generation, with broader applicability to time-series fault diagnosis in critical industries.

## Method Summary
The approach combines supervised time-series classification with class imbalance handling through class weights, chronological train-test splitting to respect operational drift, and event-level IoU evaluation to align with operator perception of slug episodes. Models (J48 Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) are trained on labeled historical data with probability calibration via Platt scaling. Detection outputs are filtered through a persistence-based alerting mechanism that requires consecutive positive predictions before triggering notifications. The system provides interactive visualization of confidence traces and allows threshold tuning via Fβ score or Youden's index.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated improved operational reliability through real-time slug detection with configurable sensitivity
- Event-level IoU evaluation provides more meaningful assessment than pointwise metrics for intermittent phenomena
- Persistence-based alerting effectively suppresses false alarms while maintaining detection sensitivity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Persistence-based alerting reduces spurious alarms by requiring consecutive positive predictions before triggering notifications. A run-length counter increments when predictions remain positive and resets on any negative, with alerts firing only when the counter exceeds threshold κ. This filters transient sensor noise while preserving detection of genuine slug episodes.

### Mechanism 2
Chronological train-test splitting provides realistic performance estimates under operational drift by preserving temporal order and preventing random shuffling that would overestimate generalization to future conditions. This respects that process plants drift across shifts, seasons, and maintenance windows.

### Mechanism 3
Event-level IoU evaluation aligns model assessment with operator perception of slug episodes rather than isolated timestep predictions. Contiguous slug intervals are treated as events, with detection counted as true if IoU ≥ θ (typically 0.5), penalizing fragmented predictions and rewarding capturing full episode extent.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Supervised time-series classification with class imbalance
  - Why needed here: Slug events are rare compared to normal operation. The paper uses class weights to prevent models from ignoring minority slug class.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why accuracy would be misleading if 95% of timesteps are non-slug?

- Concept: Threshold selection for asymmetric costs (Fβ score, Youden's index)
  - Why needed here: Safety-critical settings prioritize recall over precision. The paper allows tuning threshold via Fβ with β > 1 or Youden's index.
  - Quick check question: If a missed slug costs 10x more than a false alarm, which metric should guide threshold selection?

- Concept: Probability calibration (Platt scaling)
  - Why needed here: Raw model scores may not reflect true probabilities. Calibration enables meaningful confidence traces for operator trust.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model output 0.7 probability when only 40% of such cases are actually positive?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion (CSV upload) -> Exploration & labeling interface -> Model training (J48/RF/XGBoost) -> Evaluation (pointwise + IoU) -> Inference module -> Persistence filter -> Alert generation

- Critical path: 1) Upload labeled CSV with sensor columns + binary slug label 2) Select chronological train/test intervals 3) Train classifier with class weights 4) Tune threshold τ on validation split 5) Configure persistence threshold κ for alerts 6) Run inference on unseen data; alerts fire only when run-length ≥ κ

- Design tradeoffs: Shorter κ (faster detection) vs. longer κ (fewer false alarms); high recall threshold (catch all slugs) vs. high precision (avoid alarm fatigue); complex models (XGBoost) vs. interpretable models (Decision Tree) for operator trust

- Failure signatures: High pointwise accuracy but low IoU → model makes scattered predictions rather than capturing episodes; alerts cluster during start-up transients → persistence threshold too low or training data lacks start-up examples; performance degrades on new time period → concept drift; may need periodic retraining or transfer learning

- First 3 experiments: 1) Establish baseline: Train Decision Tree on first 2 months, test on month 3. Report Fβ (β=2) and IoU@0.5. This validates chronological split methodology. 2) Persistence sensitivity: Fix model, vary κ ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}. Plot false positive rate vs. detection latency. Identify operating point matching acceptable alarm frequency. 3) Model comparison under snapshot persistence: Train RF and XGBoost with identical train/test intervals. Compare IoU and confidence trace stability. Use hashed experiment keys to ensure reproducible comparison.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the tool's detection accuracy and alert latency change when processing live sensor data with real-world noise profiles compared to the four-month simulated dataset used in the demonstration?
- Question: Can transfer learning approaches successfully enable model reuse across different oil wells with distinct topographies and operational drifts without extensive retraining?
- Question: Do hybrid models incorporating first-principles fluid dynamics simulations provide improved reliability over the standard machine learning classifiers currently implemented?

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation relies on simulated rather than field data, raising questions about real-world applicability
- Critical implementation details (hyperparameters, class weights, train/test intervals) are unspecified
- No systematic analysis of operating points versus false alarm rates for persistence threshold selection

## Confidence
- Persistence-based alerting mechanism: High confidence
- Chronological splitting methodology: High confidence  
- Event-level IoU evaluation: High confidence
- Real-world performance claims: Medium confidence (simulated data limitation)
- Persistence threshold guidance: Low confidence (insufficient systematic analysis)

## Next Checks
1. Apply the tool to real operational sensor logs from an actual oil well pipeline over 3-6 months, comparing detection performance against operator logs and existing monitoring systems.

2. Systematically vary κ across orders of magnitude (1-16) on field data, plotting false positive rate against mean detection delay to identify optimal operating points for different operational contexts.

3. Implement periodic retraining every 30-90 days on rolling windows of recent data, measuring performance degradation between training periods to quantify operational drift and retraining requirements.
