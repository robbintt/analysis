# Mathematical Foundations of Neural Tangents and Infinite-Width Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08264
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08264
- Reference count: 15
- This work proposes NTK-ECRN, integrating Fourier feature embeddings, residual connections with layerwise scaling, and stochastic depth to bridge infinite-width NTK theory with practical finite-width deep networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the gap between theoretical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis in the infinite-width regime and practical finite-width deep networks. It introduces the NTK-Eigenvalue-Controlled Residual Network (NTK-ECRN), which uses Fourier feature embeddings, residual connections with layerwise scaling, and stochastic depth to enable rigorous mathematical analysis of NTK evolution during training. The architecture explicitly controls eigenvalue growth, improving stability and generalization. Empirical validation on synthetic regression and classification tasks, UCI benchmark datasets, and a small CIFAR-10 subset shows that NTK-ECRN achieves significantly lower mean squared error, higher R², and improved accuracy compared to standard MLPs, ResNet-18, and conventional NTK models.

## Method Summary
The NTK-ECRN architecture integrates Fourier feature embeddings, residual connections with layerwise scaling, and stochastic depth. Input data is first transformed via Fourier projection φ(x) = [sin(2πBx), cos(2πBx)]. The network consists of L residual blocks with scaled contributions: h^(l+1) = h^(l) + α_l · σ(W_l h^(l) + b_l). The NTK is computed at initialization and each epoch to monitor eigenvalue evolution. Training uses full-batch gradient descent (mini-batch SGD for larger benchmarks). The method is validated on synthetic tasks (regression with sinusoidal modes, 5-class Gaussian mixture), UCI datasets (Boston Housing, Iris, Wine), and a 5k subset of CIFAR-10.

## Key Results
- NTK-ECRN achieves lower MSE and higher R² on synthetic regression and UCI datasets compared to standard MLPs and ResNet-18.
- The architecture demonstrates improved accuracy and lower cross-entropy on the CIFAR-10 subset versus conventional NTK models.
- Theoretical analysis and kernel monitoring confirm controlled NTK eigenvalue growth and smooth spectral evolution, validating the approach as a bridge between rigorous kernel theory and practical deep learning design.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fourier feature embeddings mitigate spectral bias by explicitly injecting high-frequency basis functions into the input representation. The transformation φ(x) = [sin(2πBx), cos(2πBx)] maps input data into a higher-dimensional space where high-frequency components are linearly separable. This prevents the network from "squashing" high-frequency targets, which standard MLPs often ignore due to the spectral decay of the NTK at initialization. Core assumption: The target function requires high-frequency components to be learned, and the random or fixed frequency matrix B covers the relevant spectral bands. Evidence: [abstract] "Fourier feature embeddings... reduce spectral bias [and] allow more precise eigenvalue analysis." [section III.D] "This transformation enriches the NTK spectrum, allowing the network to learn finer-grained features..." Break condition: If the frequency matrix B is poorly scaled (frequencies too high or low), the embedding becomes effectively noise or redundant, failing to improve learning.

### Mechanism 2
Residual connections with layerwise scaling coefficients (α_l) mathematically bound the growth of the NTK's Frobenius norm, preventing uncontrolled eigenvalue divergence. By scaling the residual branch α_l σ(W_l h^(l)), the contribution of each layer to the NTK deviation ΔΘ is strictly controlled. The paper derives a bound where the deviation adds a term proportional to α_l², allowing architects to cap the largest eigenvalue λ_max by tuning α_l. Core assumption: The activation function derivatives σ'(·) remain bounded (e.g., using tanh or GELU) and the network operates in a regime where the Jacobian norm is stable. Evidence: [abstract] "The architecture explicitly controls eigenvalue growth, improving stability and generalization." [section IV.A] Eq. (15) explicitly shows λ_max growth is bounded by the scaling factor α_l². Break condition: If scaling factors α_l are set too large relative to the network depth, the cumulative eigenvalue growth may still exceed the stability threshold, causing training divergence.

### Mechanism 3
Stochastic depth acts as a regularizer that smooths the expected NTK evolution while maintaining the traceability of kernel dynamics. Dropping residual blocks stochastically during training induces a stochastic kernel E[Θ]. The paper shows this modifies the expected NTK update by a factor of (1-p_l), which theoretically reduces variance in the gradient updates and improves generalization on finite data. Core assumption: The network is sufficiently deep so that the stochastic dropping of layers provides meaningful regularization without destroying the gradient flow. Evidence: [abstract] "...integrating [stochastic depth] to enable rigorous analysis of kernel evolution... improves generalization." [section IV.B] Eq. (17) derives the expected NTK growth under stochastic masks, showing analytically tractable dampening. Break condition: If drop probability p_l is too high, the effective network depth collapses, and the "residual" nature of the kernel propagation is lost, degrading performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)**
  - Why needed here: This is the central object of analysis. You must understand that the NTK Θ(x, x') represents the network's local linearization. If it changes too rapidly (finite-width) or not at all (infinite-width), training dynamics break or stagnate.
  - Quick check question: How does the NTK relate to gradient descent dynamics in the infinite-width limit? (Answer: It remains constant, and the network behaves as a kernel method.)

- **Concept: Eigenvalue Spectrum & Spectral Bias**
  - Why needed here: The paper's success metric is controlling the eigenvalues λ_i(t). You need to grasp that large eigenvalues correspond to fast-learning modes, and "spectral bias" implies the network naturally learns low-frequency modes first.
  - Quick check question: Why would a standard MLP fail to learn a high-frequency sine wave quickly? (Answer: Because the initial NTK spectrum has decaying eigenvalues for high frequencies.)

- **Concept: Residual Connections & Stability**
  - Why needed here: The proposed architecture modifies standard ResNets with specific scaling. You need to know why ResNets help (gradient flow) to understand why adding scaling α_l helps mathematically *bound* that flow.
  - Quick check question: In a residual block h_(l+1) = h_l + F(h_l), what happens to the gradient w.r.t. h_l? (Answer: It has a component of 1, preventing vanishing gradients.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw vector x -> Fourier Projection φ(x) = [sin(2πBx), cos(2πBx)] -> Residual Tower (L blocks: h_(l+1) = h_l + m_l α_l σ(W_l h_l)) -> Linear Readout ŷ = W_(L+1) h_L
- **Critical path:** The calculation of the exact NTK during training (Eq. 31). Unlike standard implementations where you just run .backward(), this architecture requires logging the kernel matrix Θ_t and its eigenvalues λ_i(t) to verify the "Controlled" part of NTK-ECRN.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Scaling α_l: Lower values ensure tighter bounds on eigenvalue growth (stability) but may slow down learning speed (feature enrichment).
  - Stochastic Depth p_l: Higher drop probability improves regularization (generalization) but increases variance in the NTK evolution, making the theoretical "expected value" analysis less reflective of any single run.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Exploding Eigenvalues: If λ_max grows exponentially, the scaling α_l is likely too large for the network depth.
  - Stagnant Loss (Spectral Bias): If high-frequency targets are not learned, the Fourier frequency matrix B may be poorly initialized or missing the relevant frequency bands.
  - Kernel Collapse: If stochastic depth is too aggressive, the NTK may fail to propagate input similarities through the depth of the network.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Spectral Validation: Train on the synthetic regression task (sum of sines) and plot λ_max(t) over epochs. Verify it follows the derived linear/controlled bound rather than exploding like a standard MLP.
  2. Ablation on Fourier Features: Run the same task with and without the φ(x) embedding. Measure the MSE gap on high-frequency components specifically to validate the "spectral bias" reduction claim.
  3. Width Scaling: Train with increasing width. Confirm that as width increases, the NTK evolution ΔΘ decreases, approaching the theoretical infinite-width limit (validating the bridge between theory and practice).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the NTK-ECRN architecture maintain controlled eigenvalue growth and generalization improvements when scaled to full-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and deeper network configurations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The empirical validation is restricted to UCI benchmarks and a "small CIFAR-10 subset (5,000 images)," with the authors characterizing the implementation as a "UG-level project."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the theoretical stability and performance gains relative to standard ResNets persist when data complexity and model depth increase significantly beyond the tested regimes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evaluation on full-scale benchmarks (e.g., full CIFAR-100 or ImageNet) demonstrating that the largest eigenvalue λ_max(t) remains bounded and accuracy scales comparably to standard production architectures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the principles of eigenvalue-controlled residual scaling be effectively adapted to non-residual architectures, such as Transformers or attention-based models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The proposed NTK-ECRN relies specifically on recursive residual connections with layerwise scaling (Eq. 13); the theoretical analysis does not extend to attention mechanisms or other topologies.
- Why unresolved: The derivation of the bounds depends on the specific Jacobian structure of residual blocks; it remains uncertain if similar eigenvalue control can be enforced in architectures with distinct gradient propagation properties.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extension of the NTK-ECRN framework to Vision Transformers, including a derivation of the corresponding NTK evolution bounds and empirical validation of stable training dynamics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the derived generalization bounds (Eq. 8) provide numerically tight estimates of the test error, or do they primarily offer qualitative insights?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper links spectral properties to generalization bounds and validates the *trend* of performance, but does not explicitly compare the theoretical bound values against the actual generalization gap observed during experiments.
- Why unresolved: Theoretical bounds in kernel theory often involve loose constants that may not track the actual test error closely, limiting their utility for practical hyperparameter selection or architecture design.
- What evidence would resolve it: A quantitative comparison plotting the theoretical upper bound against the observed generalization error across varying dataset sizes and noise levels to assess tightness.

## Limitations

- The core theoretical claim that eigenvalue-controlled scaling via α_l can rigorously bound NTK evolution during training rests heavily on derivations from Appendix A, which are not directly verified in the main text.
- The choice of frequency matrix B initialization and scale is underspecified, introducing variability in reproduction and potentially affecting the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings.
- The claim that stochastic depth improves generalization via smoothed NTK evolution is supported analytically, but the ablation for stochastic depth alone is not presented, making its isolated contribution unclear.

## Confidence

- NTK-ECRN architecture improves both stability and generalization compared to standard NTK models and practical deep networks: **Medium**
- The eigenvalue-controlled design enables rigorous mathematical analysis of NTK evolution: **Low**
- Fourier embeddings reduce spectral bias and allow precise eigenvalue analysis: **Medium**

## Next Checks

1. **Scale-Up Stability Test:** Train NTK-ECRN on a larger subset of CIFAR-10 (e.g., 25k images) and monitor λ_max(t) and validation accuracy. Verify that controlled eigenvalue growth correlates with sustained generalization, not just initial stability.

2. **Ablation on Stochastic Depth:** Run the synthetic regression task with NTK-ECRN but disable stochastic depth. Compare λ_max(t) growth and final MSE to the full model to isolate the regularization effect.

3. **Fourier Frequency Sensitivity:** Systematically vary the scale and initialization of the frequency matrix B (e.g., B ~ N(0, σ²I) for multiple σ values) on the synthetic high-frequency regression task. Measure the impact on spectral bias reduction and final MSE to quantify robustness to this hyperparameter.
