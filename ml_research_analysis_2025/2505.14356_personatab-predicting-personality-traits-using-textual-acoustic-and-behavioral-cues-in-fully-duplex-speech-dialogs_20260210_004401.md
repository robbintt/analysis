# PersonaTAB: Predicting Personality Traits using Textual, Acoustic, and Behavioral Cues in Fully-Duplex Speech Dialogs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.14356
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14356
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Achieves average cosine similarity of 0.503 with human-annotated personality labels, outperforming BERT, LM, and MiniLM baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel pipeline for predicting personality traits from fully-duplex speech dialogues, addressing the challenge of personality-aware conversational agents in the absence of personality annotations in speech datasets. The authors preprocess raw audio recordings to create a dialogue dataset annotated with timestamps, response types, and emotion/sentiment labels using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and various classifiers. They then employ large language models (LLMs) to predict conversational personality by integrating textual information (content, emotion, sentiment), acoustic features (laughter), and conversational traits (e.g., number of turns). Human evaluators were engaged to validate both the generated dataset and prediction model, demonstrating stronger alignment with human judgments compared to existing approaches. The proposed system achieves an average cosine similarity of 0.503 with human-annotated labels, outperforming baseline methods such as BERT, LM, and MiniLM.

## Method Summary
The system extracts three feature categories—emotion/sentiment distributions from transcribed text, laughter frequency from audio, and conversational statistics (turns, backchannels, interjections) from timestamp analysis—and formats them as structured prompt sections that GPT-4o processes to predict Big Five trait alignments. Raw conversational statistics are converted into dataset-relative qualitative bins using mean and IQR thresholds to improve LLM interpretability. The pipeline includes ASR (Whisper Turbo) for transcription with word-level timestamps, laughter detection, response boundary construction with 700ms silence threshold, overlap detection, context-aware backchannel classification via GPT-4o, emotion/sentiment classification, statistics aggregation with IQR-based quantization, and personality prediction using GPT-4o with structured prompts.

## Key Results
- Average cosine similarity of 0.503 with human-annotated personality labels
- Ablation studies show full multi-modal prompt (textual + acoustic + behavioral) achieves highest Trend (0.186) and Correlation (0.183) scores
- Outperforms text-only baselines (BERT, LM, MiniLM) on personality prediction tasks
- Human evaluators demonstrate stronger alignment with human judgments compared to existing approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Modal Feature Aggregation via Structured LLM Prompts
Integrating textual, acoustic, and behavioral cues into a unified LLM prompt improves personality prediction alignment with human judgments compared to text-only baselines. The system extracts three feature categories—emotion/sentiment distributions from transcribed text, laughter frequency from audio, and conversational statistics (turns, backchannels, interjections) from timestamp analysis—and formats them as structured prompt sections that GPT-4o processes to predict Big Five trait alignments.

### Mechanism 2: Relative Behavioral Quantization for LLM Interpretability
Converting raw conversational statistics into dataset-relative qualitative bins improves LLM reasoning over behavioral features. Raw counts (laughter per minute, turn frequency, backchannel rates) are mapped to five bins using dataset-wide mean and IQR thresholds, replacing raw numbers in prompts with qualitative descriptors like "Very Frequent" vs. "Normal."

### Mechanism 3: Context-Conditioned Backchannel Disambiguation
LLM-based backchannel classification using full dialogue context improves differentiation of emotive backchannels, cognitive backchannels, and unsuccessful interjections versus keyword-based heuristics. Candidate backchannels are classified by GPT-4o using class definitions, chat history before/after target, and temporal position within overlappee speech.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Big Five Personality Model (OCEAN)**
  - Why needed here: The system outputs five-dimensional trait scores; understanding what each dimension captures is essential for interpreting results and designing features.
  - Quick check question: Which Big Five trait would most likely correlate with frequent interjections and short turn durations?

- **Concept: Fully-Duplex vs. Turn-Taking Dialogue**
  - Why needed here: The pipeline specifically targets fully-duplex settings where overlapping speech, backchannels, and interjections occur; standard turn-based NLP tooling will not capture these signals.
  - Quick check question: In a fully-duplex system, how would you distinguish a backchannel from an unsuccessful interjection using only timestamps?

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering for Structured Attribute Injection**
  - Why needed here: The system's performance depends on formatting behavioral statistics, emotion distributions, and sample utterances as structured prompt sections; poor formatting could degrade LLM reasoning.
  - Quick check question: Why might an LLM struggle with raw numerical laughter frequencies but succeed with "Very Frequent" descriptors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: ASR (Whisper Turbo) -> Response Boundary Construction -> Overlap Detection -> Backchannel Classification (GPT-4o) -> Statistics Aggregation -> LLM Personality Prediction (GPT-4o)

- **Critical path**: ASR → Response Boundary → Overlap Detection → Backchannel Classification → Statistics Aggregation → LLM Personality Prediction. Errors in early ASR/timestamp stages propagate through all downstream components.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - 700ms silence threshold for turn boundaries trades off between merging legitimate multi-sentence turns vs. splitting pauses mid-thought
  - IQR-based quantization improves LLM interpretability but loses absolute magnitude information; may obscure outliers
  - Using GPT-4o for both backchannel classification and personality prediction introduces cost and latency; no fallback is specified

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low ASR quality → incorrect timestamps → malformed overlap labels → degraded backchannel statistics → noisy personality scores
  - Dataset shift (non-English, different cultural norms) → IQR bins mischaracterize behavior → spurious "Very Many"/"Very Few" labels
  - Emotion classifier bias (e.g., over-predicting "neutral") → flattened emotion distributions → weaker Extraversion/Neuroticism signals

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate backchannel classifier accuracy: Manually annotate 200 candidate backchannels; compute precision/recall for emotive vs. cognitive vs. non-backchannel classes; identify systematic error patterns.
  2. Test quantization sensitivity: Replace IQR-based bins with raw normalized values (z-scores) in LLM prompt; compare Trend and Cosine Similarity scores to baseline; assess whether LLM can reason with numeric context.
  3. Cross-dataset generalization: Apply pipeline (recomputed IQR thresholds) to a different two-channel corpus (e.g., Switchboard); evaluate whether personality correlations hold or degrade; identify domain-specific feature drift.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can synthetic dialogue datasets generated by LLMs effectively supplement the scarce supply of human-annotated personality speech data? Current speech datasets lack personality annotations, and this study relies on a small subset of the Fisher dataset; it is unknown if synthetic data can capture the acoustic and behavioral nuances of real human interaction.

### Open Question 2
How can the predicted Big Five personality traits be utilized to condition the behavior of fully-duplex conversational agents? While the paper establishes a pipeline for predicting personality, it does not implement the inverse: controlling agent behavior based on these labels.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does the reliance on lexical samples and emotional cues limit the prediction accuracy of non-emotive traits like conscientiousness? The authors note a lower score for "Conscientiousness" and attribute discrepancies to the model relying on sample responses for responsibility, where emotional cues may not adequately capture the trait.

## Limitations
- Backchannel classification accuracy is not validated against human annotations; systematic misclassifications could propagate to personality prediction
- Quantization scheme is dataset-specific and may not generalize across cultural contexts or conversational styles
- Personality prediction uses GPT-4o without reporting inter-rater reliability or stability metrics across multiple runs

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The ablation results demonstrating that multi-modal integration (textual + acoustic + behavioral) outperforms single-modality conditions
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of relative behavioral quantization for LLM interpretability, though no ablation tests raw numerical values
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the pipeline to non-English or culturally diverse datasets, as the Fisher corpus is English-language telephone speech

## Next Checks
1. Validate backchannel classifier accuracy: Manually annotate 200 candidate backchannels; compute precision/recall for each class (emotive, cognitive, unsuccessful interjection); compare GPT-4o performance against human agreement rates.
2. Test quantization sensitivity: Replace the IQR-based relative grouping with normalized z-scores in the LLM prompt; measure changes in Trend and Cosine Similarity to determine if LLMs can reason effectively with raw numerical context.
3. Cross-dataset generalization: Apply the full pipeline (recomputing IQR thresholds) to a different two-channel corpus (e.g., Switchboard or AMI); evaluate whether personality correlation patterns hold or degrade, and identify which features show the most domain-specific drift.
