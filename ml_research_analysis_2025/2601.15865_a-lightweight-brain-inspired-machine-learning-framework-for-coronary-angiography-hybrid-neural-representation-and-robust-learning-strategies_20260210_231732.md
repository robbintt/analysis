# A Lightweight Brain-Inspired Machine Learning Framework for Coronary Angiography: Hybrid Neural Representation and Robust Learning Strategies

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.15865
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15865
- **Reference count**: 12
- **Primary result**: 85% accuracy, 96.67% sensitivity, and 0.9372 AUC on 120 coronary angiography images

## Executive Summary
This study presents a lightweight brain-inspired machine learning framework for coronary angiography image classification that addresses class imbalance, label uncertainty, and computational constraints in clinical settings. The framework combines a pretrained CNN with a compact classification head, utilizing selective neural plasticity training and a brain-inspired attention-modulated loss function that integrates Focal Loss with label smoothing. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance metrics while achieving rapid convergence within 4 epochs and maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world clinical deployment.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a hybrid neural representation approach combining a pretrained convolutional neural network backbone with a compact classification head. A selective neural plasticity training strategy is implemented alongside a brain-inspired attention-modulated loss function that integrates Focal Loss with label smoothing techniques. This combination addresses the challenges of class imbalance and label uncertainty while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is trained on coronary angiography images and validated on an independent test set, demonstrating rapid convergence and high performance metrics suitable for clinical decision support applications.

## Key Results
- Achieved 85% accuracy, 96.67% sensitivity, and 0.9372 AUC on independent test set of 120 images
- Rapid convergence within 4 epochs with 2.2 minutes training time
- Successfully addresses class imbalance and label uncertainty while maintaining computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from integrating biologically inspired mechanisms with modern deep learning techniques. The attention-modulated loss function combines Focal Loss to handle class imbalance with label smoothing to mitigate label uncertainty, creating a robust learning environment. The selective neural plasticity training strategy allows the model to focus on relevant features while maintaining generalization capability. The hybrid neural representation leverages pretrained knowledge while adapting to domain-specific features of coronary angiography images, enabling efficient learning with limited computational resources.

## Foundational Learning
- **Focal Loss**: Addresses class imbalance by down-weighting well-classified examples and focusing on hard negatives. Why needed: Coronary angiography datasets often have severe class imbalance between normal and pathological cases. Quick check: Monitor loss contribution from minority class during training.
- **Label Smoothing**: Prevents overconfidence by softening one-hot labels. Why needed: Medical imaging labels often contain uncertainty due to expert disagreement. Quick check: Compare validation loss curves with and without label smoothing.
- **Neural Plasticity**: Selectively updates network parameters based on importance. Why needed: Reduces overfitting on small medical datasets. Quick check: Track parameter update magnitudes across layers.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Pretrained CNN -> Selective Plasticity Layer -> Attention-Modulated Loss Function -> Compact Classification Head

**Critical Path**: Input images flow through the pretrained CNN backbone, undergo selective parameter updates through the plasticity layer, are processed by the compact classification head, and the final predictions are evaluated using the attention-modulated loss function.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The lightweight design sacrifices some representational capacity for faster inference and training, trading absolute accuracy for clinical deployability. The brain-inspired components add complexity to the training process but provide better handling of real-world data imperfections.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on minority classes indicates inadequate Focal Loss configuration; overfitting suggests insufficient regularization; slow convergence may indicate suboptimal plasticity parameters; sensitivity-specific performance issues suggest attention mechanism problems.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Train baseline model without selective plasticity to establish performance floor
2. Implement Focal Loss only to quantify its impact on class imbalance
3. Add label smoothing independently to measure its effect on uncertainty handling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size (120 test images) raises concerns about generalization capability
- Absence of cross-validation or external validation cohorts limits confidence in reported metrics
- Computational efficiency metrics lack hardware specification context and baseline comparisons

## Confidence
- **Performance metrics reproducibility**: Medium - High sensitivity and rapid convergence claims need independent verification
- **Generalization capability**: Medium - Limited dataset and lack of external validation raise concerns
- **Biological inspiration claims**: Low - Theoretical validation without neurophysiological evidence
- **Clinical applicability**: Medium-low - Pending external validation and robustness testing

## Next Checks
1. Release code and full hyperparameter settings for independent replication
2. Validate on an external multi-center dataset with at least 500 images
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing the proposed loss function against standard Focal Loss and cross-entropy variants
