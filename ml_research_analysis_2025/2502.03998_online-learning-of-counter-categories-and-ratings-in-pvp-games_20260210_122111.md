# Online Learning of Counter Categories and Ratings in PvP Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.03998
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03998
- Authors: Chiu-Chou Lin; I-Chen Wu
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Online learning algorithm for counter categories and ratings in PvP games

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Elo-RCC, an online learning algorithm that extends the Elo rating system to dynamically learn counter categories and adjust ratings after each match in player-vs-player (PvP) games. The method models a categorical distribution for each player, samples counter categories, and updates both ratings and counter relationships iteratively using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that Elo-RCC achieves comparable performance to Neural Counter Table (NCT) while enabling real-time updates, particularly excelling in games without complex team compositions.

## Method Summary
Elo-RCC extends the traditional Elo rating system by incorporating categorical distributions for counter relationships between players. After each match, the algorithm samples counter categories from each player's distribution and updates both the ratings and the counter relationships using an EM algorithm. This approach allows for simultaneous learning of player strengths and the underlying counter category structure of the game, making it suitable for real-time applications where player interactions are continuously evolving.

## Key Results
- Elo-RCC achieves comparable performance to Neural Counter Table (NCT) on Age of Empires II and Hearthstone datasets
- The method demonstrates high accuracy in predicting player strengths and counter relationships
- Elo-RCC shows particular effectiveness in games without complex team compositions
- The algorithm enables real-time updates while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Elo-RCC method works by integrating the Elo rating system with a probabilistic model of counter categories. By representing each player's counters as a categorical distribution, the algorithm can sample potential counter relationships and update them iteratively based on match outcomes. The EM algorithm provides a principled framework for alternating between estimating the most likely counter categories (E-step) and updating the ratings and category parameters (M-step). This joint learning approach allows the system to adapt to changing player strategies and meta-game developments while maintaining accurate strength assessments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Elo Rating System**: Traditional method for calculating relative skill levels in competitive games; needed for baseline rating mechanism; quick check: verify expected win probability calculations
- **Expectation-Maximization Algorithm**: Iterative method for finding maximum likelihood estimates with latent variables; needed for alternating between counter category estimation and parameter updates; quick check: monitor convergence of EM iterations
- **Categorical Distributions**: Probability distributions over discrete categories; needed to model uncertainty in counter relationships; quick check: validate that probabilities sum to 1 for each player
- **Online Learning**: Incremental learning approach that updates models with new data points; needed for real-time adaptation; quick check: ensure constant time complexity per update
- **Counter Relationships in Games**: Strategic interactions where certain strategies or characters are stronger against others; needed for modeling game-specific dynamics; quick check: verify learned counters align with game knowledge

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Player Ratings -> Categorical Distributions -> Counter Sampling -> Match Outcome Prediction -> EM Update Loop

**Critical Path**: New match outcome → Counter category sampling → Rating adjustment → Counter relationship update → Convergence check

**Design Tradeoffs**: Real-time learning capability vs. computational complexity; probabilistic uncertainty modeling vs. deterministic approaches; online adaptation vs. batch optimization

**Failure Signatures**: Convergence to local optima in EM algorithm; sensitivity to initialization parameters; poor performance on games with complex team compositions

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify EM algorithm convergence on synthetic data with known counter relationships
2. Test rating updates on simple Rock-Paper-Scissors with varying match sequences
3. Compare computational time per update between Elo-RCC and NCT on identical hardware

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance limitations in games with complex team compositions
- Lack of comprehensive computational efficiency comparison with NCT
- Insufficient examination of EM algorithm convergence properties and parameter sensitivity

## Confidence
- Performance comparison with NCT: Medium confidence - results show competitive accuracy but lack detailed computational analysis
- Applicability to complex team games: Low confidence - explicitly acknowledged limitation without systematic evaluation
- EM algorithm robustness: Medium confidence - methodology described but convergence and sensitivity not thoroughly validated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies on the impact of EM algorithm initialization parameters and convergence thresholds across different game types
2. Perform head-to-head computational efficiency benchmarking between Elo-RCC and NCT on identical hardware for real-time update scenarios
3. Evaluate Elo-RCC performance on games with complex team compositions and meta-strategies to quantify the stated limitations more precisely
