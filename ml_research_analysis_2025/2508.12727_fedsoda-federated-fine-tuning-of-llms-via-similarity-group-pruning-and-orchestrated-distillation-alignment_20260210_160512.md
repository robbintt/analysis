# FedSODA: Federated Fine-tuning of LLMs via Similarity Group Pruning and Orchestrated Distillation Alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.12727
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12727
- Reference count: 40
- Resource-efficient federated fine-tuning framework reducing communication by 70.6% and storage by 75.6% while improving accuracy by 3.1%

## Executive Summary
FedSODA addresses the challenge of federated fine-tuning (FFT) of large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments while preserving data privacy. The framework introduces two key innovations: similarity group pruning (SGP) to selectively reduce sub-LLM size based on representational similarity, and orchestrated distillation alignment (ODA) to minimize gradient divergence through intermittent partial-layer alignment. By combining these with QLoRA quantization, clients only deploy quantized sub-LLMs and fine-tune lightweight adapters, significantly reducing communication overhead and storage requirements while maintaining or improving task accuracy.

## Method Summary
FedSODA employs a two-module approach for resource-efficient FFT. First, similarity group pruning analyzes layer representations on public data to identify and remove redundant layers while preserving critical ones, reducing sub-LLM size. Second, orchestrated distillation alignment performs pre-alignment and intermittent realignment between the sub-LLM and full LLM to minimize gradient divergence during federated training. The framework integrates QLoRA, where clients use quantized sub-LLMs with LoRA adapters, fine-tuning only the adapters locally while keeping the sub-LLM frozen. The server aggregates updates via FedAvg and triggers realignment periodically to maintain alignment quality.

## Key Results
- Reduces communication overhead by an average of 70.6% across three base models and multiple downstream tasks
- Decreases storage usage by 75.6% through selective layer pruning and QLoRA quantization
- Improves task accuracy by 3.1% compared to baseline methods including FedPETuning and FedOT
- Demonstrates consistent performance gains across LLaMA3-8B, Qwen2-7B, and Mistral-7B on GSM8K, SST-2, and BoolQ datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FedSODA's effectiveness stems from addressing two fundamental challenges in FFT: computational resource constraints and gradient divergence. The similarity group pruning identifies layers with highly similar representations, allowing safe removal of redundant computations while preserving essential model capacity. The orchestrated distillation alignment minimizes the representational gap between the sub-LLM and full LLM through knowledge distillation, preventing performance degradation during federated training. Together with QLoRA's parameter-efficient fine-tuning, these mechanisms enable effective adaptation of large models on resource-constrained devices without compromising accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Angular distance computation**: Measures representational similarity between layers using cosine distance; needed to identify redundant layers for pruning; quick check: verify d(x^ℓ, x^(ℓ+n)) ∈ [0,1] for layer pairs
- **Knowledge distillation alignment**: Minimizes KL divergence between teacher and student model outputs; needed to reduce gradient divergence during federated training; quick check: monitor KL loss convergence during pre-alignment
- **QLoRA quantization**: Applies 4-bit quantization to reduce model size; needed to fit sub-LLMs on resource-constrained clients; quick check: confirm model size reduction from ~4.5GB to ~1.5GB for 7B model
- **Proximal regularization**: Adds L2 penalty on adapter parameters to prevent drift; needed to stabilize local fine-tuning; quick check: verify µ parameter prevents large parameter updates
- **Non-overlapping group pruning**: Ensures layer indices remain consecutive after pruning; needed to maintain model architecture integrity; quick check: confirm pruned indices don't overlap between groups
- **Intermittent realignment**: Periodically realigns sub-LLM with full LLM during federated training; needed to correct accumulated gradient errors; quick check: monitor accuracy drop when realignment is skipped

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Public Data -> SGP (Prune Layers) -> ODA (Pre-align) -> QLoRA (Quantize) -> Distribute to Clients -> Local Fine-tuning -> Server (FedAvg + Realign) -> Full Model Integration

**Critical Path**: Public data preprocessing → SGP layer pruning → ODA pre-alignment → QLoRA quantization → Distributed fine-tuning → Periodic server realignment → Model evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: SGP balances layer reduction against representational capacity; ODA trades computation for alignment quality; QLoRA sacrifices some precision for memory efficiency; periodic realignment adds communication overhead but improves accuracy

**Failure Signatures**: Excessive accuracy drop indicates over-pruning or misalignment; memory overflow suggests quantization issues; slow convergence points to inadequate local training or poor realignment timing

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement SGP on LLaMA3-8B using WikiText-2 subset, compute angular distances, and verify top 4 non-overlapping groups are correctly pruned
2. Run ODA pre-alignment with varying α and β weights, measuring KL divergence between sub-LLM and full LLM outputs
3. Simulate FFT with 10 clients on SST-2 using pruned sub-LLM, comparing accuracy and communication against FedAvg baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: Can the Orchestration Distillation Alignment (ODA) module function effectively without relying on a public proxy dataset? The current architecture fundamentally requires public data for both SGP and knowledge distillation, described as a "necessary compromise" in Appendix B.

**Open Question 2**: Does FedSODA maintain its efficiency and accuracy advantages when applied to non-decoder-only LLM architectures? Experiments are restricted to decoder-only models, though the paper mentions similar reasoning applies to others, but SGP's angular distance metric may function differently in encoder-decoder or MoE architectures.

**Open Question 3**: Can the critical hyperparameters, such as the pruning configuration (n, p) and alignment interval r, be dynamically determined rather than manually searched? Table 4 shows performance sensitivity to these parameters, requiring manual search for optimal combinations.

## Limitations
- Reliance on public proxy datasets for pruning and alignment may not generalize to all private data distributions
- Manual hyperparameter search for pruning configuration and alignment interval reduces practical deployment efficiency
- Limited evaluation to decoder-only architectures leaves uncertainty about performance on encoder-decoder or MoE models
- Unspecified exact values for alignment loss weights, proximal term, and training durations may affect reproducibility

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Conceptual validity of SGP for reducing sub-LLM size while maintaining representational capacity
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of ODA for reducing gradient divergence during federated training
- **Low confidence**: Exact reproduction of reported metrics due to unspecified hyperparameters, training durations, and data preprocessing details

## Next Checks
1. Validate SGP pruning strategy on LLaMA2-1.3B with n=3, p=4, verifying angular distances and non-overlapping group pruning
2. Test ODA pre-alignment convergence using WikiText-2 subset, varying α and β weights to minimize KL divergence
3. Simulate FFT with 10 clients on SST-2 using pruned sub-LLM, comparing accuracy and communication against FedAvg baseline
