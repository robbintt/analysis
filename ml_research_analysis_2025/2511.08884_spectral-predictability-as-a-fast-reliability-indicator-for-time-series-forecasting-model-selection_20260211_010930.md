# Spectral Predictability as a Fast Reliability Indicator for Time Series Forecasting Model Selection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.08884
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08884
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** Spectral predictability (Ω) reliably stratifies time series forecasting model performance and reduces validation costs.

## Executive Summary
Practitioners struggle to choose among dozens of time series forecasting models due to computational costs of exhaustive validation. This paper introduces spectral predictability Ω—a fast-to-compute signal processing metric that quantifies the concentration of a time series' power spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show forecasting error decreases systematically as Ω increases. Large-scale analysis of 51 models and 28 GIFT-Eval datasets reveals that zero-shot large foundation models outperform other model families by up to 60% in high-Ω regimes (Ω>0.5), while advantages vanish in low-Ω settings. Computing Ω takes seconds per dataset and reliably narrows the model search space, reducing validation costs. The findings highlight that current models differentiate primarily on easy (high-Ω) problems, revealing a critical research gap for genuinely difficult (low-Ω) forecasting challenges.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces spectral predictability Ω as a metric to quantify the concentration of a time series' power spectrum. Ω is computed by applying a Hann window to the time series, removing the DC component, calculating the power spectral density (PSD), normalizing to obtain probabilities, computing the spectral entropy, and normalizing by the maximum possible entropy. The metric ranges from 0 (completely diffuse spectrum) to 1 (perfectly concentrated spectrum). The authors evaluate this metric across synthetic Fourier signals with tunable Ω, real-world datasets (CarbonCast, PEMS, Fitbit), and a large-scale analysis of 51 models from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. They demonstrate that forecasting error decreases systematically as Ω increases, and that zero-shot large foundation models outperform other model families by up to 60% in high-Ω regimes (Ω>0.5), while advantages vanish in low-Ω settings.

## Key Results
- Spectral predictability Ω quantifies the concentration of a time series' power spectrum and correlates inversely with forecasting difficulty
- Zero-shot large foundation models outperform other model families by up to 60% in high-Ω regimes (Ω>0.5), while advantages vanish in low-Ω settings
- Computing Ω takes seconds per dataset and reliably narrows the model search space, reducing validation costs
- Current models differentiate primarily on easy (high-Ω) problems, revealing a critical research gap for genuinely difficult (low-Ω) forecasting challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None provided in the source material.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spectral Entropy:** Measures the uncertainty in a signal's frequency distribution
  - *Why needed:* Quantifies how concentrated or diffuse a signal's frequency content is
  - *Quick check:* Verify entropy values between 0 (perfectly concentrated) and log(K) (completely diffuse)
- **Hann Windowing:** Reduces spectral leakage in frequency domain analysis
  - *Why needed:* Ensures accurate power spectrum estimation by tapering signal edges
  - *Quick check:* Confirm that windowing preserves signal integrity while reducing edge effects
- **DC Component Removal:** Eliminates the mean value before spectral analysis
  - *Why needed:* Prevents the DC component from dominating the power spectrum
  - *Quick check:* Verify that the mean is subtracted before computing the FFT
- **Power Spectral Density (PSD):** Represents the power distribution across frequencies
  - *Why needed:* Provides the basis for calculating spectral predictability
  - *Quick check:* Ensure PSD values are properly normalized to sum to 1
- **Univariate Time Series Processing:** Converting multivariate datasets to univariate series
  - *Why needed:* Current Ω metric is defined only for univariate series
  - *Quick check:* Verify that aggregation or selection methods preserve relevant signal characteristics
- **sMAPE vs MSE:** Different error metrics for evaluation
  - *Why needed:* sMAPE is scale-independent and suitable for model comparison
  - *Quick check:* Confirm that both metrics show consistent trends across experiments

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Time Series -> Hann Window -> DC Removal -> FFT -> PSD -> Normalization -> Entropy -> Ω

**Critical Path:**
Signal preprocessing (Hann window + DC removal) -> Spectral analysis (FFT + PSD) -> Entropy calculation -> Ω normalization

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- **Computational Efficiency vs Accuracy:** Hann windowing and DC removal add minimal overhead while significantly improving spectral estimates
- **Metric Sensitivity vs Robustness:** Ω balances responsiveness to spectral concentration with stability across different signal lengths
- **Univariate Focus vs Multivariate Extension:** Current implementation is limited to univariate series, requiring aggregation for multivariate datasets

**Failure Signatures:**
- Ω values outside [0, 1] range indicate implementation errors (likely in entropy normalization or DC removal)
- Weak correlation between Ω and forecasting error suggests incorrect preprocessing or normalization
- High variance in low-Ω regimes is expected behavior, not a failure mode

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Implement Ω calculation on synthetic signals with known frequency content to verify range [0, 1]
2. Compute Ω for CarbonCast and PEMS datasets, plot histograms to understand distribution
3. Correlate Ω values with DLinear forecasting errors to verify inverse relationship

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:**
What architectural innovations could enable models to excel specifically on low-Ω (spectrally diffuse) forecasting problems where all current model families converge in performance?
- *Basis in paper:* "We identify the low-Ω regime as a critical open frontier where all model families struggle, motivating the design of models robust to irregular or weakly periodic signals."
- *Why unresolved:* Current models differentiate primarily on high-Ω problems; performance gaps narrow substantially as Ω decreases below 0.2.
- *What evidence would resolve it:* Novel architectures showing statistically significant improvements over baselines specifically in low-Ω regimes (Ω<0.4), evaluated on benchmarks with standardized Ω metadata.

**Open Question 2:**
Why do "re-pretrained" TSFMs lose the systematic Ω-dependent performance advantage that zero-shot models exhibit?
- *Basis in paper:* "This suggests that the pretraining corpus—not just model architecture or size—fundamentally shapes how models respond to spectral structure, a promising future area of investigation."
- *Why unresolved:* The paper observes the phenomenon but does not isolate whether data composition, training procedure, or weight initialization causes the degradation.
- *What evidence would resolve it:* Controlled ablations varying pretraining corpus spectral properties while holding architecture constant, measuring Ω-performance relationships.

**Open Question 3:**
How can spectral predictability Ω be meaningfully extended to multivariate and multimodal time series?
- *Basis in paper:* "Generalizing (Ω) to multivariate and multimodal time series would enable a notion of joint predictability that captures more complex dependencies."
- *Why unresolved:* Current Ω is defined only for univariate series; cross-series dependencies and modality interactions require new mathematical formulations.
- *What evidence would resolve it:* A generalized metric that predicts multivariate forecasting difficulty and maintains computational efficiency comparable to univariate Ω.

## Limitations
- The metric is currently limited to univariate time series, requiring aggregation or selection for multivariate datasets
- Performance advantages of large foundation models vanish in low-Ω regimes, revealing a critical research gap
- The exact synthetic signal generation procedure is not fully specified, potentially limiting reproducibility

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The core relationship between Ω and forecasting error, the computational efficiency of Ω calculation, and the systematic advantage of large foundation models in high-Ω regimes
- **Medium confidence:** The exact numerical replication of controlled experiments due to unspecified synthetic signal generation and dataset splits
- **Medium confidence:** The claim about all models performing similarly in low-Ω regimes, though results suggest this is the expected behavior

## Next Checks
1. Implement Ω calculation on synthetic signals with known frequency content to verify range [0, 1]
2. Compute Ω for CarbonCast and PEMS datasets, plot histograms to understand distribution
3. Correlate Ω values with DLinear forecasting errors to verify inverse relationship
