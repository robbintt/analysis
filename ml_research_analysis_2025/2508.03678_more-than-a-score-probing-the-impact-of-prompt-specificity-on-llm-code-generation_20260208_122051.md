# More Than a Score: Probing the Impact of Prompt Specificity on LLM Code Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.03678
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03678
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LLM code generation accuracy improves consistently with prompt specificity, but the rate of improvement depends on task complexity.

## Executive Summary
PartialOrderEval systematically measures how LLM code-generation accuracy changes with prompt detail. By augmenting benchmarks with prompts ranging from minimal to maximally detailed, it reveals that performance improves consistently as prompts become more specific, but the rate of improvement depends on task complexity. On standard benchmarks like HumanEval, models quickly reach high accuracy with modest detail; on harder, domain-specific benchmarks like ParEval, accuracy rises more gradually and never fully saturates even with rich prompts. Qualitative analysis shows that explicit input/output specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise breakdowns are the most impactful prompt details. Larger models achieve higher accuracy with less prompt specificity, making ParEval a more sensitive discriminator of model capability than HumanEval.

## Method Summary
The study generates a partial order of prompts from minimal (function signature only) to maximally detailed (step-by-step specifications) for each problem in HumanEval and ParEval benchmarks. For each problem, a maximally detailed prompt (p_top) is created using GPT-4.1 and must achieve pass@1 ≥ 0.8 with Qwen2.5-Coder-14B. Three augmentation strategies generate intermediate prompts: LLM summarization at 7 word limits, paragraph sampling at 4 retention ratios (4 variants each), and sentence-block masking at 4 ratios (4 variants each). The evaluation measures pass@1 across 41 prompts per problem using greedy decoding for multiple model sizes.

## Key Results
- Performance improves consistently as prompts become more specific, with HumanEval plateauing at ~100 words while ParEval-OMP never fully saturates even at 200 words
- Explicit input/output specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise breakdowns are the most impactful prompt details
- Larger models achieve higher accuracy with less prompt specificity, making ParEval a more sensitive discriminator of model capability than HumanEval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Increasing prompt specificity systematically improves code generation accuracy
- Mechanism: Detailed prompts reduce ambiguity in problem specification, allowing models to correctly infer required behavior, edge-case handling, and implementation approach.
- Core assumption: Models possess sufficient domain knowledge but fail to retrieve or apply it correctly without explicit guidance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "performance improves consistently as prompts become more specific"
  - [section 4.3] "pass@1 steadily improves as prompt detail increases (i.e., higher rp or lower rs)"
  - [corpus] "DETAIL Matters" paper confirms similar findings for reasoning tasks, suggesting domain-general effect
- Break condition: When prompts exceed optimal verbosity (~200 words for HumanEval), performance may decline due to "cognitive overload" or redundancy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Task complexity determines the sensitivity of model performance to prompt detail
- Mechanism: Domain-specific tasks (parallel programming, scientific computing) require more specialized knowledge that must be explicitly provided, whereas general programming tasks rely on well-represented training data.
- Core assumption: The model's training distribution over-represents general Python tasks relative to specialized domains like OpenMP.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "models converge to their maximal-detail performance much more slowly on ParEval than on HumanEval"
  - [section 4.3] HumanEval plateaus at ~100 words; ParEval-OMP "never attains its ptop accuracy" even at 200 words
  - [corpus] Weak/missing—no corpus papers directly address domain-specific prompt sensitivity
- Break condition: If a specialized domain is well-represented in training data, specificity gains may mirror general benchmarks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Specific prompt components—I/O specifications, edge-case handling, stepwise breakdowns—are disproportionately impactful
- Mechanism: These elements explicitly constrain the solution space, reducing the model's need to guess implicit requirements.
- Core assumption: Models can correctly implement well-specified components but struggle with underspecified aspects.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Qualitative analysis shows that explicit input/output specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise breakdowns are the most impactful prompt details"
  - [section 5] Themes 1.3, 1.4, 2.3, 3.4 "significantly rose in prominence at higher word limits" and correlate with higher pass@1
  - [corpus] "Prompt Engineering and Framework" paper similarly finds structured templates improve code reliability
- Break condition: For tasks where implementation is straightforward but algorithmic insight is hard, strategy specification (theme 3.1) may matter more.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: pass@1 metric**
  - Why needed here: The paper's entire evaluation framework measures performance via pass@1 (probability of correct solution in single attempt). Understanding this metric is essential to interpret all results.
  - Quick check question: If a model achieves 0.8 pass@1 on a benchmark with 100 problems, approximately how many problems did it solve correctly?

- **Concept: Partial order over prompts**
  - Why needed here: The core innovation is ordering prompts by specificity (pbot < ptop), not just comparing two conditions. This requires understanding poset structure.
  - Quick check question: Given three prompts where A is more specific than B, and C is more specific than B, can you determine whether A is more specific than C?

- **Concept: Code generation benchmarks (HumanEval vs. ParEval)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central claim depends on contrasting performance on saturated vs. unsaturated benchmarks. You must understand why HumanEval is "easy" for frontier models.
  - Quick check question: Why would a benchmark of 164 Python functions achieve ~90% pass@1 on frontier models while a parallel computing benchmark achieves only ~67%?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Source benchmark -> Max detail prompt generator -> Augmentation strategies -> Evaluation harness -> Qualitative taxonomy annotator

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate p_top for each problem (requires reference solution + GPT-4.1)
  2. Verify p_top achieves ≥0.8 pass@1 (may need manual editing for hard domains)
  3. Apply three augmentation strategies to derive intermediate prompts
  4. Run evaluation across all models and prompts (greedy decoding, temperature=0)
  5. Plot performance curves and analyze which prompt components correlate with gains

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LLM summarization vs. paragraph sampling: Summarization produces coherent but potentially hallucinated abridgments; sampling preserves original text but may fragment coherence
  - Word limit granularity: Fewer checkpoints reduces compute but may miss non-monotonic performance changes
  - Taxonomy annotation via LLM: Scalable but may reflect annotator model's biases; manual verification recommended for subset

- **Failure signatures:**
  - p_top fails to reach 0.8 pass@1 → model lacks domain knowledge (not prompt issue)
  - Performance decreases with more specificity → potential prompt contamination or overload
  - Large variance across paragraph sampling runs → prompt components have high interaction effects

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate Figure 3 for a single model on HumanEval: generate p_top, create summaries at 10/25/50/100/200 words, plot pass@1 curve to verify monotonic improvement
  2. Apply the same pipeline to a domain-specific benchmark (e.g., data science, bioinformatics) to test whether ParEval's slow saturation generalizes
  3. Ablate individual taxonomy themes: generate prompts with I/O specs but no edge-case handling, and vice versa, to quantify relative contribution of each component

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do individual prompt taxonomy themes (e.g., edge-case handling, I/O specs) quantitatively contribute to code generation accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 5 that "Future work could involve targeted ablation studies to quantify the impact of each identified theme individually, thereby confirming and further refining these recommendations."
- Why unresolved: The current analysis relies on aggregated LLM-generated summaries and co-occurrence frequencies rather than controlled isolation of specific variables.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled ablation experiments where only a single theme (e.g., explicit I/O specification) is added or removed from a constant prompt baseline to measure the isolated delta in pass@1.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the relationship between prompt specificity and performance hold for low-resource programming languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section notes the experiments used only high-resource languages (Python, C++) and states, "Investigating how PARTIAL ORDER EVAL performance curves vary for low-resource languages is future work."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if low-resource languages require significantly more prompt detail to compensate for weaker pre-training data, or if the "saturation point" differs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the PARTIAL ORDER EVAL framework to benchmarks translated into low-resource languages (e.g., using MultiPL-E) and comparing the slope and saturation of the resulting performance curves.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do alternative prompt augmentation strategies interact differently with specific model architectures or training regimes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section states, "Alternative strategies might interact differently with model architectures or training regimes, and could yield distinct model performance versus sensitivity profiles."
- Why unresolved: The study tested only three augmentation methods; it remains unconfirmed whether the observed monotonic improvement is universal or an artifact of the specific summarization/masking techniques used.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing the current augmentation pipeline against alternative methods (e.g., human-authored detail gradients or paraphrasing) across a diverse set of model architectures.

## Limitations
- Manual editing of 25/120 ParEval prompts introduces potential experimenter bias
- Domain-specific performance saturation on ParEval may reflect model architecture limitations rather than prompt quality
- The paper does not test for prompt "overfitting" where excessive detail may introduce noise or hallucinated constraints

## Confidence
- High confidence: The monotonic improvement of pass@1 with prompt specificity on HumanEval is well-supported by the experimental design and results
- Medium confidence: The claim that ParEval is more sensitive to model capability than HumanEval relies on correct interpretation of saturation curves but conflates task difficulty with model knowledge gaps
- Medium confidence: The qualitative analysis identifying I/O specifications and edge-case handling as most impactful components is reasonable but could reflect annotator model bias

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the core HumanEval experiments with a held-out test set of prompts to verify that the ptop generation process doesn't leak solution information into the prompt
2. Conduct ablation studies removing specific taxonomy components (I/O specs, edge cases, stepwise breakdowns) to quantify their independent contributions to performance gains
3. Test whether ParEval's slow saturation is due to domain knowledge gaps by training or fine-tuning models on parallel programming tasks and re-running the specificity experiments
