# ActiNet: Activity intensity classification of wrist-worn accelerometers using self-supervised deep learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01712
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01712
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: ActiNet achieves mean macro F1 score of 0.82 and Cohen's kappa of 0.86, outperforming baseline random forest + HMM model (F1: 0.77, kappa: 0.81) on wrist-worn accelerometer data.

## Executive Summary
ActiNet introduces a self-supervised deep learning approach for classifying activity intensity from wrist-worn accelerometer data. The model uses an 18-layer modified ResNet-V2 pre-trained via self-supervised learning to extract features, followed by Hidden Markov Model (HMM) smoothing for temporal consistency. Evaluated on the CAPTURE-24 dataset using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, ActiNet achieved a mean macro F1 score of 0.82 and Cohen's kappa of 0.86, outperforming a baseline random forest + HMM model. The improvement was consistent across age and sex subgroups, with ActiNet showing better alignment with ground-truth activity composition, particularly for sleep and moderate-vigorous activity.

## Method Summary
ActiNet processes 30-second windows of triaxial accelerometer data (900 x 3 input) through an 18-layer modified ResNet-V2 pre-trained via self-supervised learning on the "arrow of time" classification task using UK Biobank data. The pre-trained weights are frozen and used as a feature extractor, with the final fully connected layer fine-tuned on the CAPTURE-24 dataset using Adam optimizer with inverse class weighting. A Hidden Markov Model is then applied for temporal smoothing using Viterbi decoding, with post-hoc sleep correction requiring minimum 1-hour blocks. The model is evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation with nested 20% holdout for HMM emission estimation.

## Key Results
- ActiNet achieved macro F1 score of 0.82 and Cohen's kappa of 0.86, outperforming baseline RF+HMM (F1: 0.77, kappa: 0.81)
- Improvement consistent across age and sex subgroups with minimal standard deviation in performance metrics
- ActiNet showed better alignment with ground-truth activity composition, particularly for sleep and moderate-vigorous activity
- Strong performance demonstrated on external validation datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Self-supervised pre-training creates separable feature space
The model uses an "arrow of time" classification task on unlabelled data, forcing the ResNet to learn temporal dynamics and physical constraints of movement. These learned representations capture subtle variance between activities that standard statistical features miss.

### Mechanism 2: HMM smoothing enforces physiological realism
The HMM layer introduces transition probability matrices, reducing "jitter" by penalizing unlikely sequences and enforcing biologically plausible state transitions between the 30-second window-based predictions.

### Mechanism 3: Frozen SSL weights prevent overfitting
By freezing the pre-trained backbone and only training the final fully connected layer, the model retains general kinematic knowledge learned from 100k participants while adapting the feature-to-label mapping for the specific 4-class intensity task.

## Foundational Learning

**1D Convolutions (Conv1D) for Time Series**: ActiNet uses 1D convolutions to process triaxial accelerometer signals. Quick check: How does a 1D kernel sliding over a 3-axis accelerometer signal differ from a 2D kernel on an image?

**Class Imbalance Handling (Inverse Weighting)**: The dataset is heavily skewed (only 5% moderate-vigorous activity). Quick check: Why would "accuracy" be a misleading metric if the model simply guessed "Sedentary" for every data point?

**Transfer Learning (Feature Extraction vs. Fine-tuning)**: The architecture relies on "frozen" weights from a source domain applied to a target domain. Quick check: In ActiNet, are the convolutional weights updated during the training on CAPTURE-24?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Pre-processing (Low-pass filter → Non-wear removal → Calibration) → Windowing → ResNet Inference → HMM Smoothing → Sleep Block Correction

**Critical path**: The raw accelerometer signal flows through preprocessing filters, is windowed into 30-second segments, processed by the frozen ResNet backbone to extract 1024-dimensional features, classified by a fully connected layer, smoothed by HMM using Viterbi decoding, and corrected for sleep block fragmentation.

**Design tradeoffs**: The authors chose to freeze the backbone to preserve SSL features and reduce overfitting risk on small data (n=151), sacrificing potential marginal gains from full fine-tuning. The 30-second window size reduces computational load and matches HMM granularity but may blur short-burst activities.

**Failure signatures**: "Jitter" from incorrect HMM parameters causing rapid oscillation between classes, sleep fragmentation without the 1-hour block correction, and device calibration drift destroying intensity classification if stationary periods don't equal 1g.

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Reproduce the reported 0.82 F1 score by running the provided pipeline on CAPTURE-24 fold definitions
2. Bypass the HMM layer and compare raw softmax outputs against HMM-smoothed labels to quantify smoothing contribution
3. Extract 1024-dimensional vectors for "Sleep" and "Sedentary" windows and plot using t-SNE to verify SSL features provide greater variance for separating these classes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can advanced sequence models like LSTMs or transformers outperform the current HMM smoothing approach? The authors note this would require much more training data than was available.

**Open Question 2**: Does ActiNet's improved accuracy lead to stronger statistical associations between physical activity behaviors and health outcomes compared to the baseline model? The paper doesn't validate this claim through actual health outcome data.

**Open Question 3**: How does ActiNet perform in populations with diverse demographics and task types beyond the Oxfordshire area? The authors identify lack of diversity in training data as a limiting factor.

## Limitations
- The paper doesn't empirically validate whether fine-tuning the backbone would improve results, potentially leaving performance gains unrealized
- Manual corrections to HMM transition probabilities are described but not quantitatively justified
- While external validation is mentioned, specific datasets and detailed performance metrics beyond CAPTURE-24 are not provided

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The methodology is detailed and reproducible with appropriate 5-fold stratified group cross-validation design. The improvement over baseline is statistically significant and consistent across subgroups.

**Medium Confidence**: The superiority of self-supervised features over traditional features is demonstrated through baseline comparison, but direct comparison to other deep learning approaches is lacking.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about utility for large-scale epidemiological studies lack validation through actual deployment or demonstration of computational efficiency at scale.

## Next Checks

1. Compare frozen SSL features against fine-tuned ResNet features on CAPTURE-24 to quantify the exact contribution of SSL pre-training
2. Systematically vary HMM transition probability matrix parameters to determine sensitivity of final performance metrics
3. Test ActiNet on a population with different demographic characteristics from CAPTURE-24 to assess generalization of SSL features
