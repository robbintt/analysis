# Is Sequence Information All You Need for Bayesian Optimization of Antibodies?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24933
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24933
- Authors: Sebastian W. Ober; Calvin McCarter; Aniruddh Raghu; Yucen Lily Li; Alan N. Amin; Andrew Wilson; Hunter Elliott
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Sequence-only methods with BLOSUM embeddings outperform structure-based approaches for antibody affinity optimization, and adding a protein language model soft constraint makes sequence methods match or exceed structure-based performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether structural information is necessary for Bayesian optimization of antibody properties by comparing sequence-only methods against structure-based approaches. The authors evaluate one-hot, BLOSUM, and ESM-2 embeddings against predicted alpha-carbon coordinates from IgFold for optimizing binding affinity and thermostability. They also propose a novel protein language model "soft constraint" to guide exploration toward likely sequences. The key finding is that sequence-only methods, particularly when enhanced with the soft constraint, can match or exceed structure-based performance, suggesting structural information may not be necessary for optimal antibody optimization in low-data regimes.

## Method Summary
The authors employ Bayesian optimization to optimize antibody properties using both sequence-only and structure-based approaches. Sequence representations include one-hot encoding, BLOSUM matrices, and ESM-2 embeddings, while structure-based methods use alpha-carbon coordinates predicted by IgFold. A novel protein language model soft constraint is introduced to bias the optimization toward biologically plausible sequences. The framework is evaluated on two antibody property datasets: binding affinity (279 sequences) and thermostability (160 sequences), with performance measured across multiple acquisition functions and iteration budgets.

## Key Results
- For binding affinity optimization, sequence-only methods with BLOSUM embeddings outperform structure-based approaches, while structure methods show better early-iteration data efficiency
- Kermut, a composite kernel model, excels for thermostability optimization
- When incorporating the language model soft constraint, sequence-only methods match or exceed structure-based performance
- Structure-based methods do not surpass peak performance of sequence-only approaches even with full structural information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of sequence-only methods stems from the ability of learned representations like BLOSUM to capture evolutionary relationships and functional constraints without explicit structural information. The protein language model soft constraint works by incorporating prior knowledge about likely antibody sequences, effectively regularizing the optimization space toward biologically feasible regions. This approach reduces the search space complexity while maintaining the ability to discover novel, high-performing sequences that may differ structurally from known antibodies but share functional properties.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Sequential model-based optimization for expensive-to-evaluate functions; needed to efficiently search the antibody sequence space with limited experimental capacity; quick check: acquisition functions balance exploration/exploitation
- **Protein Sequence Embeddings**: Vector representations that capture evolutionary and functional relationships; needed to transform discrete amino acid sequences into continuous optimization space; quick check: embedding dimensionality and learned features
- **Gaussian Process Kernels**: Covariance functions defining similarity between sequences; needed to model complex, non-linear relationships in antibody properties; quick check: kernel choice affects optimization landscape
- **Alpha-carbon Coordinates**: 3D structural information from protein backbones; needed for structure-based optimization approaches; quick check: prediction accuracy of structural models
- **Language Model Soft Constraints**: Regularization using learned sequence distributions; needed to guide optimization toward biologically plausible regions; quick check: constraint strength affects exploration vs exploitation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input sequences → Embeddings (one-hot/BLOSUM/ESM-2/IgFold) → Gaussian Process → Acquisition Function → New sequence proposal → Soft constraint (optional) → Loop

**Critical Path:** Sequence encoding → Kernel computation → GP posterior update → Acquisition maximization → Sequence proposal → (Optional) soft constraint application

**Design Tradeoffs:** Sequence-only methods offer computational efficiency and scalability but may miss structure-function relationships; structure-based methods provide physical intuition but depend on prediction accuracy and are computationally expensive; soft constraints add prior knowledge but require careful tuning to avoid over-constraining exploration.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor optimization performance may indicate inadequate kernel choice for the specific antibody property, insufficient soft constraint strength leading to unrealistic sequences, or structural prediction errors in IgFold affecting structure-based methods.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare acquisition function performance (EI vs UCB) on the affinity dataset with BLOSUM embeddings
2. Test soft constraint strength sensitivity on a small sequence subset before full optimization
3. Validate structural prediction accuracy of IgFold on known antibody structures from the dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Entirely in silico without experimental validation of predicted antibody improvements
- Relatively small datasets (279 sequences for affinity, 160 for thermostability) may limit generalizability
- Structural predictions from IgFold introduce potential noise affecting structure-based method performance
- BLOSUM embeddings may miss context-dependent evolutionary relationships present in antibody sequences

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Sequence-only methods with soft constraints can match or exceed structure-based performance consistently across experimental conditions

**Medium confidence**: Specific ranking of sequence representation methods (BLOSUM > ESM-2 > one-hot) as dataset-dependent and property-specific

**Medium confidence**: Claim that structural information is unnecessary for optimal performance, given structure-based methods show better early-data efficiency

## Next Checks

1. Conduct wet-lab validation of top-performing antibody variants from both sequence-only and structure-based optimization pipelines to verify predicted affinity and thermostability improvements

2. Test the optimization framework on a larger, more diverse antibody dataset (minimum 1000 sequences) to assess scalability and robustness across different antibody targets and properties

3. Evaluate the soft constraint approach with alternative protein language models beyond ESM-2 to determine whether the observed benefits generalize across different sequence embedding architectures
