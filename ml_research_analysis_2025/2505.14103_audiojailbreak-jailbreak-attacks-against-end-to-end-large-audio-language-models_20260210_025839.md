# AudioJailbreak: Jailbreak Attacks against End-to-End Large Audio-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.14103
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14103
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Up to 100% attack success rate against 10 LALMs in weak adversary scenarios

## Executive Summary
AudioJailbreak introduces a novel approach to jailbreaking end-to-end large audio-language models (LALMs) through adversarial audio suffix generation. The method operates in both strong (full prompt control) and weak (unknown user prompts) adversary settings, achieving universal effectiveness across multiple models. By leveraging multi-prompt optimization and various stealth techniques including benign audio content, sound effects, and music, the attack maintains high success rates while remaining difficult to detect. The approach also incorporates reverberation modeling to ensure effectiveness when audio is played over the air, successfully transferring to proprietary models like GPT-4o-Audio.

## Method Summary
AudioJailbreak generates adversarial audio perturbations by optimizing suffix additions that trigger safety bypasses in LALMs. The attack operates in two adversary settings: strong (where the adversary controls the prompt) and weak (where the user prompt is unknown). For universality, the method employs multi-prompt optimization across diverse benign audio samples. Stealthiness is achieved through various transformations including integration with benign audio, sound effects, music, and audio speeding-up techniques. Over-the-air robustness is ensured through reverberation modeling that simulates real-world audio playback environments. The approach is evaluated across 10 different LALMs, demonstrating effectiveness even in challenging weak adversary scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 100% attack success rate in weak adversary scenarios against 10 LALMs
- Maintains effectiveness when audio is played over the air through reverberation modeling
- Successfully transfers attacks to proprietary models including GPT-4o-Audio

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AudioJailbreak exploits the vulnerability of LALMs to adversarial audio suffixes that manipulate the model's understanding of prompts. By carefully crafting audio perturbations that append to benign audio, the attack bypasses safety guardrails without requiring knowledge of the user's original prompt. The multi-prompt optimization ensures the attack works universally across different audio inputs, while stealth techniques make the adversarial content appear benign to human listeners. The reverberation modeling accounts for real-world audio transmission effects, maintaining attack effectiveness in practical scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Adversarial audio suffix generation**: Creates targeted perturbations that manipulate model interpretation of audio prompts; needed for jailbreaking LALMs without prompt knowledge
- **Multi-prompt optimization**: Trains attacks across diverse audio samples to ensure universal effectiveness; needed to work with arbitrary user inputs
- **Reverberation modeling**: Simulates acoustic effects of audio playback in real environments; needed for over-the-air attack robustness
- **Weak adversary setting**: Operates without knowledge of user prompts; needed for practical attack scenarios where prompt content is unknown
- **Strong adversary setting**: Controls the entire prompt; provides baseline for comparing attack effectiveness under ideal conditions
- **Transferability to proprietary models**: Tests attack effectiveness on black-box models like GPT-4o-Audio; validates practical applicability

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Benign Audio -> Adversarial Suffix Generator -> Stealth Transformation -> Reverberation Modeling -> LALM Input
**Critical Path**: The adversarial suffix generation and optimization process is the core attack mechanism, with stealth transformations and reverberation modeling as essential enablers for practical effectiveness
**Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing attack strength with stealthiness, universality across prompts versus optimization complexity, and over-the-air robustness versus computational requirements
**Failure Signatures**: Reduced attack success when reverberation modeling is inaccurate, limited effectiveness across diverse audio types, or detection of adversarial content through audio analysis
**First Experiments**:
1. Test adversarial suffix generation on a single LALM with known prompts in controlled environment
2. Evaluate stealth transformation effectiveness using human perceptual tests
3. Validate over-the-air robustness through controlled playback experiments in different room acoustics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited validation across languages and cultural contexts, primarily focusing on English
- Reverberation model assumptions may not generalize to all real-world acoustic environments
- Transferability tested only on GPT-4o-Audio, with broader black-box transfer untested
- Potential bias in benign audio selection process affecting attack generalizability

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in core methodology and controlled environment attack success rates
- **Medium confidence** in over-the-air robustness claims due to reverberation model assumptions
- **Medium confidence** in transferability results with limited model testing

## Next Checks
1. Test attack effectiveness across multiple languages and cultural contexts using diverse prompt datasets
2. Evaluate over-the-air performance in varied acoustic environments beyond modeled reverberation assumptions
3. Assess black-box transferability to broader range of proprietary LALMs beyond GPT-4o-Audio
