# Knowledge Distillation from Large Language Models for Household Energy Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.03034
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03034
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Demonstrates LLM capability to generate culturally nuanced, behavior-specific household energy consumption data across six countries via a four-stage knowledge distillation pipeline.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to household energy modeling that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic, culturally sensitive energy consumption data across diverse geographies. The framework employs a four-stage pipeline to synthesize family structures, weather patterns, and hourly energy usage profiles that reflect cultural and climatic diversity. By distilling knowledge from LLMs rather than relying on real household data, the method enables more accurate load forecasting and policy design while addressing privacy concerns.

## Method Summary
The method implements a four-stage pipeline: Stage 1 generates family structures for five types per country; Stage 2 produces seasonal min/max weather ranges; Stage 3 synthesizes 24-hour weather profiles or uses external TMY data via pvlib; Stage 4 assigns hourly activities and energy consumption values to each family member, integrating HVAC responses to weather conditions. The approach uses structured prompting to extract sociodemographic norms and physical relationships from LLM training distributions, creating synthetic datasets that preserve behavioral realism without requiring private household data.

## Key Results
- Three of five tested LLMs consistently delivered robust outputs, with larger models showing superior stability
- LLM-generated weather data closely matched external meteorological datasets in quality, with physical constraints effectively bounding anomalies
- The resulting synthetic datasets enable more accurate load forecasting, policy design, and energy optimization across six countries (USA, Japan, India, Sweden, UAE, Brazil)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs encode sufficient domain knowledge to synthesize culturally coherent family structures and energy consumption patterns without access to private data.
- Mechanism: Knowledge distillation through structured prompting extracts memorized sociodemographic norms (e.g., family types, daily routines) and physical relationships (e.g., weather parameters) from the LLM's training distribution into structured JSON/text, creating synthetic datasets that preserve behavioral realism without requiring real household data.
- Core assumption: The LLM's pre-trained corpus contains accurate, representative information about cultural practices and energy usage patterns across the target geographies.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We propose integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in energy modeling to generate realistic, culturally sensitive, and behavior-specific data for household energy usage across diverse geographies."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Constrained generation via iterative prompt refinement can produce physically plausible synthetic weather data.
- Mechanism: A two-stage weather generation pipeline with explicit prompt constraints (e.g., "diffuse solar radiation must remain below direct solar radiation," "peak temperature at 2-4 PM") forces the LLM to sample from physically realistic regions of its learned distribution.
- Core assumption: LLMs have internalized sufficient meteorological relationships from training data to produce coherent hourly sequences when properly guided.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.4] "The system prompt guided the LLM to vary meteorological conditions realistically throughout each 24-hour period..."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs can integrate behavioral, environmental, and appliance-level factors into coherent energy consumption profiles.
- Mechanism: Stage 4 combines family structures and weather data via structured prompts that assign hourly activities to each family member and HVAC operations, simultaneously reasoning about individual schedules, shared activities, and heating/cooling loads responding to weather conditions.
- Core assumption: The LLM can maintain consistency across multiple entities and time steps within a single generation, correctly modeling dependencies between occupancy, activity, and environmental load.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.5] "The system prompt highlighted the importance of cultural, seasonal, and weekday/weekend-specific contexts..."

## Foundational Learning

### Knowledge Distillation in LLMs
- Why needed: The entire framework relies on extracting structured, domain-specific knowledge from general-purpose LLMs into usable datasets.
- Quick check: Can you explain why "prompt engineering" is necessary for knowledge distillation, and what might happen if prompts lack domain-specific constraints?

### Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) Data
- Why needed: The paper proposes using external TMY data as an alternative to LLM-generated weather, requiring understanding of what TMY represents.
- Quick check: What is a Typical Meteorological Year dataset, and why might it provide more physically consistent inputs than LLM-generated weather?

### Household Energy Signatures
- Why needed: The paper uses energy signatures (consumption vs. temperature plots) as a validation tool, showing how behavioral and climatic factors manifest in load profiles.
- Quick check: How would you expect an energy signature to differ between a well-insulated home and a poorly insulated home in the same climate?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Stage 1 (Family Generation) → LLM → JSON family structures (5 types/country)
Stage 2 (Weather Ranges) → LLM → Min/max ranges for temperature, humidity, solar, wind
Stage 3 (Weather Synthesis) → LLM → 24-hour CSV weather profiles
Alternative (External Weather): pvlib + latitude/longitude → TMY data → CSV
Stage 4 (Energy Patterns): Stage 1 families + (Stage 3 OR External Weather) → LLM → 24-hour activity/HVAC profiles → Aggregation → Yearly profiles

### Critical path:
1. Define target countries, seasons, and select LLM
2. Execute Stage 1 once per model (family structures are reused)
3. Choose weather path: (a) LLM Stages 2-3, or (b) External TMY via pvlib
4. Run Stage 4 for each family × season × weekday/weekend combination
5. Aggregate daily profiles into yearly datasets with country-specific holidays

### Design tradeoffs:
- **LLM vs. External Weather**: LLM-generated weather enables rapid prototyping for data-scarce regions but may contain physical inconsistencies; External TMY guarantees physical consistency but requires reliable external data
- **Model Selection**: Larger models provide more stable, context-rich outputs but incur higher latency and token costs; smaller models are faster but may miss nuanced cultural details
- **Stage Coupling**: Tight coupling between weather and energy patterns improves realism but amplifies errors from earlier stages; decoupling (using TMY) reduces error propagation but may limit end-to-end cultural adaptation

### Failure signatures:
- Incomplete outputs: QwQ-32B-Preview and DeepSeek-R1 frequently return partial responses in Stages 3-4; implement retry logic with timeout handling
- Physical anomalies: Solar radiation exceeds 1000 W/m², temperature peaks at wrong hours; add post-hoc validation rules
- Activity inconsistencies: Family members assigned contradictory simultaneous activities; requires prompt refinement or multi-pass generation
- Token limit exhaustion: Stage 4 generates lengthy structured outputs; monitor completion tokens and truncate or chunk requests

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Reproduce family structures for one country (e.g., India) using two different LLMs**: Compare output diversity, cultural accuracy, and JSON validity to assess model sensitivity
2. **Generate weather data for one season/location using both LLM and TMY paths**: Compare solar radiation profiles, temperature-humidity relationships, and physical plausibility to quantify the LLM-external gap
3. **Produce energy consumption profiles for a single family type across two seasons (Winter/Summer)**: Validate that HVAC loads respond appropriately to weather differences and that weekday/weekend patterns reflect cultural norms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the integration of granular socio-economic variables (e.g., income, appliance ownership) alter the accuracy of generated energy signatures compared to the current demographic-only approach?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion explicitly states that "Incorporating additional cultural parameters, such as socio-economic factors, would provide deeper insights... and improve cultural sensitivity."
- **Why unresolved**: The current methodology generates profiles based on family structure and broad cultural norms but abstracts economic constraints that heavily influence appliance usage and HVAC set-points in real households.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A comparative analysis where generated profiles with and without socio-economic prompts are statistically validated against ground-truth survey datasets (e.g., EIA RECS data) for the same demographics.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Do the absolute energy consumption values (kWh) assigned by LLMs to specific activities correlate with empirical measurements, or do they exhibit statistical drift from physical reality?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] Section 3.6 notes that matching consumption values for joint activities might be "oversights" rather than intentional allocations, and Section 4 validates weather against TMY but validates energy only visually/qualitatively against CityLearn trends.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper focuses on the plausibility and shape of consumption patterns rather than verifying the absolute magnitude of synthesized loads against real smart meter data.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A quantitative error analysis comparing the probability distributions of LLM-generated hourly loads against actual metered data for matching family types and countries.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can this framework be adapted for real-time control simulations where agents must react to dynamic variables (e.g., price spikes, grid faults) rather than generating static historical profiles?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion identifies "enabling real-time simulations to dynamically respond to changes like sudden weather shifts" as a priority for future work to aid disaster response.
- **Why unresolved**: The current four-stage methodology is a batch-generation pipeline that produces static yearly CSVs, lacking the feedback loops necessary for agent-based real-time decision making.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A modified architecture where the LLM receives state updates (time, weather, price) and outputs immediate actions, demonstrating low-enough latency and logical consistency for grid simulation.

## Limitations
- Reliance on LLM training distributions creates uncertainty about cultural accuracy for underrepresented geographies or subcultures
- Physical inconsistencies in LLM-generated weather require manual intervention and prompt refinement
- Evaluation methodology lacks quantitative validation metrics, relying instead on qualitative assessment

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: LLM capability to generate culturally nuanced family structures and integrate weather with energy consumption patterns
- **Medium confidence**: Physical plausibility of LLM-generated weather data (constrained by prompt engineering but lacking quantitative validation metrics)
- **Medium confidence**: Scalability across six diverse countries (methodological framework demonstrated but country-specific cultural accuracy unverified)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-validation of cultural accuracy**: Implement a survey-based validation with domain experts from each target country to assess the realism and cultural appropriateness of generated family structures and consumption patterns against ground truth behavioral norms
2. **Quantitative weather validation**: Compare LLM-generated weather against high-resolution meteorological station data (not just TMY) using statistical metrics (RMSE, correlation coefficients) for temperature, solar radiation, and humidity to establish physical consistency benchmarks
3. **Robustness testing with complex scenarios**: Generate datasets for families with 10+ members and locations with extreme or rapidly changing weather patterns to evaluate LLM coherence maintenance and identify failure thresholds in the knowledge distillation pipeline
