# Multi-task Domain Adaptation for Computation Offloading in Edge-intelligence Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.07585
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07585
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: MTDA achieves superior performance compared to benchmarks in MEC offloading under domain shifts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Multi-Task Domain Adaptation (MTDA) for computation offloading in multi-access edge computing systems where target environments differ significantly from source training data. The approach uses a teacher-student architecture enabling online adaptation without accessing source domain data during inference, preserving privacy and reducing computational overhead. MTDA employs a multi-task learning framework to simultaneously optimize binary offloading decisions and resource allocation. Experimental results show MTDA outperforms benchmark methods in both mean squared error and accuracy, particularly as user count increases, demonstrating better scalability across varying server computing resources and data volumes.

## Method Summary
The method trains a multi-task neural network offline on labeled source data (solving MINLP via GEKKO), then adapts online using a teacher-student framework. The student learns from pseudo-labels generated by a weight-averaged teacher model, with both undergoing stochastic recovery to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The approach jointly optimizes binary offloading decisions (classification) and resource allocation ratios (regression) through shared hidden layers, making it suitable for MEC environments with dynamic network conditions and privacy constraints.

## Key Results
- MTDA achieves superior performance compared to benchmark methods (MTFNN, DDPG, COTTA) in terms of mean squared error and accuracy
- Performance advantage increases with user count, showing better scalability
- Maintains lower system costs across varying server computing resources and data volumes
- Demonstrates effectiveness for practical deployment in MEC environments with dynamic network conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Teacher-Student Pseudo-labeling for Source-Free Adaptation
The teacher-student architecture enables online domain adaptation without accessing source domain data during inference. A weight-averaged teacher model generates pseudo-labels from augmented target-domain inputs; the student model minimizes a combined loss against these pseudo-labels; the teacher is then updated via exponential moving average of student parameters. The core assumption is that pseudo-labels from the teacher remain sufficiently accurate under distribution shift to supervise student learning without ground-truth labels.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Task Joint Optimization for Coupled Decisions
Simultaneously learning binary offloading decisions (classification) and resource allocation ratios (regression) improves generalization over treating them independently. Shared hidden layers encode user/environment features; task-specific heads output classification and regression results; total loss enables gradient sharing across tasks. The core assumption is that classification and regression tasks share underlying representations about system state that benefit from joint learning.

### Mechanism 3: Stochastic Recovery for Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation
Periodic stochastic resetting of student weights to source model values reduces error accumulation during continuous self-training. At each step, a Bernoulli mask selects which weight elements reset, partially retaining useful prior knowledge from the source pre-trained model. The core assumption is that source knowledge should be partially preserved even as the model adapts to target domains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Domain Adaptation (Test-Time Adaptation)**
  - Why needed: Network conditions change (data volume, server resources), causing distribution shift between source training and target deployment environments
  - Quick check: Can you explain why a model trained on [0, 500 kbits] data volumes might fail on [600, 700 kbits] inputs?

- **Semi-Supervised Learning with Pseudo-labels**
  - Why needed: Target domain data is unlabeled (privacy/constraints), so the model must generate its own supervision via teacher predictions
  - Quick check: What happens to student learning if teacher pseudo-labels have >30% error rate?

- **Multi-Task Learning (Hard Parameter Sharing)**
  - Why needed: Offloading requires both discrete decisions (offload/local) and continuous allocations (resource fraction), which are coupled
  - Quick check: Why might sharing hidden layers between classification and regression improve over separate models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (user/environment parameters) -> Shared backbone (dense hidden layers) -> Heads (classification + regression) -> Teacher (EMA copy) -> Student (gradient update) -> EMA sync -> Stochastic recovery
- **Critical path**: Offline training on source data → Initialize teacher/student with pre-trained model → Online adaptation loop: augment input → teacher predicts → student updates → teacher EMA sync → stochastic recovery
- **Design tradeoffs**: Higher EMA decay β provides more stable teacher but slower adaptation; higher recovery probability p prevents forgetting but reduces plasticity; loss weights balance classification vs. regression priority
- **Failure signatures**: Student loss divergence indicates poor pseudo-label quality; low classification accuracy plateau suggests label imbalance or insufficient model capacity; regression MSE spikes indicate normalization issues
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline transfer: run source model on target without adaptation to measure shift magnitude; 2) Ablation on stochastic recovery: compare p ∈ {0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5} on fixed shift scenario; 3) Sensitivity to user count N: test N ∈ {3, 5, 10} with fixed resources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How does MTDA perform in large-scale environments with significant variations in the number of Mobile Users and dynamic network conditions?
2. Can the proposed MTDA framework be effectively transferred to distinct application areas such as autonomous systems or smart cities?
3. How does the single-server assumption impact the model's optimality in multi-server MEC environments requiring server selection?

## Limitations
- Architecture specifics (layer sizes, activation functions) are not provided, making exact replication impossible
- Hyperparameter values (loss weights, EMA decay, learning rate, stochastic recovery probability) are unspecified
- Input augmentation strategy is vaguely described without implementation details
- Teacher-student architecture effectiveness is claimed but lacks ablation studies isolating this effect

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Need for domain adaptation in MEC offloading; multi-task learning formulation for coupled decisions
- **Medium confidence**: Teacher-student architecture effectiveness for source-free adaptation (weak corpus support)
- **Low confidence**: Specific values and effectiveness of stochastic recovery mechanism; exact contribution of each MTDA component

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study**: Remove teacher-student component and run with only offline multi-task model to quantify adaptation benefit
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: Systematically vary EMA decay β, recovery probability p, and loss weights to identify stable operating regions
3. **Architecture scaling test**: Vary number of hidden layers and neurons to determine minimum viable architecture for target performance
