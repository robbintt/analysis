# Convergence Analysis of the Lion Optimizer in Centralized and Distributed Settings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.12327
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12327
- Authors: Wei Jiang; Lijun Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Establishes convergence rates for Lion optimizer in centralized and distributed settings with improved rates using variance reduction and 1-bit compression variants

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive convergence analysis of the Lion optimizer and its variants in both centralized and distributed settings. The authors establish that the standard Lion optimizer achieves a convergence rate of O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4}) in the centralized setting, which can be improved to O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3}) using variance reduction techniques. In distributed settings, the proposed methods maintain similar convergence rates while introducing communication-efficient variants that achieve 1-bit sign compression in both communication directions.

The key contribution is achieving these results under standard assumptions without requiring the coerciveness or bounded heterogeneity conditions typically needed in previous works. The paper analyzes both standard and variance-reduced versions of Lion, providing theoretical guarantees for their performance in different optimization scenarios.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes the convergence properties of the Lion optimizer through theoretical analysis. The authors establish convergence rates for both centralized and distributed settings by examining the algorithm's behavior under standard assumptions. They introduce variance reduction techniques to improve the convergence rate from O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4}) to O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3}) in centralized settings. For distributed settings, they propose communication-efficient variants that maintain similar convergence properties while reducing communication overhead through 1-bit sign compression. The analysis considers both synchronous and decentralized communication patterns, with parameter settings of η=Θ(T^{-1/2}) and γ=Θ(T^{-1}) throughout the theoretical derivations.

## Key Results
- Standard Lion optimizer achieves O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4}) convergence rate in centralized setting
- Variance reduction techniques improve convergence to O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3})
- Distributed variants maintain O(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4}) and O(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3}) rates
- 1-bit compression variants achieve O(max{d^{1/4}/T^{1/4}, d^{1/10}/(n^{1/5}T^{1/5})}) rates
- Results obtained under standard assumptions without coerciveness or bounded heterogeneity conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- Non-convex optimization theory: Understanding convergence rates for first-order methods in non-convex settings is essential for analyzing optimizer performance
- Variance reduction techniques: These methods help reduce the stochastic noise in gradient estimates, improving convergence rates
- Distributed optimization: Key for understanding how optimization algorithms perform when data is partitioned across multiple nodes
- Communication-efficient optimization: Important for practical deployment where communication overhead is a bottleneck
- 1-bit compression: Reduces communication cost by transmitting only the sign of gradients or updates
- Theoretical analysis of gradient methods: Provides the mathematical framework for establishing convergence guarantees

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User objective function -> Lion optimizer updates -> Parameter server or distributed nodes -> Convergence monitoring

Critical path: Loss computation → Gradient calculation → Lion update rule (with momentum and weight decay) → Parameter synchronization (centralized) or averaging (distributed) → Convergence check

Design tradeoffs: The paper balances between convergence speed and communication efficiency. Standard Lion offers good convergence but requires full-precision communication. The 1-bit compression variants sacrifice some convergence speed for significantly reduced communication overhead. Variance reduction improves convergence rates but adds computational overhead.

Failure signatures: If the step size η or weight decay γ are not properly scaled with T, the theoretical convergence guarantees may not hold. In distributed settings, slow convergence could indicate improper parameter scaling or insufficient communication frequency.

First experiments:
1. Implement the basic Lion optimizer and verify O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4}) convergence rate on standard non-convex test functions
2. Add variance reduction technique and confirm the improved O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3}) rate
3. Test the 1-bit compression variant to validate the theoretical communication efficiency claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies on specific parameter settings (η=Θ(T^{-1/2}), γ=Θ(T^{-1})) which may not be optimal in practice
- Distributed setting analysis assumes the same parameter scaling as centralized case, which may not hold in practice
- Communication-efficient variants achieve slower rates than full-precision versions, though with reduced communication overhead

## Confidence
- High confidence: The O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4}) convergence rate for standard Lion optimizer in centralized setting
- Medium confidence: The improved O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3}) rate using variance reduction techniques
- Medium confidence: The distributed setting convergence rates maintaining similar dependencies on d and T
- Medium confidence: The 1-bit compression variants achieving O(d^{1/4}/T^{1/4}) rates

## Next Checks
1. Implement the variance reduction technique and verify the improved convergence rate experimentally
2. Test the communication-efficient variants with 1-bit compression on real distributed systems to validate the theoretical guarantees
3. Compare the practical performance of the proposed methods against existing optimizers under various parameter settings beyond the theoretical assumptions
