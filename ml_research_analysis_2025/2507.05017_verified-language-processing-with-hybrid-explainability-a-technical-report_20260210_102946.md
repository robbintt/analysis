# Verified Language Processing with Hybrid Explainability: A Technical Report

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.05017
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05017
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LaSSI achieves perfect 1.00 accuracy on logical sentence-pair classification, outperforming transformer models below 0.40

## Executive Summary
LaSSI introduces a hybrid explainability pipeline that overcomes the fundamental inability of pre-trained language models to capture logical entailment, inconsistency, and indifference between factoid sentences. By combining syntactic analysis, multi-word entity recognition, and Montague Grammar-based logical rewriting, LaSSI produces human- and machine-readable First-Order Logic representations with superior explainability. The approach uses classical Boolean semantics and paraconsistent reasoning to calculate confidence scores that correctly distinguish between implication (1.0), inconsistency (0.0), and indifference (intermediate values), achieving perfect classification accuracy across three controlled datasets.

## Method Summary
LaSSI is a symbolic NLP pipeline that converts text to First-Order Logic (FOL) through Universal Dependencies parsing and Montague Grammar. It employs a "Parmenides" Upper Ontology for semantic rewriting and computes confidence scores using Boolean-valued classical semantics over possible worlds. The pipeline consists of three phases: an a priori phase for generating Multi-Word Entity Unit DataBase (meuDB) annotations, an ad hoc phase for creating Intermediate Graphs and FOL representations, and an ex post phase for calculating confidence scores between sentence pairs. Unlike transformer-based approaches relying on vector embeddings and symmetric similarity metrics, LaSSI uses classical Boolean semantics and paraconsistent reasoning to distinguish logical relationships.

## Key Results
- LaSSI achieves perfect classification accuracy (1.00) across three controlled datasets testing logical connectives, sentence structure, and spatiotemporal reasoning
- State-of-the-art models like DeBERTaV2+AMR-LDA and ColBERTv2 score below 0.40 on the same tasks
- LaSSI provides superior explainability through direct logical trace visualization, avoiding the need for separate black-box explainers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LaSSI works by explicitly representing logical relationships through symbolic reasoning rather than statistical pattern learning. The pipeline converts natural language into First-Order Logic using syntactic analysis, entity recognition, and Montague Grammar rewriting, enabling precise calculation of logical entailment, inconsistency, and indifference through classical Boolean semantics. By avoiding vector embeddings and symmetric similarity metrics, it correctly distinguishes between implication (1.0), inconsistency (0.0), and indifference (intermediate values) using paraconsistent reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Montague Grammar**: A formal system for mapping natural language syntax to logical representations. Needed for generating semantically accurate FOL from parsed sentences. Quick check: Verify generated FOL correctly captures quantifier scope in "Every student read some book."
- **Paraconsistent Reasoning**: A logical framework that allows reasoning with contradictions without triggering explosion. Needed to handle inconsistent sentence pairs without invalidating the entire inference system. Quick check: Test system's response to clearly contradictory statements like "John is tall. John is not tall."
- **Universal Dependencies**: A cross-linguistic syntactic annotation framework. Needed for consistent syntactic parsing across languages. Quick check: Ensure dependency trees correctly identify subject-verb-object relationships in simple sentences.
- **Upper Ontology**: A foundational vocabulary for semantic relationships. Needed to provide context for logical rewriting and entity disambiguation. Quick check: Verify entity type classification works for "Paris" as city vs. person.
- **Multi-Word Entity Recognition**: Fuzzy matching of compound terms across databases. Needed for accurate entity linking in complex phrases. Quick check: Test recognition of "New York City" as single entity vs. separate tokens.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Stanza Parser -> UD Kernel -> Intermediate Graph -> Logical Sentence Analysis -> FOL Representation -> Confidence Calculation

**Critical Path:**
Stanza parsing → UD kernel generation → Intermediate graph creation → Logical rewriting via Parmenides ontology → FOL generation → Confidence score calculation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
LaSSI trades computational efficiency for logical precision and explainability. While transformer models offer faster inference through learned embeddings, LaSSI provides interpretable logical traces and correct handling of logical relationships through explicit reasoning. The exponential complexity of truth table generation limits scalability but ensures semantic accuracy.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Incorrect kernel generation from parser errors (e.g., misidentifying adjectives as verbs)
- Exponential runtime in truth table generation for longer sentences
- Ontology-related failures when semantic rewriting rules cannot be applied
- Entity recognition failures when meuDB fuzzy matching returns incorrect results

**First Experiments:**
1. Run pipeline on simple subject-verb-object sentences to verify basic parsing and FOL generation
2. Test entity recognition on multi-word terms using provided meuDB to ensure fuzzy matching works
3. Calculate confidence scores between clearly entailing sentence pairs to verify correct 1.0 classification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1: Scalability on Real-World Data**
Can LaSSI maintain high accuracy and acceptable latency when processing large-scale, noisy, real-world crawled data? The authors acknowledge this is unknown, as current results rely on controlled, short factoid sentences. The pipeline currently struggles with bottlenecks in meuDB generation and lemmatization that may not scale linearly. Evidence needed: Performance benchmarks on noisy corpora demonstrating linear time complexity and sustained F1 scores.

**Open Question 2: Integrating Learning with Paraconsistency**
Can abductive reasoning and relational learning be integrated into the pipeline to generalize rules without triggering the "principle of explosion"? The authors note this might be risky as it could lead to explosion problems. The current system relies on hardcoded declarative rules to ensure logical soundness, while introducing learned rules from "dirty data" risks introducing contradictions that invalidate the paraconsistent reasoning mechanism. Evidence needed: A learning module that generates new logical functions while preserving the isolation of contradictions within the paraconsistent framework.

**Open Question 3: Context-Sensitive Query Languages**
Can a context-sensitive query language be formalized to automate the deep semantic rewriting steps currently hardcoded in the pipeline? The paper concludes that deep semantic rewriting cannot be encompassed by latest GQL standards and requires the definition of a context-sensitive query language, which is currently missing. Existing Graph Query Languages (GQL) are context-free and cannot handle the necessary semantic context required for the logical sentence analysis phase. Evidence needed: The formulation of a grammar capable of expressing the context-dependent rewriting rules currently implemented in Python.

## Limitations
- Dependency on external "Parmenides" Upper Ontology and pre-compiled meuDB database, which are not fully specified in the paper
- Exponential time complexity in truth table generation limits scalability for longer sentences
- Perfect accuracy (1.00) achieved only on controlled synthetic datasets, may not generalize to real-world data
- Reliance on Stanford CoreNLP introduces parser errors that can propagate through the entire pipeline

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core pipeline architecture (UD parsing → Intermediate Graph → FOL via Montague Grammar) is well-defined and reproducible with the provided repository and datasets.

**Medium Confidence:** The classification accuracy results (1.00) are reproducible on the specific OSF datasets provided, but their generalizability to more complex or noisy natural language is uncertain.

**Low Confidence:** The ontological semantics (Parmenides) and the efficiency of the meuDB fuzzy-matching system are critical for correct function rewriting but are not fully specified, making the pipeline's complete functionality difficult to guarantee without access to the exact versions.

## Next Checks

1. **Ontology and Entity Database Verification:** Confirm the presence and load the "Parmenides" Upper Ontology and the pre-compiled meuDB JSON file from the repository. Test the entity recognition and semantic rewriting components on a small set of sample sentences to ensure they are functioning as intended before scaling up.

2. **Parser Robustness Testing:** Systematically test the Stanford CoreNLP parsing step on sentences known to have caused failures in the paper (e.g., sentences with ambiguous words like "tailed"). Compare the generated intermediate graphs to the expected structure to identify and diagnose parsing errors.

3. **Scalability Assessment:** Measure the runtime of the `ex post` phase (truth table generation) on progressively longer sentences. Establish a clear threshold for sentence length beyond which the computational cost becomes prohibitive, and document the observed exponential growth in processing time.
