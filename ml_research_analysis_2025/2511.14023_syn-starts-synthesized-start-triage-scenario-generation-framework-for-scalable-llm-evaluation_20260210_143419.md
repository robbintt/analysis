# Syn-STARTS: Synthesized START Triage Scenario Generation Framework for Scalable LLM Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.14023
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14023
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Synthetic triage cases are qualitatively indistinguishable from expert-authored benchmarks and yield evaluation results strongly correlated with real data

## Executive Summary
Syn-STARTS presents a framework that uses LLMs to generate synthetic triage cases for evaluating LLM performance in mass casualty incidents. The framework employs a generation-and-validation pipeline to produce cases with ground-truth tags, vitals, and narratives that are qualitatively indistinguishable from expert-authored benchmarks. The study demonstrates that model performance on synthetic data strongly correlates with performance on the expert-authored TRIAGE dataset (Pearson's r=0.92, p<0.01), validating synthetic data as a scalable alternative for LLM evaluation in critical medical scenarios.

## Method Summary
The Syn-STARTS framework generates synthetic triage cases through a three-stage pipeline: generation using Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct to create cases with patient information, vitals, and narrative descriptions; validation where a second LLM acts as a medical expert to verify clinical consistency and generate ground-truth tags; and synthetic dataset creation by aggregating validated cases. The framework produces cases with consistent clinical logic, realistic vital signs, and medically plausible narratives. Ground-truth tags are generated through expert validation rather than direct extraction, ensuring alignment with clinical reasoning. The synthetic dataset is then used to evaluate multiple LLM models across triage tasks, with performance compared against an expert-authored benchmark dataset.

## Key Results
- Medical experts found synthetic cases qualitatively indistinguishable from real cases (8 sampled cases)
- Model performance on synthetic data strongly correlates with expert-authored TRIAGE dataset (Pearson's r=0.92, p<0.01)
- Larger synthetic datasets yield more stable evaluations and reveal model-specific error patterns
- Performance ranking across models remains consistent between synthetic and real datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages LLMs' ability to generate coherent, contextually consistent medical scenarios by using a structured generation pipeline that ensures clinical accuracy through validation. The synthetic data generation captures the variability and complexity of real-world triage scenarios while maintaining controlled experimental conditions. The correlation between synthetic and real dataset performance validates that LLMs can reliably simulate the task environment they are being evaluated on.

## Foundational Learning
- START Triage Protocol (why needed: Core medical standard being evaluated; quick check: Understand color-coded priority system)
- LLM-as-a-judge methodology (why needed: Validation mechanism for synthetic data; quick check: How LLM validation compares to human expert validation)
- Synthetic data generation for evaluation (why needed: Scalable alternative to human-authored benchmarks; quick check: When synthetic correlates with real performance)
- Mass casualty incident assessment (why needed: Context for triage decisions; quick check: Typical scenarios and constraints)
- Performance correlation metrics (why needed: Validate synthetic benchmark quality; quick check: Understanding Pearson correlation and p-values)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Generator LLM -> Validation LLM -> Ground-truth tagging -> Synthetic dataset creation

Critical path: Case generation → Medical expert validation → Ground-truth tag assignment → Performance evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Synthetic data offers scalability and cost-efficiency versus human-authored benchmarks, but requires careful validation to ensure clinical accuracy and avoid LLM biases.

Failure signatures: Poor correlation with real data indicates synthetic generation issues; expert rejection of synthetic cases suggests validation failures; inconsistent vitals or narratives reveal generation pipeline problems.

First experiments:
1. Generate a small batch of synthetic cases and run expert validation to establish baseline quality
2. Compare model performance on synthetic vs. real data for a single model to verify correlation
3. Test synthetic data scalability by generating datasets of varying sizes and measuring evaluation stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Does patient demographic information (age, sex) or narrative style (emotional tone, communication style) systematically bias LLM triage decisions independent of clinical data?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly identify investigating "algorithmic fairness and bias" as "a key future direction," including both traditional demographic biases and "narrative bias" where "an LLM's clinical judgment is disproportionately influenced by a patient's emotional state or communication style, independent of their primary clinical data."
- Why unresolved: The current Syn-STARTS framework does not systematically control for or test these bias dimensions; the validation pipeline ensures clinical consistency but not demographic or stylistic variation effects on model predictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments using Syn-STARTS to generate cases with systematically varied demographics and narrative styles while holding vitals constant, then measuring whether LLM triage accuracy varies across these non-clinical dimensions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the synthetic benchmark generation approach scale to dynamic, interconnected mass casualty incident scenarios where patient outcomes depend on shared environmental context?
- Basis in paper: The authors state their evaluation was "limited to static and contextually independent cases" and that "real-world MCIs present a fundamentally different context where patients emerge from a single, evolving incident and are interconnected within that shared environment." They explicitly call for "development of new frameworks capable of modeling the dynamic and context-rich environment characteristic of actual MCIs."
- Why unresolved: Syn-STARTS generates isolated cases; it does not model scene-level factors, resource constraints evolving over time, or patient interdependencies that characterize actual MCIs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of an extended framework that generates coherent multi-patient scenarios with shared incident context, demonstrating that LLM performance on interconnected cases correlates with real-world or simulated MCI performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of generator LLM and prompt design systematically affect the quality, diversity, and evaluation fidelity of synthetic medical benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge that "the application and expansion of the Syn-STARTS concept require the selection of the generator LLM and the precise design of prompts used within the framework" and explicitly designate these as "critical areas for future research."
- Why unresolved: The current study uses only Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct with a fixed prompt template; no systematic comparison of generator models or prompt engineering strategies was conducted.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing synthetic datasets generated by different LLMs and prompt variants, measuring downstream effects on linguistic diversity, expert perceptual realism scores, and evaluation correlation with expert-authored benchmarks.

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on LLM capabilities, which may introduce subtle biases not captured in expert evaluation
- Expert validation sample size was relatively small (8 cases), potentially missing edge cases
- Focuses on static, independent cases rather than dynamic, interconnected MCI scenarios
- Does not systematically test for demographic or narrative biases in LLM decision-making

## Confidence
High: Correlation results (r=0.92, p<0.01) and qualitative indistinguishability findings
Medium: Generalizability across different triage contexts
Low: Long-term model performance stability and temporal bias effects

## Next Checks
1. Conduct blinded expert evaluation of a larger, diverse set of synthetic cases (minimum 50 cases) to verify consistent quality across varied trauma scenarios and patient demographics
2. Test model performance transfer by evaluating on synthetic data from multiple LLM generators and comparing against real-world triage outcomes from actual MCIs
3. Implement temporal validation by generating synthetic cases over multiple time periods and assessing model performance stability across these cohorts, particularly focusing on potential temporal biases in synthetic data generation
