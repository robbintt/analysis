# Robust Yield Curve Estimation for Mortgage Bonds Using Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21347
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21347
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Neural network framework delivers more robust and stable yield curve estimates for Swedish mortgage bonds compared to Nelson-Siegel-Svensson and Kernel-Ridge methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a neural network-based framework for yield curve estimation specifically designed for small mortgage bond markets where data is limited and noisy. The approach estimates yield curves independently for each day using a novel loss function that enforces both smoothness and stability. The method is particularly valuable for markets with limited liquidity where traditional parametric approaches like Nelson-Siegel-Svensson struggle with robustness. The framework also allows integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance smoothness and accuracy.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework uses a single-layer neural network with three neurons and atanh activation to estimate yield curves independently for each day. The key innovation is a new loss function that combines traditional goodness-of-fit measures with regularization terms enforcing smoothness and stability. Hyperparameters were tuned to achieve a learning rate of 10^-8, 1000 epochs, and penalty weights γ1=10^3 and γ2=10^4. The model was tested on Swedish mortgage bond data and compared against Nelson-Siegel-Svensson and Kernel-Ridge methods across multiple performance metrics including robustness to outliers, price perturbations, and stability over time.

## Key Results
- Superior robustness to outliers and price perturbations with lower RMSE curve and MAD compared to NSS and KR methods
- Consistently higher hit rates (>90%) for stable yield curve estimates across different maturities over a one-year period
- Produces smoother curves while maintaining reasonable economic relationships with benchmark rates, though with slight trade-offs in yield estimation accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The neural network framework works by learning flexible yield curve representations that can adapt to the specific characteristics of small mortgage bond markets. The single-layer architecture with three neurons provides sufficient flexibility while avoiding overfitting to noisy data. The atanh activation function enables smooth curve fitting, while the custom loss function with smoothness and stability penalties ensures the estimated curves are both economically meaningful and robust to data perturbations. By estimating curves independently for each day, the model can capture day-to-day variations without being constrained by parametric assumptions that may not hold in illiquid markets.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Yield Curve Estimation** - The process of deriving zero-coupon yield curves from observed market prices of bonds
   - Why needed: Essential for pricing fixed-income securities, risk management, and monetary policy analysis
   - Quick check: Verify that the estimated curve is monotonically increasing and economically sensible

2. **Neural Network Architecture for Financial Data** - Using simplified neural networks for financial modeling when data is limited
   - Why needed: Traditional deep learning approaches may overfit when training data is scarce
   - Quick check: Confirm that model complexity matches data availability to prevent overfitting

3. **Custom Loss Functions with Regularization** - Designing loss functions that incorporate domain-specific constraints
   - Why needed: Standard loss functions may not capture the smoothness and stability requirements of yield curves
   - Quick check: Ensure regularization weights balance smoothness against fit quality appropriately

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Prices -> Neural Network (3 neurons, atanh) -> Daily Yield Curve -> Regularized Loss Function -> Output

Critical Path: The core workflow processes daily bond prices through the neural network to produce yield curves, which are then evaluated using the custom loss function that combines fit accuracy with smoothness and stability penalties.

Design Tradeoffs: The single-layer architecture with three neurons represents a deliberate choice to balance flexibility with robustness in small markets. While deeper networks might capture more complex patterns, they risk overfitting to noisy mortgage bond data. The atanh activation provides smooth transitions compared to ReLU, better matching yield curve behavior.

Failure Signatures: Poor hyperparameter tuning (learning rate too high, regularization weights imbalanced) can lead to either overfitting (noisy curves) or underfitting (oversmoothed curves). The model may struggle with extreme outliers if the regularization is too weak, or miss important curve features if too strong.

First Experiments:
1. Test sensitivity to learning rate by running with 10^-6, 10^-7, and 10^-8 to observe convergence behavior
2. Vary regularization weights γ1 and γ2 across an order of magnitude to assess smoothness-accuracy trade-off
3. Compare daily versus rolling-window estimation approaches to evaluate independence assumption

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single-layer neural network with only three neurons may not capture complex yield curve dynamics in larger or more liquid markets
- Performance demonstrated only on Swedish mortgage bonds, raising generalizability concerns to other markets or asset classes
- Hyperparameter tuning appears limited, with specific values potentially overfitted to the Swedish dataset

## Confidence
- High confidence in neural network's superior robustness to outliers and price perturbations compared to NSS and KR methods
- Medium confidence in claimed stability improvements over a year due to limited evaluation methodology details
- Medium confidence in smoothness-accuracy trade-off conclusions given limited comparison scope
- Low confidence in generalizability beyond Swedish mortgage bond market without further testing

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on yield curve data from at least two other countries/mortgage markets to assess cross-market robustness and generalizability
2. Implement a more extensive hyperparameter search with cross-validation to verify sensitivity of results to chosen parameters
3. Compare computational efficiency and training time against traditional methods across different dataset sizes to evaluate practical implementation considerations
