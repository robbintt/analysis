# Catoni-Style Change Point Detection for Regret Minimization in Non-Stationary Heavy-Tailed Bandits

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.20051
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20051
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Robust-CPD-UCB achieves nearly optimal regret bounds in non-stationary heavy-tailed bandits using Catoni-style change-point detection

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses regret minimization in non-stationary multi-armed bandits where reward distributions have heavy tails and potentially infinite variance, a setting common in finance and telecommunications. The authors propose Robust-CPD-UCB, an algorithm that combines a novel Catoni-style change-point detection strategy with optimistic algorithms for bandits. The method uses confidence sequence-based approaches to detect distribution changes in heavy-tailed settings where traditional change-point detection methods fail. Theoretical analysis shows the algorithm achieves nearly optimal regret bounds matching the lower bound of O((KΥ)^(ϵ/(1+ϵ))(vT)^(1/(1+ϵ))).

## Method Summary
The proposed Robust-CPD-UCB algorithm combines change-point detection with optimistic bandit algorithms. It uses a Catoni-style estimator to handle heavy-tailed rewards and maintains confidence sequences to detect when arm distributions change. The algorithm operates by first detecting change points using a novel Catoni-based approach, then switching to an appropriate optimistic algorithm when changes are detected. The theoretical framework leverages concentration inequalities for (1+ϵ)-th moments to establish regret bounds that account for both the number of arms K, breakpoints Υ, and the moment bound v. The algorithm's performance is validated through experiments on both synthetic data and real-world cryptocurrency datasets.

## Key Results
- Robust-CPD-UCB achieves nearly optimal regret bounds of O((KΥ)^(ϵ/(1+ϵ))(vT)^(1/(1+ϵ)))
- Superior empirical performance compared to Sliding Window UCB and Monitored UCB on synthetic and cryptocurrency data
- Robust behavior in highly non-stationary environments with frequent changes
- Theoretical guarantees match the established lower bound for this problem setting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by leveraging Catoni-style estimators that are robust to heavy-tailed distributions, allowing accurate estimation even when variance is infinite or undefined. The change-point detection mechanism uses confidence sequences to monitor when arm distributions shift, triggering switches to optimistic algorithms that can adapt to new distributions. This combination addresses the fundamental challenge of detecting changes in settings where traditional methods based on second-moment concentration fail due to heavy tails.

## Foundational Learning
- **Heavy-tailed distributions and (1+ϵ)-th moment conditions** - needed for modeling real-world scenarios like financial returns; quick check: verify moment existence for target applications
- **Catoni estimators and robust statistics** - needed to handle outliers and infinite variance; quick check: compare Catoni vs empirical mean under heavy-tailed samples
- **Change-point detection with confidence sequences** - needed for online adaptation to distribution shifts; quick check: false positive rate under stationarity
- **Regret minimization in non-stationary bandits** - needed to bound performance loss from switching; quick check: compare regret under known vs unknown change points
- **Optimistic algorithms for bandits** - needed for efficient exploration after change detection; quick check: explore-exploit tradeoff in post-change phase

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Data streams -> Catoni estimators -> Confidence sequences -> Change-point detector -> Optimistic bandit algorithm -> Action selector
**Critical path:** Reward observation → Catoni statistic update → Confidence bound evaluation → Change-point decision → Algorithm switch → Arm selection
**Design tradeoffs:** Catoni robustness vs. statistical efficiency; detection delay vs. false positives; exploration bonus vs. exploitation in post-change phase
**Failure signatures:** High false positive rate in change detection → excessive algorithm switching; slow detection → regret accumulation; over-conservative exploration → suboptimal arm pulls
**First experiments:** 1) Synthetic heavy-tailed data with known change points to validate detection accuracy; 2) Stationary heavy-tailed environment to measure false positive rate; 3) Real-world cryptocurrency data to test practical performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges several open questions: the performance of the algorithm under gradual distribution drift versus discrete breakpoints remains unclear, as the analysis focuses on breakpoints rather than continuous shifts. The computational complexity of maintaining confidence sequences and change-point detection in high-dimensional settings requires further investigation. Additionally, the algorithm's sensitivity to estimation errors in the (1+ϵ)-th moment parameter v across different heavy-tailed distributions needs examination.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes access to exact (1+ϵ)-th absolute centered moments
- Performance in environments with gradual distribution drift is unclear
- Computational complexity of confidence sequences may be prohibitive in high-dimensional settings
- Limited empirical validation on real-world data beyond cryptocurrency applications

## Confidence
**High confidence:** Theoretical regret bounds under stated assumptions
**Medium confidence:** Empirical performance claims against baselines
**Medium confidence:** Applicability to real-world cryptocurrency data

## Next Checks
1. Test algorithm performance under varying levels of gradual distribution drift versus discrete breakpoints
2. Evaluate computational efficiency and memory requirements as the number of arms K scales to hundreds
3. Assess sensitivity to estimation errors in the (1+ϵ)-th moment parameter v across different heavy-tailed distributions
