# Does Language Model Understand Language?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.12459
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12459
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Compound-Beta achieves highest Pearson correlation (0.8307) in English and strong cross-lingual performance, while models generally struggle with negation and Bengali language pairs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PRECISE, a systematic evaluation framework, and LUCID, a multilingual dataset designed to assess language model understanding of fine-grained linguistic phenomena such as negation, tense, voice, and modality. The study compares several state-of-the-art models—Compound-Beta, Gemma2-9B, LLaMA-3.3-70B-Versatile, LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, and Mistral-SABA-24B—on English and Bengali sentence pairs. Performance is measured using standard metrics (Pearson/Spearman correlation, MAE) and a novel Human Calibration Envelope (HCE) accuracy, which captures alignment with human rating variability. Results show that Compound-Beta achieves the highest Pearson correlation in English (0.8307) and strong cross-lingual performance (HCE: 0.6290), while Gemma2-9B excels in English calibration (HCE: 0.7843). Models generally struggle with negation and Bengali language pairs, highlighting ongoing challenges in multilingual and nuanced linguistic understanding.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces PRECISE, a systematic evaluation framework that uses the LUCID dataset containing English and Bengali sentence pairs with linguistic phenomenon tags (negation, tense, voice, modality). Human annotators rate semantic similarity on a 1-10 scale, which is normalized to [0,1]. The study evaluates five SOTA LLMs (Mistral-SABA-24B, LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B-Versatile, Gemma2-9B, Compound-Beta) by prompting them to output similarity scores and explanations for each pair. Performance is measured using Pearson/Spearman correlation, MAE, Human Calibration Envelope (HCE) accuracy (whether prediction falls within ±1σ of human mean), and reasoning similarity via MiniLM-L6-v2 cosine similarity against ground-truth explanations.

## Key Results
- Compound-Beta achieves highest Pearson correlation in English (0.8307) but shows moderate HCE accuracy (0.6290)
- Gemma2-9B excels in English HCE accuracy (0.7843) despite not leading in Pearson correlation
- All models struggle significantly with negation pairs, with LLaMA-3.3-70B scoring only 0.0060 on reasoning quality
- Cross-lingual performance shows systematic calibration drift, with high Pearson but near-zero HCE in Bengali for some models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The Human Calibration Envelope (HCE) metric captures model alignment with human interpretive variability better than standard correlation metrics alone.
- **Mechanism:** HCE evaluates whether a model's prediction falls within one standard deviation (±σ) of the mean human rating. This binary classification treats human judgment as a distribution rather than a scalar ground truth, penalizing models that are confidently wrong or outliers relative to human consensus.
- **Core assumption:** Human disagreement (variance) is a meaningful feature of linguistic interpretation rather than noise to be discarded.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.1 defines the envelope E_i and HCE accuracy computation; abstract notes HCE captures "human-like tolerance for variability in language interpretation"; related work supports analyzing vector dimensions but lacks direct validation of distribution-aware metrics like HCE.
- **Break condition:** If human annotators exhibit low agreement (high variance) due to ambiguity rather than legitimate linguistic nuance, the "envelope" becomes too wide to meaningfully discriminate model quality.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Targeted stress-testing using minimal pairs (LUCID) exposes specific brittle points in model reasoning, particularly negation and cross-lingual transfer.
- **Mechanism:** By isolating linguistic phenomena (e.g., changing only tense or negation while holding structure constant), the framework forces the model to rely on semantic understanding rather than syntactic pattern matching. The low scores on "Negation-Affirmative" pairs indicate models fail to flip truth conditions when "not" is introduced.
- **Core assumption:** Failure on synthetic or curated minimal pairs generalizes to failure in organic, complex usage contexts.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract highlights "models generally struggle with negation and Bengali language pairs"; Table 2 shows reasoning quality for Negation dropping to near zero (e.g., 0.0060 for LLaMA-3.3) compared to other categories; "LLMs Struggle with NLI for Perfect Aspect" and "IMPACT" papers corroborate that models fail on specific, fine-grained linguistic probes.
- **Break condition:** If the synthetic sentence pairs lack ecological validity (e.g., they are unnatural), model failures might reflect training data distribution mismatches rather than a fundamental lack of reasoning capability.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Disagreement analysis reveals distinct calibration biases (overconfidence vs. conservatism) that are invisible to Pearson correlation.
- **Mechanism:** Mapping model predictions against human rating buckets (Strong/Medium/Weak) identifies how models fail. For instance, LLaMA models tended to classify weak human prompts as strong (overconfidence), while Gemma2-9B often underestimated medium prompts (conservatism).
- **Core assumption:** A model's error type (e.g., overconfidence) is a stable trait relevant to downstream deployment safety.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 4.3 details "Disagreement Matrices" showing LLaMA-4-Scout has 35.6% "Weak-Human/Strong-Model" disagreement; Gemma2-9B is noted for high HCE accuracy (0.7843), which aligns with the disagreement analysis showing it is better calibrated (if conservative); corpus neighbors focus on general linguistic struggles; they do not contradict this specific behavioral profiling.
- **Break condition:** If the binary threshold (Strong ≥ 8) used for disagreement analysis is too coarse, it may obscure calibration details in the "Medium" (5-7) range.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Semantic Similarity vs. Natural Language Inference (NLI)**
  - **Why needed here:** The LUCID dataset uses sentence pairs rated for similarity, but the linguistic challenges (negation, tense) overlap heavily with NLI (Entailment/Contradiction). Understanding the distinction helps interpret why a model might rate "She played" and "She is playing" as semantically close (same topic) despite them being logically distinct (temporal contradiction).
  - **Quick check question:** Does the model treat "She is playing chess" and "She is not playing chess" as low similarity (correct NLI logic) or high similarity (surface-level topic overlap)?

- **Concept: Distributional Calibration**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper introduces HCE, which relies on standard deviation. You must understand that a model can have high accuracy (mean) but poor calibration (variance/distribution alignment).
  - **Quick check question:** If a human rates a sentence 8 ± 1, and the model rates it 9.5, is the model "accurate" in terms of HCE? (Answer: No, if 9.5 > mean + σ).

- **Concept: Minimal Pair Testing**
  - **Why needed here:** The LUCID dataset methodology relies on changing one variable (tense, voice) at a time. This is the scientific control mechanism of the paper.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is it harder to debug a model on "She played chess" vs "The game was played by her" compared to "She played chess" vs "She did not play chess"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** LUCID Dataset (Sentence Pairs + Phenomenon Tags) -> SOTA LLMs (Prompted for similarity score + Explanation) -> Evaluation Layer (Correlation Metrics + HCE Accuracy + Reasoning Similarity)
- **Critical path:**
  1. **Data Curation:** Constructing/Loading LUCID pairs (ensure 70:30 English/Bengali split)
  2. **Inference:** Running prompts to get numerical scores (0-10) and text explanations
  3. **Enveloping:** Loading human stats (mean/sd) per pair to compute HCE
  4. **Disagreement Mapping:** Bucketing results into Strong/Medium/Weak matrices
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - HCE vs. Pearson: HCE prioritizes "human-like" behavior within a tolerance range; Pearson prioritizes strict linear ranking. Gemma-2 wins on HCE/English, Compound-Beta wins on Pearson/English—choose based on whether you need precision or calibrated safety.
  - Model Size: LLaMA-3.3-70B is large but struggles with Bengali HCE (0.0909); smaller models like Mistral-SABA (24B) show more balanced cross-lingual stability.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Negation Blindness: High similarity scores for pairs differing only by "not" (Table 2 low reasoning scores)
  - Cross-Lingual Collapse: High Pearson but near-zero HCE in Bengali (seen in LLaMA-3.3), indicating the model gets the general rank right but fails to match the specific scale of human judgment
  - Overconfidence: High "Weak-Human/Strong-Model" percentage in disagreement matrices (Figure 4)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Run Gemma2-9B on the English LUCID subset to verify if local inference replicates the paper's reported HCE (0.7843)
  2. **Negation Stress Test:** Isolate the "Negation-Affirmative" pairs. Compare model explanations for "Why are these different?" against the provided ground truth using a semantic similarity encoder
  3. **Language Transfer Check:** Take the English sentence pairs, translate them to a low-resource language not in the training set (if possible) or use the Bengali subset, and measure the drop in HCE vs. Pearson to check for calibration drift

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do models attend to the same lexical tokens as humans when making semantic similarity judgments, particularly for negation and temporal markers?
- Basis in paper: The authors state they "plan to incorporate explainability methods such as LIME, SHAP, and Integrated Gradients to probe whether the model's attention to lexical tokens corresponds with human-perceived semantic pivots."
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation metrics (correlation, MAE, HCE) measure output alignment but not internal attention patterns or reasoning pathways.
- What evidence would resolve it: Attention heatmaps or feature attribution scores showing whether models weight negation markers (e.g., "not," "never") and temporal indicators similarly to human annotators' stated reasoning.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can model output variance be calibrated to match human disagreement patterns, with lower variance on high-consensus items and higher variance on ambiguous inputs?
- Basis in paper: The authors propose exploring "uncertainty quantification by leveraging the inter-quartile range (IQR) of human ratings as a proxy for interpretive subjectivity."
- Why unresolved: Models currently produce point estimates without confidence intervals, and their internal uncertainty may not correlate with human interpretive difficulty.
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analysis between model output variance (across multiple sampling runs) and human rating IQR across sentence pairs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does negation understanding remain persistently poor across all evaluated models, even when other linguistic phenomena are handled well?
- Basis in paper: The paper reports "performance on negation remains notably poor (e.g., LLaMA-3.3-70B scores 0.0060)" and notes this "reinforces prior observations that negation understanding remains a persistent challenge for LLMs."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but does not investigate whether it stems from training data distribution, architectural limitations, or tokenization issues.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying negation token frequency in pretraining data, or probing whether negation tokens receive sufficient attention weight.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How well do models distinguish contrastive minimal pairs that differ only in subtle semantic dimensions (e.g., "She ate" vs. "She had eaten")?
- Basis in paper: The authors propose "constructing contrastive minimal pairs—prompt pairs that differ only in subtle semantic or syntactic dimensions" to "reveal sensitivity to temporal semantics."
- Why unresolved: Current LUCID dataset includes diverse phenomena but does not systematically isolate single-variable semantic shifts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Models appropriately ranking minimal pair similarity in alignment with human judgments, demonstrating true linguistic competence rather than surface-level pattern matching.

## Limitations

- The Human Calibration Envelope metric may conflate legitimate linguistic ambiguity with annotator confusion, particularly for complex phenomena like modality
- Cross-lingual generalization claims are limited by Bengali's relatively small representation (30% of pairs) in the dataset
- The reasoning similarity metric assumes semantic similarity between model and human explanations is a valid proxy for reasoning quality, potentially missing deeper logical or inferential failures

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The general finding that models struggle with negation (particularly Compound-Beta's strong performance on Pearson but weaker HCE) and Bengali pairs is robust across multiple metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: Cross-lingual performance patterns and the specific calibration biases (overconfidence vs. conservatism) require additional validation across different linguistic contexts
- **Low Confidence**: The Human Calibration Envelope's superiority over traditional metrics for deployment decisions needs broader validation beyond the LUCID dataset

## Next Checks

1. **Ecological Validity Test**: Evaluate the same models on naturalistic sentence pairs containing negation and tense variations from existing NLI or paraphrase datasets to determine if minimal pair failures generalize to real-world usage

2. **Annotation Agreement Analysis**: Compute inter-annotator agreement (e.g., Krippendorff's alpha) for each linguistic phenomenon category to distinguish between true human disagreement and annotation noise, particularly for Bengali pairs with low HCE scores

3. **Calibration Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the envelope threshold (±0.5σ, ±1.5σ, ±2σ) to determine if the reported HCE differences between models are robust to this parameter or merely artifacts of the chosen tolerance level
