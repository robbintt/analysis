# Deep Learning in Renewable Energy Forecasting: A Cross-Dataset Evaluation of Temporal and Spatial Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.03109
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03109
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: LSTM and MLP models achieved lowest RMSE values in renewable energy forecasting across Spanish hourly energy/weather data and photovoltaic panel outputs from 12 locations

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates seven deep learning models—LSTM, Stacked LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM, DNN, MLP, and Encoder-Decoder—for renewable energy forecasting across two distinct datasets. The models are tested across varying training/test ratios (0.2–0.5) and optimized using dimensionality reduction (PCA), feature selection (mutual information filtering), and regularization techniques. LSTM and MLP emerge as top performers with validation errors as low as 0.0376 and 0.1213 RMSE, respectively. The research emphasizes that effective model selection must be tailored to specific dataset characteristics and demonstrates that regularization techniques improve generalization while mitigating overfitting.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic evaluation framework across two datasets: Spanish hourly energy and weather data, and photovoltaic panel outputs from 12 geographic locations. Seven deep learning architectures are benchmarked under consistent conditions, with performance measured via RMSE across four different training/test split ratios (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5). Optimization techniques including PCA for dimensionality reduction, mutual information filtering for feature selection, and various regularization approaches are applied to enhance model performance and prevent overfitting. The comparative analysis provides insights into architecture-specific strengths and weaknesses for renewable energy forecasting tasks.

## Key Results
- LSTM and MLP models achieved the lowest RMSE values, with validation errors reaching 0.0376 and 0.1213 respectively
- Model performance varies significantly across different training/test ratios, with 0.3-0.4 splits generally providing optimal results
- Regularization techniques demonstrated effectiveness in improving generalization and preventing overfitting across all evaluated architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of temporal models like LSTM and hybrid architectures in renewable energy forecasting stems from their ability to capture sequential dependencies and temporal patterns inherent in energy production and consumption data. LSTM's gated recurrent structure effectively handles the vanishing gradient problem while maintaining long-term dependencies, crucial for capturing seasonal and diurnal patterns in renewable energy systems. The MLP's strength lies in its universal function approximation capabilities, making it well-suited for modeling complex nonlinear relationships between weather variables and energy output. CNN-based models excel at spatial feature extraction from gridded weather data, while hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures combine spatial and temporal learning capabilities. The study's optimization pipeline—combining feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and regularization—addresses the high-dimensionality and multicollinearity common in meteorological and energy datasets, enabling more robust model training and improved generalization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal dependency modeling**: Required for capturing sequential patterns in energy data; quick check: verify model performance on synthetic sequences with known temporal structures
- **Feature selection and dimensionality reduction**: Critical for handling high-dimensional meteorological data; quick check: compare model performance with and without PCA/mutual information filtering
- **Regularization techniques**: Essential for preventing overfitting in deep networks; quick check: monitor validation loss during training to detect overfitting patterns
- **Cross-dataset generalization**: Fundamental for ensuring model robustness across different geographic regions; quick check: evaluate models on held-out locations or time periods
- **RMSE interpretation**: Standard metric for forecasting accuracy; quick check: convert RMSE to percentage error for domain-relevant context
- **Architecture-specific hyperparameter tuning**: Crucial for optimizing each model type's performance; quick check: conduct systematic grid searches for key hyperparameters

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Data → Preprocessing (Normalization, PCA, Feature Selection) → Model Architecture → Training (with Regularization) → Validation (RMSE Evaluation) → Comparison

**Critical Path**: Data Preparation → Model Selection → Hyperparameter Optimization → Performance Evaluation → Generalization Assessment

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study balances model complexity against generalization capability, with deeper architectures (Stacked LSTM, CNN-LSTM) offering potential performance gains at increased risk of overfitting. Temporal models (LSTM variants) trade computational efficiency for superior sequential pattern capture, while CNNs provide spatial feature extraction capabilities. The choice between model depth and regularization strength represents a fundamental tradeoff in preventing overfitting while maintaining predictive power.

**Failure Signatures**: Overfitting manifests as decreasing training error coupled with increasing validation error, particularly evident in deeper architectures without adequate regularization. Poor generalization appears as significant performance degradation when applied to new geographic locations or time periods. Model underperformance may indicate insufficient capacity to capture complex temporal or spatial patterns, or inappropriate feature selection that removes critical predictive variables.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline evaluation: Train each model architecture without optimization techniques to establish performance floors
2. Feature importance analysis: Remove individual features using mutual information scores to identify critical predictors
3. Regularization ablation: Compare model performance across different regularization strengths to identify optimal balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Limited scope of model architectures tested, excluding newer approaches like Transformers and attention-based models
- Reliance on only two specific datasets raises concerns about generalizability to other geographic regions and renewable energy sources
- Use of RMSE as primary metric may not fully capture practical forecasting implications for grid management
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter choices remains unclear due to limited ablation studies

## Confidence

| Claim Cluster | Confidence Level |
| --- | --- |
| Comparative performance of LSTM and MLP models | High |
| Model selection should be tailored to dataset characteristics | Medium |
| Regularization improves generalization and prevents overfitting | Low |

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate top-performing LSTM and MLP models on at least three additional datasets from different geographic regions and renewable energy sources to assess robustness and generalizability
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Conduct systematic grid searches or Bayesian optimization for key hyperparameters (learning rate, regularization strength, network depth) to determine stability of reported performance metrics
3. **Alternative metric evaluation**: Implement additional performance metrics such as MASE, CRPS, and economic impact measures to provide comprehensive assessment of model utility in real-world grid management scenarios
