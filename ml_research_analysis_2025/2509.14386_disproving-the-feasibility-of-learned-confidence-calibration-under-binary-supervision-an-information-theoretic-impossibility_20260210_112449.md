# Disproving the Feasibility of Learned Confidence Calibration Under Binary Supervision: An Information-Theoretic Impossibility

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.14386
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14386
- **Authors**: Arjun S. Nair; Kristina P. Sinaga
- **Reference count**: 37
- **Key outcome**: Proves impossibility of learned post-hoc confidence calibration under binary supervision via information-theoretic bounds

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility result showing that learned post-hoc confidence calibration cannot succeed under binary supervision conditions. The authors use information-theoretic arguments to demonstrate that the mutual information between true confidence and predicted confidence is bounded above by the mutual information between the binary label and the model's predicted probability. This bound fundamentally limits the achievable calibration performance when only binary labels are available during training.

The theoretical framework proves that no post-hoc calibration method can overcome this information bottleneck, making the impossibility universal across all possible calibration techniques. This challenges the widespread assumption that post-hoc calibration is always feasible and suggests that confidence calibration requires either different supervision signals or fundamentally different approaches than those currently employed.

## Method Summary
The authors develop their impossibility result through a rigorous information-theoretic framework. They begin by establishing the information bottleneck between binary labels and continuous confidence scores, then derive upper bounds on the mutual information between true and predicted confidences. The core mechanism involves showing that the conditional entropy of true confidence given predicted confidence is lower bounded by the conditional entropy of true confidence given the binary label.

The analysis assumes a standard binary classification setup where models output probabilities but only binary labels are available for supervision. By applying Fano's inequality and properties of mutual information, they derive tight bounds that apply to any post-hoc calibration method operating under these conditions. The proof structure systematically eliminates potential workarounds by showing that any calibration scheme must respect these fundamental information-theoretic constraints.

## Key Results
- Proves post-hoc confidence calibration is impossible under binary supervision through information-theoretic bounds
- Shows mutual information between true and predicted confidence is bounded by mutual information between binary label and predicted probability
- Establishes that no post-hoc calibration method can overcome this fundamental information bottleneck

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The impossibility result stems from the fundamental information-theoretic constraint that binary labels contain insufficient information to recover the continuous confidence distribution. When a model outputs a probability score, the binary label provides only a thresholded version of this information, discarding the magnitude information needed for proper calibration. The mutual information framework captures this information loss mathematically, proving that no function can reconstruct what was never present in the supervision signal.

## Foundational Learning
- **Information theory basics** (why needed: foundation for mutual information bounds; quick check: understand entropy and mutual information definitions)
- **Fano's inequality** (why needed: key tool for deriving lower bounds on conditional entropy; quick check: can apply Fano's inequality to simple binary problems)
- **Post-hoc calibration methods** (why needed: understand what approaches are being ruled out; quick check: know how Platt scaling and isotonic regression work)
- **Mutual information properties** (why needed: understand chain rule and bounds used in proofs; quick check: manipulate mutual information expressions)
- **Binary classification setup** (why needed: understand the problem constraints; quick check: distinguish between probability outputs and binary labels)

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Binary label supervision -> Model probability outputs -> Post-hoc calibration function -> Calibrated confidence scores

**Critical path**: The theoretical proof flow follows: define information measures → apply Fano's inequality → derive upper bounds → establish impossibility

**Design tradeoffs**: The paper contrasts the theoretical impossibility with practical calibration success, highlighting that empirical methods may appear to work due to: 1) distribution-specific effects not captured by worst-case bounds, 2) overfitting to training data that happens to align with test distribution, 3) evaluation metrics that don't capture the fundamental information loss

**Failure signatures**: Any post-hoc calibration method will exhibit: 1) systematic miscalibration on out-of-distribution data, 2) inability to correct for class-conditional probability distortions, 3) performance degradation as the gap between true and predicted confidence distributions increases

**First experiments**: 
1. Verify mutual information bounds empirically across different noise models and datasets
2. Test calibration performance limits predicted by theory against actual calibration methods
3. Extend analysis to multi-class scenarios to check if impossibility generalizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges several important open questions:
- How do these theoretical bounds relate to empirical calibration performance in practice?
- Can alternative supervision signals (beyond binary labels) enable effective post-hoc calibration?
- Do the impossibility results extend to multi-class classification scenarios?
- What are the practical implications for model deployment when calibration is critical?

## Limitations
- Binary classification focus limits applicability to multi-class or continuous prediction scenarios
- Theoretical bounds may not be tight for practical distributions, making results overly pessimistic
- Assumes idealized noise models that may not reflect real-world data complexities

## Confidence
- **Theoretical framework**: High - rigorous information-theoretic proofs
- **Practical applicability**: Medium - depends on whether real-world conditions satisfy theoretical assumptions
- **Generality of results**: Medium - binary classification focus limits broader conclusions
- **Empirical validation**: Low - primarily theoretical contribution without extensive empirical verification

## Next Checks
1. Test the theoretical bounds empirically across diverse datasets and noise models to determine how often real-world conditions violate the assumptions
2. Extend the analysis to multi-class classification scenarios to identify whether similar impossibility results hold
3. Compare the predicted performance limits against actual post-hoc calibration methods on benchmark datasets to assess the tightness of the theoretical bounds
