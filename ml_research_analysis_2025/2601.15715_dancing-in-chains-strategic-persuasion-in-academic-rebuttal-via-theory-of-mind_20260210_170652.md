## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating strategic, persuasive academic rebuttals by introducing RebuttalAgent, the first framework to apply Theory of Mind (ToM) to this domain. The core innovation is a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental states, formulates persuasive strategies, and generates evidence-grounded responses. A large-scale synthetic dataset (RebuttleBench) was created via critique-and-refine, and the model was trained using supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with a self-reward mechanism. An automated evaluator (Rebuttal-RM) was also developed to reliably score responses. Experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms baseline models by 18.3% on average and achieves the highest human evaluation scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in strategic academic rebuttal.

## Method Summary
The RebuttalAgent framework introduces a three-stage pipeline: first modeling reviewer mental states through Theory of Mind analysis, then formulating strategic persuasion approaches based on this understanding, and finally generating evidence-grounded responses. The system was trained on a synthetic dataset (RebuttleBench) created through a critique-and-refine process, using supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with a self-reward mechanism. An automated evaluator called Rebuttal-RM was developed to assess response quality during both training and evaluation phases.

## Key Results
- RebuttalAgent outperforms baseline models by 18.3% on average
- Achieved highest scores in human evaluation across all metrics
- Demonstrates effective application of Theory of Mind to strategic academic persuasion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by explicitly modeling the psychological dynamics between authors and reviewers, treating rebuttal generation as a strategic persuasion task rather than simple information retrieval. By understanding reviewer perspectives through Theory of Mind, the system can craft responses that address not just factual concerns but also underlying reviewer motivations and concerns, leading to more persuasive outcomes.

## Foundational Learning
- Theory of Mind: Understanding others' mental states - Needed to model reviewer perspectives and motivations beyond surface-level comments
- Strategic Persuasion: Crafting arguments to influence others - Essential for transforming defensive responses into persuasive rebuttals
- Critique-and-Refine Methodology: Iterative improvement through feedback - Required to generate synthetic training data that captures complex rebuttal dynamics
- Reinforcement Learning with Self-Reward: Learning from generated feedback - Enables continuous improvement without extensive human annotation
- Persuasion Strategy Formulation: Developing targeted approaches based on audience analysis - Critical for adapting responses to different reviewer types

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Reviewer Analysis -> Strategy Formulation -> Response Generation -> Self-Reward Evaluation
Critical Path: The ToM-Strategy-Response pipeline forms the core workflow where mental state modeling directly informs strategy development, which then guides response generation
Design Tradeoffs: Synthetic dataset creation versus real-world data collection; automated evaluation versus human judgment; computational complexity of ToM modeling versus simpler pattern matching approaches
Failure Signatures: Generic responses indicating poor mental state modeling; misaligned strategies that don't address reviewer concerns; responses lacking evidence grounding
First Experiments: 1) Test ToM modeling accuracy on reviewer comment analysis 2) Evaluate strategy formulation effectiveness across different reviewer types 3) Measure response quality improvements with and without self-reward mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Synthetic dataset construction may not fully capture real-world academic review complexity
- Automated evaluator reliability depends on alignment with human judgment across domains
- Framework applicability to other persuasive writing domains remains untested

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical framework combining Theory of Mind with strategic persuasion
- Medium confidence in synthetic dataset's representation of real academic review scenarios
- Medium confidence in automated evaluation methodology's alignment with human judgment
- Medium confidence in model's generalizability beyond academic rebuttal domain

## Next Checks
1. Validate RebuttalAgent's performance on real academic rebuttals from published papers rather than synthetic data to assess true generalization capabilities
2. Conduct cross-domain testing by applying the framework to other persuasive writing tasks (e.g., grant proposals, editorial responses) to evaluate transferability
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the specific contributions of Theory of Mind modeling versus other components of the TSR pipeline to overall performance
