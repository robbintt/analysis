# Data Matters Most: Auditing Social Bias in Contrastive Vision Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.13223
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13223
- **Reference count**: 19
- **Primary result**: Training data source is the dominant driver of bias in vision-language models, outweighing both model size and data scale.

## Executive Summary
This study disentangles three factors—model size, training data scale, and training data source—to identify their relative impact on social bias in CLIP-style vision-language models. Using a controlled 2×2×2 grid of model/data combinations and balanced face-analysis benchmarks, the authors show that data source (proprietary vs LAION) has the strongest effect on gender and racial bias, with larger models amplifying bias in LAION-trained models but reducing it in proprietary-trained ones. Scaling from 400M to 2B LAION pairs further increases bias, challenging the assumption that bigger datasets are automatically fairer. The study also evaluates three post-hoc debiasing strategies, finding that mitigation effectiveness depends on both source and size, with no single method uniformly best.

## Method Summary
The authors audit bias in CLIP and OpenCLIP models by holding the contrastive objective constant while varying model size (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14), training data scale (400M, 2B pairs), and data source (proprietary, LAION). Bias is measured on FairFace and PATA benchmarks using zero-shot inference with cosine similarity. Six axes are evaluated: gender/race × crime/communion/agency. Three post-hoc debiasing strategies—Bias Prompts (closed-form projection), Prompt Array (3 epochs training), and SANER (5 epochs training)—are tested. All evaluations use single NVIDIA A100 (40GB) and complete in under 30 minutes.

## Key Results
- Data source is the dominant driver of bias, with LAION-trained models showing higher gender and racial skew than proprietary-trained models.
- Model size effects vary by data source: enlarging the encoder reduces gender skew in CLIP but amplifies both gender and racial skew in OpenCLIP.
- Scaling LAION from 400M to 2B pairs increases bias in OpenCLIP, challenging the assumption that larger datasets are fairer.
- Debiasing effectiveness is source- and size-dependent, with no single method uniformly best across all configurations.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's controlled experimental design isolates three key variables (model size, data scale, data source) while holding the contrastive objective constant. This disentanglement reveals that training data composition and curation—not just quantity—determine bias patterns. The use of balanced benchmarks and multiple bias metrics provides robust measurement, while the evaluation of post-hoc debiasing strategies shows that mitigation effectiveness depends on both the model configuration and the data source.

## Foundational Learning
- **Zero-shot inference**: Classification without task-specific fine-tuning using cosine similarity between image and text embeddings. Why needed: Enables fair comparison across models trained on different data. Quick check: Verify that embeddings are normalized before computing cosine similarity.
- **Contrastive learning**: Training framework where models learn to match related image-text pairs. Why needed: All models use the same objective, isolating the effect of other variables. Quick check: Confirm that temperature scaling is applied consistently across checkpoints.
- **Bias metrics (Max Skew, Harm Rate)**: Quantitative measures of demographic disparities in model predictions. Why needed: Provide objective comparison of bias across different model configurations. Quick check: Ensure that group-level aggregation accounts for all demographic categories.
- **Prompt engineering**: Template-based text construction for zero-shot inference. Why needed: Controls for linguistic variability in model evaluation. Quick check: Verify that all prompt templates are correctly formatted with {label} placeholders.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Image encoder (ViT) -> Text encoder (Transformer) -> Cosine similarity -> Max similarity prediction -> Demographic aggregation

**Critical path**: Image preprocessing → model inference → similarity computation → top-1 label assignment → group-level bias calculation

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Fixed contrastive objective enables clean variable isolation but limits architectural innovation
- Balanced benchmarks ensure fair measurement but may not reflect real-world distributions
- Multiple debiasing methods allow comparison but introduce implementation complexity

**Failure signatures**:
- Temperature mismatch → shifted similarity distributions affecting relative rankings
- Resolution mismatch → degraded embeddings for larger models (ViT-L/14 requires 336×336)
- Debiasing incompatibility → closed-source CLIP vs gradient-requiring OpenCLIP methods

**Three first experiments**:
1. Verify temperature scaling matches checkpoint metadata for all models
2. Confirm image resolution matches model requirements (224×224 vs 336×336)
3. Test bias metrics on a small subset of FairFace before full-scale evaluation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How can principled, scale-stable debiasing objectives be formulated to maintain effectiveness across different model sizes and training data sources?
- Basis: Current mitigation effectiveness is source- and size-dependent
- Why unresolved: Methods work well for some configurations but become unstable for others
- Evidence: A debiasing method that successfully reduces both gender and racial skew across all ViT-B/32 and ViT-L/14 checkpoints without increasing harm rates

**Open Question 2**: To what extent does demographic rebalancing or counterfactual augmentation of pre-training data mitigate bias compared to simply increasing corpus scale?
- Basis: Study shows increasing data scale amplifies bias in OpenCLIP
- Why unresolved: Does not test if scaling rebalanced data would dilute harms
- Evidence: Comparison of bias metrics between raw LAION-2B and demographically balanced subset of equal size

**Open Question 3**: How do model size and data source affect bias in intersectional sub-groups (e.g., race × gender) that were not evaluated in this study?
- Basis: Analysis confined to binary gender and seven race categories
- Why unresolved: Unknown if overall gender skew reduction holds for specific groups
- Evidence: Audit using intersectional benchmark reporting Max Skew for combined race and gender categories

## Limitations
- Limited to binary gender and seven race categories, excluding intersectional analysis
- Relies on two specific benchmarks (FairFace, PATA) that may not capture full bias spectrum
- Fixed English-language prompts may not generalize across cultures and languages
- 2×2×2 grid excludes other important variables like model architecture variants

## Confidence
- **High**: Relative ranking of bias drivers (data source > model size > data scale) consistent across metrics and benchmarks
- **Medium**: Reversal of model size effects between proprietary and LAION data plausible but dataset-dependent
- **Medium**: Effectiveness rankings of debiasing strategies internally consistent but may not generalize

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt robustness**: Test bias metrics with broader, multilingual prompt set to ensure results are not prompt-dependent
2. **Dataset generalization**: Audit bias on additional face datasets (UTKFace, CelebA) and non-face domains (MS-COCO scenes) to assess external validity
3. **Debiasing ablation**: Perform ablation studies on hyperparameters and training data used for Prompt Array and SANER to isolate factors driving mitigation success
