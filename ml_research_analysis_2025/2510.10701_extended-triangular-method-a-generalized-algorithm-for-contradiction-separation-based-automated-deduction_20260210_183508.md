# Extended Triangular Method: A Generalized Algorithm for Contradiction Separation Based Automated Deduction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.10701
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10701
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Formalizes and generalizes the Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework through the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a multi-clause contradiction-construction algorithm that enables dynamic, goal-directed inference and has achieved competitive results in TPTP and CASC 2018–2025.

## Executive Summary
This paper formalizes and generalizes the internal algorithmic core of the Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework through the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized multi-clause contradiction-construction algorithm that enables dynamic, goal-directed inference among interdependent clauses rather than fixed pairwise resolution. ETM extends and unifies earlier contradiction-building strategies, such as the Standard Extension method, within a triangular geometric framework supporting flexible clause interaction. The method is proven sound and complete for both propositional and first-order logic, and serves as the algorithmic kernel for high-performance theorem provers (CSE, CSE_E, CSI_E, CSI_Enig) that have achieved competitive results in TPTP and CASC 2018–2025. The ETM advances automated reasoning by bridging theoretical completeness with scalable, practical efficiency, and offers integration potential with learning-guided systems.

## Method Summary
The Extended Triangular Method (ETM) is a generalized algorithm for automated theorem proving that constructs contradictions through multi-clause synergy rather than sequential pairwise resolution. The method operates by selecting a sequence of clauses $D_1, \dots, D_k$ and identifying a "Main Boundary Line" of literals to form a triangular geometric structure. Each clause is partitioned into $D_i^-$ (literals inside the contradiction boundary) and $D_i^+$ (remaining literals), with the conjunction of $D_i^-$ forming the contradiction and the disjunction of $D_i^+$ yielding a new clause (CSC) added back to the clause set. The process repeats until the CSC is empty, proving unsatisfiability. For first-order logic, substitutions (unification) are used to align literals across clauses. The method is proven sound and complete for both propositional and first-order logic.

## Key Results
- ETM enables dynamic, goal-directed inference among interdependent clauses rather than fixed pairwise resolution
- The method is proven sound and complete for both propositional and first-order logic
- ETM serves as the algorithmic kernel for high-performance theorem provers (CSE, CSE_E, CSI_E, CSI_Enig) achieving competitive results in TPTP and CASC 2018–2025

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Clause Synergized Inference
ETM enables simultaneous inference across multiple clauses ($k \ge 2$) rather than sequential pairwise resolution, potentially reducing proof depth. The algorithm selects a sequence of clauses $D_1, \dots, D_k$ and identifies a "Main Boundary Line" of literals ($x_1, \dots, x_{k-1}$). The intersection of these clauses forms a triangular geometric structure where the lower portion is a contradiction and the upper portion yields a new clause. Proof search efficiency improves when inference rules exploit dependencies across multiple clauses simultaneously, rather than deriving intermediate binary resolvents.

### Mechanism 2: Contradiction Separation Clause (CSC) Generation
The primary output of the inference step is a Contradiction Separation Clause (CSC), derived by isolating the "contradictory" parts of selected clauses from the "residual" literals. Each selected clause $D_i$ is partitioned into $D_i^-$ (literals inside the contradiction boundary) and $D_i^+$ (literals outside). The conjunction of $D_i^-$ forms the contradiction, while the disjunction of $D_i^+$ forms the new CSC, which is added back to the clause set. Separating contradictory literals from residual literals allows the prover to make larger, semantically meaningful leaps in the search space compared to resolving single literals.

### Mechanism 3: Dynamic Boundary Selection Heuristics
The efficiency of ETM depends on a goal-directed strategy for selecting the "Main Boundary Line" literals to maximize contradiction coverage. The algorithm prioritizes literals that appear frequently or have many complements in the set. This greedily constructs the "triangle" to minimize the size of the resulting CSC. A "full" or "flat-top" triangle (where the contradiction covers all involved literals) is structurally optimal for deriving an empty clause.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) & Literals**
  - **Why needed here:** ETM operates strictly on clause sets (disjunctions of literals) in CNF. Understanding the difference between a clause ($A \lor B$) and a set of clauses is vital.
  - **Quick check question:** Given the formula $\neg(A \land B) \lor C$, can you convert it to a set of clauses?

- **Concept:** **Unification (First-Order Logic)**
  - **Why needed here:** In FOL, clauses contain variables. The mechanism requires substitutions (e.g., $\sigma = \{x/a\}$) to make literals complementary (e.g., $P(x)$ and $\neg P(a)$).
  - **Quick check question:** What is the most general unifier (MGU) for the literals $P(x, f(y))$ and $P(a, z)$?

- **Concept:** **Soundness vs. Completeness**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper claims ETM is both sound (never proves false things) and complete (can prove all true things). You must understand that an inference rule can be complete theoretically but impractical computationally without heuristics.
  - **Quick check question:** If a prover derives the empty clause, what does that strictly imply about the original clause set $S$?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Preprocessor -> Clause Selector -> ETC Constructor -> CSC Generator -> Controller
- **Critical path:** The **Selection of the main boundary line literal** (Steps 1 to $k-1$ in Section 4.3). Errors here (e.g., selecting literals with no complements) break the contradiction construction.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Generality vs. Efficiency:** The algorithm allows *any* literal selection (high generality), but practical use demands aggressive heuristics (Section 4.6) to prevent combinatorial explosion.
  - **Standard vs. Extended Triangle:** Standard Triangles are easier to compute but less flexible; ETM allows "stair-like" and incomplete triangles for broader coverage.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Tautology Loop:** The generated CSC is a tautology (contains $L$ and $\neg L$), adding no information.
  - **Stair-lock:** The triangle grows indefinitely without forming a "flat top" or contradiction (Section 4.2).
  - **Variable Clash:** Unification fails due to improper variable renaming in Step 0.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Unit Propagation Check:** Implement the "flat-top" logic where all clauses are unit literals to verify basic contradiction detection.
  2. **Propositional Validation:** Run the algorithm on Example 4.1 (Table 4.1) to verify the geometric matrix construction visually.
  3. **Unification Stress Test:** Implement Example 5.1 in FOL to ensure the substitution application ($\sigma_i$) correctly handles variable binding across the triangle.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What are the theoretical complexity bounds and redundancy characteristics of the Extended Triangular Method (ETM) compared to standard binary resolution?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 8 states future work includes "Complexity and Redundancy Analysis: Establish theoretical bounds and heuristic strategies for inference growth, quantifying and minimizing redundancy under multi-clause synergy."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper focuses on proving soundness and completeness and validating performance via competition benchmarks (CASC), but it does not provide a formal theoretical analysis of the computational complexity or proof length bounds relative to existing calculi.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A formal theoretical analysis establishing complexity classes or bounds on the number of inference steps required for ETM versus binary resolution on specific problem classes.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can neural networks or reinforcement learning models be optimally integrated to guide the dynamic clause selection process within the ETM framework?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 8 lists "Learning-Integrated Deduction" as a future direction, specifically to "Develop neural and reinforcement learning models to predict clause combinations and optimize contradiction construction dynamically."
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper notes that existing systems like CSI_Enig use learning guidance, the specific architectural integration of learning models to predict the "dynamic, goal-oriented" clause interactions unique to ETM remains an open development task.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An implementation of ETM utilizing a trained neural model for clause selection that demonstrates statistically significant efficiency gains over heuristic-based ETM in standard benchmarks.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the Extended Triangular Method be formally generalized to non-classical logics (e.g., modal, temporal, or fuzzy logics) while retaining soundness and completeness?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 8 identifies "Cross-Domain Applications" as a future research direction, explicitly proposing to "Extend ETM to non-classical Logic (modal, temporal, higher-order logics, fuzzy logics...)."
- **Why unresolved:** The current theoretical formulation and proofs of soundness and completeness provided in the paper are restricted to propositional and first-order logic only.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A formal extension of the ETM definitions and theorems (soundness/completeness) applied to a specific non-classical logic, such as modal logic K or temporal logic.

## Limitations

- **Heuristic Implementation Details:** The paper describes strategies for literal selection but does not provide concrete weights or pseudo-code for the clause/literal scoring function used in competition-grade provers
- **Unification Strategy:** While unification is mentioned, specific algorithm details and inverse substitution handling are high-level descriptions without implementation specifics
- **Termination Thresholds:** The paper mentions thresholds for CSC size but does not provide specific values used in experiments

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the soundness and completeness proofs for both propositional and first-order logic
- **Medium confidence** in the theoretical framework and geometric construction mechanism
- **Low confidence** in practical implementation details for heuristics and unification strategy

## Next Checks

1. Implement Example 4.1 (propositional) and verify the geometric matrix construction produces the expected CSC through visual inspection of the triangular structure
2. Implement Example 5.1 (first-order) to validate that variable renaming and substitution application correctly handle cross-clause variable binding in the triangular construction
3. Test the basic algorithm on unit clause propagation cases to verify the "flat-top" triangle mechanism correctly detects contradictions without heuristic guidance
