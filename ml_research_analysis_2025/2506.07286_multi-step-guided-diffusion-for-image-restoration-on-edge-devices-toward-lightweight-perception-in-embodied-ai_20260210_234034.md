# Multi-Step Guided Diffusion for Image Restoration on Edge Devices: Toward Lightweight Perception in Embodied AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07286
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07286
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Multi-step optimization in MPGD improves perceptual quality and pixel accuracy on edge devices with minimal latency, achieving real-time restoration for aerial and natural images.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the use of Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) with multi-step optimization for image restoration tasks on resource-constrained edge devices. Originally developed for face datasets, MPGD is evaluated for its ability to generalize to natural and aerial imagery, addressing real-world degradation such as super-resolution and deblurring. The study introduces deeper conditioning via multiple gradient descent updates per denoising step, resulting in improved perceptual quality (LPIPS) and pixel-level accuracy (PSNR) with only modest latency overhead. Experiments on a Jetson Orin Nano demonstrate real-time performance, with results suggesting MPGD's potential as a retraining-free, lightweight module for embodied AI perception systems like drones and mobile robots.

## Method Summary
The work adapts Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) for image restoration by applying multiple gradient descent updates within each denoising step, effectively increasing the depth of conditioning and optimization. This approach is tested on two restoration tasks—4× super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring—using a Jetson Orin Nano for edge deployment. MPGD is trained on face datasets but evaluated for generalization on natural and aerial images. The study compares MPGD against NAFNet and Uformer, assessing both perceptual quality (LPIPS) and pixel-level accuracy (PSNR), while monitoring inference latency. The experiments reveal a saturation point at approximately 15 denoising steps, beyond which gains diminish and latency increases.

## Key Results
- MPGD outperforms NAFNet and Uformer on UAV123 aerial dataset in both LPIPS and PSNR while maintaining real-time throughput.
- Performance saturates around 15 denoising steps, with inference times of 50–100 ms per image on Jetson Orin Nano.
- Multi-step optimization enhances perceptual quality and pixel accuracy with minimal latency overhead, even when trained on mismatched (face) data.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MPGD leverages the denoising diffusion probabilistic model framework, but with manifold preservation to better capture the structure of images. The multi-step optimization approach applies several gradient descent updates within each denoising step, effectively deepening the conditioning and enabling more precise correction of degradations. This results in both improved perceptual quality (via LPIPS) and pixel-level accuracy (via PSNR), while keeping the computational load manageable for edge devices.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion probabilistic models**: Stochastic process that gradually denoises images from random noise; needed for iterative restoration; quick check: verify step-wise noise reduction.
- **Manifold preservation**: Maintains the intrinsic structure of image manifolds during denoising; needed for high-quality, structured outputs; quick check: assess feature smoothness.
- **Gradient descent optimization**: Iterative method to minimize loss during denoising; needed for multi-step conditioning; quick check: monitor loss convergence per step.
- **Edge device constraints**: Limited compute and memory resources; needed to ensure real-time performance; quick check: measure latency and resource usage.
- **Perceptual quality metrics (LPIPS)**: Measures human perceptual similarity; needed for evaluating visual realism; quick check: compare LPIPS scores across methods.
- **Pixel-level accuracy (PSNR)**: Measures reconstruction fidelity; needed for quantitative assessment; quick check: calculate PSNR on ground truth images.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input Degradation -> MPGD Denoiser -> Multi-step Gradient Updates -> Restored Image

**Critical Path**
Degraded image → denoising steps with multi-gradient updates → restored output

**Design Tradeoffs**
- More gradient steps improve quality but increase latency; optimal around 15 steps.
- Training on face data enables generalization but may limit performance on very different modalities.
- Edge deployment favors lightweight models; MPGD balances accuracy and speed.

**Failure Signatures**
- Excessive steps cause latency spikes without quality gains.
- Mismatched training data may reduce restoration quality on certain image types.
- Edge device limitations may restrict model depth or step count.

**First Experiments**
1. Compare MPGD against NAFNet and Uformer on UAV123 dataset (LPIPS, PSNR, latency).
2. Vary number of gradient descent steps (1, 5, 10, 15, 20) and measure quality/latency trade-offs.
3. Test MPGD generalization by applying face-trained model to natural and aerial images.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to Jetson Orin Nano; unclear how MPGD performs on other edge devices.
- Only two restoration tasks tested; generalization to other degradation types not explored.
- No subjective human studies to validate LPIPS improvements in practical scenarios.

## Confidence
- Real-time performance on Jetson Orin Nano: High
- Generalization of MPGD from faces to natural/aerial images: Medium
- Saturation at 15 steps across all conditions: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MPGD on additional edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, mobile SoCs) to confirm portability and latency claims.
2. Conduct ablation studies varying noise levels and degradation types to test the robustness of the 15-step saturation claim.
3. Perform user studies or third-party perceptual metrics (e.g., Maad) to validate LPIPS improvements in practical scenarios.
