# Orchestrating Human-AI Teams: The Manager Agent as a Unifying Research Challenge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02557
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02557
- Reference count: 40
- Key result: Manager Agents struggle to jointly optimize goal completion, constraint adherence, and runtime efficiency across 20 workflows, highlighting workflow management as a difficult open problem.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Manager Agent as a unifying research challenge for orchestrating human-AI teams in complex workflows. The authors formalize autonomous workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) and identify four foundational challenges: hierarchical task decomposition, multi-objective optimization under non-stationary preferences, coordination in ad hoc teams, and governance by design. To enable progress, they release MA-Gym, an open-source simulator and evaluation framework. Benchmarking GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, they find that while agents can achieve individual objectives like goal completion, constraint adherence, or runtime efficiency, they struggle to optimize all three simultaneously—highlighting workflow management as a difficult open problem for agentic AI.

## Method Summary
The paper formalizes workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) where a Manager Agent coordinates heterogeneous human and AI workers through task graph construction, worker allocation, and adaptive re-planning. MA-Gym implements this POSG as a discrete-timestep environment with 20 workflow scenarios across domains like legal, finance, marketing, and healthcare. Each workflow includes task dependency graphs, heterogeneous agent teams, stakeholder preferences, and hard/soft constraints. Three baseline policies are evaluated: Random (uniform action sampling), Chain-of-Thought (reasoning-based action selection), and Assign-All (upfront task assignment). GPT-5 and GPT-4.1 serve as base models, with GPT-4o as impartial judge. Five metrics are normalized to [0,1]: preference alignment, constraint adherence, goal achievement, stakeholder management, and workflow completion time.

## Key Results
- GPT-5-based Manager Agents achieve 0.6-0.7 normalized goal achievement on analytics/product-launch workflows versus lower GPT-4.1 scores
- Different baseline policies exhibit distinct trade-offs: Assign-All maximizes goal completion (0.502) but minimizes constraint adherence (0.475), while CoT improves constraint adherence (0.589) but increases runtime 17× (46.9 hours vs 2.7)
- Current Manager Agents struggle to jointly optimize goal completion, constraint adherence, and runtime efficiency simultaneously across all 20 workflows
- GPT-5 executes 14.5× more task decompositions and 26× more dependency additions than GPT-4.1, forming structured planning chains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Formalizing workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) may enable principled algorithmic development by explicitly representing multi-agent interactions under uncertainty.
- Mechanism: The POSG framework ⟨I, S, b₀, {Aᵢ}, {Oᵢ}, P, {Rᵢ}⟩ decomposes the problem into agents (manager + workers), states (task graph G, workers W, communications C, artifacts X, preferences U), actions, observations, transition dynamics, and reward functions—allowing solution concepts like Pareto-optimal Nash Equilibrium (PONE) to be defined.
- Core assumption: Manager and worker agents have distinct action spaces, observations, and potentially conflicting objectives, which the POSG formulation captures better than single-agent MDPs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 3 provides the complete POSG formalism with state space S ≡ ⟨G, W, C, X, U⟩ and distinct action spaces A_M for the manager vs. A_i for workers.
  - [section] Section 3.7 explicitly defines the solution concept as Pareto-optimal Nash Equilibrium for mixed cooperative/self-interested settings.
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Toward Agentic Software Project Management" similarly argues for formal frameworks to manage agentic workflows, but does not adopt POSG specifically.
- Break condition: If agents are purely cooperative with identical reward functions (R_i = R, ∀i), the model simplifies to Dec-POMDP, and equilibrium-based solution concepts become unnecessary.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Stronger reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5 with RLVR-style training) may improve goal achievement by enabling more proactive orchestration chains (decompose → refine → assign) rather than reactive communication loops.
- Mechanism: RLVR (Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards) trains models for stepwise reasoning; this translates to 14.5× more task decompositions, 7.8× more refinements, and 26× more dependency additions in GPT-5 vs. GPT-4.1, forming structured planning chains rather than status-check/messaging loops.
- Core assumption: The correlation between reasoning capacity and proactive planning operators implies a causal relationship; this is plausible but not definitively proven.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 5.2 reports GPT-5 achieves 0.6–0.7 normalized goal achievement on analytics/product-launch workflows vs. lower GPT-4.1 scores.
  - [section] Table 2 shows GPT-5 executes 14.5× more decompose_task actions and 26× more add_dependency actions than GPT-4.1.
  - [corpus] The "Toward Agentic Software Project Management" roadmap similarly emphasizes reasoning capabilities but does not quantify action-level differences.
- Break condition: If proactive planning does not translate to higher goal achievement (e.g., due to poor decomposition quality), more planning actions could increase runtime without improving outcomes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Manager Agents appear to face a fundamental multi-objective trade-off where optimizing for one objective (e.g., goal completion) degrades others (e.g., constraint adherence or runtime), and this trade-off cannot be eliminated by current methods.
- Mechanism: The Assign-All baseline achieves higher goal completion (0.502 ± 0.209) than CoT (0.313 ± 0.187) but lower constraint adherence (0.475 vs. 0.589), while CoT's runtime balloons to 46.9 hours vs. 2.7 for Random—indicating that different policies explore different regions of the Pareto frontier.
- Core assumption: The trade-off is inherent to the problem structure, not just a limitation of current baselines; this is supported by but not proven by the experiments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 5.2 documents the trade-off: Assign-All achieves higher goal completion but lower constraint adherence; CoT completes more task nodes but with 17× slower execution.
  - [section] Figure 2 visualizes the trade-off space across 20 workflows.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers explicitly address simultaneous multi-objective optimization in agentic orchestration.
- Break condition: If a future method jointly optimizes all objectives (e.g., via learned preference inference or hierarchical control), this trade-off may be mitigated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Partially Observable Stochastic Games (POSGs)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core formalism; understanding agent types I, state spaces S, and solution concepts like PONE is required to reason about manager-worker coordination.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a POSG is more appropriate than a single-agent POMDP for modeling a manager coordinating multiple workers with possibly misaligned objectives?

- Concept: **Hierarchical Task Decomposition**
  - Why needed here: Section 4.1 identifies this as the bottleneck for downstream capabilities; the paper shows performance gains correlate with task graph quality, and current LLMs rely on shallow pattern matching rather than compositional reasoning.
  - Quick check question: Given a high-level goal like "launch a quarterly report workflow," what sub-steps would you decompose, and what dependencies would you enforce?

- Concept: **Ad Hoc Teamwork**
  - Why needed here: Manager Agents must coordinate with workers they were not jointly trained with; Section 4.3 frames this as a core challenge requiring rapid teammate capability inference.
  - Quick check question: How would you design a manager policy to adapt when a new AI worker joins mid-workflow with unknown skill profiles?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MA-Gym instantiates the POSG as discrete timesteps with: WorkflowExecutionEngine (controller) -> ManagerAgent (orchestration policy) -> ValidationEngine (rubric scorer) -> Workflow (task graph + constraints) -> AgentRegistry (worker pool) -> CommunicationService (messaging). Each agent i ∈ I observes o_i and selects a_i ∈ A_i per timestep.

- Critical path: (1) Install MA-Gym and run a single workflow with Random policy to understand observations/actions -> (2) Implement a simple CoT policy that logs reasoning before action selection -> (3) Evaluate on 3 workflows (e.g., Legal Contract Negotiation, Data Science Analytics, Marketing Campaign) -> (4) Analyze trade-offs using the 5 metrics (preference alignment, constraint adherence, goal achievement, stakeholder management, completion time).

- Design tradeoffs: Static upfront planning (Assign-All) favors goal completion but risks constraint violations; adaptive CoT improves constraint adherence but increases runtime by 17×; Random baselines establish lower bounds. The paper assumes human workers can be simulated with scripted policies, which may not capture real-world variability.

- Failure signatures: (1) Reactive loops (repeated send_message → status_check without planning action) indicate under-exploration of A_M → switch to stronger reasoning model or add exploration bonus. (2) Hard constraint violations terminate workflow immediately → inspect constraint predicates and add pre-action checks. (3) Stakeholder management score drops to 0 → ensure manager initiates communication early (first 10 timesteps).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Legal Contract Negotiation with CoT (GPT-5) and log all actions; verify the action sequence includes decompose → assign → add_dependency chains.
  2. Compare Assign-All vs. CoT on Data Science Analytics; plot goal achievement vs. constraint adherence to visualize the trade-off.
  3. Inject a team churn event (new worker joins at t=30) in Marketing Campaign; measure whether CoT adapts task allocation within 5 timesteps.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can a Manager Agent learn a policy that efficiently adapts to non-stationary stakeholder preferences over multiple objectives without requiring costly retraining?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify multi-objective optimization under shifting preferences as a core challenge, noting that current Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) assumes fixed objectives while preference-learning pipelines typically model only a single scalar reward.
- Why unresolved: Existing methods break when preference weights shift online, and current models fail to pragmatically handle evolving, conflicting objectives in real-time.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm capable of inferring new weight vectors from minimal stakeholder corrections or interactions during execution in MA-Gym.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the Manager Agent rapidly infer the capabilities, reliability, and intent of new teammates from limited interaction to enable effective, on-the-fly task delegation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights coordination in ad hoc teams as a foundational challenge, pointing out that current approaches struggle under extreme heterogeneity or lack mechanisms for dynamic role negotiation.
- Why unresolved: The Manager Agent cannot rely on pre-coordinated strategies or prior joint training, yet must quickly model unseen human and AI worker behaviors.
- What evidence would resolve it: A policy that generalizes to novel agent types in MA-Gym without pre-coordination, maintaining performance despite team churn.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can Manager Agents maintain governance and compliance in dynamic workflows while interpreting ambiguous natural language regulatory constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors ask how agents can interpret natural language constraints and adapt to evolving regulations without compromising operational effectiveness (Section 4.4).
- Why unresolved: Current safe MARL methods focus on binary safety constraints rather than the nuanced, ambiguous requirements found in regulatory text.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful zero-shot adherence to dynamic, complex hard constraints in the MA-Gym environment without manual policy rewriting.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Why do state-of-the-art Manager Agents fail to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint adherence, and workflow runtime?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The benchmarking results (Section 5.2) show that while agents can achieve individual objectives, they struggle to optimize all three simultaneously; specifically, "managerial interventions" like Chain-of-Thought reasoning often reduce goal completion compared to simple baselines.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if this failure is due to the lack of hierarchical causal reasoning in current models or the inability to navigate the multidimensional trade-off space.
- What evidence would resolve it: An agent architecture that achieves Pareto-optimal Nash Equilibrium across the three metrics in the 20 MA-Gym workflows.

## Limitations
- The POSG formulation assumes clear separation of agent objectives and observations, but real human-AI teams often have overlapping goals and asymmetric information—this may limit direct applicability.
- GPT-5 performance improvements may be conflated with increased sampling scale or RLVR training artifacts rather than pure reasoning capability gains.
- The multi-objective trade-off claim is descriptive of current baselines but not proven to be fundamental; future methods could break this pattern.

## Confidence
- **High**: POSG formalism correctly captures the coordination problem structure; MA-Gym simulator accurately implements the specification.
- **Medium**: Observed performance gaps between GPT-5 and GPT-4.1 reflect reasoning capability differences rather than scale or sampling effects.
- **Low**: The multi-objective trade-off is inherent to the problem structure rather than a limitation of current baselines.

## Next Checks
1. Run ablation studies varying worker policy complexity (scripted vs. stochastic) to isolate manager performance from worker behavior.
2. Implement a preference-learning baseline that infers U dynamically and test whether this mitigates the multi-objective trade-off.
3. Test manager generalization by training on 15 workflows and evaluating zero-shot on 5 held-out scenarios.
