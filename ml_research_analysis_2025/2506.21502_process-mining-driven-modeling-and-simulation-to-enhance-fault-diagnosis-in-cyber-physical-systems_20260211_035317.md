# Process mining-driven modeling and simulation to enhance fault diagnosis in cyber-physical systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.21502
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21502
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Unsupervised clustering of sensor data combined with process mining achieves up to 98.9% fault identification F1-score with interpretable stochastic Petri nets.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a process mining-driven method for fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that extracts interpretable stochastic models from low-level sensor data without requiring labeled datasets. The approach combines unsupervised anomaly detection, clustering-based event log extraction, Petri net discovery, and conformance checking to identify specific fault types. Applied to the Robotic Arm Dataset, the method achieves a balance between model interpretability and simulation accuracy, with Petri nets demonstrating up to 0.676 arc-degree simplicity while maintaining fault identification F1 scores up to 98.925%.

## Method Summary
The method transforms continuous sensor data into discrete events through K-means clustering, where each cluster represents a system state and transitions between clusters form event logs. Process discovery algorithms (Inductive Miner Infrequent, ILP, or Heuristics Miner) extract control-flow structures to build Petri nets, which are enhanced with temporal distributions from observed state durations to create stochastic Petri nets. For fault diagnosis, incoming traces are compared against the library of mined Petri nets using a hybrid approach combining structural alignment (conformance checking) and signal-level similarity (RMSE/R²), with classification determined through majority voting of these metrics.

## Key Results
- Fault identification achieves F1 score up to 98.925% with conformance checking time of 0.020 seconds
- Models achieve up to 0.676 arc-degree simplicity while maintaining 0.395 R² simulation accuracy
- Increasing cluster granularity (K) improves simulation R² but degrades model interpretability and increases diagnosis latency
- Inductive Miner Infrequent (IMf) provides the best balance between soundness and simplicity among tested miners

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Unsupervised Discretization of Low-Level Sensors
The method applies clustering to raw multivariate time series windows, defining system states via centroids and transitions between clusters as events. This bridges the gap between raw physical signals and discrete control-flow models. Core assumption: physical states form distinguishable clusters in sensor feature space. Break condition: highly noisy data or continuous spectra without distinct modes obscure clustering.

### Mechanism 2: Interpretable Stochastic Modeling via Process Discovery
Process discovery algorithms extract control-flow structures to build Petri nets, which are enhanced by mapping observed state durations to probability distributions on transitions. This creates stochastic Petri nets that are both human-readable and simulatable. Core assumption: faulty behavior follows a repeatable, structured workflow fitting the miner's representational bias. Break condition: random or highly concurrent faulty behavior produces unsound or overly generic models.

### Mechanism 3: Hybrid Conformance & Simulation Alignment
Fault identification combines structural alignment (conformance checking) with signal-level similarity (RMSE/R²) via majority voting. Online traces are checked against Petri net libraries for fitness scores and time-series reconstruction errors. Core assumption: distinct fault types exhibit distinguishable differences in control-flow structure or temporal dynamics. Break condition: similar faults share identical sequences and timing distributions, preventing distinction.

## Foundational Learning

**Petri Nets & Soundness**
- Why needed: Entire modeling output relies on Petri nets (places, transitions, soundness)
- Quick check: If a Petri net is "unsound," can it be used for reliable simulation? (Answer: No, may contain dead transitions or infinite loops)

**Conformance Checking (Alignment)**
- Why needed: Core classification logic requires understanding log moves vs. model moves and alignment costs
- Quick check: Does a low fitness score imply a mismatch between observed trace and Petri net structure? (Answer: Yes, implies high alignment costs)

**Time Series Discretization**
- Why needed: Transforms continuous sensor streams into discrete events; choice of K affects state space granularity
- Quick check: Increasing number of clusters (K) generally has what effect on Petri net complexity? (Answer: Increases structural complexity and computation time)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Pre-processing (normalizes data) -> Event Log Builder (clusters → states → logs) -> Process Mining Engine (logs → discovery + enhancement → SPN) -> Simulator (replays SPN → synthetic traces) -> Diagnoser (online trace → fitness + RMSE/R² → majority vote → fault label)

**Critical path:** Event Log Builder is most sensitive; too low K merges distinct states hiding faults, too high K creates noisy logs causing "spaghetti" models that timeout during conformance checking.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Miner Selection: IMf offers best soundness-simplicity balance but struggles with complex concurrency; ILP can overfit and produce unsound nets; HM may be unstable for soundness
- State Granularity (K): Increasing K improves simulation R² but degrades arc-degree simplicity and increases diagnosis latency

**Failure signatures:**
- Diagnosis Timeout: Conformance checking exceeds 300s. Remedy: Reduce K or switch to simpler miner
- Unsound Model: ILP output unusable for conformance. Remedy: Switch to IMf
- Low F1 Score (<20%): Likely caused by low anomaly detection accuracy contaminating training set

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Baseline Clustering: Run pipeline with K=3, 5, 7 on RoAD data; plot Arc-Degree Simplicity vs Simulation R² to find optimal "knee" point
2. Miner Stability: Compare IMf vs ILP on same training log; verify ILP produces unsound nets (deadlocks) as hinted in paper
3. Contamination Test: Inject normal windows into fault training set (reducing accuracy to 80%); measure drop in F1 score to validate robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can the method be generalized to diverse industrial settings beyond robotic arms, specifically environments where regular trends do not follow cyclic patterns?
- Basis: Authors state applying methodology to additional CPS environments is necessary and future studies should validate non-cyclic scenarios
- Why unresolved: Current validation limited to RoAD dataset with specific cyclic behaviors (N1 and N2 patterns)
- Evidence needed: Successful application on disparate CPS datasets like supply chain networks or process manufacturing lines with non-cyclic workflows

**Open Question 2:** How can event log extraction phase be made robust to inherent noise in low-level sensor data without manual noise threshold tuning?
- Basis: Authors acknowledge noisy sensor data significantly impacts Petri net quality and requires deeper study
- Why unresolved: Uses 75% noise threshold but doesn't propose generalized solution for clustering and state transition extraction
- Evidence needed: Comparative study showing improved noise-handling mechanism maintains/improves F1 scores without manual parameter tuning

**Open Question 3:** How can discovered stochastic Petri nets be formally integrated with digital twins and runtime monitoring to enable autonomous corrective actions?
- Basis: Conclusion proposes coupling simulation-based fault diagnosis with safety assurance tools like digital twins and runtime monitoring
- Why unresolved: Current work stops at offline modeling and online diagnosis without closing loop through active runtime monitors or digital twin integration
- Evidence needed: Framework implementation where generated Petri nets trigger automated safety assurances or schedule adjustments upon fault detection

## Limitations

- Performance highly sensitive to initial anomaly detection accuracy and clustering granularity choice (K)
- Assumes distinct fault types produce distinguishable state sequences and temporal patterns, which may not hold for subtle or overlapping faults
- Validation limited to Robotic Arm Dataset with only two fault types (Velocity and Weight), restricting generalizability to complex CPS scenarios

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Clustering for state discretization and general process mining pipeline (discovery + enhancement + conformance checking) is well-established
**Medium confidence:** Specific combination of unsupervised clustering, IMf mining, and hybrid conformance-simulation classification for CPS fault diagnosis is novel and validated only on single dataset
**Low confidence:** Robustness to noise, scalability to larger state spaces (higher K), and performance on CPS with more than two fault types remain untested

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Expansion Test:** Validate method on CPS dataset with more than two distinct fault types to assess discriminative power and F1 score stability
2. **Noise Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically inject varying levels of Gaussian noise into RoAD sensor data and measure degradation in fault identification F1 score and model soundness
3. **Cluster Granularity Stress Test:** Run pipeline with K values from 2 to 15 on RoAD data, recording Petri net arc-degree simplicity, R² scores, and conformance checking times to map trade-off curve precisely
