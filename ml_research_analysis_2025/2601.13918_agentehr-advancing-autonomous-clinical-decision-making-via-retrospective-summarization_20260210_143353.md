# AgentEHR: Advancing Autonomous Clinical Decision-Making via Retrospective Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.13918
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13918
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces RETROSUM framework achieving up to 29.16% performance gains and 92.3% error reduction in EHR-based clinical decision-making

## Executive Summary
AGENTEHR introduces a new benchmark for autonomous clinical decision-making requiring agents to reason within raw EHR databases to predict diagnoses and treatments. Standard summarization methods suffer from information loss and disrupted reasoning continuity in this setting. RETROSUM addresses this by combining a retrospective summarization mechanism that periodically re-evaluates interaction history to capture latent dependencies, with an evolving strategy that retrieves domain-specific experience from a memory bank. The approach achieves significant performance improvements and demonstrates robustness to context truncation.

## Method Summary
RETROSUM operates as a multi-turn agent that maintains raw EHR interaction history while periodically generating retrospective summaries to capture latent dependencies. Every 10 steps, a summarizer re-evaluates the full interaction history (distant and recent) to generate updated summaries that prevent information loss. The agent also maintains an experience memory bank storing successful reasoning patterns from training cases, which are retrieved during inference to guide current decisions. The framework operates on MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III datasets restructured into patient-centric SQLite databases, using 19+ tools for EHR navigation across six clinical tasks.

## Key Results
- RETROSUM achieves performance gains of up to 29.16% compared to competitive baselines
- Total interaction errors reduced by up to 92.3% in case studies
- Demonstrates robustness to context truncation, maintaining performance even with 8k-token limits
- Best@K performance improves substantially with increased sampling budgets up to K=256

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Retrospective Re-evaluation Captures Latent Cross-Temporal Dependencies
Periodically re-examining full interaction history prevents loss of information whose relevance only becomes apparent after later observations. At fixed intervals (every 10 steps), the summarizer conditions on both distant and recent history to generate updated summaries, capturing cross-temporal correlations that incremental summarization misses.

### Mechanism 2: Augmented History Preserves Reasoning Continuity
Providing the actor with both full raw history and retrospective summaries maintains reasoning coherence better than history replacement. The context retains all raw (action, observation) pairs while adding periodic summaries, ensuring precise syntactical and numerical details remain available for logical deduction.

### Mechanism 3: Experience Memory Bank Bridges Domain Knowledge Gaps
Crystallizing successful reasoning patterns into an external memory bank enables retrieval of domain-specific heuristics that improve future task performance. After each training instance, a reflection module extracts actor heuristics and summarizer guidelines, stored with patient embeddings and retrieved during inference for similar cases.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Unidirectional vs. Retrospective Summarization**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why incremental summarization fails in EHR contexts is essential for grasping the core contribution.
  - Quick check question: Given three observations [A, B, C] where B becomes relevant only after seeing C, how would unidirectional summarization at step 2 differ from retrospective re-evaluation at step 3?

- **Concept: Agent-Tool Interaction Loops**
  - Why needed here: RETROSUM operates as a multi-turn agent that must maintain coherent plans across 20-100+ tool calls.
  - Quick check question: If an agent's context is compressed after each tool call, what types of reasoning errors would you expect to increase?

- **Concept: Memory Retrieval for Knowledge Transfer**
  - Why needed here: The evolving strategy relies on retrieving prior experiences to guide current reasoning.
  - Quick check question: How would you determine whether a retrieved experience is relevant enough to condition the current agent's decision?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Actor (π_θ) -> Environment (E) -> History (H) -> Summarizer (M_θ) -> Context (Ĥ) -> Memory Bank (B) -> Toolbox/MCP Server
- **Critical path:** Actor generates action a_i based on context Ĥ_i, Environment returns observation o_i, History updated with (a_i, o_i), Summarizer generates S_i every 10 steps conditioning on full history, Context augmented with new summary, Repeat until finish action
- **Design tradeoffs:** Window size w=10 balances summarization frequency and computational cost; memory bank uses top-1 retrieval from 100 training examples; context limits tested from 8k-64k tokens
- **Failure signatures:** Tool Repeat (5+ consecutive identical actions), Single-Tool Loop (10+ same tool calls), Multi-Tool Cyclic Loop (15+ similar tool calls), No Candidate Tool (finish without predictions), Tool Parsing Failure (malformed syntax)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Test Sum-Only vs. Act-Only retrospective application across different window sizes on single task, 2) Stress-test context limits by comparing RETROSUM vs. baselines from 64k down to 8k tokens, 3) Analyze error reduction patterns by categorizing failures across all six error types on 50+ cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does RETROSUM performance generalize to multi-center EHR systems with heterogeneous administrative protocols and demographic distributions? The current evaluation relies on single-center MIMIC datasets, which may not capture diverse global healthcare variations.

### Open Question 2
Can the retrospective summarization mechanism be effectively extended to integrate multimodal clinical data including medical imaging and physiological waveforms? The current framework processes only text and structured data, lacking capabilities for pixel-level analysis or high-frequency waveform interpretation.

### Open Question 3
What are the upper bounds of test-time scaling for clinical agents on AGENTEHR tasks, and does performance plateau or continue improving with larger sampling budgets? Experiments only tested up to K=256 samples, leaving optimal sampling budgets and asymptotic behavior unexplored.

## Limitations
- Weak validation of the evolving strategy mechanism, tested on only two tasks with limited case counts
- Unclear scalability with current 100-example memory bank and fixed context windows
- Context window constraints may create scalability bottlenecks despite claimed robustness to truncation

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Core retrospective summarization mechanism and superiority over incremental methods
- **Medium confidence:** Evolving strategy's contribution to error reduction, requiring more extensive validation
- **Medium confidence:** 92.3% error reduction claim based on limited case studies needing broader validation

## Next Checks
1. Validate reflection module effectiveness by measuring performance with and without retrieved experiences on a held-out validation set
2. Stress-test memory bank scalability by evaluating RETROSUM with varying memory bank sizes (10, 50, 100, 200 examples)
3. Analyze error type distributions across all six error types on a larger sample (50+ cases per task) to verify claimed error reduction patterns
