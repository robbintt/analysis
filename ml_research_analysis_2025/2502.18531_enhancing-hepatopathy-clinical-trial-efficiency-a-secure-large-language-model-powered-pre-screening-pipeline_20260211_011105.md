# Enhancing Hepatopathy Clinical Trial Efficiency: A Secure, Large Language Model-Powered Pre-Screening Pipeline

## Quick Facts

- Introduces secure LLM-powered pipeline for hepatopathy clinical trial pre-screening

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a secure pipeline for pre-screening hepatopathy clinical trial candidates using local large language models (LLMs). The system decomposes complex eligibility criteria into simpler questions, then applies two distinct pathways for processing: Pathway A uses anthropomorphized expert roles with chain-of-thought reasoning, while Pathway B employs preset-stance agent collaboration with debate-and-arbitrate mechanisms. Both approaches achieve high precision in matching patients to clinical trial criteria while maintaining data security through local deployment.

## Method Summary
The pipeline first decomposes 58 complex eligibility criteria into 87 simpler questions using external closed-source LLMs. For processing, Pathway A assigns three anthropomorphized expert roles (Clinical Research Coordinator, Junior Doctor, Information Engineer) to each question with majority voting, while Pathway B uses three agents with preset stances (Proponent, Opponent, Judge) who debate and arbitrate. The system runs locally on 4× RTX 3090 GPUs, achieving high precision while maintaining data security by avoiding cloud API dependencies for the core processing.

## Key Results
- Pathway A achieved 0.877 precision at question level and 0.922 at criterion level
- Pathway B achieved 0.892 precision at question level and 0.920 at criterion level
- Processing time: Pathway A (0.44s per task) vs Pathway B (2.5s+ per task)
- Strong performance in hepatocellular carcinoma trials (0.878) and cirrhosis trials (0.843)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing complex eligibility criteria into simpler questions improves LLM accuracy on clinical trial screening.
- Mechanism: External LLMs convert 58 criteria into 87 simpler questions, transforming multi-step logical inference into straightforward semantic matching tasks.
- Core assumption: Local open-source LLMs struggle with complex reasoning but perform adequately on simpler question-answering tasks.
- Evidence anchors: "The pipeline breaks down complex criteria into a series of composite questions" [abstract]; "leveraging advanced non-open-source LLMs... to decompose complex eligibility criteria into simpler and manageable questions" [Methods].

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Anthropomorphized expert roles with chain-of-thought prompting improve extraction accuracy while maintaining speed.
- Mechanism: Three roles apply domain-specific attention patterns; majority vote aggregates perspectives, reducing individual role biases.
- Core assumption: Role-specific prompting constrains LLM attention to relevant EHR sections and reduces hallucination through explicit reasoning steps.
- Evidence anchors: Pathway A achieved 0.877 precision at question level, 0.922 at criterion level; processing times: CRC 0.588s, JD 0.395s, IE 0.340s per question.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Preset-stance agent collaboration with debate-and-arbitrate structure improves performance on complex classification tasks.
- Mechanism: Three agents assume opposing positions; forced debate surfaces overlooked evidence; Judge resolves disagreements, optionally triggering second evaluation round.
- Core assumption: Adversarial framing compels LLMs to consider counterfactuals and reduces confirmation bias.
- Evidence anchors: Pathway B achieved highest precision (0.892 question level, 0.920 criterion level) and lowest counterfactual inference rate (0.25%); excelled in "Etiology and Pathology" (0.921) and "Symptom and Event" (0.847) categories.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting**
  - Why needed here: Complex clinical criteria require multi-step reasoning; local LLMs lack implicit medical reasoning capabilities.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why "Let's think step by step" alone was insufficient for this task?

- Concept: **Agent Collaboration Frameworks**
  - Why needed here: Single LLM responses are prone to hallucination and bias; multi-agent debate provides error-correction through adversarial review.
  - Quick check question: What is the theoretical justification for preset stances (positive/negative assumption) improving output quality?

- Concept: **Criterion vs Question Level Aggregation**
  - Why needed here: Multiple questions map to one criterion via logical rules; understanding this distinction is essential for interpreting precision metrics correctly.
  - Quick check question: Why might high question-level precision not translate to equivalent criterion-level precision?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Criteria Converter (external LLMs) → Question generation → Pathway selection → Local LLM inference → Rule-based aggregation → Precision evaluation

- Critical path: Criteria conversion (offline, one-time using external APIs) → Question generation → Pathway selection → Local LLM inference → Rule-based aggregation → Precision evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pathway A: 5-7× faster but slightly lower precision on complex tasks; best for explicit diagnosis/intervention extraction
  - Pathway B: Higher precision on classification tasks, lower counterfactual error rate, but 2.5s+ per question
  - Local vs cloud deployment: Data security preserved but limits model capability; requires prompt engineering to compensate

- Failure signatures:
  - Over-inference (observed with BAICHUAN): Model extrapolates beyond evidence
  - Constraint drift (observed with GLM): Fails to adhere to output format or logical bounds
  - False negatives (observed with QWEN2): Conservative responses miss valid matches
  - Stance collapse (risk in Pathway B): Both proponent and opponent converge to same conclusion without genuine debate

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate criteria decomposition quality: Manually review a sample of 87 generated questions against original 58 criteria to confirm semantic equivalence and absence of ambiguity.
  2. Benchmark single-pathway performance on held-out subset: Run 400 records (10% of dataset) through Pathway A only, Pathway B only, and hybrid to quantify precision/latency tradeoffs on your hardware.
  3. Stress-test counterfactual scenarios: Inject EHR records with deliberately contradictory information to evaluate Pathway B's adjudication robustness and identify failure modes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- External API dependency for criteria decomposition creates potential bottleneck for adoption
- Dataset representativeness limited to hepatopathy trials; generalization to other therapeutic areas unverified
- Temporal and dynamic reasoning capabilities not explicitly tested or reported
- Explainability gaps in decision-making process for complex criteria

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Criterion-level precision metrics (0.921) and fundamental architecture are well-supported by results
- **Medium Confidence**: Comparative advantage of Pathway A vs Pathway B depends heavily on task type
- **Medium Confidence**: Data security claims reasonable given intranet deployment, but external API dependency creates potential vulnerability
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization to other therapeutic areas and handling of temporal/dynamic criteria are speculative

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Domain Generalization Test: Apply pipeline to 100+ records from non-hepatopathy clinical trials to measure precision degradation and identify domain-specific failure modes.

2. Temporal Reasoning Benchmark: Construct test suite with 50+ records containing explicit temporal eligibility criteria to evaluate pipeline's ability to handle time-based constraints.

3. Cost-Benefit Analysis: Calculate total operational costs for 6-month deployment with 10,000 patient screenings and compare against traditional manual screening approaches.
