# Multilingual Sentiment Analysis of Summarized Texts: A Cross-Language Study of Text Shortening Effects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.00265
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00265
- Reference count: 35
- Languages with rich inflectional morphology experienced greater accuracy drops (up to 10%) compared to English or German during summarization

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how text summarization impacts sentiment analysis accuracy across eight languages with varying morphological complexities. The research compares extractive and abstractive summarization methods using multilingual models (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and language-specific models (FinBERT, AraBERT). Results demonstrate that extractive summarization better preserves sentiment, particularly in morphologically complex languages like Finnish, Hungarian, and Arabic, while abstractive methods improve readability but introduce sentiment distortion. The study proposes hybrid summarization approaches to balance readability and sentiment preservation, with practical implications for social media monitoring and market analysis applications.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates sentiment preservation across eight languages using both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. Researchers employed multilingual transformer models (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and language-specific models (FinBERT, AraBERT) on parallel datasets. Performance was measured through accuracy, F1-score, and human evaluation of readability and sentiment preservation. The analysis systematically compared sentiment analysis performance before and after summarization, with particular attention to morphologically complex languages versus simpler morphological structures.

## Key Results
- Extractive summarization better preserves sentiment accuracy, especially in morphologically complex languages like Finnish, Hungarian, and Arabic
- Abstractive summarization improves readability but introduces sentiment distortion, with accuracy drops up to 10% in inflectional languages
- Languages with rich inflectional morphology experienced significantly greater sentiment analysis degradation compared to English or German

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of extractive summarization in preserving sentiment stems from its direct selection of original text segments, maintaining the linguistic markers and contextual cues critical for sentiment detection. In morphologically complex languages, these markers are embedded within word structures and inflections that abstractive methods may lose during paraphrasing. Abstractive summarization's readability improvements come from generating more fluent, coherent text, but this process risks altering sentiment-carrying phrases through rewording or omission. The morphological complexity factor amplifies these effects because sentiment indicators in inflectional languages are more deeply integrated into word forms rather than existing as separate tokens.

## Foundational Learning
- **Morphological complexity**: Why needed - determines how sentiment markers are distributed in language structure; Quick check - identify languages with rich inflectional systems vs. analytical languages
- **Extractive vs. abstractive summarization**: Why needed - different approaches have distinct trade-offs for sentiment preservation; Quick check - evaluate whether method preserves original sentiment-carrying phrases
- **Cross-lingual transfer learning**: Why needed - enables model application across multiple languages with varying resources; Quick check - verify model performance consistency across language families
- **Sentiment analysis metrics**: Why needed - accuracy and F1-score may not capture all aspects of sentiment preservation; Quick check - combine automated metrics with human evaluation
- **Hybrid summarization techniques**: Why needed - combines benefits of both methods while mitigating individual weaknesses; Quick check - test whether hybrid approaches maintain sentiment while improving readability

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Text -> Summarization Method (Extractive/Abstractive/Hybrid) -> Sentiment Analysis Model (mBERT/XLM-RoBERTa/FinBERT/AraBERT) -> Sentiment Classification Output

Critical Path: The core workflow follows: raw text → summarization transformation → sentiment feature extraction → classification → accuracy evaluation. Performance bottlenecks occur primarily in the summarization stage where morphological complexity affects feature preservation.

Design Tradeoffs: Extractive methods preserve sentiment better but produce less readable output, while abstractive methods improve readability but risk sentiment distortion. Hybrid approaches attempt to balance these competing objectives but require careful design to avoid compounding errors from both methods.

Failure Signatures: Sentiment accuracy degradation manifests as systematic shifts in polarity classification, particularly for morphologically complex languages where inflectional markers are lost. Readability improvements may mask underlying sentiment distortions, requiring separate evaluation metrics.

First Experiments: 1) Baseline comparison of raw vs. summarized text sentiment accuracy across all languages, 2) Ablation study removing morphological features to test their impact on sentiment preservation, 3) Human evaluation of sentiment preservation in hybrid summaries versus pure methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the generalizability of findings across additional languages and domains, the development of more sophisticated hybrid approaches that can dynamically adapt to language-specific morphological characteristics, and the potential for incorporating syntactic and semantic preservation metrics alongside sentiment analysis. The research also raises questions about how different text domains (social media, news, reviews) might affect the relationship between summarization method and sentiment preservation.

## Limitations
- Small sample sizes for morphologically complex languages, particularly Finnish and Hungarian datasets, may not fully represent linguistic diversity
- Focus primarily on sentiment preservation without comprehensive semantic content retention analysis
- Performance gaps may be influenced by dataset-specific characteristics rather than universal linguistic principles
- Proposed hybrid approach remains theoretical without empirical validation through implementation and testing

## Confidence
- Extractive summarization better preserves sentiment in morphologically complex languages: **High** confidence
- Abstractive summarization improves readability while introducing sentiment distortion: **Medium** confidence
- Hybrid summarization approaches balance readability and sentiment preservation: **Low** confidence pending implementation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments testing the proposed hybrid summarization approach on the same multilingual datasets to empirically validate performance improvements over pure extractive or abstractive methods
2. Expand dataset sizes for morphologically complex languages and include additional low-resource languages to strengthen generalizability of the morphological complexity-sentiment preservation relationship
3. Implement comprehensive semantic content analysis alongside sentiment evaluation to assess overall information retention and identify specific linguistic features most vulnerable to summarization loss
