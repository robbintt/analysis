# Zero-Shot Commonsense Validation and Reasoning with Large Language Models: An Evaluation on SemEval-2020 Task 4 Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15810
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15810
- Authors: Rawand Alfugaha; Mohammad AL-Smadi
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: LLaMA3-70B achieved 98.40% accuracy on Task A (validation) and 93.40% on Task B (explanation), outperforming previous fine-tuned models in validation but struggling with explanation selection

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) on commonsense reasoning tasks from the SemEval-2020 Task 4 dataset using zero-shot prompting without fine-tuning. The study tests LLaMA3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Mixtral-8x7B on two tasks: commonsense validation (identifying implausible statements) and commonsense explanation (selecting the best reasoning for implausibility). LLaMA3-70B achieved the highest accuracy of 98.40% in Task A, while Mixtral-8x7B showed the weakest performance at 66.00%. For Task B, models generally performed worse, with LLaMA3-70B at 93.40% and Mixtral-8x7B at 50.90%, indicating challenges in causal reasoning. The results show that larger LLMs outperform previous fine-tuned models in validation but struggle with explanation selection, highlighting limitations in inferential reasoning. The study concludes that while LLMs excel at commonsense validation, they require further adaptation to improve explanation generation.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates zero-shot prompting on SemEval-2020 Task 4 using LLaMA3-70B, LLaMA3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and Mixtral-8x7B models via GroqCloud API. Task A requires identifying which of two statements violates commonsense, while Task B involves selecting the correct explanation from three options for why a statement is implausible. Models are prompted with templatic prompts without any fine-tuning or gradient updates. Output parsing is required to handle format inconsistencies, particularly Mixtral's tendency to generate verbose explanations instead of simple labels. Accuracy is computed against gold labels for both tasks.

## Key Results
- LLaMA3-70B achieved the highest accuracy of 98.40% in Task A (validation)
- Task B explanation selection performance was significantly lower, with LLaMA3-70B at 93.40% and Mixtral-8x7B at 50.90%
- Larger models consistently outperformed smaller ones, with LLaMA3-8B scoring only 84.4% on Task A
- Zero-shot LLMs outperformed previous fine-tuned models on Task A but lagged behind on Task B (93.40% vs 95.0% for best fine-tuned model)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Model scale correlates with commonsense validation accuracy in zero-shot settings
- Mechanism: Larger parameter count (70B vs 8B) appears to encode richer statistical patterns from pretraining data, enabling better recognition of implausible statements without explicit task training
- Core assumption: The performance gain is primarily attributable to scale rather than architectural differences or data quality
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "results indicate that larger models outperform previous models and perform closely to human evaluation for Task A, with LLaMA3-70B achieving the highest accuracy of 98.40%"
  - [section 4.1] "The smaller L3-8B (LLaMA3-8B) demonstrates significantly weaker performance than its larger version, with 84.4% in Task A and 83.1% in Task B"
  - [corpus] Related work on LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA suggests benchmark limitations may obscure whether models handle jointly plausible vs. mutually exclusive interpretations; this complicates scale-effect attribution
- Break condition: If smaller models with architectural innovations (e.g., retrieval-augmented or knowledge-graph-enhanced) match or exceed 70B performance, scale alone is insufficient as explanation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Surface-level implausibility detection is mechanistically distinct from causal explanation selection
- Mechanism: Task A (binary validation) requires pattern matching against learned world knowledge, while Task B (explanation) requires explicit cause-effect reasoning chains that zero-shot prompts may not elicit reliably
- Core assumption: The accuracy gap reflects a reasoning limitation rather than prompt design failure
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "while models effectively identify implausible statements, they face challenges in selecting the most relevant explanation, highlighting limitations in causal and inferential reasoning"
  - [section 4.2] "current zero-shot approaches may capture surface-level plausibility but lack deeper reasoning abilities necessary for explanation generation"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence on causal mechanism differences; related benchmarks (HellaSwag-Pro) investigate robustness to question variations but do not isolate explanation vs. detection
- Break condition: If improved prompting strategies (e.g., chain-of-thought) close the Task A-Task B gap without architecture changes, the limitation is prompt elicitation, not reasoning capacity

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuned models with external knowledge graphs retain advantage in explanation tasks
- Mechanism: Structured knowledge (ConceptNet triples) integrated during training provides explicit relational reasoning paths that zero-shot LLMs must infer implicitly
- Core assumption: The SemEval-2020 fine-tuned model comparisons remain valid baselines despite dataset size constraints (1,000 test entries per task)
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] CN-HIT-IT.NLP and ECNU-SenseMaker "integrat[ed] knowledge graphs, specifically ConceptNet, which allows it to extract relevant triples that enhance the understanding of language representations"
  - [section 4.1] LLaMA3-70B "performance in Task B (93.4%) lags behind the transformer-based models reported as top 4 performing models"
  - [corpus] Related work (Toroghi et al., 2024, cited in paper) on knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs is mentioned as future direction but not directly evaluated here
- Break condition: If zero-shot LLMs with in-context retrieved knowledge graph triples match fine-tuned performance, structured training is not the decisive factor

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Zero-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: The methodology relies entirely on prompting pre-trained models without gradient updates; understanding prompt design and output parsing is essential for reproducibility
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why zero-shot evaluation requires strict output format enforcement (e.g., handling Mixtral's verbose responses)?

- Concept: Commonsense knowledge representation
  - Why needed here: The distinction between validation (does this violate commonsense?) and explanation (why?) maps to different knowledge access patterns
  - Quick check question: Given the example "He put an elephant into the fridge," what knowledge (size, object permanence, typical fridge capacity) is required for Task A vs. Task B?

- Concept: Evaluation benchmark design
  - Why needed here: SemEval-2020 Task 4 uses constrained test sets; understanding what accuracy numbers mean (and don't mean) in small-sample contexts is critical
  - Quick check question: A model scores 93.4% on a 1,000-item test. What confidence interval should you report, and what additional metrics would reveal failure modes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input preprocessing (templatic prompts) -> Model inference (GroqCloud API) -> Output parsing (label extraction) -> Evaluation (accuracy calculation)
- Critical path: Prompt template design → output format enforcement → post-processing for non-compliant responses → accuracy calculation. The paper identifies Mixtral's low scores (50.9% Task B) as artifact of format failures, not reasoning failures.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot vs. fine-tuning: Zero-shot sacrifices ~1-2% Task B accuracy for deployment flexibility
  - Model size vs. latency: 70B models achieve best results but require significant inference resources
  - Strict output parsing vs. flexible interpretation: Strict parsing enables automated evaluation but may undercount correct reasoning expressed in unexpected formats
- Failure signatures:
  - Task A errors: Subtle semantic confusions (e.g., "dog pounced on rabbit" vs. "cat pounced on rabbit") suggesting reliance on surface patterns over deep semantics
  - Task B errors: Selecting plausible-but-not-best explanations, indicating difficulty ranking causal relevance
  - Format failures: Models generating explanations when only labels requested (Mixtral)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce Task A and Task B accuracy with the specified prompt templates on the open SemEval-2020 test set; verify format compliance rates per model
  2. Add chain-of-thought prompting to Task B; measure whether explicit reasoning steps improve explanation selection accuracy
  3. Retrieve ConceptNet triples relevant to each Task B instance and include them in-context; compare against zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines to isolate knowledge graph contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can integrating commonsense knowledge graphs with LLMs improve performance on explanation selection tasks (Task B) to match or exceed fine-tuned transformer models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "Future research may include exploring Commonsense knowledge-graph LLMs... to enhance the inferential reasoning capabilities of LLMs in zero-shot settings."
- Why unresolved: The paper shows LLMs lag behind fine-tuned models on Task B (93.40% vs 95.0% for ECNU-SenseMaker), and prior work showed knowledge graph integration improved performance, but this has not been tested with modern LLMs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating LLaMA3-70B with and without commonsense knowledge graph integration on Task B, measuring whether the gap to fine-tuned models closes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific mechanisms cause the performance gap between validation (Task A: 98.40%) and explanation selection (Task B: 93.40%) in large LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note models "recognize implausible statements but fail to select the most relevant explanation, highlighting deficits in causal and inferential reasoning" but do not identify the root cause.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the gap exists and hypothesizes it relates to surface-level plausibility detection versus deeper causal reasoning, but does not isolate which model capabilities differ between the tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A probing study analyzing internal representations during Task A versus Task B, or ablation experiments testing whether models can generate correct explanations even when they select incorrect ones.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or structured prompting techniques improve zero-shot LLM performance on explanation selection beyond simple prompting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion recommends: "fine-tuning strategies, retrieval-augmented approaches, and structured prompting techniques to enhance the inferential reasoning capabilities of LLMs in zero-shot settings."
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates simple zero-shot prompting and does not test whether providing external knowledge retrieval or structured reasoning prompts would improve Task B performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing baseline zero-shot prompting against RAG-augmented and chain-of-thought prompting approaches on Task B, measuring accuracy improvements.

## Limitations
- Zero-shot constraint: Results depend heavily on prompt design quality; small prompt variations could significantly affect accuracy, particularly for Task B where models already struggle
- Dataset size: Evaluation uses only 1,000 test instances per task, limiting statistical power for fine-grained error analysis and confidence interval estimation
- Task B evaluation granularity: The paper doesn't provide breakdown of which explanation types (A, B, C) models consistently miss, limiting interpretability of reasoning failures

## Confidence
- High confidence: Task A validation accuracy (98.40% LLaMA3-70B) - clear methodology and results with strong consistency across model scales
- Medium confidence: Scale-performance correlation - results show clear trend but confounding factors like architectural differences and data quality aren't fully controlled
- Medium confidence: Task B accuracy (93.40% LLaMA3-70B) - results are reported but performance gap with Task A and format issues with Mixtral introduce uncertainty about true reasoning capability

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt robustness testing**: Systematically vary prompt templates (temperature, explicit reasoning instructions) for Task B to determine if the 93.40% accuracy reflects true reasoning capability or prompt sensitivity
2. **Fine-grained error analysis**: Break down Task B failures by explanation type (A/B/C) and identify specific semantic categories where models consistently select incorrect explanations
3. **Knowledge graph integration test**: Evaluate whether in-context retrieval of relevant ConceptNet triples for Task B instances can close the gap between zero-shot LLMs and fine-tuned knowledge-graph-augmented models
