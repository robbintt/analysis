# A Deep Learning-Driven Inhalation Injury Grading Assistant Using Bronchoscopy Images

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.08517
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08517
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** GoogLeNet + CUT augmentation achieves 97.8% classification accuracy on inhalation injury grading

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of objectively grading inhalation injuries in burn patients by developing a deep learning-based diagnosis assistant using bronchoscopy images. Traditional grading methods like the Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) are subjective and poorly correlate with clinical outcomes. The proposed system employs data augmentation techniques including graphic transformations, CycleGAN, and Contrastive Unpaired Translation (CUT) to overcome limited medical imaging data. GoogLeNet and Vision Transformer models are fine-tuned on augmented datasets, with GoogLeNet + CUT achieving the highest classification accuracy of 97.8%. The approach leverages mechanical ventilation duration as an objective grading standard, providing comprehensive diagnostic support for improved patient care.

## Method Summary
The system uses 236 bronchoscopy images from 22 patients to classify inhalation injury severity into six grades based on mechanical ventilation duration. Data augmentation is performed through graphic transformations (scaling, rotation, reflection) and generative models (CycleGAN, CUT) using one-vs-all partitioning. GoogLeNet and Vision Transformer models are fine-tuned with transfer learning from ImageNet. Classification performance is evaluated on accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Explainability is provided through Grad-CAM heatmaps and PCA visualizations of feature space separability.

## Key Results
- GoogLeNet combined with CUT augmentation achieves 97.8% classification accuracy, outperforming other configurations
- PCA visualizations demonstrate CUT substantially enhances class separability in feature space compared to original and CycleGAN-generated images
- Grad-CAM analyses show CUT-generated images shift model attention toward clinically relevant inner bronchus walls rather than spurious correlations
- Vision Transformer performs significantly worse on original data but improves substantially with CUT augmentation (96.7% accuracy)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
CUT improves classification accuracy by enhancing class separability through patch-wise contrastive losses during image generation, creating sharper feature boundaries in latent space. This forces the classifier to learn robust, separable features rather than memorizing noise. Evidence shows CUT-generated images form distinct, well-separated clusters in PCA visualizations compared to other augmentation methods.

### Mechanism 2
Data augmentation via CUT redirects model attention from spurious correlations (e.g., bronchial holes) to clinically relevant regions (inner bronchus walls). The synthetic images maintain textural integrity while altering structural layout, preventing overfitting to fixed anatomical shapes. Grad-CAM mean intensity for CUT heatmaps (119.6) significantly exceeds original datasets (98.8), indicating focus on diagnostic regions.

### Mechanism 3
Transfer learning combined with domain-specific augmentation allows deep architectures to overcome small dataset limitations. Pre-trained weights from ImageNet provide baseline feature extraction, while fine-tuning on CUT-augmented data adapts these features to bronchoscopy without catastrophic forgetting. GoogLeNet + CUT achieves 97.8% accuracy, demonstrating effectiveness for limited medical imaging data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Unpaired Translation (CUT)**
  - Why needed: Core mechanism for data generation using patch-wise contrastive losses to maintain medical validity
  - Quick check: How does CUT differ from CycleGAN in terms of cycle consistency versus patch-wise contrastive loss?

- **Concept: Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)**
  - Why needed: Primary tool for explainability to validate if AI focuses on injury or anatomy
  - Quick check: Does higher mean intensity in Grad-CAM heatmap guarantee correct diagnosis or just high model confidence?

- **Concept: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Feature Visualization**
  - Why needed: Proves augmented data creates separable clusters in feature space
  - Quick check: If PCA plots of two injury grades overlap significantly, what does this imply about classifier error rate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Bronchoscopy Images) → Augmentation Pipeline (Graphic Transforms → CUT/CycleGAN) → Classification Backbone (GoogLeNet/ViT) → Interpretability Layer (Grad-CAM, PCA)

- **Critical path:** The CUT Augmentation phase is most critical. If synthetic images don't faithfully represent pathology, high accuracy is meaningless.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - GoogLeNet vs. ViT: GoogLeNet more robust for smaller, diverse sets (97.8% with CUT); ViT requires more data to stabilize
  - One-vs-All Partitioning: Helps GAN learn "Grade X vs. Not Grade X" but may dilute specific features of "Not Grade X"

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Accuracy + Low Clinical Correlation: Model highlights non-biological artifacts (scope edges, text overlays)
  - PCA Overlap: Original and CUT data drifting apart significantly indicates augmentation distorted biological features

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train GoogLeNet on raw 236 images (no augmentation) to establish performance floor
  2. Train GoogLeNet using only graphic transformations vs. only CUT; compare confusion matrices
  3. Run inference on CUT-generated image and original source; overlay Grad-CAM heatmaps to verify consistent focus

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the deep learning assistant be successfully operationalized in real-world clinical workflows?
- How does integration of additional imaging modalities affect classification accuracy?
- Can high classification accuracy be maintained when applied to external datasets from different medical centers?
- Is mechanical ventilation duration a robust ground truth for visual injury severity?

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size (22 patients, 236 images) raises concerns about overfitting and generalizability
- Potential data leakage if patient-level separation not properly enforced between train/test splits
- Mechanical ventilation duration as ground truth introduces temporal confounders unrelated to visual injury appearance

## Confidence
- **High:** CUT augmentation effectiveness in creating separable feature clusters (supported by PCA visualizations)
- **Medium:** Clinical relevance of Grad-CAM attention shifts (correlation with actual injury pathology remains indirect)
- **Medium:** Choice of mechanical ventilation duration as objective grading standard (temporal confounders not controlled)

## Next Checks
1. Re-run experiment with confirmed patient-level train/test splits to prevent data leakage
2. Compare CUT-generated images against ground truth pathology reviews by clinicians to verify diagnostic feature preservation
3. Test model performance on external dataset or through temporal validation to assess generalizability beyond initial patient cohort
