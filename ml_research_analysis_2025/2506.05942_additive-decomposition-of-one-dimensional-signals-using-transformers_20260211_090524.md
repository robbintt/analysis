# Additive decomposition of one-dimensional signals using Transformers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.05942
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05942
- Reference count: 7
- The TSD model achieves lower RMSE (2.999) than VSD (4.780) on average

## Executive Summary
This work proposes TSD (Transformer-based Signal Decomposition), a novel method for additive decomposition of one-dimensional signals using Transformers. The model decomposes input signals into four components: piecewise constant, smooth (low-frequency oscillatory), textured (high-frequency oscillatory), and noise. Trained on synthetic data, TSD demonstrates superior accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art variational method (VSD), achieving lower RMSE while being significantly faster and requiring no per-signal hyperparameter tuning. The authors release a large synthetic dataset with ground-truth components to foster further research.

## Method Summary
The TSD model processes 1D signals through a hybrid architecture combining 1D convolutions with a Transformer encoder. Input signals are optionally chunked into segments, projected to a higher-dimensional embedding space via convolution, and combined with sinusoidal positional encodings. A 4-layer Transformer encoder with multi-head self-attention processes the sequence, learning global dependencies across the signal. The output is processed through a convolutional head to produce predictions for all four components simultaneously. The model is trained end-to-end using supervised learning with a loss function that sums MSE across all components, leveraging synthetic training data generated from specified mathematical models.

## Key Results
- TSD achieves average RMSE of 2.999 vs 4.780 for VSD on synthetic test data
- Two variants: "no chunks" (L=M=512) for highest accuracy, "chunks" (L=128, S=4) for efficiency
- TSD requires no per-signal hyperparameter tuning unlike variational methods
- Ablation study validates hybrid convolution-Transformer design

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Global Context via Self-Attention
Self-attention mechanisms enable the model to learn dependencies across the entire signal, allowing it to distinguish global patterns (trends) from local patterns (texture/noise) more effectively than convolutional approaches. The multi-head self-attention operation computes relationships between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, providing a global view that helps identify piecewise constant components by correlating distant segments and distinguishing them from high-frequency oscillatory components with different correlation profiles.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Head Specialization via Supervised Decomposition
The model's multiple attention heads and layers learn to specialize in detecting different types of signal components through end-to-end supervised training. The loss function, defined as the sum of MSE for each of the four ground-truth components, guides different parts of the network to become feature detectors for specific frequency bands or structural patterns, with the final linear layer aggregating these learned features.

### Mechanism 3: Feature Extraction via Hybrid Convolution-Transformer
Combining 1D convolutions with a Transformer encoder allows the model to effectively handle both local signal features and long-range dependencies. The input pipeline uses 1D convolutions as initial feature extractors to capture local patterns, which are then passed to the Transformer encoder for modeling global relationships. Ablation study results show that convolutional projections outperform other pooling methods, validating the importance of this feature extraction stage.

## Foundational Learning

- **Signal Decomposition as an Additive Model**: The entire premise is based on the assumption that observed signals are sums of distinct components with different mathematical properties. Quick check: If a signal f is composed of a trend s and noise n, how would the TSD model's output for the other components (c, o) ideally look?

- **Self-Attention and Positional Encoding**: Transformers use self-attention, which is permutation-equivariant and processes input tokens as a set, ignoring order. Positional encodings are necessary to provide sequential information to the model for order-dependent decomposition. Quick check: Why would a Transformer fail to decompose a signal correctly if you removed the positional encoding step?

- **Synthetic-to-Real Generalization**: The model is trained exclusively on synthetic data generated by a specific mathematical process. Understanding the in-distribution assumption is crucial for applying it to real-world data where the true decomposition may not perfectly match the synthetic model. Quick check: What is the primary risk when applying this TSD model to a real-world signal whose components do not strictly follow the piecewise constant / smooth / oscillatory definitions used in the synthetic dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw Signal (M) -> Input Chunking/Projection -> (+ Pos. Encode) -> Transformer Encoder -> Output Head -> 4 Components
- **Critical path**: Raw Signal (M) → Input Chunking/Projection (→ L tokens, D dims) → (+ Pos. Encode) → Transformer Encoder (L x D → L x D) → Output Head (→ M, 4). The most computationally intensive step is self-attention within the encoder, which scales as O(L² × D).
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **No Chunks vs. Chunks**: No Chunks (L=M): Best overall accuracy, highest memory and compute cost (O(M²)). Best for shorter signals where resources permit. Chunks (L<M): Lower memory and faster inference. Better at estimating high-frequency oscillatory component. Slightly worse overall RMSE. Best for longer signals or resource-constrained environments.
  - **Loss Function**: Uses simple MSE for each component. May not perfectly capture perceptual or domain-specific qualities of the decomposition.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Distribution Shift**: Performance will likely degrade if applied to signals with components outside the training distribution (e.g., different frequency bands, non-Gaussian noise).
  - **Oscillatory Component Error (in "no chunks" variant)**: The "no chunks" variant, while best overall, is the worst at predicting the high-frequency o component compared to the chunked variant.
  - **Component Leakage**: The model might fail to perfectly separate components, leading to one component's features "leaking" into another's prediction.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce Ablation on Mini-Dataset: Generate a small dataset (2k train, 500 val, 500 test) and train both TSD no chunks and TSD chunks variants. Verify that no chunks achieves lower average RMSE but chunks is better on the oscillatory component (o).
  2. Test Generalization to Unseen Blending: Train on the full dataset but create a held-out test set with blending factors not present in the training set. Measure RMSE to test the model's ability to generalize to new mixtures of the same components.
  3. Ensemble Model: Implement the proposed ensemble strategy: use the TSD chunks model's prediction for the oscillatory component (o) and the TSD no chunks model's predictions for all other components (c, s, n). Evaluate if this hybrid approach achieves the best overall performance on the full test set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can the TSD model maintain its performance when applied to real-world signals that deviate from the specific synthetic distributions (e.g., fixed SNR, specific frequency bands) used for training?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion suggests "employing more complex and real-world datasets" as a future avenue; [inferred] Section 5 validates the model exclusively on synthetic data "from the same distribution".
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not evaluate the model on out-of-distribution data or real-world benchmarks, leaving the generalization capability unproven beyond the synthetic environment.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Quantitative results (RMSE) from testing the pre-trained TSD model on real-world datasets (e.g., physiological or financial signals) compared against variational methods.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the Transformer decoder architecture be utilized to improve decomposition accuracy by framing the task as a generative problem?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 3 states: "We note here that also the decoder part of the architecture could be used here... We leave the exploration of such research path to future work."
- **Why unresolved**: The proposed TSD uses only the Transformer encoder; the potential benefits or drawbacks of using the decoder for this specific signal processing task were not investigated.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An ablation study comparing the current encoder-only model against an encoder-decoder or decoder-only architecture on the same synthetic dataset.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can the TSD approach be adapted to decompose multidimensional signals while managing the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion lists "extending the approach to multidimensional signals" as a potential avenue for exploration.
- **Why unresolved**: The current mathematical formulation (Eq. 1) and architecture are strictly designed for one-dimensional inputs ($f \in R^M$), and extending to higher dimensions increases computational cost significantly.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A modified TSD architecture capable of processing 2D or 3D inputs, along with a performance and runtime analysis compared to multidimensional variational baselines.

## Limitations
- Model performance is contingent on training data distribution with specific component characteristics and noise levels
- Transformer's O(L²) computational complexity limits scalability to longer signals
- Strong performance relies on assumption that signals follow additive model with specific component types used in training

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The proposed architecture and training methodology are technically sound and the synthetic data generation process is clearly specified
- **Medium confidence**: Comparative performance against VSD is compelling but relies on synthetic data where ground truth is known
- **Low confidence**: Claims about generalization to unseen signal distributions or performance on signals significantly different from training data are not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. **Distribution Shift Test**: Create a test set with signals containing components outside the training distribution (e.g., different frequency bands, non-Gaussian noise, or signals longer than 512 samples) and measure decomposition quality degradation.
2. **Real-World Application**: Apply the trained TSD model to a real-world signal (e.g., physiological signal, financial time series) and qualitatively assess whether the decomposed components are interpretable and useful, even without ground truth.
3. **Scalability Analysis**: Implement the chunked variant and systematically evaluate its performance and memory usage on signals of increasing length (e.g., 1024, 2048, 4096 samples) to quantify the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.
