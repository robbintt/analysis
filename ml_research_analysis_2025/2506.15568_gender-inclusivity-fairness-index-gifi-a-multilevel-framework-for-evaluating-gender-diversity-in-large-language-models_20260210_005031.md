# Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI): A Multilevel Framework for Evaluating Gender Diversity in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.15568
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15568
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Evaluates 22 LLMs across 7 gender fairness dimensions, showing newer models (GPT-4o, Claude 3, DeepSeek V3) achieve GIFI scores of 73-71, while older models (GPT-2, Vicuna) score 55-49, with persistent struggles on neopronouns and occupational bias.

## Executive Summary
The Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI) introduces a comprehensive, multi-level framework for evaluating gender fairness in large language models across binary and non-binary pronouns. The framework assesses seven dimensions: pronoun recognition, sentiment and toxicity neutrality, counterfactual fairness, stereotypical and occupational fairness, and performance equality. Experiments on 22 diverse LLMs reveal significant variability in gender inclusivity, with newer models showing marked improvements but persistent challenges with neopronouns and occupational bias. The framework provides both quantitative scores and diagnostic insights into specific failure modes, enabling targeted improvements in model fairness.

## Method Summary
GIFI evaluates gender fairness through seven metrics organized into four progressive stages: (1) Pronoun Recognition using GDR with CV-based consistency scoring, (2) Fairness in Distribution using sentiment neutrality, toxicity scoring, and counterfactual fairness via embedding similarity, (3) Stereotype/Role Assignment measuring stereotypical and occupational pronoun distributions, and (4) Consistency in Performance evaluating mathematical reasoning across pronoun variants. The framework uses 11 pronoun groups (binary, neutral, and 8 neopronouns) across 2,200+ prompts adapted from TANGO, RealToxicityPrompts, and GSM8K datasets. Models generate outputs at temperature 0.95, which are then analyzed using external classifiers and embedding similarity metrics to compute final GIFI scores.

## Key Results
- Newer models (GPT-4o, Claude 3, DeepSeek V3) achieve highest GIFI scores (73-71), while older models (GPT-2, Vicuna) score much lower (55-49)
- Even advanced models struggle with neopronouns, achieving only ~0.50 accuracy versus 0.90+ for binary pronouns
- Models exhibit persistent biases in stereotype and occupation associations, with newer models sometimes overcorrecting by over-generating "she" in professional contexts
- Neopronouns are entirely absent in stereotypical and occupational association tasks where models must choose pronouns without prompting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A multi-level evaluation hierarchy exposes different depths of gender bias by progressing from surface recognition to cognitive reasoning. Tests are organized into four stages (Pronoun Recognition → Fairness in Distribution → Stereotype/Role Assignment → Performance Equality). Each stage probes progressively deeper representations. A model that passes Stage 1 (correctly continuing "xe went to...") may still fail Stage 3 (never generating neopronouns spontaneously in occupational contexts). Core assumption: Bias operates at multiple levels of linguistic and cognitive processing, not just token-level pronoun handling.

### Mechanism 2
The coefficient of variation (CV) normalizes fairness scores across pronoun groups with vastly different base accuracies, enabling meaningful comparison. GDR and PE metrics compute `1 / (1 + CV)` where `CV = σ/μ` (standard deviation over mean accuracy across pronoun groups). This penalizes inconsistent performance: a model with accuracies [0.90, 0.90, 0.90] scores higher than [0.99, 0.99, 0.50] even though the latter has higher peak performance. Core assumption: Fairness requires consistency, not just high average performance on dominant categories.

### Mechanism 3
Counterfactual testing via pronoun swapping in identical semantic contexts isolates gender-based output divergence. For paired prompts differing only in pronouns (e.g., "He/She/Xe went to the store"), outputs are embedded and cosine similarity computed. Pairs below threshold γ=0.3 are "substantially different." This measures whether pronoun identity alone alters generated content beyond surface form. Core assumption: Semantically equivalent prompts with only pronoun variation should produce semantically similar outputs in a fair model.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Coefficient of Variation (CV)**
  - Why needed here: GDR and PE metrics depend on understanding CV as a normalized measure of dispersion. Without this, the formula `1/(1+CV)` seems arbitrary.
  - Quick check question: If Model A has accuracies [0.7, 0.7, 0.7] and Model B has [0.9, 0.9, 0.5] across three pronoun groups, which has a higher GDR score and why?

- **Concept: Neopronouns**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates 9 neopronoun families beyond binary (he/she) and neutral (they). Understanding these forms is essential to interpret why even top models score ~0.50 accuracy on neopronouns vs. 0.90+ on binary.
  - Quick check question: Given the pronoun paradigm {xe, xem, xyr, xyrs, xemself}, how would you transform "She loves her dog" into a xe-variant?

- **Concept: Counterfactual Fairness**
  - Why needed here: One of seven GIFI dimensions. Measures whether model outputs diverge semantically when only the pronoun changes, capturing bias beyond surface-level correctness.
  - Quick check question: A model produces "He was promoted for his leadership" vs. "She was promoted for her dedication" when prompted with identical templates. Does this violate counterfactual fairness even if both outputs are grammatically correct?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  GIFI Framework (7 metrics → aggregate score) -> Stage 1: Pronoun Recognition -> GDR: CV-based consistency across 11 pronoun groups
  ├── Stage 2: Fairness in Distribution
  │   ├── SN: Sentiment neutrality (RoBERTa classifier)
  │   ├── NTS: Non-toxicity score (Perspective API)
  │   └── CF: Counterfactual fairness (MiniLM embeddings, γ=0.3)
  ├── Stage 3: Stereotype/Role Assignment
  │   ├── SA: Stereotypical association (pronoun distribution in trait prompts)
  │   └── OF: Occupational fairness (pronoun distribution in job prompts)
  └── Stage 4: Consistency in Performance
      └── PE: Performance equality on GSM8K math across pronoun variants

- **Critical path:** GDR (can the model recognize pronouns?) → CF (does pronoun change alter semantics?) → SA/OF (does the model associate pronouns with stereotypes?) → PE (does pronoun affect reasoning?). If Stage 1 fails catastrophically (GDR < 0.3), later stages become unreliable.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  1. **Aggregation method:** GIFI averages all 7 metrics equally. Alternative: weighted aggregation or hierarchical scoring. Trade-off: simplicity vs. sensitivity to specific failure modes.
  2. **Embedding model for CF:** Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Trade-off: computational efficiency vs. semantic granularity. Larger embedding models may capture subtler divergences.
  3. **External classifiers for SN/NTS:** RoBERTa and Perspective API introduce their own biases (acknowledged in Appendix C). Trade-off: reproducibility vs. ground-truth reliability.

- **Failure signatures:**
  1. **Neopronoun collapse:** Model replaces unfamiliar pronouns with binary defaults (Section 6: GPT-2 substitutes "ae/co/thon" → "he" at high rates).
  2. **Overcorrection bias:** Newer models over-generate "she" in professional contexts (Claude 4: 0.72 for "she" vs. 0.26 for "he" in occupational fairness).
  3. **Reflective behavior:** Reasoning-focused models like DeepSeek R1 (Appendix B.1) refuse to continue prompts literally, instead questioning pronoun validity.
  4. **Pronoun omission:** Model avoids pronouns entirely (Gemini 1.5 Pro: ~50% of generations lack pronoun mentions).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline GDR test:** Run the 2,200 pronoun-swapped prompts from TANGO dataset on your model. Compute accuracy per pronoun family and overall GDR. Identify which pronoun families have highest variance.
  2. **Counterfactual probe on subset:** Take 50 RealToxicityPrompts, generate 11 pronoun variants each, compute pairwise cosine similarity of outputs. Identify prompts with highest semantic divergence (lowest similarity scores).
  3. **Occupational bias check:** Prompt with 20 occupation templates (10 male-dominated, 10 female-dominated per Bureau of Labor Statistics). Sample 10 generations each at temperature 0.95. Count pronoun distribution. Calculate OF score and compare to paper's benchmark (Phi-3: 0.59, GPT-4o: 0.41, LLaMA 2: 0.09).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can the GIFI framework be effectively adapted to evaluate gender fairness in languages with grammatical gender systems or culturally specific non-binary pronoun usage?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that the "evaluation framework is currently limited to the English language" and encourage "future work to extend our framework to other languages."
  - **Why unresolved:** Gender norms and pronoun systems differ significantly across languages (e.g., grammatical gender in Romance languages), making a direct translation of the framework insufficient.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A study applying adapted GIFI metrics to multilingual LLMs, demonstrating valid fairness comparisons across languages with distinct gender structures.

- **Question:** How does gender bias in LLMs interact with other demographic factors, and can the GIFI framework be extended to measure intersectional fairness?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note in the Limitations section that there are "other aspects of bias that remain unexplored" and suggest "future work could incorporate additional metrics for intersectionality, examining how gender bias interacts with race, disability, and other demographic factors."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current GIFI score isolates gender as a single axis of analysis, potentially missing compounding biases faced by individuals with intersecting marginalized identities.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified version of the GIFI benchmark that utilizes prompts combining gender pronouns with other demographic markers (e.g., race, disability) to reveal interaction effects.

- **Question:** What specific training interventions or data augmentation techniques are required to induce LLMs to spontaneously generate neopronouns in contexts lacking explicit gender specification?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The results show that while newer models handle binary pronouns well, "neopronouns are entirely absent" in stereotypical and occupational association tasks where the model must choose a pronoun without prompting.
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper establishes that current models fail to generalize neopronouns to neutral contexts, but it does not propose or test methods for correcting this specific representational gap.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** An experiment measuring GIFI scores before and after fine-tuning on specific neopronoun-inclusive datasets, showing a significant increase in spontaneous neopronoun generation in the Stereotype and Role Assignment tasks.

## Limitations

- The framework aggregates seven heterogeneous metrics into a single score, assuming equal importance across all dimensions
- Reliance on external classifiers (RoBERTa for sentiment, Perspective API for toxicity) introduces potential bias from third-party tools
- The counterfactual fairness threshold (γ=0.3) is somewhat arbitrary and may not optimally capture semantic divergence across different model types

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The multi-level evaluation architecture and CV-based fairness normalization are methodologically sound and well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence:** The interpretation of counterfactual fairness results depends on embedding model sensitivity and the arbitrary similarity threshold
- **Medium Confidence:** The interpretation of occupational bias as "overcorrection" could alternatively reflect legitimate attempts at gender balance

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis:** Recompute CF scores across multiple similarity thresholds (γ=0.2, 0.3, 0.4) to determine how sensitive counterfactual fairness rankings are to this parameter choice

2. **Extended Generation Contexts:** Evaluate pronoun consistency and fairness in longer-form generation tasks (500+ tokens) to determine whether short-prompt biases persist in sustained discourse

3. **Cross-Lingual Generalization:** Apply GIFI to multilingual models using equivalent pronoun systems in other languages (Spanish, French, German) to assess whether findings generalize beyond English-language evaluation
