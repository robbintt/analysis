# RADAR: Mechanistic Pathways for Detecting Data Contamination in LLM Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08931
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08931
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: RADAR achieves 93% overall accuracy in distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based LLM responses using mechanistic interpretability

## Executive Summary
RADAR addresses the critical problem of data contamination in LLM evaluation by detecting whether models rely on memorization versus reasoning. The framework extracts 37 features from model internal states, including attention specialization patterns and confidence trajectory dynamics, to classify responses as recall-based or reasoning-based. Using an ensemble of classifiers, RADAR achieves high accuracy (93% overall, 100% on clear cases) while providing interpretable insights into the cognitive processes underlying model responses.

## Method Summary
RADAR extracts 37 features from LLM internal states, combining surface-level confidence trajectories with deep mechanistic properties like attention specialization and circuit dynamics. The framework uses microsoft/DialoGPT-medium with output_attentions=True and output_hidden_states=True to compute features including entropy-based attention specialization, convergence speed, and activation variance. An ensemble of four classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistic Regression) aggregates predictions to classify responses as recall or reasoning, with 93% overall accuracy on test data.

## Key Results
- 93% overall classification accuracy distinguishing recall from reasoning responses
- 100% accuracy on clear-cut recall and reasoning cases
- 76.7% accuracy on challenging/ambiguous cases
- Framework provides interpretable mechanistic insights without requiring training data access

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Attention Specialization Discrimination
The framework posits that factual retrieval activates specific "memory" circuits with focused attention, whereas reasoning recruits broader network resources. This is operationalized by counting heads with entropy below a threshold (τ=1.5) and measuring mean attention entropy. The core assumption is that distinct internal mechanisms exist for recall versus reasoning, and attention entropy serves as a valid proxy for this functional separation.

### Mechanism 2: Confidence Trajectory Dynamics
Recall tasks are characterized by rapid, early convergence to high confidence, while reasoning tasks show gradual confidence accumulation across layers. The system monitors maximum softmax probability across layers, using convergence speed (1/(l*+1)) as a signal for how quickly the model settles on a final output. This assumes surface-level probability trajectories reflect underlying computational depth.

### Mechanism 3: Circuit Complexity & Activation Variance
Reasoning tasks induce higher variance in activation flow and higher "circuit complexity" than recall tasks. The framework proxies this via hidden state variance and norm growth, assuming complex computation creates "noisier" or more dynamic internal representations. This assumes activation magnitude and variance are sufficient proxies for computational effort without requiring gradient-based causal tracing.

## Foundational Learning

- **Mechanistic Interpretability (MI):** Why needed - RADAR relies on the premise that internal model states are more truthful indicators of processing than output text. Quick check - Can you distinguish between a feature derived from output logits versus attention weights?
- **Ensemble Classification:** Why needed - The framework aggregates predictions from multiple classifiers to improve robustness. Quick check - If Random Forest predicts "Recall" with 90% confidence and SVM predicts "Reasoning" with 60% confidence, how does the ensemble aggregate this?
- **Data Contamination vs. Generalization:** Why needed - The core problem is distinguishing "knowing because I saw it" versus "knowing because I computed it." Quick check - Why is n-gram overlap insufficient for detecting paraphrased contamination in LLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Mechanistic Analyzer -> Feature Extraction -> Classifier
- **Critical path:** The Feature Extraction logic (specifically the entropy and variance calculations defined in Appendix D) is the core IP. If the definition of specialized heads is incorrect for the specific model architecture, the entire classifier fails.
- **Design tradeoffs:** The paper uses proxy-based causal features rather than actual causal tracing for speed, and trained on only 30 examples despite high cross-validation performance.
- **Failure signatures:** Expect degraded performance on ambiguous prompts (76.7% accuracy reported) and potential failure on models with architectural obfuscation or RAG patterns.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Run RADAR on training prompts to verify expected feature patterns, 2) Adjust the specialization threshold (τ=1.5) and observe impact on classification, 3) Remove mechanistic features and retrain to quantify their marginal value.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Cross-architecture transfer:** Will RADAR's features transfer effectively to larger frontier models (GPT-4, Claude) with different attention patterns and circuit dynamics?
- **Proxy validation:** Can RADAR's proxy-based causal features be validated against true causal intervention methods, and do approximations introduce systematic errors?
- **Continuous spectrum:** How should RADAR handle cases where recall and reasoning co-occur, rather than representing a binary distinction?

## Limitations

- Reliance on only 30 training examples raises significant generalization concerns
- 76.7% accuracy on ambiguous cases suggests fundamental limitations in distinguishing complex reasoning from retrieval
- Performance on real-world contamination scenarios beyond curated test sets is unknown

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core mechanism of using attention specialization and confidence trajectories as discriminative features is theoretically sound and technically implementable (93% accuracy claim is verifiable).

**Medium Confidence:** The 37-feature engineering approach shows promise, but sufficiency across diverse model architectures and task domains remains unproven.

**Low Confidence:** The claim that mechanistic interpretability provides "deeper understanding of cognitive processes" is philosophical rather than empirical.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Architecture Transfer:** Apply RADAR to Llama-3 or GPT-4 without retraining and measure accuracy degradation compared to DialoGPT-medium.

2. **Real Contamination Detection:** Evaluate RADAR on a dataset with known contamination (responses with paraphrased training examples) versus clean responses to assess practical utility.

3. **Feature Ablation Impact:** Systematically remove groups of features and measure the impact on classification accuracy, particularly for ambiguous cases.
