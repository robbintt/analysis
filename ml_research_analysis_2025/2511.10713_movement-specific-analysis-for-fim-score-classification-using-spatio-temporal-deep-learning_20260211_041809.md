# Movement-Specific Analysis for FIM Score Classification Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10713
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10713
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: 70.09-78.79% balanced accuracy for FIM motor item classification using simplified exercises

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a deep learning approach for automatic Functional Independence Measure (FIM) motor item scoring using simplified exercises instead of prescribed assessment actions. The method combines skeletal estimation with a neural network architecture integrating ST-GCN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms to capture both spatial-temporal motion features and long-term dependencies. Evaluated on 277 rehabilitation patients, the approach demonstrates that natural movements like standing reaches and squats can effectively predict FIM scores, with attention mechanisms revealing key body-joint contributions during movement.

## Method Summary
The method employs a multi-stage deep learning pipeline that first estimates skeletal keypoints from video input, then processes these through a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) to capture local motion patterns. A bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) layer extracts long-term temporal dependencies, while an attention mechanism weights the importance of different body joints for final classification. The system is trained on simplified exercises performed by rehabilitation patients, with the goal of predicting FIM motor item scores without requiring traditional assessment protocols.

## Key Results
- Achieved 70.09-78.79% balanced accuracy across transfer and locomotion FIM items
- Standing reach actions and squat movements proved most predictive for specific FIM scores
- Attention mechanism effectively highlighted key body-joint contributions during movement
- Simplified exercises demonstrated reliability as FIM score predictors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages spatio-temporal deep learning to capture both the geometric relationships between body joints (spatial) and their evolution over time (temporal). The ST-GCN component effectively models the human skeleton as a graph, preserving natural joint connections while learning motion patterns. The BiLSTM layer captures long-range dependencies in movement sequences that may indicate functional capacity. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant body parts for each specific FIM item, mimicking how clinicians might observe particular movements during assessment.

## Foundational Learning
- ST-GCN (Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network): Models human skeleton as a graph with spatial and temporal dimensions - needed for capturing natural joint relationships and motion patterns; quick check: verify graph structure preserves anatomical connections
- BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory): Processes sequences in both forward and backward directions to capture context from entire movement - needed for understanding movement intent and completion; quick check: examine hidden state activations for temporal patterns
- Attention mechanisms: Dynamically weights input features based on their relevance to output - needed for interpretability and focusing on clinically relevant body parts; quick check: visualize attention weights across different FIM items

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Video input -> Skeletal estimation -> ST-GCN -> BiLSTM -> Attention -> Classification

Critical path: Skeletal estimation -> ST-GCN -> BiLSTM -> Attention -> Classification
The skeletal estimation must be accurate for meaningful spatial-temporal features, ST-GCN captures local motion patterns, BiLSTM extracts long-term dependencies, attention weights the most relevant features, and classification produces the final FIM score prediction.

Design tradeoffs:
- Simplified exercises vs. prescribed actions: Natural movements improve patient comfort but may introduce variability
- Skeleton-based vs. RGB input: Skeleton reduces computational complexity and privacy concerns but loses texture information
- Attention vs. global pooling: Attention provides interpretability but adds complexity and potential overfitting risk

Failure signatures:
- Low accuracy on specific FIM items may indicate insufficient training data or that simplified exercises don't capture required functional aspects
- Attention weights concentrated on unexpected body parts could signal model confusion or data quality issues
- Performance degradation on patients with different characteristics suggests domain shift problems

Three first experiments:
1. Ablation study removing attention mechanism to quantify its contribution to performance
2. Cross-validation with different exercise types to identify most predictive movements
3. Analysis of attention patterns across different patient demographics to assess consistency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset size of 277 patients may not capture full variability of rehabilitation populations
- Model performance shows considerable variation across different FIM items, indicating inconsistent reliability
- Simplified exercises may not fully capture all aspects of functional independence measured by traditional FIM assessments

## Confidence
- Model architecture effectiveness: High confidence
- Simplified exercises as reliable predictors: Medium confidence
- Generalizability across patient populations: Low confidence
- Clinical applicability: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. External validation on a separate dataset from a different rehabilitation center to assess generalizability
2. Head-to-head comparison with traditional FIM assessment methods using the same patient cohort
3. Longitudinal study tracking model performance across multiple assessment sessions for individual patients
