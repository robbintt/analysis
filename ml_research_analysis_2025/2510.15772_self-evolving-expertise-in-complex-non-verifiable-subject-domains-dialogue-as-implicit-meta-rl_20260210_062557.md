## Executive Summary
This work addresses how to improve expertise in non-verifiable domains, such as carbon market governance, where there are no objective metrics for success. The core method introduces Dialectica, a framework where multiple LLM agents engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory, self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Agents iteratively update their prompt contexts based on conversational feedback and reflections, enabling them to evolve their positions over time.

Quantitative results from tournaments using Elo scoring, BTD ability, and AlphaRank mass consistently show that agents with context evolution enabled significantly outperform baseline agents. For example, Qwen3:30b agents with memory + evolution + web access achieved Elo scores of 1316 and BTD ability of 1.773, with AlphaRank mass concentrated at 0.5, indicating dominance. Qualitative analysis of conversation logs reveals clear patterns where reflections lead to more sophisticated, evidence-grounded statements, demonstrating learning through dialogue. The findings support dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical path to expertise amplification in open, non-verifiable domains.

## Method Summary
The method uses a dual-tier memory system (session and persistent) with semantic retrieval to track debate details and accumulate consolidated perspectives. After each round of dialogue, agents generate first-person reflections identifying weaknesses and planned adjustments. When eligibility thresholds are met (≥3 debates, ≥2 consolidated topics), an LLM-based evolution process proposes structured changes to allow-listed configuration fields (perspective, priorities, debate style) while protecting core identity (expertise domains). Updated configurations immediately affect subsequent prompt construction. Tournament evaluation uses pairwise contests judged by GPT-4.1 with Elo scoring, Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and AlphaRank mass to measure performance.

## Key Results
- Agents with context evolution achieved Elo scores of 1316 vs 1082 for baseline agents
- BTD ability of 1.773 for evolved agents vs 0.944 for baseline agents
- AlphaRank mass concentrated at 0.5 for evolved agents vs 0.14 for baseline agents
- Qualitative analysis shows reflection→statement patterns consistent with bounded outer-loop updates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured multi-round dialogue functions as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process that optimizes agent conditioning states without explicit scalar rewards.
- Mechanism: The system operates on two timescales—an inner loop where agents generate responses conditioned on current context (C_t, P_k), and an outer loop where a meta-policy Π_ψ maps compressed summaries of dialogue traces to bounded updates of guidance variables. Reflection serves as the compression function g(·) that extracts actionable updates from conversational feedback.
- Core assumption: The model's output distribution p_θ(y|c,x) depends smoothly on context c, so systematic edits to c based on conversational signals constitute a form of conditioning control even without explicit optimization objectives.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Formally, discussion is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process"; [section 1.2] Formal two-time-scale equations defining inner policy π_θ and outer meta-policy Π_ψ with bounded update operator ⊕; [corpus] "Conversation for Non-verifiable Learning" (arxiv 2601.21464) reports related meta-evaluation approaches for non-verifiable tasks but via LLM-as-judge rather than peer dialogue
- Break condition: If model output distributions are not smoothly dependent on context edits, or if reflection quality degrades under non-stationary partner adaptation, the outer-loop updates become unstable or ineffective.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Policy-constrained context evolution—where agents edit specific prompt components based on accumulated reflections—produces durable behavioral changes that improve expertise in target domains.
- Mechanism: After each round, agents generate first-person reflections identifying weaknesses and planned adjustments. When eligibility thresholds are met (≥3 debates, ≥2 consolidated topics), an LLM-based evolution process proposes structured changes to allow-listed configuration fields (perspective, priorities, debate style) while protecting core identity (expertise domains). Updated configurations immediately affect subsequent prompt construction.
- Core assumption: Reflections reliably identify actionable weaknesses and the proposed context edits directionally improve future responses rather than inducing drift or gaming.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "results show that enabling reflection-based context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline counterparts on Elo scores"; [section 2.3] Evolution criteria and policy-constrained operator: S^+_i,r = S_i,r ⊕ (∆S_i ↾ E); [section 5.2] Qualitative tracing shows reflection→statement patterns: "commitments recorded in reflections appear in the following statements, consistent with a bounded outer-update"; [corpus] "Building Self-Evolving Agents via Experience-Driven Lifelong Learning" (arxiv 2508.19005) proposes related experience-driven frameworks but without the dialogue-as-feedback signal
- Break condition: If reflections become self-justifying rather than self-critical, or if evolution proposals optimize for rhetorical success rather than genuine expertise, the context edits may produce persuasive but shallow agents.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dual-tier memory with semantic retrieval enables cross-session knowledge consolidation that amplifies the effectiveness of context evolution.
- Mechanism: Session-tier memory tracks ephemeral details (opponent claims, thinking logs) while persistent-tier memory accumulates consolidated perspectives, strategic lessons, and debate history. Retrieval uses composite scoring: 0.6×semantic_similarity + 0.4×importance_weight. Topic-level consolidation synthesizes multiple reflections into structured summaries available for future prompts.
- Core assumption: The compression and retrieval mechanisms surface genuinely relevant prior learning at the right time, rather than retrieving irrelevant or contradictory notes that confuse reasoning.
- Evidence anchors: [section 2.2] Memory architecture definition: M_i(t) = M^sess_i(t) ∪ M^pers_i(t) with semantic retrieval Score(n|q) = 0.6R(q,n) + 0.4I(n); [section 5.1] "Web access without context evolution does not consistently outperform 'Memory'-only, suggesting that iterative context editing is the primary driver"; [corpus] "ES-MemEval" (arxiv 2602.01885) benchmarks long-term memory in conversational agents but focuses on emotional support rather than expertise development
- Break condition: If memory grows unbounded without effective pruning, or if consolidation over-generalizes from sparse experiences, retrieval quality degrades and agents may retrieve contradictory guidance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Bradley-Terry-Davidson models for pairwise comparison**
  - Why needed here: The tournament evaluation uses BTD to convert win/draw/loss records into calibrated ability scores that preserve non-transitive structure. Understanding this helps interpret why AlphaRank mass concentration matters.
  - Quick check question: Given agents A, B, C where A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A with equal probability, would a scalar Elo ranking fully capture this structure?

- Concept: **AlphaRank and evolutionary game dynamics**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses AlphaRank to analyze the "strategic topology" of the meta-game over agent configurations. Understanding logit best-reply dynamics helps interpret mass concentration as dominance vs. intransitive cycles.
  - Quick check question: If AlphaRank mass concentrates 0.5 on each of two agents with no mass elsewhere, what does this imply about their mutual dominance relationship?

- Concept: **In-context learning vs. weight updating**
  - Why needed here: Dialectica operates with frozen model weights θ while optimizing only the conditioning state. This distinction is critical—context evolution is not fine-tuning, it's prompt-space optimization.
  - Quick check question: If you wanted to transfer an agent's learned expertise to a different model architecture, what component would you need to migrate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Orchestrator (deterministic controller) -> Agent configurations (JSON: identity, worldview, evolution settings) -> Memory system (Session tier + Persistent tier) -> Tool interfaces (Web search, RAG documents, Memory operations) -> Facilitator (optional, passive in current experiments)

- Critical path:
  1. Load agent configurations and initialize memory
  2. For each topic: broadcast topic to all agents → collect opening statements → for each round: collect statements → trigger post-round reflections → consolidate at topic-level → check evolution eligibility → apply approved context edits
  3. At session end: write debate history, persist transcripts, update learning logs
  4. Tournament: snapshot agents pre/post discussion → run pairwise comparisons with LLM judge → compute Elo/BTD/AlphaRank

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Evolution intensity (conservative/moderate/radical)**: Higher intensity may accelerate learning but risks identity drift or overfitting to debate partners
  - **Memory retrieval weights (0.6 semantic / 0.4 importance)**: Adjusting these changes whether recent relevant content or historically important content surfaces
  - **Evolution thresholds (D_min debates, U_min topics)**: Lower thresholds enable faster adaptation but with less evidence; higher thresholds are more conservative
  - **Allow-list vs. protected fields**: Expanding evolvable components (e.g., allowing expertise domains to change) increases adaptability but risks losing core competence

- Failure signatures:
  - **Reflection loops**: Agents produce self-validating reflections that don't identify genuine weaknesses (check for generic statements like "I felt confident" without specific critiques)
  - **Context bloat**: Evolved configurations become verbose and contradictory (monitor prompt token growth across topics)
  - **Echo chamber**: Agents converge to similar positions rather than maintaining distinct perspectives (track position diversity metrics)
  - **Reward hacking**: Agents optimize for judge preferences rather than genuine expertise (compare tournament performance on held-out topics vs. training topics)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablate memory tiers**: Run agents with session-only vs. persistent-only memory to isolate the contribution of cross-topic consolidation. Expect persistent memory to show gains only after 3+ topics.
  2. **Vary evolution thresholds**: Test (D_min=2, U_min=1) vs. (D_min=5, U_min=3) to characterize the speed-stability tradeoff. Monitor reflection quality (specificity of self-critique) as a function of experience depth.
  3. **Cross-topic transfer probe**: Train agents on topics 1-5, evaluate on topics 6-9 (within-domain) and on held-out domain (e.g., pandemic resilience). This tests whether learning generalizes or overfits to carbon governance specifics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does expertise acquired through dialogue-driven context evolution on topic A transfer to related topic B (cross-task transfer)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Also still to be investigated are phenomena such as cross-task transfer (does learning on topic A improve performance on related topic B?)"
- Why unresolved: The experiments trained and evaluated agents on the same domain (carbon market governance); no transfer experiments were conducted.
- What evidence would resolve it: Train agents on one topic cluster, then evaluate their tournament performance on a related but distinct cluster, comparing against baselines without prior dialogue training.

### Open Question 2
- Question: At what scale (number of agents, rounds, topics) does dialogue-driven learning saturate or degrade?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Saturation, or even reduction, in the benefits of dialogue may occur for large numbers of agents and large numbers of rounds/turns-per-round" and "questions of how many agents, the precise definition of their personas, how many topics, and how many turns are allowed per topic, have not been investigated"
- Why unresolved: The experimental design (7 agents, 9 topics, 5 rounds) was chosen arbitrarily without systematic variation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying agent count, topic count, and round count independently, measuring Elo/BTD/AlphaRank at each configuration to identify performance plateaus or declines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the distilled context remain beneficial after extended subsequent use (long-horizon stability)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Also still to be investigated are... long-horizon stability (does the distilled context remain helpful after many subsequent tasks?)"
- Why unresolved: Post-training evaluation occurred immediately after dialogue sessions; no longitudinal or repeated-use testing was performed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Deploy dialogue-trained agents across many additional tasks or time periods, periodically re-evaluating tournament performance to detect degradation or sustained improvement.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can dialogue-driven context evolution produce distillable system prompts that improve alignment across diverse tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "One possible use for the 'dialogue-training' described here is to create system prompts which drive aligned behaviour through conversations between the 'system agent' and others agents with specified broad ranges of views"
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates domain expertise amplification but does not test alignment-specific outcomes (e.g., safety, consistency, rubric adherence) or cross-task prompt transfer.
- What evidence would resolve it: Use dialogue-trained agent configurations as system prompts for new tasks, then evaluate against alignment benchmarks (e.g., safety evaluations, consistency checks) compared to hand-crafted prompts.

## Limitations

- Several critical design choices are underspecified, notably the exact reflection generation prompts, evolution decision logic, and consolidation prompts.
- The tournament evaluation relies on LLM judges, introducing potential position or style biases that could inflate measured performance differences.
- The paper does not report statistical significance testing for Elo/BTD differences between conditions, making it unclear whether observed advantages are robust or sample-size dependent.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of structured dialogue with post-round reflections is clearly described and experimentally validated; the observed patterns of reflection leading to more sophisticated subsequent statements are reproducible. The dual-tier memory architecture with semantic retrieval is implementable as specified.
- **Medium confidence**: The meta-RL framing as implicit policy optimization is conceptually sound but the theoretical mapping between dialogue traces and outer-loop updates is hand-wavy; the actual boundedness of updates is asserted but not formally proven. The Elo/BTD evaluation methodology is standard, but without significance tests the magnitude of claimed advantages is uncertain.
- **Low confidence**: The practical impact beyond carbon market governance is unproven; no transfer experiments to other domains (e.g., public health, urban planning) are reported. The long-term stability of context evolution under repeated iterations is not tested—agents could drift or overfit to specific debate partners.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation of meta-learning signal**: Run a control condition where agents have identical memory and web access but *no* reflection-based context evolution. Compare Elo/BTD gains to the full Dialectica condition to isolate the contribution of the outer-loop adaptation.

2. **Judge consistency audit**: Re-run a subset of tournament debates with both GPT-4.1 and Qwen3 judges, swapping agent positions to test for ordering bias. Measure inter-judge agreement and position bias; if agreement <80% or bias >10%, the evaluation methodology needs refinement.

3. **Domain transfer probe**: Train agents on carbon market topics 1-5, then evaluate on (a) carbon topics 6-9 (within-domain) and (b) a held-out domain (e.g., pandemic resilience). Compare performance drop to assess whether expertise is domain-specific or transferable, revealing the scope of Dialectica's generalization.
