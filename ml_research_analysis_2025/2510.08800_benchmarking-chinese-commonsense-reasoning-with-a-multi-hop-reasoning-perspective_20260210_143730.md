# Benchmarking Chinese Commonsense Reasoning with a Multi-hop Reasoning Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08800
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08800
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces CCMOR, a Chinese multi-hop reasoning benchmark revealing persistent gaps in large language models' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step logical reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CCMOR, a Chinese commonsense multi-hop reasoning benchmark designed to evaluate large language models on integrating Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step logical reasoning. The dataset is constructed via an LLM-powered pipeline using existing QA data, anchored on factual unit chains, and refined through expert human verification. Experiments show that state-of-the-art models still struggle with long-tail knowledge and knowledge-intensive reasoning, especially as hop count increases. System-2-style models and retrieval-augmented generation notably improve performance. The benchmark highlights persistent gaps in Chinese multi-hop reasoning and provides a rigorous, culturally grounded resource for future evaluation.

## Method Summary
The CCMOR benchmark is constructed through a three-step LLM-powered pipeline: (1) sampling and classifying seed QA pairs from Chinese SimpleQA and CHARM-Memorization into six domains using LLM verification, (2) recursively generating tree-structured sub-questions anchored on factual unit chains with LLM-based verification for answerability and specificity, and (3) composing multi-hop questions from valid paths with human-in-the-loop verification for global uniqueness and sequential consistency. The final dataset contains 480 3-hop and 166 6-hop questions evaluated using Stepwise Question Answering (SQA) and Overall Answering (OA) settings with ROUGE-L recall and LLM-as-Judge accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art models show persistent performance gaps between SQA and OA settings, indicating integration difficulties in multi-hop reasoning
- Retrieval-augmented generation yields substantial improvements, with average accuracy gains of approximately 9.5 percentage points
- System-2-style models with explicit reasoning chains demonstrate significant improvements in OA scores compared to System-1 intuitive responses
- Performance degrades notably as hop count increases, with 6-hop questions proving particularly challenging

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Anchoring multi-hop question generation on factual unit chains produces verifiable reasoning paths. Each answer in the chain serves as an "anchor fact" for generating subsequent sub-questions, creating a tree-structured dependency where edges represent questions connecting answers to follow-ups. This grounds abstract reasoning in concrete, verifiable entities (persons, dates, locations). The core assumption is that answers can be decomposed into discrete, countable factual units that support unambiguous follow-up questioning.

### Mechanism 2
System-2-style deliberate reasoning improves multi-hop synthesis over intuitive System-1 responses. Models trained for long chain-of-thought explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps before final answers, reducing error propagation across hops. The core assumption is that explicit reasoning traces reduce compounding errors when integrating multiple knowledge retrievals.

### Mechanism 3
Retrieval augmentation bridges knowledge gaps for long-tail cultural facts in multi-hop chains. External retrieval provides missing factual knowledge that models haven't memorized, particularly important for Chinese-specific cultural knowledge where training data may be sparse. The core assumption is that retrieval systems can surface relevant documents for intermediate reasoning steps, not just final answers.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-hop reasoning decomposition**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how complex questions decompose into sub-questions with dependencies is essential for diagnosing where reasoning fails (knowledge gap vs. integration failure)
  - Quick check question: Given "The capital of the country where the longest river in Africa ends," can you identify the two sub-questions and their dependency?

- **Concept: System-1 vs. System-2 reasoning paradigms**
  - Why needed here: The benchmark explicitly categorizes models by reasoning style; knowing when to apply deliberate vs. intuitive reasoning affects architecture decisions
  - Quick check question: Would a customer service chatbot benefit more from System-1 or System-2 reasoning for factual queries?

- **Concept: Long-tail knowledge distribution**
  - Why needed here: Performance gaps are most pronounced for infrequent cultural knowledge; understanding knowledge frequency helps prioritize retrieval vs. memorization strategies
  - Quick check question: Why might a model correctly answer "What is the capital of France?" but fail at "What is the capital of the birthplace of the author of China's first modern novel?"

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Seed Data Layer -> Domain Classifier -> Sub-question Generator -> Quality Filter -> Human Verification Loop -> Evaluation Module
- **Critical path:** 1. Sample seed questions → 2. Domain classification → 3. Recursive sub-question generation (N hops) → 4. LLM quality filtering → 5. Multi-hop question composition → 6. Human verification → 7. Dataset release
- **Design tradeoffs:** LLM generation speed vs. human verification quality (fully automated is faster but introduces hallucinations); answer uniqueness enforcement vs. coverage (paper allows multiple valid answers at sub-question level but enforces unique final answers); hop depth vs. difficulty (6-hop questions average 2.26 domains but yield fewer valid samples)
- **Failure signatures:** Knowledge gap cascade (model fails early sub-question → subsequent hops unreachable → OA fails); retrieval mismatch (RAG returns irrelevant documents → model refuses to answer); reasoning shortcut (composed multi-hop question accidentally reveals intermediate answer)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Baseline diagnostic: Run your model on CCMOR's SQA vs. OA settings; if SQA >> OA, your integration layer (not knowledge) is the bottleneck; 2. RAG ablation: Test with/without retrieval on a 50-question subset; measure not just accuracy gain but also refusal rate changes; 3. Hop-depth scaling: Plot accuracy vs. hop count (1, 3, 6); identify your model's "reasoning horizon" where performance drops below acceptable threshold

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What mechanisms enable certain LLMs (e.g., Doubao) to achieve substantial RAG gains for multi-hop reasoning while others (e.g., Kimi, Wenxin) show limited improvements despite retrieval access? The paper documents heterogeneity in RAG effectiveness but doesn't investigate architectural or training differences causing some models to adaptively utilize multi-turn retrieval while others fail.

### Open Question 2
Can the factual-unit-chain construction methodology generalize to multimodal Chinese commonsense reasoning without compromising verifiability? The current pipeline relies on textual sub-question decomposition and LLM-based verification. Visual or procedural reasoning chains may not decompose cleanly into discrete, verifiable factual units.

### Open Question 3
Does the observed performance gap between Stepwise Question Answering (SQA) and Overall Answering (OA) stem primarily from working memory limitations, reasoning coherence failures, or knowledge integration deficits in current LLMs? The paper quantifies the gap but doesn't perform error analysis categorizing failure modes.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on LLM-generated content introduces potential systemic biases in question difficulty and cultural representation
- Deeper hop levels (6-hop) yield significantly fewer valid samples (166 vs. 480 for 3-hop), suggesting structural limitations in multi-hop question composition
- LLM-as-judge evaluation methodology may not fully capture nuanced reasoning failures, particularly for questions requiring cultural or contextual understanding

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Core findings about multi-hop reasoning difficulties and general effectiveness of retrieval augmentation are well-supported by experimental results across multiple model families and settings
- **Medium confidence:** Claim that Chinese-specific cultural knowledge poses unique challenges is supported but could benefit from more granular analysis; comparison between System-1 and System-2 reasoning modes shows clear differences but doesn't fully explore trade-offs
- **Low confidence:** Assertion that current state-of-the-art models fundamentally lack multi-hop reasoning capabilities may overstate the case, as some models show competitive performance in SQA settings despite lower OA scores

## Next Checks
1. Cross-cultural validation: Test the same benchmark construction pipeline on English factual knowledge to determine whether observed multi-hop reasoning difficulties are language-specific or general architectural limitations
2. Reasoning decomposition analysis: Conduct error analysis on the 25% of questions where models succeed in SQA but fail OA to determine whether failures stem from knowledge gaps, integration errors, or output formatting issues
3. Temporal stability validation: Create a longitudinal study testing model performance on CCMOR questions with answers that may change over time (e.g., population statistics, award winners) to assess the benchmark's long-term validity
