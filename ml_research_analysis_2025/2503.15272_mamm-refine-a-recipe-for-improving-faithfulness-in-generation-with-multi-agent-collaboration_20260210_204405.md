# MAMM-Refine: A Recipe for Improving Faithfulness in Generation with Multi-Agent Collaboration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.15272
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15272
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: Multi-agent multi-model collaboration improves faithfulness in long-form generation through iterative refinement of error detection, critiquing, and correction.

## Executive Summary
This paper extends multi-agent collaboration to improve faithfulness in long-form generation tasks like summarization and question answering. The authors investigate how iterative collaboration among multiple instances and types of LLMs enhances subtasks in refinement: error detection, critiquing unfaithful sentences, and correction. They design intrinsic evaluations for each subtask, finding that multi-agent (multiple instances) and multi-model (diverse LLM types) approaches benefit error detection and critiquing. Notably, reframing critiquing and refinement as reranking rather than generation tasks improves multi-agent performance. The authors consolidate these insights into MAMM-Refine, a recipe combining the best configurations.

## Method Summary
MAMM-Refine implements a three-stage pipeline for improving faithfulness: DETECT (binary classification of faithful/unfaithful sentences), CRITIQUE (identify error spans and suggest fixes), and REFINE (generate corrected sentences). The approach uses multi-agent debate where agents iteratively critique each other's outputs until consensus or maximum rounds. The optimal configuration uses different models for different subtasks: GPT-4o + Claude-3.5 Sonnet for detection, Claude-3.5 Sonnet for critiquing, and GPT-4o for refinement, with reranking instead of generation for critiquing and refinement. The method is validated on three summarization datasets (MediaSum, MeetingBank, UltraChat) and long-form question answering.

## Key Results
- Multi-model collaboration (GPT-4o + Claude) improves error detection accuracy by 1.6-2.5% over single models
- Reframing critiquing and refinement as reranking tasks outperforms generation approaches in multi-agent settings
- MAMM-Refine significantly boosts MiniCheck scores across summarization datasets and long-form QA tasks
- The recipe achieves 5.3% improvement on MiniCheck for long-form question answering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Diversity-Driven Error Detection Through Model Heterogeneity
Different LLMs trained on different data exhibit distinct hallucination patterns. When diverse agents collaborate, their complementary error profiles increase the likelihood that at least one agent identifies any given factual inconsistency, while overlapping agreement increases confidence. This works best when models have similar baseline performance levels; large gaps cause weaker agents to disproportionately influence outcomes.

### Mechanism 2: Reranking Reframes Generation as Verification
Generation tasks lack clear convergence criteria and evaluation is challenging across long-form outputs. Reranking converts this to classification: agents select from discrete candidates, enabling voting, clear stopping conditions, and leveraging LLMs' comparative judgment strength over absolute generation. This approach requires at least one high-quality candidate exists in the pool.

### Mechanism 3: Task-Specific Model Specialization Within Pipeline
Different models excel at different subtasks due to varying cognitive demands—detection requires discrimination, critique requires explanation generation, refinement requires editing. The pipeline approach allows per-subtask optimization by matching models to subtasks based on intrinsic strengths rather than using the same model throughout.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Faithfulness vs. Hallucination in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The entire approach targets factual consistency between generated output and source context. Understanding that hallucinations are model-specific and non-random is essential for the diversity mechanism.
  - Quick check question: Given a summary sentence "The vote occurred on September 18th" and a source document that mentions a vote but no date, is this unfaithful? Why?

- **Concept: Multi-Agent Debate Protocols**
  - Why needed here: The paper adapts debate frameworks from reasoning tasks to generation. Understanding turn-taking, consensus, and conversation history is essential for implementing the architecture.
  - Quick check question: In a 2-agent debate with maximum 10 rounds, if Agent A says "faithful" and Agent B says "unfaithful" in round 0, what happens in round 1?

- **Concept: Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Evaluation Design**
  - Why needed here: The paper's contribution relies on intrinsic evaluation (per-subtask performance on TofuEval) to derive the recipe, then validates extrinsically on end tasks. Confusing these leads to circular reasoning.
  - Quick check question: If a detection model achieves 95% accuracy on intrinsic evaluation but end-to-end faithfulness doesn't improve, what might be happening?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Sentence splitting → DETECT (G+C debate) → filter unfaithful sentences → CRITIQUE (2xC rerank) → REFINE (2xG rerank) → reconstruct summary
- **Critical path**: 1. Split sentences with NLTK 2. DETECT with G+C debate outputs labels + reasoning 3. For unfaithful sentences: CRITIQUE with 2xC rerank selects best critique 4. REFINE with 2xG rerank selects best refinement 5. Reconstruct faithful summary
- **Design tradeoffs**: Multi-model (G+C) vs. Multi-agent same-model (2xG/2xC): Multi-model improves detection but requires API access to multiple providers; same-model is cheaper but shows weaker gains. RERANK vs. GENERATE: Rerank is more reliable and cheaper but requires candidate pool generation upfront; GENERATE allows more creative fixes but degrades over iterations. 2 vs. 3+ agents: Adding Gemini as third agent helps but with diminishing returns and increased latency/cost.
- **Failure signatures**: Detection accuracy drops when documents exceed context windows (sentence-level detection loses document context). Reranking fails when all candidates contain similar hallucinations (pool quality issue). Multi-model debate degrades when one model dominates (82% agreement with larger model suggests weaker model contributes little). Performance decreases over GENERATE iterations indicating error accumulation.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Replicate intrinsic DETECT evaluation on TofuEval validation split (30 examples) with G+C vs. 2xG vs. single-agent; verify BACC improvements match paper before proceeding. 2. Ablate RERANK vs. GENERATE on CRITIQUE subtask using gold labels; measure error match rate to confirm reranking advantage on your infrastructure. 3. End-to-end test on 20 examples from a held-out domain; measure MiniCheck and manually inspect whether detection→critique→refine pipeline improves faithfulness or introduces new errors.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: Does the focus on faithfulness in MAMM-Refine come at the cost of other generation qualities like coherence and relevance?
  - Basis in paper: The authors explicitly state in the Limitations section: "While there are other aspects, such as coherence and relevance, that could contribute to a comprehensive evaluation, we choose to evaluate faithfulness..."
  - Why unresolved: The optimization targets (MiniCheck, GPT-Likert) and the intrinsic evaluations are designed exclusively to detect and correct factual inconsistencies, potentially ignoring degradation in text flow or topic relevance.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Human or automatic evaluations on the refined outputs measuring coherence (e.g., using perplexity or human ratings) and relevance to verify no significant regression compared to the original summaries.

- **Question**: Can the MAMM-Refine recipe be generalized to open-ended generation tasks beyond summarization and long-form QA?
  - Basis in paper: The conclusion posits that "Applying multi-agent reasoning to open-ended generation tasks more broadly is a crucial area for which we lay the groundwork."
  - Why unresolved: The current study validates the recipe only on tasks with grounding context (documents or retrieved evidence); its effectiveness on tasks requiring purely parametric knowledge or creative generation remains untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Application of the MAMM-Refine pipeline to domains like creative writing or code generation to assess if the reranking and critiquing mechanism improves output quality without grounding documents.

- **Question**: How does the performance asymmetry between agents impact the reliability of the consensus process in multi-agent refinement?
  - Basis in paper: Appendix B.6 notes that pairing a smaller model (Llama3.1-8B) with a stronger model (GPT-4o) resulted in the larger model being persuaded to accept incorrect answers 18% of the time, underscoring the "importance of using agents with similar performance levels."
  - Why unresolved: While the main experiments use top-tier models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5), the instability caused by heterogeneous agent capabilities suggests the recipe is brittle when attempting to use cheaper or smaller models as agents.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying the capability gap between Agent 1 and Agent 2 to identify the threshold where the collaborative process fails or degrades compared to single-agent performance.

## Limitations
- Computational cost of multi-agent debate, especially multi-model setups, represents a practical deployment barrier
- Heavy reliance on specific model capabilities (GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 Sonnet) with no clear fallback when models change
- Intrinsic evaluation framework may not fully capture real-world faithfulness challenges across diverse domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core finding that multi-agent collaboration improves faithfulness, and that RERANK outperforms GENERATE for critiquing and refinement tasks. The intrinsic evaluation methodology is sound and the ablation studies are rigorous.
- **Medium confidence**: The generalizability to long-form QA tasks and the optimal configuration (G+C for detection, 2xC for critique, 2xG for refinement) given the limited scope of tested models and domains.
- **Low confidence**: The scalability claims for larger agent counts beyond 3 models and the assumption that model-specific strengths (Claude for critique, GPT-4o for refinement) will hold across domains and future model versions.

## Next Checks
1. Test MAMM-Refine on out-of-domain summarization datasets (e.g., ArXiv papers, legal documents) to assess domain generalization of the model specialization assumptions.
2. Implement a cost-performance tradeoff analysis comparing MAMM-Refine against single-model approaches using newer open-weight models (Llama-3.1, Qwen2.5) to evaluate practical deployment viability.
3. Conduct a failure mode analysis by intentionally injecting various types of hallucinations into summaries and measuring MAMM-Refine's ability to detect and correct each type, particularly examining whether the method degrades when no faithful candidate exists in the reranking pool.
