# NeuroFaith: Evaluating LLM Self-Explanation Faithfulness via Internal Representation Alignment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.09277
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09277
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Evaluates explanation faithfulness by aligning explanations with internal model representations through mechanistic testing

## Executive Summary
NeuroFaith introduces a framework for evaluating the faithfulness of LLM self-explanations by aligning them with the model's internal reasoning process. The method extracts key concepts from explanations and mechanistically tests whether these concepts influence the model's predictions. Applied to 2-hop reasoning and classification tasks, the approach demonstrates that faithful explanations correlate with accurate predictions and can be improved through linear probing and steering in representation space. This provides a principled approach for assessing and enhancing explanation faithfulness, critical for trustworthy AI deployment.

## Method Summary
NeuroFaith evaluates explanation faithfulness by extracting key concepts from LLM self-explanations and testing their mechanistic influence on model predictions. The framework uses linear probing to detect explanation faithfulness and steering in representation space to improve it. For 2-hop reasoning tasks, concepts are extracted from explanations and used to manipulate model representations, measuring the impact on prediction accuracy. The approach also applies to classification tasks, where explanation faithfulness is evaluated through internal representation alignment with model behavior.

## Key Results
- Faithful explanations show strong correlation with accurate model predictions in 2-hop reasoning tasks
- Linear probing can detect explanation faithfulness with measurable accuracy
- Steering in representation space can improve explanation faithfulness and prediction accuracy
- The framework successfully identifies and enhances faithful explanations in classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NeuroFaith works by establishing a direct link between the concepts mentioned in explanations and their actual influence on model predictions. By extracting key concepts and mechanistically testing their impact through representation manipulation, the framework can verify whether explanations reflect genuine reasoning processes. The alignment between internal representations and explanation content allows for quantitative assessment of faithfulness, while steering techniques enable active improvement of explanations by reinforcing concept-prediction relationships in the model's latent space.

## Foundational Learning
- **Linear probing**: A technique for extracting information from model representations by training a linear classifier on frozen embeddings. Why needed: Provides a lightweight method to detect whether explanation concepts are represented in the model's internal state. Quick check: Verify probe accuracy on known concept-prediction pairs.
- **Representation steering**: Manipulating model representations to influence predictions. Why needed: Enables active improvement of explanation faithfulness by strengthening concept-prediction relationships. Quick check: Measure prediction change magnitude after steering.
- **Mechanistic interpretability**: Understanding model behavior through direct manipulation of internal components. Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for testing whether explanation concepts actually influence predictions. Quick check: Verify causal relationship between concept manipulation and prediction changes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Explanation extraction -> Concept identification -> Representation manipulation -> Prediction evaluation -> Faithfulness assessment

**Critical Path**: The core workflow follows: self-explanation generation → concept extraction → linear probing for faithfulness detection → representation steering for improvement → prediction evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for interpretability by using linear probes instead of full fine-tuning, enabling faster faithfulness assessment but potentially missing nonlinear relationships. The focus on 2-hop reasoning limits generalizability to more complex reasoning patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: Explanation faithfulness detection may fail when concepts are implicitly represented rather than explicitly mentioned. Steering may have limited effectiveness when concept-prediction relationships are weak or when representations are highly entangled. The framework may struggle with domain-specific terminology or nuanced reasoning steps.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test faithfulness detection on synthetic explanations with known concept-prediction relationships, 2) Apply steering to improve faithfulness on simple classification tasks, 3) Evaluate correlation between explanation faithfulness and prediction accuracy across multiple reasoning hops

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness on complex, multi-step reasoning beyond 2-hop scenarios remains unproven
- The causal relationship between improved explanation faithfulness and actual model performance enhancement is not definitively established
- The concept extraction approach may miss implicit reasoning steps that are nonetheless important for predictions

## Confidence

**Major Claim Clusters Confidence:**
- Faithfulness assessment via internal alignment: Medium
- Improvement of explanations through steering: Low
- Correlation between faithful explanations and prediction accuracy: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Test NeuroFaith on multi-step reasoning tasks beyond 2-hop scenarios to assess scalability
2. Apply the framework to a diverse set of model architectures (e.g., GPT, T5) to evaluate generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the effect of explanation faithfulness improvements on actual model performance
