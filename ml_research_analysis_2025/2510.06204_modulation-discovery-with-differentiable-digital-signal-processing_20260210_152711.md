# Modulation Discovery with Differentiable Digital Signal Processing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06204
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06204
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: Neural sound-matching approach discovers interpretable modulation signals in audio using DDSP, with LPF balancing accuracy and interpretability better than raw framewise extraction.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach for discovering interpretable modulation signals in audio by leveraging differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) and neural sound-matching. The method extracts control signals from audio features, parameterizes them using low-pass filtering or piecewise Bézier curves to ensure smoothness and interpretability, and routes them through a DDSP synthesizer. Experiments demonstrate the framework's ability to reconstruct highly modulated synthetic and real audio while maintaining interpretability of the discovered control signals.

## Method Summary
The approach uses an encoder (LFO-net) to extract control signals from 3-channel Mel spectrograms, which are then parameterized via framewise prediction, low-pass filtering (fc < 20Hz), or 2D Bézier splines. These signals drive a DDSP synthesizer (wavetable oscillator → biquad filter → envelope), trained end-to-end using multi-resolution STFT loss and Schedule-Free AdamW. The parameterization constraints ensure smooth, human-interpretable modulation curves rather than high-frequency noise.

## Key Results
- LPF parameterization achieves the best balance between sound-matching accuracy and interpretability
- Spline parameterization maximizes interpretability but slightly reduces matching accuracy
- Discovered modulations often combine across synth modules to better approximate ground truth than individual signals
- The framework generalizes across different DDSP architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Gradient-Based Control Signal Inference
If a synthesizer is differentiable, self-supervised reconstruction loss can be backpropagated to infer interpretable control signals without labeled training data. An encoder extracts control signals from audio features, these drive a DDSP synthesizer, and a multi-resolution STFT loss compares output to target. Gradients update network weights and learnable synth parameters to minimize perceptual loss.

### Mechanism 2: Inductive Bias via Signal Parameterization
Constraining the control signal space (via Low-Pass Filtering or Bézier curves) forces the model to discover smooth, human-interpretable modulations rather than high-frequency frame-wise noise. Bézier curves mathematically guarantee the curve stays within the convex hull of control points, bounding output and enforcing smoothness.

### Mechanism 3: Functional Modulation Distribution
The system distributes modulation requirements across available synth modules based on their learned routing and expressiveness. The optimizer seeks any valid configuration to minimize reconstruction error, with LLS analysis showing discovered modulations often combine to approximate ground truth better than individual signals.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP)**
- Why needed here: Understanding how standard DSP (oscillators, filters) can be implemented as neural network layers to allow end-to-end training.
- Quick check question: Can you compute the derivative of a wavetable read operation with respect to the wavetable position index?

**Concept: Bézier Curves**
- Why needed here: The paper uses 2D Bézier curves to parameterize modulation paths; understanding control points and convex hulls is required to tune the "Spline" method.
- Quick check question: If you move a control point in a cubic Bézier curve, does the entire curve move or just a local segment?

**Concept: Inductive Bias in Neural Networks**
- Why needed here: The "information bottleneck" (1D modulation signals) and parameterization constraints (LPF/Spline) are biases forcing the network to learn interpretable features rather than overfitting.
- Quick check question: Why would a framewise prediction (Frame) overfit the training data compared to a low-pass filtered prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input (3-channel Mel + f0) → LFO-net → Adapter (MLP) → Parameterization (Frame/LPF/Spline) → Mod. Synth (Wavetable → Filter → Envelope) → MSS Loss

**Critical path:** The gradient flow from the MSS loss through the synth modules to the LFO-net weights is the critical path; any non-differentiability breaks the system.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Frame:** Highest accuracy, lowest interpretability (noisy signals)
- **LPF:** Best balance of accuracy and smoothness
- **Spline:** Highest interpretability, lowest accuracy

**Failure signatures:**
- **Static Output:** Model predicts flat modulation lines (usually 0.5) if learning rate is too high or synth parameters are untrained
- **Wavetable Aliasing:** If anti-aliasing filter cutoff (fc = 0.9 · fs / 2) is violated
- **Convex Hull Violation:** If predictions diverge outside [0,1] range

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **White-box Extraction:** Train on synthetic data with frozen synth parameters to verify LFO-net can extract known ground truth modulation signals
2. **Parameterization Ablation:** Compare Frame, LPF, and Spline on same dataset to measure L1 distance and Total Variation of recovered signals
3. **Gray-box Discovery:** Train on real-world audio (Serum presets) with learnable synth parameters to test if system can approximate unseen sounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** How does the modulation discovery framework perform when applied to unconventional, non-synthetic audio inputs?
- Basis: The conclusion explicitly lists "creative applications with unconventional input audio" as a compelling direction for future work
- Why unresolved: Experiments are restricted to synthetic datasets and real-world samples from Serum soft synth
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation using acoustic instruments, vocal samples, or environmental sounds as targets

**Open Question 2:** What geometric or functional symmetries exist in the space of discovered modulation signals?
- Basis: Authors identify "analyzing the symmetry of discovered modulations" as a specific avenue for future research
- Why unresolved: Current study focuses on extraction and parameterization rather than analyzing structural properties
- What evidence would resolve it: Study mapping the latent manifold of extracted curves to identify invariances preserved across different sounds

**Open Question 3:** Can the piecewise Bézier curve parameterization be refined to close the performance gap with low-pass filtered signals?
- Basis: Results show spline parameterization maximizes interpretability but consistently yields lower sound-matching accuracy
- Why unresolved: Paper establishes a trade-off but doesn't propose a method to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified differentiable spline implementation achieving statistical parity with LPF on audio similarity metrics

## Limitations

- The approach assumes modulation signals are smooth and structured, which may not hold for all audio types
- The specific architecture of the LFO-net encoder and adapter MLPs is not fully specified in the paper
- The method depends heavily on the expressiveness of the DDSP synthesizer architecture

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The core mechanism of using differentiable DSP for gradient-based control signal inference is well-supported by the mathematical framework and implementation details.

**Medium confidence:** The effectiveness of inductive bias via signal parameterization is demonstrated but may not generalize to all audio types beyond the tested datasets.

**Medium confidence:** The functional modulation distribution across synth modules is observed in experiments but requires further validation across diverse synthesizer architectures.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-architecture generalization test:** Apply the framework to a different DDSP synthesizer architecture (e.g., Harmonic+Noise) to verify that modulation distribution (LLS 3 advantage) holds across architectures.

2. **Rapid modulation robustness test:** Generate synthetic audio with known high-frequency modulations (above 20Hz) and measure reconstruction accuracy using LPF vs. Spline parameterizations to quantify the smoothness bias limitation.

3. **Real-world audio diversity test:** Test the system on diverse real-world audio sources beyond Serum presets (e.g., acoustic instruments, environmental sounds) to evaluate whether the LPF parameterization consistently balances accuracy and interpretability.
