# GSAP-ERE: Fine-Grained Scholarly Entity and Relation Extraction Focused on Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.09411
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09411
- **Reference count:** 10
- **Primary result:** Introduces GSAP-ERE dataset with 63K entities and 35K relations across 100 ML papers

## Executive Summary
This paper presents GSAP-ERE, a fine-grained dataset for scholarly entity and relation extraction specifically focused on machine learning publications. The dataset contains 10 entity types and 18 relation types annotated across 100 full-text ML publications, totaling 63K entities and 35K relations. The authors demonstrate the dataset's utility by fine-tuning two baseline models (a pipeline approach and a joint approach) and comparing them to zero-shot and few-shot prompting with large language models. The best fine-tuned model achieves 80.6% F1 for named entity recognition and 54.0% F1 for relation extraction, substantially outperforming the LLM prompting results (44.4% and 10.1% F1, respectively). These results suggest that supervised models trained on curated datasets like GSAP-ERE outperform unsupervised LLM prompting on fine-grained scholarly IE tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors created GSAP-ERE by annotating 100 full-text machine learning publications with 10 entity types (including TASK, METHOD, DATASET, METRIC, CODE) and 18 relation types capturing scientific discourse patterns. They employed a team of annotators following detailed annotation guidelines and measured inter-annotator agreement to ensure quality. For baseline models, they fine-tuned both a pipeline approach (separate NER and RE models) and a joint approach (combined NER and RE) on the dataset. They also evaluated zero-shot and few-shot prompting with large language models using carefully crafted prompts. The evaluation metrics included standard precision, recall, and F1 scores for both entity recognition and relation extraction tasks.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned models achieved 80.6% F1 for NER compared to 44.4% F1 for LLM prompting
- Fine-tuned models achieved 54.0% F1 for RE compared to 10.1% F1 for LLM prompting
- The joint model approach showed competitive performance to the pipeline approach while reducing computational overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's fine-grained annotation scheme captures the complex relationships between scientific entities in ML papers, which requires understanding contextual nuances and domain-specific terminology. The supervised learning approach benefits from the curated annotations that capture these subtle distinctions, while LLM prompting struggles with the specificity and complexity of the task despite the models' general knowledge capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Fine-grained entity types**: Necessary for distinguishing between similar scientific concepts (e.g., different types of methods or metrics)
  - *Quick check*: Verify the 10 entity types cover the key scientific concepts in ML papers
- **Relation extraction**: Captures how entities interact and relate to each other in scientific discourse
  - *Quick check*: Ensure the 18 relation types capture meaningful scientific relationships
- **Domain-specific annotation**: ML publications contain specialized terminology and structures that generic NER approaches miss
  - *Quick check*: Confirm annotators had ML expertise to capture domain nuances
- **Pipeline vs joint modeling**: Different architectural approaches to handling the dependency between NER and RE tasks
  - *Quick check*: Evaluate whether joint modeling improves overall performance
- **Zero-shot vs few-shot prompting**: Testing LLM capabilities without extensive fine-tuning
  - *Quick check*: Compare performance across different shot counts and prompt formulations
- **Inter-annotator agreement**: Critical for ensuring dataset quality and reliability
  - *Quick check*: Review reported agreement scores to validate annotation consistency

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Annotation guidelines -> Annotators -> GSAP-ERE dataset -> Baseline models (Pipeline, Joint) -> Evaluation metrics

**Critical path:** Dataset annotation → Model training → Zero-shot/few-shot prompting → Performance comparison

**Design tradeoffs:** Fine-grained vs coarse-grained annotations (more detailed but harder to annotate vs simpler but less informative), pipeline vs joint modeling (simpler but sequential vs more complex but potentially more accurate)

**Failure signatures:** Low inter-annotator agreement indicates unclear guidelines or difficult distinctions; poor performance on specific entity types suggests need for more training data or better features for those types; significant gap between pipeline and joint approaches indicates dependency issues between NER and RE

**First experiments:**
1. Replicate the baseline model training on the GSAP-ERE dataset to verify reported performance metrics
2. Test the models on a small held-out validation set from the same distribution
3. Compare different prompt formulations for the LLM zero-shot and few-shot experiments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The dataset size (100 full-text papers) and ML domain specificity may limit generalizability to other scientific domains
- The significant performance gap between fine-tuned models and LLM prompting (43.9 F1 points for RE) needs investigation into whether this reflects fundamental limitations or implementation choices
- Lack of ablation studies on entity type granularity and relation complexity makes it difficult to isolate which aspects contribute most to task difficulty

## Confidence

High confidence in dataset construction methodology and annotation quality due to detailed guidelines and inter-annotator agreement metrics.

Medium confidence in baseline model comparisons as the experimental setup is standard but lacks detailed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation procedures.

Low confidence in broader claims about LLM prompting limitations since only a single prompting approach was evaluated without systematic exploration of alternatives.

## Next Checks

1. Test the GSAP-ERE models on a held-out test set from the same distribution to verify that reported performance metrics are not inflated by overfitting to the validation set.

2. Conduct domain transfer experiments by evaluating models on scholarly entity and relation extraction datasets from other scientific domains (e.g., biology, chemistry) to assess generalizability of fine-tuned models.

3. Perform systematic ablation studies varying granularity of entity types and relation categories to determine which aspects of fine-grained annotation scheme most significantly impact model performance.
