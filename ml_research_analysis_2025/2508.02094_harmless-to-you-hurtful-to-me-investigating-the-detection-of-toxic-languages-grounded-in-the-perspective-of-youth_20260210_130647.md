core_contribution: 'This paper investigates "youth-toxicity" languages, defined as
  content perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic to youth, which existing detection
  systems often overlook. The authors constructed a Chinese youth-toxicity dataset
  by collecting 5,092 utterances annotated by youth aged 13-21 across four dimensions:
  toxicity label, utterance source, toxicity type, and toxicity risk.'

# "Harmless to You, Hurtful to Me!": Investigating the Detection of Toxic Languages Grounded in the Perspective of Youth

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.02094
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02094
- **Reference count:** 30
- **Primary result:** Advanced LLMs significantly outperform traditional toxic language detectors when detecting youth-specific toxicity, especially with added meta-information like age and source.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical blind spot in toxic language detection: content perceived as harmless by adults but harmful to youth. The authors construct a Chinese youth-toxicity dataset annotated by youth aged 13-21, defining "youth toxicity" as a distinct category. Through logistic regression and LLM-based experiments, they demonstrate that traditional tools like Perspective API and fine-tuned PLMs fail to capture this nuanced perspective, while advanced LLMs (GPT-4o, GLM-4, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1, DeepSeek-R1) achieve significantly better performance when provided with contextual metadata such as age, gender, and utterance source. The study reveals that youth-toxicity perception is influenced by demographic and linguistic factors, and that detection systems must evolve to account for these individual and contextual differences.

## Method Summary
The authors built a Chinese youth-toxicity dataset by collecting 5,092 utterances annotated by 1,000 youth aged 13-21. Annotations covered four dimensions: toxicity label, utterance source, toxicity type, and toxicity risk. They conducted logistic regression to identify key features influencing youth toxicity perception, including demographic variables and linguistic patterns. For detection, they compared traditional methods (Perspective API, fine-tuned PLMs) against advanced LLMs with and without meta-information prompts. They also explored fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches to improve LLM performance.

## Key Results
- Traditional toxic language detection tools (Perspective API, fine-tuned PLMs) perform poorly on youth-toxicity data.
- Advanced LLMs (GPT-4o, GLM-4, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1, DeepSeek-R1) significantly outperform traditional methods when given meta-information (age, gender, utterance source).
- Fine-tuning LLMs further improves detection accuracy, while few-shot learning offers limited benefits.
- Providing meta-information to LLMs improves accuracy but risks over-moderation by exaggerating low-risk cases.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that youth-toxicity detection requires models to understand context beyond text—specifically, demographic and relational factors that shape how harmful content is perceived. Traditional detectors fail because they are trained on adult-labeled data and lack the ability to contextualize language based on the recipient's age and social environment. LLMs, with their capacity to integrate structured metadata into prompts, can simulate this contextual awareness, leading to improved detection of youth-specific toxicity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Youth-Toxicity Concept**: Content harmless to adults but harmful to youth—why needed to highlight detection blind spots; quick check: verify dataset annotations reflect this distinction.
- **Meta-Information Integration**: Adding demographic and source context to LLM prompts—why needed to improve contextual understanding; quick check: compare performance with and without metadata.
- **LLM Fine-Tuning vs. Prompting**: Trade-off between adapting model weights vs. engineering prompts—why needed to optimize detection accuracy; quick check: measure performance gains from fine-tuning vs. prompting alone.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Collection -> Annotation -> Logistic Regression Analysis -> LLM Prompting (with/without meta-info) -> Fine-tuning (optional) -> Evaluation

**Critical Path:** Dataset construction → Logistic regression feature analysis → LLM baseline testing → Meta-information prompt integration → Fine-tuning → Performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Using meta-information improves accuracy but risks over-moderation; fine-tuning boosts performance but requires more resources; few-shot learning is less effective than full fine-tuning.

**Failure Signatures:** Traditional tools misclassify youth-toxicity as nontoxic; LLMs without context underperform; over-moderation occurs when too much contextual information is provided.

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Replicate logistic regression to confirm key demographic and linguistic predictors of youth toxicity.
2. Test LLM performance with and without meta-information prompts on a held-out test set.
3. Conduct ablation study by removing individual meta-features (age, gender, source) to measure their marginal impact.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- What is the marginal utility of specific meta-information combinations (e.g., age vs. source) in LLM prompts for detecting youth toxicity?
- Can advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), mitigate the "risk exaggeration" observed when using meta-based prompts?
- How can toxicity detection systems be adapted to move from a generalized youth perspective to a personalized individual perspective?

## Limitations
- The study focuses on a general youth perspective rather than personalized detection for individuals.
- Meta-information was provided as a whole without exploring the effects of various combinations.
- The dataset is in Chinese, limiting generalizability to other languages.

## Confidence
- **Dataset Construction**: High — detailed methodology and large sample size.
- **Logistic Regression Analysis**: High — standard statistical approach with interpretable results.
- **LLM Performance Claims**: Medium — results are promising but may depend on prompt quality and dataset specifics.
- **Generalizability**: Low — findings are based on Chinese data and may not transfer directly to other languages or cultures.

## Next Checks
1. Validate logistic regression findings on a separate youth-toxicity dataset.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the marginal impact of each meta-feature in LLM prompts.
3. Test Chain-of-Thought prompting to assess its effect on reducing over-moderation while maintaining detection accuracy.
