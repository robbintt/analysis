## Executive Summary
Atlantes is a deep learning system that provides real-time global vessel activity monitoring by processing AIS GPS streams using transformer-based models. The system addresses the challenge of distinguishing vessel types and activities (fishing, transiting, anchored, moored, or other) from irregular GPS sequences. It employs a custom ATLAS architecture with continuous point embedding layers to handle spatial and temporal irregularities, combined with CNNs and transformers for feature extraction and sequence modeling. The model was trained on expert-annotated datasets covering 7,500+ track-months of AIS data, achieving 97.5% accuracy in entity classification and 71% overall accuracy in activity classification.

## Method Summary
Atlantes processes AIS messages through a two-stage pipeline: first classifying entities as vessel, buoy, or unknown, then classifying activities for vessel entities only. The core ATLAS architecture uses Continuous Point Embedding (CPE) layers to convert irregularly-sampled GPS sequences into regularized representations by computing spatiotemporal differences between successive anchor points within a 9-message window. This eliminates the need for interpolation or handcrafted features. CNN layers extract local movement patterns, followed by transformer encoders that learn global trajectory representations across sequences up to 2048 messages (30 days). The system achieves 28 activity classifications per second using modest computational resources, enabling operationally relevant maritime intelligence for global monitoring and intervention efforts.

## Key Results
- Entity classification accuracy: 97.5% for distinguishing vessels from buoys
- Overall activity classification accuracy: 71% (90% for known fishing vessels, 51% for unknown vessels)
- Real-time processing capability: 28 activity classifications per second
- Performance approaching human inter-annotator agreement of 85%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Continuous Point Embedding (CPE) for Spatiotemporal Irregularity
CPE layers enable transformers to process irregularly-sampled GPS sequences without interpolation or handcrafted features by computing spatiotemporal differences between successive anchor points within a configurable window (n=9 messages), converting irregular absolute positions into regularized relative representations suitable for transformer attention.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Local-Global Feature Extraction
CNNs extract local movement signatures while transformers aggregate global trajectory patterns. CNN layers capture short-term dynamics (speed/course changes), then transformer encoder applies self-attention across the full sequence context (up to 2048 messages, 30 days).

### Mechanism 3: Conditional Two-Stage Classification Pipeline
Entity classification (vessel vs. buoy) as a prerequisite constrains activity classification and reduces false positives. Entity classifier runs first (offline on historical data); activity classifier only proceeds if entity=vesel, with fishing events gated to vessel-class entities only.

## Foundational Learning

- **Self-attention for variable-length sequences**
  - Why needed here: Transformers must handle sequences from tens to thousands of GPS messages; understanding how attention aggregates across variable lengths is critical.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why padding/masking is needed for batched attention on sequences of different lengths?

- **Irregular time-series representation**
  - Why needed here: Unlike NLP tokens, GPS messages arrive at unpredictable intervals; CPE converts irregular samples into learnable representations.
  - Quick check question: What would go wrong if you fed raw (timestamp, lat, lon) tuples directly into a standard transformer?

- **Post-processing heuristics in ML systems**
  - Why needed here: Model outputs pass through confidence thresholds, geo-fencing, and speed filters; understanding when to trust model vs. rules is operational knowledge.
  - Quick check question: Why might a pure ML approach without geo-fencing produce implausible predictions (e.g., "fishing" in a harbor)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** AIS messages (MMSI, timestamp, lat, lon, SOG, COG) -> Change-point detection -> Context window assembly (up to 2048 messages / 30 days) -> Entity classifier (offline, 4 transformer layers): vessel/buoy/unknown -> Activity classifier (real-time, 9 transformer layers): transiting/anchored/fishing/moored/other -> Post-processing: confidence thresholds, geo-fencing (marine infrastructure), speed filters -> Output: Per-message activity labels at 28 classifications/second

- **Critical path:**
  1. Change-point detector flags behavioral shift (time + SOG-based)
  2. Context window (n messages) assembled from DB
  3. CPE embeds spatiotemporal deltas → CNN local features → transformer global encoding
  4. Classification head produces activity probabilities
  5. Post-processing filters apply domain constraints

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Lightweight model (4.7M params) vs. accuracy: enables modest hardware deployment but may underperform on rare vessel types
  - Real-time constraint vs. future context: model cannot use future messages; historical analysis would perform better
  - 71% overall accuracy (90% for known fishing vessels, 51% for unknown vessels) reflects this tradeoff

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Unknown vessel types: 51% accuracy suggests poor generalization to out-of-distribution vessel categories
  - Short trajectories (<500 messages): entity classifier defaults to "unknown"
  - Ambiguous activities: inter-annotator agreement is 85%, indicating inherent task difficulty

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation:** Run inference on a held-out stratified sample; verify entity accuracy ~97.5% and activity accuracy ~71% match reported metrics.
  2. **Ablation on context window:** Test activity accuracy with reduced context (e.g., 256 vs. 2048 messages) to quantify how much historical context contributes to performance.
  3. **Per-class error analysis:** Identify which activity classes have lowest per-class recall; inspect failure cases for systematic patterns (e.g., specific vessel types, geographic regions, or transmission gaps).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the performance gap between the model (71% accuracy) and human inter-annotator agreement (85%) be closed using only GPS streams, or is this a fundamental limitation of the data modality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "The best context we can provide about how 'good' our performance is, is that we are approaching human performance but not quite there. We measured inter-annotator agreement on the activity classification task at 85%."
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes the performance delta but does not determine if the remaining error rate is due to model architecture limitations or the inherent ambiguity of classifying activities solely from GPS data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study demonstrating convergence to or exceeding 85% accuracy on the activity classification task via architectural improvements or unsupervised pre-training on raw AIS data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the integration of multimodal data (e.g., satellite imagery) improve classification accuracy compared to the GPS-only approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Humans also typically use many different data sources, in addition to the GPS sequence, to classify a trajectory. The model only has access to the GPS stream."
- Why unresolved: The authors explicitly restrict the model to GPS streams to ensure low latency and cost-efficiency, leaving the potential gains from multimodal fusion unexplored in this work.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing the current ATLAS model against a multimodal variant that includes visual or contextual data sources.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can robust benchmarks be established for real-time maritime intelligence given the current lack of comparable global-scale models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Because there is no other model that offers real-time global predictions, we are not able to produce a direct comparison of this model to prior work."
- Why unresolved: The novelty of the real-time global constraint means standard benchmarks do not exist, making it difficult to objectively weigh the trade-offs between the model's speed and accuracy relative to the state-of-the-art.
- What evidence would resolve it: The release of a standardized, globally stratified test dataset with baseline metrics from other trajectory models adapted for real-time inference.

## Limitations
- Performance on rare or novel vessel types remains unclear, with unknown vessel accuracy at 51% suggesting significant out-of-distribution limitations
- Post-processing parameters (confidence thresholds, geo-fencing rules, speed filters) are critical for operational deployment but not fully specified in the paper
- The change-point detection algorithm details are only available in external GitHub repositories, creating reproducibility gaps

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Entity classification mechanism and performance (97.5% accuracy), CPE layer functionality for handling irregular GPS sequences, and the two-stage classification pipeline design
- **Medium Confidence**: Overall activity classification accuracy (71%) and the CNN-transformer feature extraction hierarchy, though detailed ablation studies are missing
- **Low Confidence**: Performance on rare vessel types (51% accuracy for unknown vessels), generalizability across different maritime regions and seasons, and the system's behavior with extended GPS transmission gaps

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on Context Window Size**: Systematically vary the context window from 256 to 2048 messages to quantify the impact on activity classification accuracy, particularly for fishing detection
2. **Out-of-Distribution Vessel Type Testing**: Evaluate the system on vessel types not present in the training data (e.g., research vessels, military ships) to assess generalization beyond the 90% fishing vessel accuracy
3. **GPS Gap Robustness Analysis**: Simulate irregular transmission patterns with gaps ranging from minutes to days to identify the threshold where CPE embedding and transformer attention break down
