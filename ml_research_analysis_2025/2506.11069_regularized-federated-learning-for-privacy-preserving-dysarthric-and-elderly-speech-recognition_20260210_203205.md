# Regularized Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.11069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11069
- Reference count: 0
- System demonstrates statistically significant WER reductions up to 0.54% absolute on UASpeech corpus

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates federated learning for dysarthric and elderly speech recognition, addressing privacy concerns in healthcare applications. The work explores three regularization techniques to improve federated learning performance: parameter-based, embedding-based, and a novel loss-based regularization using pseudo-logits from a frozen global model. Experiments on UASpeech and DementiaBank Pitt corpora demonstrate that all three methods significantly improve word error rates compared to baseline FedAvg systems, with loss-based regularization achieving the best results. The study also examines communication frequency effects, finding that more frequent exchanges approach centralized training performance.

## Method Summary
The research systematically evaluates federated learning for dysarthric and elderly speech recognition by implementing three regularization techniques. The parameter-based approach uses elastic weight consolidation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, the embedding-based method aligns local and global embedding spaces through contrastive learning, and the novel loss-based regularization introduces pseudo-logits from a frozen global model as auxiliary supervision. The experiments are conducted on UASpeech for dysarthric speech and DementiaBank Pitt for elderly speech, comparing these regularization methods against baseline FedAvg and centralized training approaches.

## Key Results
- Loss-based regularization achieves best performance with 0.54% absolute WER reduction on UASpeech
- Combining all three regularization techniques yields further improvements
- Communication frequency of one exchange per batch approaches centralized training performance
- Statistically significant improvements across both UASpeech and DementiaBank Pitt corpora

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Regularization techniques help federated learning systems overcome data heterogeneity and scarcity issues by providing additional constraints that guide model updates toward global optima. Parameter-based regularization prevents catastrophic forgetting by preserving important parameters from previous global models. Embedding-based regularization ensures local models learn representations aligned with the global model, reducing divergence. Loss-based regularization with pseudo-logits provides auxiliary supervision that helps local models maintain global knowledge while adapting to local data patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- Federated Learning: Distributed training paradigm where models are trained locally on client devices and only model updates are shared - needed for privacy preservation in healthcare applications; quick check: understanding of FedAvg algorithm
- Regularization Techniques: Methods to prevent overfitting and improve generalization - needed to address data heterogeneity in federated settings; quick check: knowledge of EWC, contrastive learning
- Dysarthric Speech Recognition: Recognition of speech affected by motor speech disorders - needed as target application domain; quick check: understanding of unique acoustic characteristics
- Elderly Speech Characteristics: Age-related changes in speech production - needed for DementiaBank Pitt corpus analysis; quick check: familiarity with acoustic aging effects
- Communication Frequency Trade-offs: Balance between model performance and communication overhead - needed for practical deployment considerations; quick check: understanding of convergence behavior

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Client Models -> Server Aggregator -> Global Model -> Regularization Module -> Client Models

Critical Path: Local training on client data → Regularization application → Model update aggregation → Global model update → Parameter synchronization

Design Tradeoffs: Privacy preservation vs. model performance, communication frequency vs. training time, regularization strength vs. local adaptation capability

Failure Signatures: Catastrophic forgetting without parameter regularization, embedding space divergence without alignment, poor convergence without auxiliary supervision

First Experiments:
1. Baseline FedAvg comparison on UASpeech corpus
2. Individual regularization technique evaluation
3. Combined regularization approach testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two specific datasets (UASpeech and DementiaBank Pitt)
- Communication frequency experiments only compare batch-level vs. one exchange per batch
- Statistical significance tests lack multiple comparison corrections

## Confidence
- High confidence: Regularization effectiveness improvements on both corpora
- Medium confidence: Loss-based regularization outperforming other methods
- Medium confidence: Federated approaches matching centralized performance with sufficient communication

## Next Checks
1. Test regularization techniques on additional dysarthric and elderly speech datasets for generalizability
2. Evaluate varying communication frequencies at finer intervals to identify optimal trade-offs
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of individual regularization components
