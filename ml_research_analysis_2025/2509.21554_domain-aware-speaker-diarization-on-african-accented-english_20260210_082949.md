# Domain-Aware Speaker Diarization On African-Accented English

## Quick Facts

- This study benchmarks eight state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems on African-accented English, revealing a 18.20 p.p. domain gap between clinical (DER 33.38%) and general speech (DER 15.18%).

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates speaker diarization performance on African-accented English across clinical and general domains, revealing a consistent performance gap favoring general speech. Benchmarking eight state-of-the-art systems shows clinical conversations incur significantly higher error (DER 33.38%) compared to general ones (DER 15.18%). Fine-tuning the Pyannote segmentation model on 67.73 hours of in-domain data reduces overall DER by 50% (21.30% → 10.65%) but does not fully close the domain gap. Error analysis attributes the clinical penalty primarily to false alarms and missed detections, linked to short turns and frequent overlap in clinical speech. Results suggest overlap-aware segmentation and balanced clinical resources as key directions for improvement.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates speaker diarization systems on AfriSpeech-Dialog, a corpus of African-accented English conversations (20 clinical + 29 general dyadic recordings). Eight state-of-the-art systems are benchmarked using strict DER with collar=0.0s and overlap scored. The study then fine-tunes Pyannote's segmentation module on AfriSpeech-Countries (67.73h accent-matched data) with frozen speaker embeddings, using frame-level BCE loss on 10-second chunks. Hyperparameters include Adam optimizer (LR=1e-4), batch_size=1 with gradient accumulation=4, 10 epochs with early stopping patience=3. Error decomposition into FA/MISS/CONF is performed using pyannote.metrics.

## Key Results
- Clinical domain penalty: Medical DER 33.38% vs General DER 15.18% across all systems (18.20 p.p. gap)
- Fine-tuning impact: Pyannote segmentation fine-tuning reduces overall DER from 21.30% to 10.65% (50% improvement)
- Error profile: Clinical speech shows FA-heavy errors (54% of DER) vs CONF-heavy in general speech (50% of DER)
- Structure effects: Medical conversations have ~2.6× more turns (78.6 vs 30.55) with ~9× shorter utterances (3.31s vs 30.71s)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuning only the segmentation module on accent-matched data substantially reduces DER without requiring full pipeline retraining.
- Mechanism: The segmentation model is fine-tuned on 67.73 hours of African-accented English (AfriSpeech-Countries) with speaker embeddings frozen, using frame-level binary cross-entropy loss on 10-second chunks. This adapts speech activity boundaries to accent-specific prosody while preserving pretrained speaker representations.
- Core assumption: Segmentation errors are a major contributor to overall diarization error in accented, domain-specific speech; embeddings generalize adequately without retraining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We test lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap."
  - [section 4.2] "For Pyannote, DER reduced from 21.30% to 10.65% overall (Medical: 31.46% to 15.73%; General: 19.03% to 9.52%)"
  - [corpus] Related work on SE-DiCoW shows domain-conditioned approaches improve generalization but require careful fine-tuning strategies.
- Break condition: If speaker confusion (CONF) dominates error rather than FA/MISS, segmentation-only fine-tuning will yield diminishing returns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The clinical domain penalty is primarily driven by false alarms and missed detections caused by conversation structure differences, not accent alone.
- Mechanism: Clinical conversations exhibit ~2.6× more turns per conversation (78.6 vs 30.55) with much shorter average utterances (3.31s vs 30.71s) and slightly higher overlap (0.14% vs 0.10%). These structural properties cause segmentation models to erroneously insert speaker boundaries (FA) or miss rapid turn transitions (MISS).
- Core assumption: DER components can be meaningfully decomposed and attributed to acoustic/structural features rather than random variation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap."
  - [section 4.2.1] "From General to Medical, FA increases most (+11.0 p.p.), followed by MISS (+5.9 p.p.) and CONF (+1.9 p.p.). As a share of DER, Medical is FA-heavy (54%)"
  - [corpus] No directly comparable corpus evidence on clinical conversation structure effects; this is a gap in related work.
- Break condition: If the clinical domain shift were primarily acoustic (e.g., background noise, recording quality) rather than structural, overlap-aware segmentation would be less impactful.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Broader multilingual training data provides domain robustness even without explicit fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: Commercial systems with larger, more diverse training corpora (e.g., AssemblyAI: 12.5M+ hours, 21+ languages) degrade less across domains than open systems trained on narrower datasets (e.g., Pyannote: ~2k hours, limited accent diversity).
- Core assumption: Exposure to diverse speakers, accents, and recording conditions during pretraining improves generalization to unseen domain-accent combinations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2.3] Table 4 shows training data profiles; AssemblyAI and Deepgram have substantially larger and more diverse training sets than open models.
  - [section 4.1] Table 7 shows AssemblyAI (DER 12.72%) and Deepgram (DER 14.21%) outperforming most open models.
  - [corpus] Related benchmarking work (SDBench) confirms high variance across datasets, suggesting training diversity matters.
- Break condition: If evaluation data distribution is extremely far from any training distribution, even large-scale pretraining may not help; targeted fine-tuning remains necessary.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Diarization Error Rate (DER) and its decomposition**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that DER = False Alarm + Missed Detection + Confusion is essential for diagnosing whether to improve segmentation (FA/MISS) or embeddings/clustering (CONF).
  - Quick check question: If FA dominates your error budget, which component of the diarization pipeline should you target first?

- Concept: **Overlap-aware vs. collar-based evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The study uses strict evaluation (collar=0.0s, overlap scored), which is harsher than typical protocols. Knowing this explains why DER values appear high.
  - Quick check question: What happens to your DER if you switch from scoring overlap to excluding it?

- Concept: **Segmentation- vs. embedding-focused adaptation**
  - Why needed here: The paper freezes embeddings and only fine-tunes segmentation. Understanding this distinction helps choose adaptation strategies based on error profiles.
  - Quick check question: If confusion error (CONF) is your primary issue, would segmentation-only fine-tuning be sufficient?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input (mono audio) -> Preprocessing (resampling, normalization) -> Segmentation module (Pyannote/segmentation-3.0) -> Activity + boundary predictions -> Embedding extraction (frozen) -> Clustering -> RTTM output

- Critical path:
  1. Audio preprocessing (resampling, normalization)
  2. Segmentation inference -> activity + boundary predictions
  3. Embedding extraction per segment
  4. Clustering to assign speaker labels
  5. DER scoring with Hungarian mapping

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Segmentation-only vs. full fine-tuning: Freezing embeddings reduces computation and data requirements but limits speaker discrimination improvements.
  - Strict vs. lenient evaluation: Collar=0.0s + overlap scored reveals true performance but inflates DER compared to standard benchmarks.
  - Chunk size (10s): Longer chunks provide more context but increase memory; shorter chunks may miss long-range dependencies.

- Failure signatures:
  - High FA + short utterances -> segmentation model over-segmenting; may need higher activity threshold or minimum duration constraints.
  - High MISS + rapid turns -> model missing brief utterances; consider lower detection threshold or overlap-aware training.
  - High CONF + similar speakers -> embedding/clustering weakness; may need better speaker discrimination or more stable clustering thresholds.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline replication: Run Pyannote 3.1 on AfriSpeech-Dialog eval split with strict DER protocol to reproduce reported Medical DER ~31.5% and General DER ~19%.
  2. Segmentation fine-tuning ablation: Fine-tune with varying amounts of data (10h, 30h, 67h) to measure DER reduction curve and identify diminishing returns.
  3. Error component profiling: Decompose DER into FA/MISS/CONF for both domains to confirm FA-heavy pattern in clinical data before investing in overlap-aware approaches.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can overlap-aware segmentation models (e.g., EEND variants with explicit overlap detection) reduce the false-alarm-dominated error pattern in clinical African-accented speech more effectively than the fine-tuned segmentation-only approach tested here?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Future work will evaluate explicit overlap models (EEND-style)" and that "reducing FA/MISS in clinical speech likely requires overlap-aware segmentation." Error analysis shows FA accounts for 54% of DER in medical speech versus 43% in general.
- Why unresolved: The study only fine-tuned Pyannote's segmentation module (frame-level BCE) without evaluating architectures designed to model overlapping speakers explicitly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark EEND or overlap-aware diarization systems on the same AfriSpeech-Dialog clinical subset, comparing FA/MISS decomposition against the fine-tuned Pyannote baseline.

---

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would collecting balanced clinical resources across multiple African accents (rather than the current 6 accents from 1 country in medical data) further close the medical-general DER gap beyond the 6.21 p.p. residual observed after fine-tuning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "balanced clinical resources across accents" as a future direction. Table 1 shows medical data has 6 accents from 1 country, while general has 8 accents from 3 countries, suggesting the clinical set may be less accent-diverse.
- Why unresolved: The fine-tuning set (AfriSpeech-Countries) was not domain-matched to clinical speech, and the clinical evaluation set has limited accent and geographic diversity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-tune on accent-balanced clinical data and measure whether the residual domain gap decreases relative to the current 6.21 p.p. gap.

---

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the clinical DER penalty stem from short turn duration versus overlap frequency, and can controlled manipulation of these factors quantify their independent contributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Future work will evaluate... controlled studies isolating overlap and turn-length effects." Table 11 shows medical turns are ~2.6× more frequent with ~9× shorter duration, but overlap is only slightly higher (0.14% vs 0.10%).
- Why unresolved: The correlational analysis cannot disentangle whether short turns, overlap, or their interaction drives FA/MISS increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Synthetic or controlled experiments varying turn length and overlap independently while holding other factors constant, measuring DER component changes.

---

### Open Question 4
- Question: Would a matched non-African clinical benchmark exhibit similar domain penalties, indicating that clinical speech is intrinsically harder for diarization regardless of accent?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note as a limitation "the absence of a matched non-African clinical benchmark." This leaves unclear whether the 18.20 p.p. domain gap is accent-interaction-specific or a general clinical-diagnostic property.
- Why unresolved: Without a non-African clinical comparison, the relative contributions of accent mismatch versus conversational structure (short turns, task-driven exchanges) cannot be separated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluate the same diarization systems on a non-African clinical corpus (e.g., English medical consultations) using identical protocols and compare domain gap magnitude.

## Limitations
- Clinical domain penalty attribution relies on correlational analysis without controlled isolation of acoustic vs. structural factors
- Fine-tuning effectiveness demonstrated only for segmentation module, not full pipeline adaptation
- Limited clinical accent diversity (6 accents from 1 country) may constrain generalizability of findings
- Absence of non-African clinical benchmark prevents isolating accent-specific vs. domain-specific challenges

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Domain gap exists and is measurable; fine-tuning segmentation reduces DER; FA and MISS are primary error sources in clinical speech.
- **Medium confidence**: Clinical domain penalty is primarily structural rather than acoustic; segmentation-only fine-tuning cannot fully close the gap; broader training data aids robustness.
- **Low confidence**: Overlap-aware segmentation will substantially improve clinical performance; error patterns are stable across different dataset splits.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation on training data diversity by training Pyannote from scratch with varying amounts of multilingual/accented data to isolate pretraining effects.
2. Implement and evaluate overlap-aware segmentation (e.g., pyannote/segmentation-4.0 or similar) on the AfriSpeech-Dialog clinical subset to test the proposed remedy.
3. Perform controlled acoustic analysis to separate structural vs. recording-quality contributions to the clinical domain penalty.
