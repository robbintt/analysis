# LSZone: A Lightweight Spatial Information Modeling Architecture for Real-time In-car Multi-zone Speech Separation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.10687
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10687
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Achieves 0.56G MACs computational complexity and 0.37 real-time factor while outperforming baselines in CER and FIR

## Executive Summary
LSZone introduces a lightweight spatial information modeling architecture specifically designed for real-time in-car multi-zone speech separation. The system employs a spatial information extraction-compression (SpaIEC) module that integrates Mel spectrogram and Interaural Phase Difference (IPD) to reduce computational load while maintaining separation performance. An ultra-lightweight Conv-GRU crossband-narrowband processing (CNP) module efficiently models spatial, frequency, and temporal information. The architecture demonstrates superior performance in complex noise and multi-speaker scenarios compared to competitive baselines while maintaining real-time capability.

## Method Summary
LSZone combines spatial information extraction with efficient neural processing modules. The SpaIEC module extracts spatial cues from both Mel spectrogram and IPD features, compressing this information to reduce computational requirements. The CNP module uses Conv-GRU layers to process crossband and narrowband information efficiently. This architecture is specifically optimized for in-car environments where computational resources are limited and real-time processing is essential. The system targets multi-zone speech separation, enabling clear communication between different passenger zones in vehicles.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.56G MACs computational complexity
- Maintains 0.37 real-time factor for real-time processing
- Outperforms Zoneformer, DualSep, and SpatialNet in CER and FIR metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The architecture leverages spatial information from microphone arrays combined with efficient neural processing. By integrating Mel spectrogram and IPD features in the SpaIEC module, it captures both spectral and spatial characteristics while reducing dimensionality. The Conv-GRU CNP module efficiently processes temporal and frequency information across different bands, enabling effective separation without excessive computational cost. This combination allows the system to maintain high performance in challenging in-car acoustic environments while meeting real-time constraints.

## Foundational Learning
- Mel Spectrogram: Why needed - captures spectral characteristics of speech signals; Quick check - verify Mel filter bank implementation and frequency range coverage
- Interaural Phase Difference (IPD): Why needed - provides spatial localization cues between microphones; Quick check - validate IPD calculation accuracy across frequency bands
- Conv-GRU Networks: Why needed - efficiently model temporal dependencies in sequential data; Quick check - test Conv-GRU layer configurations for optimal performance

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Microphone Array -> SpaIEC -> CNP -> Output Separator
Critical path: Audio input -> Mel+IPD extraction -> Spatial compression -> Conv-GRU processing -> Speech separation
Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs. separation performance; model complexity vs. real-time capability
Failure signatures: Poor spatial separation in low SNR conditions; increased computational load under multi-speaker scenarios
First experiments:
1. Validate Mel+IPD feature extraction accuracy
2. Test Conv-GRU layer configurations for computational efficiency
3. Benchmark separation performance against baseline models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited validation across different vehicle types and microphone array configurations
- Insufficient ablation studies showing individual module contributions
- Unclear generalization capabilities across varying environmental conditions

## Confidence
- Computational efficiency claims (MACs and RTF): High confidence

- Real-world deployment readiness: Low confidence (insufficient testing conditions specified)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive testing across different vehicle types and microphone array configurations to verify generalization capabilities
2. Perform long-term stability tests to evaluate model performance degradation over time in real-world conditions
3. Implement and validate the system in actual vehicles under varying environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind noise) to assess robustness
