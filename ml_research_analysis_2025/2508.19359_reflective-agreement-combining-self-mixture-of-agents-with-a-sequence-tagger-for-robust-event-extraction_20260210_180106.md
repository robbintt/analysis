# Reflective Agreement: Combining Self-Mixture of Agents with a Sequence Tagger for Robust Event Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19359
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19359
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ARIS achieves up to 73.8% F1 for trigger identification and 59.2% for argument classification on M2E2

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ARIS, a hybrid event extraction framework that combines a generative Self Mixture of Agents with a discriminative sequence tagger to improve both precision and recall. The method uses structured consensus detection, confidence-based filtering, and a reflective inference module to resolve ambiguous predictions, and leverages decomposed instruction fine-tuning to improve the LLM's understanding of event extraction subtasks. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show ARIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in argument extraction tasks.

## Method Summary
ARIS addresses the limitations of existing event extraction methods by combining generative and discriminative approaches in a hybrid architecture. The framework employs a Self Mixture of Agents (SoM) that generates multiple event extraction hypotheses, which are then refined through structured consensus detection. A reflective inference module analyzes the agreement patterns among agent outputs to resolve ambiguities and improve prediction quality. The system also incorporates confidence-based filtering to discard low-quality predictions and uses decomposed instruction fine-tuning to enhance the LLM's understanding of specific event extraction subtasks. This approach balances precision and recall while maintaining robustness across different event extraction scenarios.

## Key Results
- ARIS achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
- On M2E2 dataset: 73.8% F1 for trigger identification and 59.2% for argument classification
- The hybrid approach shows consistent improvements over purely generative or discriminative baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of ARIS stems from its ability to leverage complementary strengths of generative and discriminative approaches. The generative Self Mixture of Agents produces diverse hypotheses that capture different perspectives on event structures, while the discriminative sequence tagger provides precise token-level classification. The reflective agreement mechanism acts as a quality control layer, identifying and resolving inconsistencies between different extraction attempts. This multi-stage refinement process reduces both false positives and false negatives, leading to improved overall performance. The decomposed instruction fine-tuning ensures the LLM understands the nuances of event extraction subtasks, enabling more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

## Foundational Learning
- **Event extraction schema understanding**: Essential for mapping natural language to structured event representations; quick check involves verifying correct identification of event types, triggers, and arguments.
- **Zero-shot learning capabilities**: Critical for leveraging pre-trained LLMs without extensive fine-tuning; quick check examines performance on out-of-distribution examples.
- **Structured consensus detection**: Needed to aggregate multiple extraction hypotheses; quick check evaluates agreement quality between different agent outputs.
- **Confidence-based filtering**: Important for quality control; quick check assesses correlation between confidence scores and actual prediction accuracy.
- **Reflective inference mechanisms**: Required for resolving ambiguous predictions; quick check measures improvement in agreement consistency after reflection.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Documents -> Self Mixture of Agents -> Consensus Detection -> Reflective Inference -> Confidence Filtering -> Final Output

**Critical Path**: The core processing pipeline flows from document input through the SoM agents, consensus detection, and reflective inference stages before final output generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The hybrid architecture trades computational complexity for improved accuracy, requiring multiple LLM inference passes versus single-pass approaches. The reflective agreement mechanism adds latency but significantly improves prediction quality.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include inconsistent agent outputs that cannot be resolved through consensus, low-confidence predictions that get filtered despite being correct, and schema mismatches when applying to domains with different event structures.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run the SoM agents independently to establish baseline performance without consensus detection
2. Apply confidence filtering to single-agent outputs to measure its standalone impact
3. Test reflective inference on synthetically generated ambiguous cases to validate the agreement resolution mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on LLM zero-shot capabilities may limit performance on out-of-domain data
- Computational overhead from multiple inference passes could impact real-time applications
- Task-specific annotation requirements for instruction fine-tuning may limit scalability
- Performance on long documents and dense event structures was not thoroughly evaluated
- Potential LLM biases in event understanding that could systematically affect extraction quality

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The hybrid architecture combining generative and discriminative components is technically sound and well-motivated
- **Medium confidence**: Reported improvements are significant but may partly reflect specific evaluation setup
- **Medium confidence**: The decomposed instruction fine-tuning approach appears promising but requires more extensive ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain evaluation using datasets from different domains (biomedical, financial, social media) to assess generalizability
2. Perform systematic ablation studies isolating the contribution of each ARIS component
3. Evaluate the framework's performance on documents with varying lengths and event densities to establish scalability limits
