## Executive Summary
This survey synthesizes the emerging ecosystem of alternatives to next-token prediction (NTP) in large language models, categorizing methods into five families: multi-token prediction (MTP), plan-then-generate (PtG), latent reasoning (LR), continuous generation approaches (CG), and non-transformer architectures (NTA). These approaches address NTP's fundamental limitations—error accumulation, lack of global planning, computational inefficiency, and semantic granularity mismatch—by shifting from token-by-token generation to methods that predict blocks of tokens, generate global plans, operate in continuous latent spaces, refine outputs iteratively, or use alternative model structures like state space models. The survey provides a roadmap for researchers exploring how language models might move beyond token-level generation toward more human-like planning and reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
This is a comprehensive survey that categorizes alternatives to next-token prediction by analyzing 13 representative papers from major venues (ACL, EMNLP, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, arXiv, 2020-2025). The authors synthesized literature to create a taxonomy based on prediction target (single token vs. block vs. latent), generation paradigm (sequential vs. parallel), planning mechanism (implicit vs. explicit), and architectural structure. The survey evaluates each approach's strengths, limitations, and failure modes, providing implementation insights and empirical benchmarks where available.

## Key Results
- Multi-token prediction enables parallel token prediction and faster inference but limited to short-term planning horizons
- Plan-then-generate approaches decouple high-level planning from low-level generation to improve global coherence
- Latent reasoning models operate over semantic units rather than subword tokens to capture larger abstractions
- Continuous generation replaces sequential generation with iterative refinement, enabling bidirectional context
- Non-transformer architectures (Mamba, state space models) sidestep token-level generation entirely

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Shared-Trunk Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)
Predicting blocks of $k$ future tokens simultaneously forces richer planning-oriented representations and enables faster inference via speculative decoding. A shared transformer trunk processes context, feeding multiple parallel output heads that predict tokens at different future offsets ($t+1, t+2, \dots$). This prevents myopic optimization for immediate local likelihood.

### Mechanism 2: Plan-then-Generate (PtG) for Global Coherence
Decoupling high-level planning from low-level token generation mitigates error accumulation and greedy myopia by committing to a global structure before emitting text. A distinct "Planner" module first maps input context $c$ to a high-level plan $z$ (symbolic or latent), then a "Generator" produces the output sequence $y$ conditioned on both $c$ and $z$.

### Mechanism 3: Continuous Generation (Diffusion/Flow) for Iterative Refinement
Replacing left-to-right token generation with parallel, iterative refinement over a global representation allows for bidirectional context and self-correction. The model initializes the entire output sequence (often as noise or a mask) and refines it over $N$ steps using denoising (diffusion) or deterministic paths (flow matching).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: The Token Granularity Mismatch**
  - Why needed here: The paper argues NTP fails because it forces reasoning over "subword tokens" (BPE) when human reasoning operates over "ideas." Understanding this mismatch is crucial for valuing Latent Reasoning (LR) and PtG.
  - Quick check question: Why does predicting the next subword token fail to capture the intent of a sentence-level thought?

- **Concept: Teacher Forcing & The "Clever Hans" Effect**
  - Why needed here: This explains why standard NTP training fails at planning. The paper cites Bachmann and Nagarajan (2024) to show models learn shortcuts using revealed prefixes rather than learning to plan.
  - Quick check question: In standard training, does the model learn to generate the next token based on its own past predictions or the ground truth, and why does this cause failure at test time?

- **Concept: Autoregression vs. Parallelism**
  - Why needed here: Fundamental distinction between sequential nature of NTP/MTP (limiting speed and causing error drift) and parallel nature of Continuous Generation (CG) approaches like diffusion.
  - Quick check question: How does parallel refinement in diffusion models theoretically prevent the "error accumulation" seen in autoregressive decoding?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - MTP: Trunk (Shared Transformer) $\to$ Multiple Heads (Offsets $1 \dots k$)
  - PtG: Input $\to$ Planner (CRF/VAE/Diffusion) $\to$ Plan Latent $\to$ Generator (LLM)
  - CG: Noise/Mask $\to$ Denoiser (Diffusion/Flow) $\to$ Continuous Embedding $\to$ Rounding/Decoder
  - LR: Input $\to$ Latent Autoregression (Thought Vectors) $\to$ Decoder

- **Critical path:** For MTP, the critical path is ensuring the trunk representation $h_t$ has sufficient bandwidth to feed all heads. For PtG, it is the interface where the plan $z$ conditions the generator (e.g., cross-attention vs. prepending).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - MTP: Gains inference speed (speculative decoding) and short-term planning at cost of complex training heads
  - PtG: Gains global coherence at cost of pipeline complexity and potential rigidity
  - CG: Gains bidirectional refinement (fixing errors globally) at cost of slow inference (multiple denoising steps) and fixed output lengths

- **Failure signatures:**
  - NTP/MTP: "Greediness"—local optima that ruin long-term coherence (e.g., dead ends in reasoning)
  - PtG: "Pipeline Fragility"—the generator ignores the plan, or the plan is hallucinated/abstract to the point of uselessness
  - LR/CG: "Latent Misalignment"—the continuous vector decodes to text that doesn't match the intended high-level concept

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement a 4-head MTP trunk on small GPT-2 scale model. Measure if perplexity on 4th token degrades compared to 1st, and compare inference speed with speculative decoding.
  2. Build simple PtG system where "Plan" is just a summary generated by frozen LLM. Feed this summary back as prefix. Compare long-form coherence against standard NTP.
  3. Following "Future Lens" approach, probe standard LLM's intermediate layers to see if they linearly predict tokens $t+4$ or $t+5$. If they do, confirms "larger-than-token" capacity exists.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can variable-length or adaptive prediction horizons enable Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) models to achieve global reasoning capabilities beyond limitations of fixed $k$? Current MTP implementations typically look only 4–5 tokens ahead, limiting them to short-term planning and failing to account for document-level structure.

- How can Plan-then-Generate (PtG) models systematically verify that generated output strictly adheres to high-level latent plan? Latent planners are often opaque, making it difficult to debug or quantify causal link between generated plan and final token sequence.

- How can continuous generation approaches, such as diffusion models, be effectively composed with hierarchical planning to ensure global coherence? Continuous generation models currently excel at local fluency but struggle with global structure due to fixed-length constraints and lack of explicit semantic planning modules.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical comparisons across approaches—most innovations evaluated in isolation rather than head-to-head against NTP baselines and each other
- Computational overhead of training and inference for alternatives like diffusion-based methods may offset theoretical advantages
- Some methods blur category boundaries suggesting taxonomy may be more fluid than presented

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The identification of next-token prediction's fundamental limitations (error accumulation, lack of global planning, computational inefficiency) is well-supported by both theoretical arguments and empirical observations.

**Medium Confidence**: Claims about specific mechanisms (e.g., that MTP forces planning-oriented representations or that CG enables bidirectional refinement) are plausible but lack comprehensive empirical validation.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about relative performance and scalability of different approaches remain speculative due to limited testing on large models and real-world applications.

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Comparison Suite**: Implement and evaluate one representative from each of the five categories on unified benchmark suite including long-form coherence tasks, reasoning tasks, and efficiency metrics to provide empirical grounding for taxonomic claims.

2. **Planning Horizon Analysis**: Systematically vary lookahead distance k in MTP models and measure degradation in both local perplexity and global coherence metrics. Compare against PtG models with different plan abstraction levels to quantify whether explicit planning provides advantages over implicit multi-token prediction.

3. **Continuous Space Fidelity Evaluation**: For CG and LR approaches, conduct ablation studies measuring reconstruction fidelity across latent space, semantic drift over refinement steps, and trade-off between continuous representation capacity and discrete output quality.
