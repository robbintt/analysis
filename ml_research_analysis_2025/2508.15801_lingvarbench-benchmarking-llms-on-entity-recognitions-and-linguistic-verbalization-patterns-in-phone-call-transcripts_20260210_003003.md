# LingVarBench: Benchmarking LLMs on Entity Recognitions and Linguistic Verbalization Patterns in Phone-Call Transcripts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.15801
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15801
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: LingVarBench enables LLM-based entity extraction from phone-call transcripts, achieving 94-95% F1 scores for structured entities using optimized prompts and synthetic data.

## Executive Summary
LingVarBench introduces a synthetic data generation pipeline to address structured entity extraction from phone-call transcripts, where disfluencies and speaker overlap hinder performance. The approach leverages LLM-sampled entity values, curated linguistic verbalization patterns, and a value-transcript consistency filter to create training data. DSPy's SIMBA optimizes extraction prompts, reducing manual engineering. On real customer transcripts, prompts optimized solely on LingVarBench achieve F1 scores of approximately 94-95% for structured entities like ZIP code, date of birth, and name, matching or surpassing human-tuned prompts. For subjective questionnaire items, optimized prompts substantially improve over zero-shot performance and approach human-tuned prompts. LingVarBench offers a practical and cost-efficient path to deployment in a direct-answer setting, with real annotations later enabling additional refinement.

## Method Summary
LingVarBench is a synthetic data generation pipeline that creates linguistically varied training data for LLM-based entity extraction from phone-call transcripts. It uses LLM-sampled entity values, curated linguistic verbalization patterns, and a value-transcript consistency filter to produce high-quality synthetic transcripts. DSPy's SIMBA optimizes extraction prompts on this synthetic data, reducing the need for manual prompt engineering. The system is evaluated on real customer transcripts, achieving high F1 scores for structured entities and substantial improvements for subjective questionnaire items compared to zero-shot baselines.

## Key Results
- Prompts optimized solely on LingVarBench synthetic data achieve F1 scores of approximately 94-95% for structured entities (ZIP code, date of birth, name) on real customer transcripts.
- For subjective questionnaire items, optimized prompts substantially improve over zero-shot performance and approach human-tuned prompts.
- LingVarBench enables deployment in a direct-answer setting with real annotations later enabling additional refinement.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LingVarBench pipeline addresses the challenge of structured entity extraction from phone-call transcripts by generating synthetic training data that captures the linguistic variability and disfluencies present in real conversations. By leveraging LLM-sampled entity values and curated verbalization patterns, the system can create diverse and realistic training examples. DSPy's SIMBA optimizes prompts on this synthetic data, reducing the need for manual engineering and enabling robust performance on real-world transcripts. The value-transcript consistency filter ensures that generated data maintains coherence, further improving the quality of the synthetic training set.

## Foundational Learning
- **Synthetic data generation for domain adaptation**: Needed to create diverse training examples that capture linguistic variability and disfluencies in phone-call transcripts; Quick check: Evaluate model performance on held-out real-world data after training on synthetic data.
- **LLM-sampled entity values**: Required to introduce variability and realism into synthetic training data; Quick check: Compare entity extraction accuracy when using LLM-sampled vs. static entity values.
- **Value-transcript consistency filtering**: Ensures that generated transcripts maintain coherence and realism, improving data quality; Quick check: Measure consistency scores of generated transcripts before and after filtering.
- **DSPy SIMBA prompt optimization**: Automates prompt engineering, reducing manual effort and improving robustness; Quick check: Compare performance of optimized vs. hand-tuned prompts on real transcripts.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Synthetic Data Generator -> DSPy SIMBA Optimizer -> Entity Extractor -> Evaluation Module

### Critical Path
Synthetic Data Generator (LLM-sampled values + verbalization patterns + consistency filter) -> DSPy SIMBA Optimizer (prompt optimization) -> Entity Extractor (LLM-based extraction) -> Evaluation Module (F1 score calculation)

### Design Tradeoffs
- Synthetic data generation vs. reliance on real annotations: Synthetic data enables rapid iteration and cost savings but may not fully capture all real-world linguistic patterns.
- LLM-sampled entity values vs. static values: LLM sampling increases variability but may introduce noise; static values ensure consistency but reduce diversity.
- DSPy optimization vs. manual prompt engineering: Automation reduces effort and improves robustness but may not capture domain-specific nuances as effectively as human tuning.

### Failure Signatures
- Low F1 scores on real transcripts despite high synthetic data performance: Indicates synthetic data may not fully represent real-world linguistic patterns.
- High variance in entity extraction results: Suggests sensitivity to prompt phrasing or data quality issues.
- Poor performance on out-of-domain or highly disfluent transcripts: Highlights limitations of synthetic data and curated verbalization patterns.

### First Experiments
1. Evaluate optimized prompts on a separate, out-of-domain corpus to assess robustness and generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contributions of synthetic data quality, linguistic patterns, and DSPy optimization to performance.
3. Test the system on transcripts with higher speaker overlap, greater disfluency rates, or more complex entity types to identify failure modes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains are demonstrated primarily on a single telecom domain, limiting generalizability to other domains or entity types.
- The synthetic data approach may not fully capture all real-world linguistic patterns, especially for highly variable or complex conversational contexts.
- The system focuses on structured entity extraction and does not address more complex entity types or relations.
- Reliance on proprietary DSPy optimization and specific prompt templates may constrain reproducibility across different environments or domains.

## Confidence

### Confidence Labels
- **High confidence** in the technical feasibility and internal validity of the LingVarBench pipeline for the targeted telecom domain.
- **Medium confidence** in the generalizability of results to other domains or entity types, given the synthetic data approach and domain-specific nature of the benchmark.
- **Low confidence** in the robustness of the system to highly variable linguistic patterns or out-of-domain conversational contexts not covered by the curated verbalization patterns.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the optimized prompts on a separate, out-of-domain corpus to assess robustness and generalizability beyond the original telecom setting.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of synthetic data quality, linguistic verbalization patterns, and DSPy optimization to overall performance.
3. Test the system's performance on transcripts with higher speaker overlap, greater disfluency rates, or more complex entity types (e.g., relational entities or nested entities) to identify potential failure modes.
