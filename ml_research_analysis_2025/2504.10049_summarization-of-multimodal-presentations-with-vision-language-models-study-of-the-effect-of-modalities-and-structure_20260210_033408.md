# Summarization of Multimodal Presentations with Vision-Language Models: Study of the Effect of Modalities and Structure

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.10049
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10049
- Reference count: 40
- This paper investigates how different input representations affect the performance of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for summarizing multimodal presentations.

## Executive Summary
This study explores how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can effectively summarize multimodal presentations by examining various input representations. The researchers systematically evaluate the impact of different modalities (slides, transcripts, videos) and their structural arrangements on summarization performance. Using Qwen2-VL and other VLMs, they discover that structured interleaved representations of slides and transcripts significantly outperform unstructured concatenation or single-modality inputs. The work reveals critical insights about visual token thresholds and modality interactions that could guide the development of more effective multimodal summarization systems.

## Method Summary
The authors experiment with various input representations for multimodal presentation summarization, including unimodal slides, transcripts, and videos, as well as multimodal combinations. They test structured interleaved slide-transcript sequences against unstructured concatenations, varying the number of visual tokens per slide (16, 64, 256, 512, 1024). Using VLMs like Qwen2-VL, they evaluate performance on the Minimax-Conference dataset with ROUGE metrics. The study also includes extractive analysis to understand how multimodal inputs affect summary content compared to unimodal approaches, revealing that multimodal summaries are less extractive but more relevant than unimodal ones.

## Key Results
- Structured interleaved slide-transcript representations outperform unstructured concatenation across all VLMs tested
- 512 visual tokens per slide achieves optimal performance for Qwen2-VL
- Extracted key frames from video outperform raw video input
- Multimodal summaries are less extractive but more relevant than unimodal summaries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of structured interleaved representations stems from their ability to maintain natural alignment between visual and textual elements while preserving contextual relationships. When slides and transcripts are properly interleaved, the model can leverage cross-modal interactions more effectively, capturing temporal and semantic dependencies that are lost in unstructured concatenation. The 512-token threshold appears to provide sufficient visual context without overwhelming the model with redundant information, allowing optimal balance between visual detail and computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
**Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** - Neural architectures that process both visual and textual inputs simultaneously. Needed to understand how models handle multimodal information fusion. Quick check: Verify the model can process both image and text tokens in the same forward pass.

**Multimodal Input Representations** - Different ways of structuring slides, transcripts, and videos for model consumption. Essential for understanding how input format affects model performance. Quick check: Compare structured vs unstructured input processing paths.

**ROUGE Metrics** - Evaluation metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUUGE-L) measuring n-gram overlap between generated and reference summaries. Critical for quantitative assessment of summarization quality. Quick check: Calculate ROUGE scores between human-written and model-generated summaries.

**Visual Tokenization** - Process of converting images into discrete token sequences for model processing. Important for understanding computational tradeoffs in visual input processing. Quick check: Verify visual token count affects model performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Processing -> Tokenization -> Cross-Modal Fusion -> Summarization

**Critical Path**: Visual Token Extraction → Text Token Processing → Cross-Modal Attention → Summary Generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Visual tokens vs computational efficiency: More tokens provide better visual context but increase computational cost
- Structured vs unstructured inputs: Structured inputs preserve relationships but may limit flexibility
- Single vs multimodal inputs: Multimodal inputs capture more information but introduce modality conflicts

**Failure Signatures**:
- Performance degradation when visual tokens exceed 1024 per slide
- Reduced effectiveness of raw video compared to extracted frames
- Inconsistent performance across different VLMs on the same task

**First Experiments**:
1. Test structured vs unstructured input representations with minimal visual tokens (16)
2. Evaluate single-modality performance (slides only vs transcript only)
3. Compare extracted key frames vs raw video input with identical visual token counts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Results are based on conference presentations which may not generalize to other multimodal domains
- Comparison limited to Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, potentially missing performance differences with other VLMs
- Assumes slide-transcript alignment exists, but real-world presentations often have misalignment
- Does not address temporal dynamics in video processing beyond key frame extraction

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Structured interleaved representations outperform unstructured concatenation (supported by clear performance metrics across multiple VLMs)

**Medium confidence**: Optimal visual token threshold of 512 tokens per slide (based on Qwen2-VL results but may vary across models)

**Medium confidence**: Superiority of extracted key frames over raw video (limited to two video input variants)

**Low confidence**: Claims about cross-modality training data improvements (speculative based on observed modality conflicts)

## Next Checks

1. Test the optimal visual token threshold (512 tokens per slide) across multiple VLMs and presentation types to verify generalizability

2. Evaluate model performance on presentations with intentionally misaligned slides and transcripts to assess robustness to modality conflicts

3. Compare results with other strong VLMs (e.g., GPT-4V, Claude 3) and newer models to establish relative performance baselines
