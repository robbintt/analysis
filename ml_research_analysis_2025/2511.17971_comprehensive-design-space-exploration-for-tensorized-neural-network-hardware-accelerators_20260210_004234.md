core_contribution: This work addresses the inefficiency of tensorized neural networks
  (TNNs) in real hardware by showing that algorithm-level tensor decomposition optimizations
  (which reduce parameters) do not guarantee hardware acceleration. The key insight

# Comprehensive Design Space Exploration for Tensorized Neural Network Hardware Accelerators

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.17971
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17971
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Key outcome:** Co-design of algorithmic tensor decomposition and hardware optimization achieves up to 4× inference and 3.85× training speedup for TNNs on FPGAs

## Executive Summary
This work demonstrates that tensorized neural networks (TNNs) optimized at the algorithm level through tensor decomposition do not automatically translate to hardware acceleration due to the complex interplay between contraction paths, hardware partitioning, and dataflow mappings. The authors propose a unified design space exploration framework that formulates a latency-driven objective function and solves it via global search across layer-wise configurations. Their approach combines MAC-guided contraction path search with hierarchical optimization to minimize end-to-end execution cost, implemented on a parameterized FPGA kernel.

The key insight is that algorithm-level parameter reduction alone is insufficient for hardware efficiency; instead, the contraction paths, hardware partitioning strategies, and dataflow mappings must be jointly optimized. By treating these three dimensions as tightly coupled rather than independent, the framework achieves significant improvements in inference and training latency while reducing power consumption. The method shows up to 4× lower inference latency and 3.85× lower training latency compared to dense baselines, with up to 21% power reduction, demonstrating the critical importance of co-designing algorithmic and hardware dimensions for TNN efficiency on edge devices.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a unified design space exploration framework that formulates a latency-driven objective function for tensorized neural networks. The method solves this optimization problem through global search across layer-wise configurations, combining MAC-guided contraction path search with hierarchical search to minimize end-to-end execution cost. The framework is implemented on a parameterized FPGA kernel that can be configured for different TNN architectures and hardware constraints.

The approach treats contraction paths, hardware partitioning, and dataflow mappings as tightly coupled dimensions that must be jointly optimized rather than independently tuned. The hierarchical search methodology first explores contraction paths at the algorithm level, then maps these to hardware configurations through the parameterized FPGA kernel. This unified formulation allows the framework to find optimal configurations that balance computational efficiency with hardware resource utilization, achieving significant latency and power improvements over traditional dense baselines.

## Key Results
- Up to 4× lower inference latency compared to dense neural network baselines
- Up to 3.85× lower training latency through optimized contraction paths and hardware mappings
- Up to 21% power reduction achieved through joint optimization of algorithmic and hardware parameters
- Demonstrated effectiveness on parameterized FPGA kernel with configurable hardware configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from recognizing that tensor decomposition optimizations at the algorithm level do not automatically translate to hardware acceleration. The mechanism works by jointly optimizing three tightly coupled dimensions: contraction paths (determining how tensor operations are decomposed), hardware partitioning (how computations are distributed across resources), and dataflow mappings (how data moves through the hardware). By formulating a unified latency-driven objective that considers all three dimensions simultaneously through global search, the framework can discover configurations that traditional independent optimization approaches would miss.

## Foundational Learning

**Tensor Decomposition (CP-decomposition)**: Factorization of high-dimensional tensors into a sum of rank-one tensors, reducing parameter count while maintaining representational capacity. Why needed: Enables compression of neural network weights while preserving computational capabilities. Quick check: Verify that reconstructed tensors maintain sufficient accuracy for the target task.

**Contraction Path Optimization**: Determining the optimal order of tensor contractions to minimize computational complexity. Why needed: Different contraction orders can lead to exponential differences in operation count and memory requirements. Quick check: Compare FLOPs for different contraction paths on the same tensor network.

**Hardware Partitioning**: Distribution of computational tasks across available hardware resources (PEs, memory banks, etc.). Why needed: Determines parallel execution capability and resource utilization efficiency. Quick check: Verify that workload is balanced across all processing elements.

**Dataflow Mapping**: Scheduling of data movement and computation to match hardware architecture characteristics. Why needed: Critical for maximizing data reuse and minimizing memory access latency. Quick check: Ensure data reuse patterns align with available on-chip memory hierarchy.

**Parameterized FPGA Kernel**: Configurable hardware template that can be adapted for different TNN architectures and optimization targets. Why needed: Enables rapid prototyping and evaluation of different design configurations without full hardware redesign. Quick check: Verify kernel configurability across different tensor shapes and sizes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** TNN Algorithm → Contraction Path Search → Hardware Partitioning → Dataflow Mapping → Parameterized FPGA Kernel → Performance Metrics

**Critical Path:** Algorithm configuration (tensor decomposition) → Contraction path optimization → Hardware resource allocation → Dataflow scheduling → FPGA execution

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- Parameter reduction vs. computational overhead of tensor operations
- Hardware resource utilization vs. latency optimization
- Memory bandwidth vs. on-chip storage requirements
- Flexibility of configuration vs. optimization quality

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Suboptimal contraction paths leading to increased FLOPs
- Poor hardware partitioning causing resource underutilization or bottlenecks
- Inefficient dataflow mappings resulting in excessive memory accesses
- Configuration mismatches between algorithm and hardware constraints

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate contraction path optimization on simple tensor networks to establish baseline performance improvements
2. Test hardware partitioning strategies with fixed dataflow mappings to isolate optimization effects
3. Validate parameterized FPGA kernel configurability across different tensor shapes and sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None provided in the source material.

## Limitations

- Design space exploration may not generalize to all tensor decomposition schemes or emerging TNN variants beyond CP-decomposition
- Performance claims are based on a specific parameterized FPGA kernel template rather than complete architectural exploration
- Evaluation focuses on latency and power metrics without extensive analysis of area overhead, thermal constraints, or multi-objective trade-offs critical for edge deployment

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core insight that contraction paths, hardware partitioning, and dataflow mappings must be jointly optimized is well-supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental results
- **Medium confidence**: The specific latency and power improvement numbers are reliable within the evaluated FPGA kernel context but may vary with different hardware implementations
- **Medium confidence**: The hierarchical search methodology is sound, but its optimality for all TNN configurations has not been exhaustively proven

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the framework's performance across diverse TNN architectures beyond CP-decomposed networks, including tensor train and block-term decompositions
2. Implement and benchmark the optimized designs on multiple FPGA platforms and ASIC prototypes to verify cross-platform generalizability
3. Conduct multi-objective optimization studies incorporating area, thermal, and energy-per-inference metrics alongside latency to assess real-world deployment viability
