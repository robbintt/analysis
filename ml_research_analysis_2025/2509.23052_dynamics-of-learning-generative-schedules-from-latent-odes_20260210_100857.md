# Dynamics of Learning: Generative Schedules from Latent ODEs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23052
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23052
- Authors: Matt L. Sampson; Peter Melchior
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: LODE-based method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks including 93.8% accuracy on Fashion-MNIST, 93.9% on CIFAR-100, 74.5% on ImageNet, and 59.8% next-word prediction accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of finding optimal learning rate schedules for neural network training. Current methods rely on simple parametric functions or short-term signals, lacking a comprehensive view of the training process. The proposed method uses a Latent ODE (LODE) model trained on hyperparameter search data to predict future training dynamics and select the learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance.

The LODE model encodes current training metrics (loss, validation accuracy, learning rate) into a latent vector and generates future trajectories to guide learning rate selection. The method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks: 93.8% accuracy on Fashion-MNIST (CNN), 93.9% on CIFAR-100 (ResNet18), 74.5% on ImageNet (ResNet34), and 59.8% next-word prediction accuracy on a transformer model. The trained models are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape, providing better generalization than those trained with other schedules. The approach is computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can be easily integrated with ML experiment-tracking platforms.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a Latent ODE (LODE) model to predict future training dynamics and optimize learning rate schedules. The LODE model is trained on hyperparameter search data and uses a latent vector encoding of current training metrics (loss, validation accuracy, learning rate) to generate future trajectories. These trajectories guide the selection of learning rate schedules that maximize long-term validation performance. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art results across various tasks and architectures, with trained models located in flatter regions of the loss landscape, indicating better generalization.

## Key Results
- Achieves 93.8% accuracy on Fashion-MNIST with CNN
- Achieves 93.9% accuracy on CIFAR-100 with ResNet18
- Achieves 74.5% accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet34
- Achieves 59.8% next-word prediction accuracy on transformer model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LODE model captures the complex, non-linear dynamics of neural network training by encoding current training metrics into a latent space and predicting future trajectories. This allows the model to anticipate how different learning rate schedules will affect long-term validation performance, rather than relying on short-term signals or simple parametric functions. By selecting schedules that lead to flatter loss landscapes, the method ensures better generalization and robustness of the trained models.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Latent ODEs (LODE)**
   - Why needed: To model the continuous-time dynamics of neural network training and predict future trajectories based on current metrics.
   - Quick check: Verify that the LODE model can accurately predict training dynamics on a held-out validation set.

2. **Hyperparameter Search**
   - Why needed: To generate diverse training data for training the LODE model across different learning rate schedules and architectures.
   - Quick check: Ensure that the hyperparameter search covers a wide range of learning rate schedules and produces diverse training dynamics.

3. **Loss Landscape Analysis**
   - Why needed: To understand the generalization properties of trained models and validate that flatter regions of the loss landscape correspond to better performance.
   - Quick check: Compare the flatness of the loss landscape for models trained with LODE-based schedules versus other methods.

4. **Optimizer-Agnostic Design**
   - Why needed: To ensure the method can be applied to various optimization algorithms without modification.
   - Quick check: Test the LODE model with different optimizers (e.g., SGD, Adam) and verify consistent performance improvements.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Current metrics (loss, val acc, LR) -> Encoder -> Latent vector -> LODE decoder -> Future trajectories -> Schedule selection

Critical path:
Training data generation -> LODE model training -> Real-time training metric encoding -> Trajectory prediction -> Schedule selection -> Model training

Design tradeoffs:
- Computational overhead of training LODE model vs. improved performance
- Complexity of LODE architecture vs. generalizability across tasks
- Real-time trajectory prediction vs. accuracy of schedule selection

Failure signatures:
- Poor trajectory prediction leading to suboptimal schedule selection
- Overfitting of LODE model to training data
- Inability to generalize across architectures or tasks

First experiments:
1. Test LODE model's ability to predict training dynamics on a held-out validation set
2. Compare performance of models trained with LODE-based schedules vs. other methods on a benchmark dataset
3. Evaluate the computational overhead of training and using the LODE model in various scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Uncertain generalizability to tasks and architectures beyond those presented in the paper
- Unverified long-term stability and performance in real-world, dynamic environments
- Need for further empirical validation of computational efficiency and optimizer-agnostic claims

## Confidence

High:
- The method's ability to predict future training dynamics and select learning rate schedules, as demonstrated by the reported accuracy on benchmark datasets

Medium:
- The claim that the approach is computationally efficient and optimizer-agnostic, given that these assertions require further empirical testing across diverse scenarios

Low:
- The generalizability of the method to tasks and architectures beyond those presented in the paper, and its long-term stability in dynamic environments

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on additional datasets and architectures not covered in the current study to evaluate its generalizability.
2. Measure the computational overhead of training and using the LODE model in various practical scenarios to confirm its efficiency.
3. Evaluate the method's performance and stability over extended periods in real-world, dynamic environments to assess its robustness.
