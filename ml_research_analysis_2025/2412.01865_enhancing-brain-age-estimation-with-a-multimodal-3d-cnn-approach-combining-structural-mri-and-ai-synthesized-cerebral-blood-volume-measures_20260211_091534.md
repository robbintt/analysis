# Enhancing Brain Age Estimation with a Multimodal 3D CNN Approach Combining Structural MRI and AI-Synthesized Cerebral Blood Volume Measures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.01865
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01865
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Multimodal fusion of T1w MRI and AICBV maps achieved MAE=3.95 years for cognitively normal controls, outperforming single-modality models

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a multimodal deep learning framework that combines structural T1-weighted MRI with AI-synthesized cerebral blood volume (AICBV) maps for brain age estimation. The approach uses two separate 3D VGG-based networks, one trained on T1w scans and another on AICBV maps, with predictions fused via linear regression. Trained on 2,851 scans from 13 datasets and evaluated on 1,233 ADNI subjects, the combined model achieved the most accurate brain age gap estimation, particularly for cognitively normal controls. The AICBV-based BrainAGE showed strong separation between stable and progressive MCI, suggesting sensitivity to prodromal vascular changes.

## Method Summary
The method employs two parallel 3D VGG8 networks: one processing T1-weighted MRI and another processing AI-synthesized cerebral blood volume (AICBV) maps generated from the same T1w scans using the TABSurfer model. Both networks predict brain age independently, and these predictions are combined through linear regression (optionally including sex as a covariate) to produce the final brain age estimate. The model was trained on 2,851 scans from 13 open-source datasets and evaluated on 1,233 subjects from ADNI.

## Key Results
- Combined multimodal model achieved MAE=3.95 years for cognitively normal controls (R²=0.943)
- Outperformed T1w-only (MAE=4.10) and AICBV-only (MAE=4.49) models
- AICBV-based BrainAGE showed particularly strong separation between stable vs. progressive MCI (p=1.47×10⁻⁸)
- Saliency maps revealed complementary contributions: T1w emphasized white matter/cortical atrophy while AICBV highlighted vascular-rich/periventricular regions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal fusion captures complementary aging signals that neither modality provides alone
- Mechanism: T1w networks learn structural atrophy patterns while AICBV networks capture vascular-rich regions linked to hypoperfusion. Linear regression fusion combines independent predictions.
- Core assumption: AICBV maps contain functionally meaningful vascular information that correlates with biological aging independently of structural changes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Saliency maps revealed complementary modality contributions: T1w emphasized white matter and cortical atrophy, while AICBV highlighted vascular-rich and periventricular regions implicated in hypoperfusion"
  - [Page 13, section 3.2] "The T1w encoder consistently focused its attention on white matter structures...In contrast, the AICBV encoder preferentially highlighted vascular-rich areas, particularly in the periventricular areas"
- Break condition: If AICBV maps contain no independent vascular information beyond what is derivable from T1w intensities, the fusion benefit would collapse to marginal noise reduction

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: AICBV-derived BrainAGE provides earlier sensitivity to prodromal neurodegeneration than structural measures alone
- Mechanism: Vascular changes precede measurable tissue atrophy in neurodegeneration. AICBV captures these functional deficits before they manifest as structural damage.
- Core assumption: The AICBV synthesis model (TABSurfer) trained on GBCA-enhanced ground truth transfers perfusion-relevant features to non-contrast scans in a way that preserves disease-sensitive information
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AICBV-based BrainAGE showed particularly strong separation between stable vs. progressive MCI (p=1.47×10⁻⁸), suggesting sensitivity to prodromal vascular changes that precede overt atrophy"
  - [Page 15, Table 3] AICBV model achieved Cohen's d=0.54 for SMCI vs. PMCI compared to T1w model's d=0.30
- Break condition: If the SMCI/PMCI separation is driven by incidental structural features already captured in T1w, then the apparent vascular sensitivity is spurious

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Late fusion via linear regression outperforms single-modality predictions by letting each network specialize independently
- Mechanism: Separate VGG8 networks optimize modality-specific feature extraction without interference. Linear regression on predictions preserves each modality's learned representations.
- Core assumption: The optimal fusion function is approximately linear; nonlinear interactions between modalities are either absent or negligible for age prediction
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 7, section 2.3] "A linear regression model was implemented in R to combine the predictions from each model"
  - [Page 10, Table 1] Bootstrap tests show TA-model significantly outperforms both T-only and A-only models (p < 2.2×10⁻¹⁶)
- Break condition: If nonlinear interactions between structural and vascular features are critical, linear fusion would leave predictive signal untapped

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Brain Age Gap Estimation (BrainAGE)
  - Why needed here: Core task definition; understanding that BrainAGE = predicted age - chronological age, serving as a biomarker for accelerated biological aging
  - Quick check question: If a 70-year-old has BrainAGE of +8 years, what does this imply about their brain health relative to peers?

- Concept: Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) as functional imaging marker
  - Why needed here: Motivates AICBV synthesis; CBV measures regional metabolism and perfusion, typically requiring contrast agents (GBCA), which this work circumvents via AI synthesis
  - Quick check question: Why would vascular/perfusion changes potentially precede structural atrophy in neurodegeneration?

- Concept: Late vs. Early Fusion in Multimodal Learning
  - Why needed here: Critical architectural choice; this paper uses late fusion (combining predictions), not early fusion (concatenating features before a single model)
  - Quick check question: What is one advantage of late fusion when modalities have different optimal feature extractors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input T1w scan → MNI152 affine registration → 1mm isotropic resampling → 192×192×160 voxels → min-max normalization → T1w VGG8 → age prediction
  - Input T1w scan → AICBV synthesis (TABSurfer) → 96×96×96 patches with stride 6 → overlapping patch aggregation → AICBV VGG8 → age prediction
  - Concatenate predictions [+ sex] → linear regression → final brain age → BrainAGE calculation

- Critical path:
  1. Single T1w scan input
  2. Parallel branches: (A) preprocess → T1w VGG8 → age prediction; (B) preprocess → AICBV synthesis → AICBV VGG8 → age prediction
  3. Concatenate predictions [+ sex] → linear regression → final brain age
  4. BrainAGE = predicted age - chronological age

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Late fusion simplicity vs. potential loss of cross-modal feature interactions
  - Patch-based AICBV synthesis (96³ with stride 6) vs. whole-brain processing; balances GPU memory against boundary artifacts
  - VGG8 depth (relatively shallow) vs. newer architectures; prioritizes training stability on heterogeneous multi-site data
  - Linear regression fusion vs. learned nonlinear fusion (e.g., MLP); may underfit if modalities interact nonlinearly

- Failure signatures:
  - T1w-only MAE significantly worse than literature benchmarks (~4+ years): check normalization pipeline, registration quality, or training data age distribution
  - AICBV predictions uncorrelated with age: AICBV synthesis model may be degraded or not properly loaded
  - Fusion model underperforms best single modality: multicollinearity between T1w and AICBV predictions (check correlation); linear regression coefficients may be unstable
  - Grad-CAM shows diffuse/uninterpretable attention: gradient flow issue in VGG8; check batch norm statistics or try alternative interpretability methods

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replication check: Train T1w-only VGG8 on provided training split, verify MAE ≈ 4.10 on test set; deviation > 0.3 years suggests preprocessing or implementation issue
  2. AICBV synthesis validation: Generate AICBV maps for held-out subjects with available GBCA-derived CBV ground truth (if accessible); compute correlation to confirm synthesis quality
  3. Ablation study: Compare linear fusion vs. (a) simple averaging, (b) MLP fusion head, (c) early feature concatenation; quantify whether linear regression is sufficient or limiting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How well does AICBV validate against ground-truth perfusion imaging (e.g., arterial spin labeling or contrast-enhanced CBV) across diverse populations and scanner protocols?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work will aim to further validate AICBV as a clinically usable and valid proxy for fMRI."
- Why unresolved: The AICBV model was trained on GBCA-derived CBV from limited datasets; its generalizability to scanners/protocols outside training data remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison of AICBV maps against gold-standard perfusion measures across multiple scanner manufacturers, field strengths, and clinical populations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would more sophisticated multimodal fusion approaches (e.g., attention-based feature fusion) outperform the simple linear regression fusion used here?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors used linear regression to combine predictions, but more complex fusion strategies were not explored despite potential for capturing non-linear interactions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare fusion strategies; simple linear combination may not fully exploit complementary information between modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of fusion methods (early fusion, attention mechanisms, transformer-based integration) on the same dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the multimodal BrainAGE approach generalize to other neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease) and non-AD vascular cognitive impairment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper validated only on ADNI (CN/MCI/AD), though training data included FTLD and PPMI datasets; clinical applicability beyond AD spectrum is unstated.
- Why unresolved: Different neurodegenerative diseases have distinct vascular and atrophy patterns; sensitivity to non-AD pathology is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the trained model to well-characterized cohorts with non-AD neurodegeneration.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does longitudinal BrainAGE trajectory using this multimodal approach predict conversion risk compared to single timepoint assessment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrated cross-sectional SMCI vs. PMCI discrimination but did not examine whether BrainAGE rate-of-change improves prognostic accuracy.
- Why unresolved: Single timepoint BrainAGE may not capture disease dynamics; temporal trajectories could provide earlier or more specific conversion signals.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal analysis of BrainAGE change over time in MCI converters vs. non-converters.

## Limitations

- Primary uncertainty about functional validity of AI-synthesized AICBV maps without direct validation against GBCA-based ground truth
- Simple linear regression fusion may miss nonlinear interactions between structural and vascular aging signals
- Interpretability of saliency maps does not prove the model is actually learning biologically relevant vascular aging

## Confidence

- Multimodal fusion performance improvement: **High** - statistically significant improvements in MAE and diagnostic stratification are well-documented
- Complementary vascular-structural aging signals: **Medium** - anatomical saliency patterns support the claim, but functional validation is absent
- AICBV sensitivity to prodromal vascular changes: **Medium** - strong statistical separation between SMCI and PMCI, but causal interpretation requires caution given potential structural leakage
- Linear regression as optimal fusion strategy: **Low-Medium** - reasonable baseline but untested against nonlinear alternatives

## Next Checks

1. Generate AICBV maps for a subset of subjects with available GBCA-derived CBV ground truth and compute quantitative correlation to validate synthesis quality
2. Perform ablation testing comparing linear regression fusion against learned MLP fusion and early feature concatenation to assess potential signal loss
3. Conduct cross-cohort validation using an independent dataset with both T1w and perfusion imaging to verify that AICBV-based BrainAGE generalizes beyond the ADNI test set
