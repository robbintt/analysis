# ARE: Scaling Up Agent Environments and Evaluations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.17158
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17158
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: ARE enables scalable creation of simulated environments and benchmarks, with Gaia2 evaluating 1,120 scenarios across seven agent capabilities in a mobile environment.

## Executive Summary
ARE introduces a modular platform for creating scalable simulated environments and benchmarks to evaluate agent capabilities beyond idealized sequential models. By decoupling environment dynamics from agent behavior through event-based simulation and asynchronous execution, ARE supports realistic interactions with time, uncertainty, and multi-agent collaboration. Gaia2, built in ARE, benchmarks general agent capabilities across 1,120 scenarios in a mobile environment, evaluating search, execution, adaptability, time-awareness, ambiguity handling, and collaboration with other agents. Experiments reveal that no single system dominates across capabilities, with stronger reasoning often coming at the cost of efficiency, highlighting gaps in robustness and multi-agent coordination.

## Method Summary
ARE provides abstractions for event-based simulation, asynchronous execution, and verifiable rewards to support diverse environments beyond idealized sequential models. The platform decouples environment dynamics from agent behavior, enabling realistic interactions with time, uncertainty, and multi-agent collaboration. Gaia2, built in ARE, benchmarks general agent capabilities across 1,120 scenarios in a mobile environment. It evaluates search, execution, adaptability, time-awareness, ambiguity handling, and collaboration with other agents. Unlike static benchmarks, Gaia2 runs asynchronously with dynamic events, requiring agents to adapt in real time. The evaluation uses a ReAct-like scaffold with pre/post-step hooks, temperature=0.5, max 16K tokens/turn, and 200 max steps. Verification compares agent write actions to oracle action DAGs using hard/soft checks and causality/timing validation with Llama 3.3 70B Instruct as judge.

## Key Results
- No single agent system dominates across all capability dimensions in Gaia2
- Stronger reasoning capabilities correlate with slower response times, revealing an inverse scaling law on time-sensitive tasks
- Agent-to-agent collaboration improves weaker models but plateaus for stronger models, suggesting coordination overhead limits benefits
- Gaia2 reveals significant gaps in agent robustness, ambiguity resolution, and multi-agent coordination capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ARE works by providing a modular architecture that separates environment simulation from agent behavior through event-driven systems and asynchronous execution. This decoupling allows agents to interact with dynamic, time-sensitive environments that change continuously, unlike traditional sequential benchmarks. The platform's verifiable reward system ensures objective evaluation through oracle action DAGs and causality/timing validation. ARE's extensibility enables rapid creation of new benchmarks and environments, supporting continuous evaluation of emerging agent capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Event-based simulation**: Needed to model asynchronous, time-sensitive interactions; quick check: verify environment state changes trigger agent observations
- **Verifiable rewards**: Required for objective evaluation; quick check: ensure oracle action DAGs can be matched against agent trajectories
- **Asynchronous execution**: Essential for realistic multi-agent interactions; quick check: confirm agents can receive notifications while processing previous actions
- **Modular architecture**: Enables rapid benchmark creation; quick check: verify new environments can be added without modifying core simulation engine
- **Oracle-based verification**: Provides ground truth for evaluation; quick check: confirm verifier can handle multiple valid solution paths
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Tests collaboration capabilities; quick check: verify agents can communicate and coordinate actions effectively

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Simulation Engine -> Agent Scaffolds -> Verifier -> Benchmark Manager -> Scenario Database

**Critical Path**: Environment events trigger notifications → Agent receives notification → Agent processes observation → Agent generates action → Action executed in environment → State updated → Next event triggered

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Modularity vs. performance: Extensible architecture may introduce overhead
- Verifiability vs. realism: Oracle-based verification may not capture all valid solutions
- Synchronous vs. asynchronous: Asynchronous execution better models real-world but increases complexity
- Single vs. multi-agent: Multi-agent evaluation reveals collaboration gaps but adds coordination overhead

**Failure Signatures**:
- Context overflow: Agent terminated due to token limit exceeded
- Verifier hacking: Agent embeds code in messages to bypass checks
- Timing failures: Agent misses time windows due to slow inference
- API rate limiting: Missed time windows due to external model API constraints

**First Experiments**:
1. Run Gaia2-mini (160 scenarios) with a simple agent to verify basic functionality
2. Test verifier with adversarial scenarios to assess robustness
3. Compare single-agent vs. agent-to-agent performance on collaboration scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: How can agent architectures be designed to dynamically adapt computational expenditure (reasoning depth vs. latency) to satisfy strict temporal constraints in asynchronous environments? Current scaffolds trade efficiency for accuracy uniformly without mechanisms to switch between fast/intuitive and slow/deliberate modes based on real-time task urgency.

**Open Question 2**: How can verification systems be evolved to robustly evaluate agent trajectories in tasks that permit multiple valid solution paths or contain inherent ambiguity? The current verifier's reliance on a single oracle graph restricts benchmarks to deterministic solutions and fails to capture realistic, open-ended user requests.

**Open Question 3**: What architectural paradigms beyond the sequential ReAct loop are required to enable parallel tool execution and continuous state monitoring in asynchronous simulations? Standard LLM generation is inherently sequential and blocking, preventing agents from sensing and acting concurrently or maintaining background monitoring processes.

**Open Question 4**: Under what conditions does hierarchical decomposition (Agent-to-Agent collaboration) yield performance gains that justify the overhead compared to single-agent systems? While Agent2Agent collaboration improves weaker models, it plateaus for stronger models, suggesting benefits may not always outweigh coordination overhead.

## Limitations
- Proprietary model dependencies (Claude, GPT-4o, Llama 3.3 70B) may limit accessibility to all researchers
- Benchmark extensibility claims depend heavily on undocumented implementation details of the simulation engine and verifier
- Scalability to more complex environments (e.g., multi-modal interactions beyond text) is not empirically validated
- Current verifier assumes no equivalent write actions, limiting evaluation of ambiguous or open-ended tasks

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: ARE's modular architecture and Gaia2's benchmark design are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: The claimed benefits of ARE (scalability, realistic interactions) are demonstrated but not independently verified
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of ARE beyond mobile environments and the long-term maintenance of Gaia2

## Next Checks
1. Re-implement ARE's simulation engine using only open-source models to test accessibility and scalability claims
2. Conduct ablation studies on Gaia2's seven capability splits to identify which dimensions most challenge current agent architectures
3. Stress-test ARE's verifier by intentionally introducing adversarial scenarios to assess robustness of the verification mechanism
