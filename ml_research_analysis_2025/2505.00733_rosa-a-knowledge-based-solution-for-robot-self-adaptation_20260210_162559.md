# ROSA: A Knowledge-based Solution for Robot Self-Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.00733
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00733
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: ROSA enables task-and-architecture co-adaptation in robotics using a central knowledge base, successfully handling thruster failures, visibility changes, and battery drops in an underwater robot exemplar.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ROSA (Robot Self-Adaptation), a knowledge-based framework enabling task-and-architecture co-adaptation (TACA) in robotic systems. ROSA uses a central knowledge base to capture application-specific adaptation knowledge and reason about when and how to adapt at runtime. A reference ROS 2 implementation is provided and evaluated on an underwater robotics exemplar, demonstrating feasibility through successful handling of thruster failures, visibility changes, and battery level drops. The framework shows competitive performance with other managing subsystems while offering advantages in reusability and development effort.

## Method Summary
ROSA implements a MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over Knowledge) loop in ROS 2. The framework uses TypeDB for knowledge representation and reasoning, Behavior Trees or PDDL planners for task decision-making, and System Modes for architectural reconfiguration. The knowledge model captures application-specific entities (actions, functions, components) and relationships (constraints, function designs) to enable runtime reasoning about adaptation needs. The system was evaluated on a simulated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) handling three uncertainty scenarios: thruster failure, visibility changes, and battery depletion.

## Key Results
- Successfully demonstrated task-and-architecture co-adaptation in an underwater robotics exemplar
- Framework shows competitive performance with existing managing subsystems
- Knowledge model scales linearly with added actions and adaptations
- Successfully captured knowledge for TACA in other use cases including autonomous ground vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ROSA works by centralizing all adaptation knowledge in a TypeDB knowledge base, enabling the system to reason about both task-level and architecture-level adaptations simultaneously. The MAPE-K loop continuously monitors quality attributes and environmental conditions, analyzes the knowledge base to detect violations of constraints, plans appropriate adaptations using either Behavior Trees or PDDL planners, and executes those adaptations through System Modes reconfiguration. This unified approach ensures that task decisions and architectural changes are coordinated and consistent.

## Foundational Learning
- **TypeDB Knowledge Modeling**: Understanding how to represent robotic entities and relationships in TypeDB using entities (actions, functions, components) and relationships (constraints, function designs) is essential for capturing the adaptation knowledge that drives ROSA's reasoning.
- **MAPE-K Loop Implementation**: The continuous cycle of monitoring, analyzing, planning, and executing over a shared knowledge base is the core mechanism that enables runtime adaptation.
- **ROS 2 Lifecycle and System Modes**: Integration with ROS 2's lifecycle management and the System Modes package is critical for implementing the architectural reconfiguration aspect of TACA.
- **Behavior Trees vs PDDL Integration**: The framework supports multiple task decision methods, requiring understanding of how to interface either Behavior Trees (BT.CPP) or PDDL-based planners (PlanSys2) with the knowledge base for adaptation planning.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Monitor nodes -> ROSA Analyzer -> Knowledge Base (TypeDB) -> Decision Layer (BT or PDDL) -> Execution Layer (System Modes) -> ROS 2 components

**Critical Path**: Monitor publishes diagnostics → Analyzer queries KB → KB inference triggers adaptation → Decision layer plans → Execution layer applies System Modes

**Design Tradeoffs**: ROSA trades increased development effort for knowledge modeling against reduced effort for adaptation logic and improved reusability across applications. The centralized knowledge base approach provides consistency but requires careful modeling upfront.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- TypeDB rule syntax errors prevent constraint inference
- Monitor nodes failing to publish proper diagnostics prevent adaptation triggers
- System Modes server not running blocks architectural reconfiguration
- Incorrect entity mapping in KB prevents proper node state transitions

**First Experiments**:
1. Launch TypeDB server, load SUAVE knowledge model, verify constraint inference works by checking component status propagation
2. Start Gazebo AUV simulation, trigger thruster fault via monitor, observe System Modes reconfiguration
3. Test battery depletion scenario, verify reaction time measurement and mission adaptation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: Can machine learning be integrated to update Quality Attribute and Environmental Attribute estimations and constraints at runtime? The authors state they intend to explore this future integration.
- **Open Question 2**: Can the framework learn the existence of constraints and estimations without prior knowledge of the relationship structure? The authors propose learning that constraints and estimations exist without prior knowledge.
- **Open Question 3**: Can ROSA be extended to support alternative task decision-making methods like state machines or Markov decision processes? The conclusion notes this as an interesting future extension.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single exemplar (SUAVE AUV) with predefined uncertainty scenarios
- Generalizability to other domains based on reusing knowledge model structure rather than demonstrated runtime adaptation
- Performance comparison lacks statistical significance testing and considers only single mission configuration

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in TACA framework implementation feasibility and ability to handle specified uncertainties in SUAVE exemplar
- **Medium confidence** in claimed advantages regarding reusability and development effort (qualitative assessment)
- **Medium confidence** in knowledge model's linear scalability (theoretically derived)

## Next Checks
1. **TypeDB version compatibility test**: Verify knowledge model loads and executes correctly with TypeDB version 2.x, testing constraint inference rules
2. **Monitor implementation validation**: Implement concrete monitor for one uncertainty (e.g., battery voltage conversion) and verify adaptation response
3. **Statistical significance of performance metrics**: Run SUAVE mission with multiple trials across all uncertainty scenarios to establish confidence intervals for reaction time, search time, and distance inspected metrics
