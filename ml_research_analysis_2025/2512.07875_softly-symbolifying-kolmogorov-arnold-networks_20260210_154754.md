- Primary result: S2KAN achieves competitive accuracy with smaller, more interpretable models by integrating symbolic primitives into KAN training via differentiable gating

## Executive Summary
Standard Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) excel at fitting data but often produce uninterpretable decompositions that resist post-hoc symbolification. This paper introduces Softly Symbolified KANs (S2KAN), which directly embed symbolic, sparse basis, and dense functions into the activation dictionary during training. By using differentiable Hard Concrete gates and a Minimum Description Length objective, S2KAN discovers interpretable symbolic forms when possible and gracefully falls back to dense splines otherwise. Experiments on symbolic benchmarks, chaotic systems, and real-world datasets demonstrate that S2KAN can achieve full symbolic representation with significantly smaller models while maintaining or improving accuracy.

## Method Summary
S2KAN modifies KAN architecture by replacing standard activation functions with a dictionary combining symbolic primitives (S), sparse basis functions (F), and dense B-splines (R). Each edge activation φ(x) is computed as a weighted sum of these components, with selection controlled by Hard Concrete gates that are differentiable and trainable. The model is trained end-to-end using a combined loss function that includes both mean squared error and a Minimum Description Length penalty that encourages sparsity. The method employs a warmup phase with no regularization, followed by regularization-enabled training, and finally model extraction by thresholding gate probabilities.

## Key Results
- Achieves full symbolic representation on 8/10 Nguyen benchmark functions with fewer active terms than baseline KANs
- On chaotic dynamical systems (Ikeda map, 3-species ecosystem), S2KAN produces sparse symbolic models with competitive multi-step prediction accuracy
- For concrete strength prediction, S2KAN achieves similar accuracy to standard KANs but with models containing only 5-15% of the symbolic terms
- Observes emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure, where gates naturally converge to sparse configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Differentiable gating enables end-to-end learning of sparse symbolic representations without post-hoc fitting. Binary gates select activation terms via the Hard Concrete distribution—a stretched, rectified Concrete (Gumbel-Softmax) distribution that places probability mass at exactly 0 and 1 while remaining differentiable. Gradients flow through gate parameters αᵢ, allowing the network to jointly learn which symbolic terms to retain and their coefficients. Core assumption: The true underlying function can be decomposed into compositions of the provided symbolic primitives; if not, graceful degradation to dense splines is acceptable. Break condition: If gates fail to converge (remain near p≈0.5), the architecture lacks sufficient symbolic capacity or β is too low; increase regularization or expand dictionary.

### Mechanism 2
MDL-based loss provides a principled accuracy-parsimony tradeoff that induces sparsity proportional to regularization strength β. The objective L = MSE + β·(k log n)/(2n) penalizes expected active terms k. Higher β forces more aggressive pruning. The BIC-style penalty grows with log(n), naturally scaling regularization to dataset size. Core assumption: Parsimonious models generalize better; the symbolic terms in the dictionary meaningfully capture structure in the data. Break condition: If accuracy degrades sharply with minimal β increase, the symbolic library is mismatched to the problem—add domain-appropriate primitives.

### Mechanism 3
Self-sparsification emerges even without explicit regularization (β=0) due to gradient dynamics favoring fewer active terms when multiple representations achieve similar loss. Without regularization pressure, gates explore during warmup (high entropy), then gradually commit as MSE alone drives optimization. When symbolic terms achieve low error, gradient variance favors closing unnecessary gates—a form of implicit regularization through the Hard Concrete parameterization. Core assumption: The optimization landscape has local minima where sparse symbolic solutions exist and are reachable from initialization. Break condition: Self-sparsification may fail with poor initialization (gates stuck open) or when dense splines consistently outperform symbolic terms early in training.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - Why needed here: S2KAN builds on KAN architecture, which replaces fixed activations with learnable univariate functions φ on edges. Understanding that any continuous multivariate function can be decomposed into sums of univariate functions motivates the edge-level activation design.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why KANs use learnable activations on edges rather than fixed activations at nodes?

- Concept: **Gumbel-Softmax / Concrete Distribution**
  - Why needed here: The Hard Concrete gates require understanding how continuous relaxations of discrete variables enable backpropagation through sampling operations.
  - Quick check question: Why does the standard Concrete distribution (Eq. 6) fail to produce exact zeros, and how does the stretch-and-clip operation (Eqs. 7-8) solve this?

- Concept: **Minimum Description Length (MDL) / BIC**
  - Why needed here: The loss function uses MDL to balance fit against model complexity; understanding this tradeoff is essential for tuning β.
  - Quick check question: If you double the dataset size n, how should the regularization strength β change to maintain equivalent sparsity pressure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → [Layer ℓ] → Output; For each edge (i→j): φ(x) = Σ_s z_s·c_s·ψ_s(x) [symbolic] + Σ_f z_f·c_f·ψ_f(x) [Fourier/Chebyshev] + z_r·φ_spline(x;c_r) [dense fallback]; Gates z sampled via Hard Concrete(αᵢ); Loss = MSE + β·(k log n)/(2n)

- Critical path:
  1. Define symbolic library S based on domain knowledge
  2. Initialize gates: α_symbolic ~ N(0,0.1), α_spline = -1 (biased toward symbolic)
  3. Warmup: β=0 for 200 epochs (let gates explore)
  4. Enable regularization: set target β, train until decisiveness > 0.99
  5. Extract final model: threshold gates at p > 0.5

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Larger symbolic library: More expressive but slower training (O(|S|+|F|) per activation evaluation); inference cost depends only on selected terms
  - Higher β: More compression, potentially losing nuance; lower β preserves accuracy but may yield less interpretable models
  - Warmup duration: Too short → premature gate commitment; too long → wasted computation

- Failure signatures:
  - Gates stuck at p≈0.5: Learning rate too high or dictionary missing key primitives
  - All gates close (empty model): β too high for problem complexity
  - Spline dominates (no symbolic terms): Dictionary mismatched or α initialization biased wrong
  - NaN/Inf during training: Symbolic terms (log, 1/x) hitting invalid domains—add protected operators

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate on known function: Train S2KAN on y = sinc(x) = sin(x)/x with S={1/x}. Confirm it discovers the multiplicative decomposition (Fig. 1) while baseline KAN fails post-hoc symbolification.
  2. Ablate β on Nguyen benchmark: Run Table 1 problems with β∈{0.1, 1, 10}. Plot % symbolic terms vs. test R² to characterize the accuracy-parsimony frontier.
  3. Test graceful degradation: Train on data generated from a function outside S (e.g., Bessel function). Verify S2KAN falls back to splines while maintaining competitive accuracy vs. baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does combining S2KAN's explicit symbolic terms with implicit symbolic biases (such as Projective KAN) improve training stability and symbolic fidelity compared to either method in isolation? Basis in paper: The Discussion section states that "Combining explicit symbolic terms with implicit biases toward symbolic fidelity is a promising direction," suggesting that hybrid approaches may offer the benefits of guaranteed symbolic output with greater stability. Why unresolved: S2KAN currently relies on explicit terms which can destabilize training (e.g., divergences), whereas implicit methods like Projective KAN offer a different approach to fidelity not yet integrated into this framework. What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring training stability and symbolic recovery rates between standard S2KAN, Projective KAN, and a hybrid model on benchmarks with pathological functions.

### Open Question 2
Can automated methods be developed to select or construct the activation function dictionary without relying solely on domain knowledge? Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge in the Discussion that "S2KAN offers no particular guidance on how to choose the activation function dictionary," classifying this as a limitation inherent to current symbolic regression techniques. Why unresolved: The method currently requires the user to manually specify candidate functions (symbolic library), risking suboptimal libraries that force the model to fall back to less interpretable dense splines. What evidence would resolve it: The demonstration of an algorithm that dynamically expands or prunes the symbolic library during training, resulting in higher interpretability or accuracy without user-specified engineering.

### Open Question 3
How do non-uniform complexity weights (e.g., based on encoding cost or FLOPs) affect the trade-off between model accuracy and structural simplicity compared to the standard MDL objective used in this study? Basis in paper: Section 3.3.1 notes that while complexity weights can theoretically account for differential encoding or computational costs, "In this work, we do not pursue weighting schemes other than traditional MDL, but it may be beneficial to consider them in the future." Why unresolved: The paper only validates the standard BIC-style approximation; the utility of weighting specific symbolic terms differently (e.g., penalizing a complex exponential more than a linear term) remains untested. What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the standard β k log n objective against complexity-weighted variants (k_w) on tasks where computational efficiency or bit-encoding cost is a constraint.

## Limitations

- The Hard Concrete gate implementation has a potential formula error in the expected value calculation that needs verification against the original Louizos et al. 2018 paper
- The Ikeda map and ecosystem benchmarks reference external papers for methodology details without providing them, creating reproducibility gaps
- Some symbolic functions (1/x, log) require input domain protection that isn't explicitly addressed in the experimental setup

## Confidence

- High confidence: The MDL-based regularization mechanism and its implementation (Eqs. 6-14, Table 1 results showing sparsity-accuracy tradeoff)
- Medium confidence: The differentiable gating approach and Hard Concrete parameterization, pending verification of the expected value formula
- Medium confidence: The claimed emergent self-sparsification without regularization, though mechanism remains heuristic
- Low confidence: Reproducibility of chaotic dynamics benchmarks due to missing methodological details

## Next Checks

1. Gate convergence analysis: Run the Nguyen benchmark with β=0 and monitor gate decisiveness over training. Verify that gates transition from exploratory (p≈0.5) to decisive (p<0.01 or p>0.99) as claimed, and identify training epochs where this transition occurs.

2. Symbolic library sensitivity: For the concrete strength dataset, test S2KAN with expanded symbolic libraries (adding exponential, tanh, piecewise linear terms) and compare % symbolic discovery and accuracy. This validates whether the original library choice was optimal or merely sufficient.

3. Break case validation: Train on a function provably outside the symbolic dictionary (e.g., f(x,y) = exp(x)sin(y) with S lacking exp) and verify that S2KAN gracefully degrades to spline-dominated solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy versus baseline KANs.
