# PAS: A Training-Free Stabilizer for Temporal Encoding in Video LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.10979
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10979
- **Reference count**: 38
- **Primary result**: PAS stabilizes video LLM temporal encoding by smoothing RoPE-induced ripples through multi-head phase aggregation, yielding consistent gains across nine benchmarks with negligible overhead.

## Executive Summary
PAS addresses temporal instability in video LLMs caused by multimodal RoPE's rippled attention modulation, where small timing shifts can suppress key frames. The method aggregates attention heads with opposed phase offsets to smooth the effective temporal kernel while preserving per-head spectrum magnitudes. Under Nyquist-valid sampling, per-head recovered spectra remain invariant to temporal offsets, allowing PAS to change how modulation is sampled and aggregated without altering what each head encodes. The approach acts as a plug-and-play stabilizer requiring no training, showing consistent improvements across nine benchmarks under matched token budgets.

## Method Summary
PAS is a training-free stabilizer that applies per-head temporal phase offsets to the query stream after base positional encoding but before attention computation. It partitions video-token heads into K groups (default K=2) and applies opposed offsets [0, 0.5] bin units to the temporal half-dimensions of queries. This aggregation smooths the effective temporal modulation while preserving per-head spectrum magnitudes. The method operates only on video tokens, leaving text tokens unchanged, and adds negligible computational overhead. PAS preserves Nyquist-valid sampling requirements for its theoretical guarantees but shows practical gains even when violated.

## Key Results
- Consistent accuracy gains across nine benchmarks (20BN-Jester, Something-Something V2, Kinetics-700, Breakfast Actions, MVBench, TempCompass, PerceptionTest, EgoSchema, MMBench-Video)
- Robust performance with default K=2 groups and [0, 0.5] offsets across diverse sampling ratios
- Orthogonal improvements when stacked with other training-free methods like SlowFast-LLaVA
- Negligible computational overhead while preserving per-head spectrum magnitudes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The temporal instability stems from multimodal RoPE inducing a rippled time-domain modulation that amplifies or suppresses attention based on frame timing rather than content. RoPE assigns a finite set of temporal frequency lines whose inverse Fourier transform produces a kernel m(Δt) inherently rippled at the frame scale. Under the phase modulation approximation, the RoPE-rotated attention logit ≈ content dot product × Re{m(Δt)}, where small timing shifts probe different points on this rippled waveform, causing large logit swings. The core assumption is high-dimensional approximation with near-uniform spectral energy across frequency lines and weak content–frequency coupling.

### Mechanism 2
Aggregating attention heads with small, opposed phase offsets smooths the effective temporal modulation, reducing sensitivity to timing perturbations. PAS applies per-head temporal offsets {δ_h} to the query stream, where each head samples the IFT kernel at slightly shifted lags. Multi-phase averaging reduces mean-square local variation V_ε(m_eff) ≤ V_ε(m), with strict reduction when shifts differ. In the frequency domain, the line spectrum is multiplied by |K(ω)| ≤ 1, attenuating high-frequency ripples. The core assumption is that shifts are small and opposed while aggregation weights are nonnegative and sum to 1.

### Mechanism 3
Under Nyquist-valid sampling, per-head recovered spectra are invariant to temporal offsets, so PAS changes how modulation is sampled and aggregated—not what each head encodes. For a Nyquist-band-limited m(Δt), a fractional delay δ produces X_δ[k] = e^{jθ_k(δ)} X[k]; magnitudes |X_δ[k]| = |X[k]| are preserved. Each head's DFT spectrum is unchanged; only phases rotate. The core assumption is that temporal sampling respects Nyquist for the RoPE line set with finite observation length.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)**
  - Why needed here: The entire diagnostic and remedy hinge on understanding how RoPE encodes position via complex-plane rotations applied to query–key pairs along frequency lines
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why RoPE's logit depends on relative position via Re{Σ C_i e^{jω_i Δ}} rather than absolute position?

- **Concept: Inverse Fourier Transform of a discrete spectrum**
  - Why needed here: The paper models the RoPE modulation as the IFT of its frequency lines; understanding how discrete spectra produce rippled time-domain waveforms is essential
  - Quick check question: Why does the IFT of a finite set of spectral lines produce a rippled rather than smooth time-domain signal?

- **Concept: Multi-head attention aggregation**
  - Why needed here: PAS leverages standard head aggregation as a smoothing mechanism by distributing phase offsets across heads
  - Quick check question: How does averaging the outputs of heads with different query-phase offsets act as a moving average over the time-domain modulation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Base M-RoPE positional encoding → PAS phase operator Γ_δ (on Q only) → Attention computation → Standard multi-head aggregation
- **Critical path**: 1) Identify video-token span via masking, 2) Compute Q, K, V with base M-RoPE, 3) Partition query heads into K groups, 4) Apply per-group temporal offsets [0, Δ], 5) Compute attention and aggregate heads normally
- **Design tradeoffs**: K=2 groups with [0, 0.5] offsets provides simple, strong default with plateau from Δ≈0.3–0.8; more groups potentially more smoothing but more hyperparameters; larger Δ gives more smoothing up to aliasing boundary with diminishing returns past Δ≈0.8
- **Failure signatures**: No improvement on dense sampling (r → 1) is expected; negative impact on sub-Nyquist data with large offsets indicates aliasing; text-only tasks affected suggests masking bug
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce Δ-sweep on 20BN-Jester to validate 0.3–0.8 plateau and Δ=0.5 default, 2) Run sampling-ratio ablation to verify gains diminish as sampling densifies matching Theorem 2, 3) Stack PAS on SlowFast-LLaVA and compare against Table 2 to confirm orthogonality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the theoretical guarantees of PAS be extended to handle sub-Nyquist sampling regimes where aliasing currently limits performance gains? The paper notes that on the Breakfast Actions dataset (sub-Nyquist), "aliasing limits the effective benefit" and Theorem 4's spectrum invariance explicitly requires a Nyquist-band-limited assumption. Evidence would require a modification of the phase-shift strategy that accounts for aliased energy, or empirical results showing significant improvements on long-horizon, sparsely sampled benchmarks where Nyquist is violated.

### Open Question 2
How does the "Phase Modulation Approximation" (Theorem 1) degrade when specific visual features couple strongly with specific positional frequencies? The proof relies on Assumption (A3) regarding "Weak content–frequency coupling," which posits that content coefficients are weakly dependent on frequency lines. If high-level semantic features consistently activate specific frequency bands in the RoPE spectrum, the approximation of the logit as a "content dot product scaled by a time kernel" may break down. Evidence would come from synthetic experiments where feature dimensions are forced to correlate with positional frequency bands, followed by analysis of PAS's failure modes.

### Open Question 3
Is the "opposed phase offset" heuristic (e.g., [0, 0.5]) globally optimal, or is there significant performance headroom available by learning these offsets during fine-tuning? While the current method offers a plug-and-play solution, it treats phase offsets as hyperparameters rather than learnable weights. Evidence would come from a comparative study where phase offsets are optimized via backpropagation on a validation set versus the fixed heuristic, measuring the gap in temporal consistency and accuracy.

### Open Question 4
Does the smoothing effect of PAS generalize to relative positional encoding schemes (e.g., relative bias matrices), or is it strictly necessary that the encoding is multiplicative (RoPE)? The mathematical derivation of the IFT kernel relies on the multiplicative complex rotation of RoPE; additive relative biases behave differently in the frequency domain and might not exhibit the same phase instability. Evidence would come from applying the PAS mechanism to a Video LLM utilizing relative positional encodings to see if similar temporal stability gains are observed.

## Limitations

- Dependency on Nyquist-valid sampling for full spectral magnitude invariance, with aliasing limiting gains on sub-Nyquist datasets like Breakfast Actions
- Uncertainty around exact implementation of fractional delay operator Γ_δ and its handling of temporal dimension mapping
- Default K=2 groups and [0, 0.5] offsets appear reasonable but lack systematic justification across diverse sampling regimes
- Practical impact on downstream video understanding tasks beyond classification accuracy isn't fully explored

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mechanism of temporal instability via rippled RoPE modulation is well-supported by both theory and diagnostic experiments
- **Medium Confidence**: Empirical gains across nine benchmarks are consistently positive, but exact conditions for plateauing gains need more systematic validation
- **Medium Confidence**: Orthogonality claim with other training-free methods is demonstrated but could benefit from more systematic ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. **Systematic Nyquist Sweep**: Replicate the Breakfast Actions experiment but systematically vary the sampling ratio r and measure PAS gains to validate theory predictions about gains diminishing as sampling approaches Nyquist

2. **Fractional Delay Implementation Verification**: Implement the phase operator Γ_δ with explicit verification that magnitude invariance holds under Nyquist sampling, testing with synthetic signals where ground truth spectra are known

3. **Multi-Group Ablation Study**: Beyond default K=2, systematically test K=3, K=4 groups with different offset patterns to determine if simplicity of K=2 is truly optimal or just a practical compromise
