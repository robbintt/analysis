# Minimal Convolutional RNNs Accelerate Spatiotemporal Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03614
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03614
- Reference count: 28
- Two novel minimal convolutional RNNs (MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU) achieve up to 5x training speed improvement over ConvLSTM/ConvGRU

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. The approach extends the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized spatial modeling. An exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM architecture is incorporated into the MinConvLSTM to further simplify log-domain computation. The models are evaluated on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world geopotential data.

## Method Summary
The authors extend the minimal RNN approach from log-domain prefix-sum formulations (used in MinLSTM and MinGRU) to convolutional architectures. This enables parallel training by replacing sequential dependencies with prefix-sum operations in log space. The MinConvLSTM variant incorporates an exponential gating mechanism inspired by xLSTM to further simplify computation. Both models maintain convolutional input aggregation for spatial locality while benefiting from the training efficiency of minimal RNN structures.

## Key Results
- Up to 5x training acceleration compared to standard ConvLSTM and ConvGRU
- Lower prediction errors in both Navier-Stokes dynamics and geopotential data forecasting
- Superior performance in closed-loop autoregressive mode compared to baseline models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The parallelizability comes from converting sequential dependencies into prefix-sum operations in log space, which can be computed efficiently using parallel algorithms. The convolutional structure preserves spatial locality and inductive biases essential for spatiotemporal modeling. The exponential gating mechanism simplifies the log-domain computation by replacing complex activation functions with simpler exponential operations, reducing computational overhead while maintaining expressiveness.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Log-domain RNN computation** - Transforms multiplicative operations into additive ones in log space, enabling efficient parallel prefix-sum algorithms
   - Why needed: Enables parallelization of sequential dependencies
   - Quick check: Verify that log-space operations preserve numerical stability

2. **Convolutional inductive biases** - Local connectivity patterns that capture spatial relationships in grid-structured data
   - Why needed: Maintains spatial coherence in spatiotemporal modeling
   - Quick check: Confirm receptive field coverage matches problem requirements

3. **Prefix-sum parallel algorithms** - Parallel computation of cumulative sums across sequences
   - Why needed: Enables O(log n) parallel training instead of O(n) sequential
   - Quick check: Benchmark parallel vs sequential computation times

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input tensor → Convolutional aggregation → Log-domain prefix-sum → Gating mechanism → State update → Output

**Critical path:** The most compute-intensive path is the convolutional aggregation followed by log-domain prefix-sum, as these operations dominate training time. The gating mechanism (especially with exponential formulation) is secondary but critical for accuracy.

**Design tradeoffs:** Minimal structure sacrifices some expressiveness compared to full LSTM/GRU but gains significant training speed. The exponential gating simplifies computation but may limit dynamic range. Convolutional input aggregation adds spatial modeling capability at the cost of increased parameter count.

**Failure signatures:** Performance degradation typically manifests as either numerical instability in log-space computations (visible as NaNs or infinities) or insufficient spatial modeling when receptive fields are too small for the problem domain.

**First experiments:**
1. Verify parallel prefix-sum computation correctness by comparing against sequential implementation
2. Test numerical stability across different input scales in log-domain operations
3. Benchmark training speed vs accuracy tradeoff by varying convolutional kernel sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to only two spatiotemporal datasets (Navier-Stokes and geopotential data), raising questions about generalization to other domains
- Exponential gating mechanism only tested in MinConvLSTM variant, not systematically evaluated across both architectures
- Closed-loop autoregressive performance demonstrated only on the two evaluated datasets

## Confidence
- Training speed improvements (up to 5x): High
- Prediction error reductions: Medium (limited to two datasets)
- Generalizability across spatiotemporal domains: Low
- Exponential gating benefits: Medium (only tested in one variant)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MinConvLSTM/MinConvGRU on diverse spatiotemporal benchmarks including video prediction, weather forecasting from multiple sources, and traffic flow datasets to assess domain generalization
2. Compare exponential gating variants against standard gating across all minimal convolutional architectures (both MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU) to validate the universal benefit claim
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of minimal RNN structure versus convolutional input aggregation to quantify their relative importance in the observed improvements
