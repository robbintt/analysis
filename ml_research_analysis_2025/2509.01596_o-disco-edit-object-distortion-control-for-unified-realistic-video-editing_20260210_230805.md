# O-DisCo-Edit: Object Distortion Control for Unified Realistic Video Editing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.01596
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01596
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Introduces a single object distortion control signal to unify diverse video editing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
O-DisCo-Edit is a unified framework for realistic video editing that leverages a single control signal—object distortion control (O-DisCo)—to manage diverse editing tasks such as object removal, motion transfer, and style transfer. By simplifying training and using adaptive noise injection, it enables multi-granular editing with strong preservation of non-edited regions and identity. The method outperforms specialized models like MiniMax-Remover and VACE across several benchmarks, demonstrating both high editing completeness and video quality.

## Method Summary
O-DisCo-Edit unifies video editing through a single control signal—object distortion control (O-DisCo)—that simplifies training and enables multi-granular editing via adaptive noise injection. The framework includes a "copy-form" preservation module to maintain non-edited regions and an identity preservation module for video consistency. By integrating these components, it achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks like object removal, outpainting, motion transfer, and style transfer, outperforming specialized models on benchmarks such as OmnimatteRF.

## Key Results
- Outperforms MiniMax-Remover on the OmnimatteRF benchmark for object removal.
- Surpasses models like VACE and Senorita on multi-task benchmarks, achieving higher user study scores for editing completeness and video quality.
- Demonstrates strong performance across diverse editing tasks with a unified control framework.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
O-DisCo-Edit's effectiveness stems from its unified approach, using a single control signal to manage multiple editing tasks, which reduces model complexity and training overhead. The adaptive noise injection allows for fine-grained control over editing granularity, while the "copy-form" and identity preservation modules ensure temporal consistency and fidelity of non-edited regions. This integration enables both high-quality edits and robust preservation across varied scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Object distortion control (O-DisCo)**: Central control signal for unified editing; needed for task generalization; quick check: validate on unseen object types.
- **Adaptive noise injection**: Enables multi-granular editing; needed for flexible control; quick check: measure editing granularity across tasks.
- **Copy-form preservation**: Maintains non-edited regions; needed for temporal consistency; quick check: assess preservation over long sequences.
- **Identity preservation**: Ensures video identity consistency; needed for realistic edits; quick check: evaluate under rapid motion/scene changes.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: O-DisCo control -> Adaptive noise injection -> Copy-form preservation -> Identity preservation -> Output
- **Critical path**: Control signal flows through noise injection to preservation modules before generating the final edited video.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Unified control simplifies training but may limit specialization; preservation modules add complexity but improve quality.
- **Failure signatures**: Fragility in unseen object types, temporal inconsistency in long sequences, and identity loss under rapid motion.
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test O-DisCo control on unseen object types.
  2. Evaluate preservation modules over extended video sequences.
  3. Assess identity preservation under rapid viewpoint changes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided.

## Limitations
- Limited validation under challenging real-world conditions (complex lighting, occlusion, dynamic scenes).
- Uncertain scalability of copy-form preservation for long video sequences.
- Unclear impact of identity preservation under rapid motion or significant viewpoint changes.

## Confidence
- **High**: Core claims of unified editing and state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.
- **Medium**: Robustness and generalizability in challenging scenarios.
- **Low**: Long-term preservation of video quality and identity across extended sequences.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate O-DisCo-Edit on long-form videos (>30 seconds) to assess temporal consistency and identity preservation.
2. Test the method on videos with challenging conditions (extreme lighting, heavy occlusion, rapid motion) to measure robustness.
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of each module and clarify their individual impacts on editing quality.
