## Executive Summary
This paper presents an AI-based fighter jet agent using deep reinforcement learning within a Pygame simulation to handle multi-objective tasks including navigation, target engagement, and enemy evasion. The agent employs a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm with a carefully designed reward function balancing efficiency, resource management, and intelligent decision-making. State and action spaces are discretely defined to simplify decision-making and enhance explainability. Results show over 80% task completion rate across 1000 test episodes, with consistent learning progress reflected in average reward and episode length metrics. Explainability is enhanced through factual and counterfactual reward analysis, revealing the agent's decision rationale and validating the optimality of its actions.

## Method Summary
The method employs a DDQN algorithm where the online network selects actions and the target network evaluates them to reduce Q-value overestimation. The agent operates in a custom Pygame simulation with 13-dimensional state vectors including position, velocity, target/enemy distances, and bullet count. A discrete action space of six actions enables navigation and combat decisions. The reward function incorporates 11 components including distance-based shaping, zone indicators, resource penalties, and terminal rewards/penalties. Training uses experience replay with a 500K buffer, epsilon-greedy exploration with linear decay, and periodic target network updates every 5000 steps.

## Key Results
- Agent achieves over 80% task completion rate across 1000 test episodes
- Learning progress shows consistent improvement in average reward and episode length metrics
- Explainability analysis through factual vs. counterfactual reward comparison validates action optimality
- Heatmap visualizations reveal consistent high-reward action patterns guiding agent behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DDQN enables stable multi-objective policy learning by reducing Q-value overestimation.
- Mechanism: The Double Deep Q-Network decouples action selection from value estimation using separate online and target networks. The online network selects actions; the target network evaluates them. This reduces optimistic bias inherent in standard DQN, leading to more stable convergence when balancing competing objectives (navigation, engagement, evasion).
- Core assumption: The simulation dynamics are sufficiently Markovian that state-action pairs map reliably to expected returns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section II.E] "DDQN mitigates this issue by decoupling these tasks, using the target network for Q-value estimation, resulting in more stable and accurate learning."
  - [section II.E] "The neural network architecture for the Q-network consists of three fully connected layers with 256 neurons in each layer."
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for DDQN-specific claims in combat domains; related work uses varied DRL approaches.
- Break condition: If Q-value estimates diverge or exhibit high variance across training runs, the decoupling benefit is compromised—check for stable average reward curves.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The multi-component reward function shapes behavior by penalizing inefficiency and rewarding mission-relevant progress.
- Mechanism: The reward function combines distance-based shaping (penalizing movement away from target), zone-based indicators (rewarding target zone presence), resource penalties (excessive bullet usage), and terminal rewards/penalties (hitting target/enemy, mission failure). This creates dense feedback signals that guide exploration toward viable policies without requiring sparse success-only rewards.
- Core assumption: The reward components are correctly weighted such that local optima align with global mission success.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section II.D] Full reward function with 11 components including distance penalties, zone indicators, and terminal conditions.
  - [section IV.A] "From the heatmap, it can be observed that certain actions consistently yield higher rewards, which guides the agent's preferred choices."
  - [corpus] Neighboring work on MAER-Nav and navigation RL similarly uses shaped rewards for dense feedback in navigation tasks.
- Break condition: If the agent exhibits reward hacking (e.g., oscillating near target without completing), reward component weights require rebalancing.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Factual vs. counterfactual reward comparison provides post-hoc explainability of agent decisions.
- Mechanism: For each state-action pair, the trained agent's Q-network outputs expected rewards for all actions. By comparing the chosen (factual) action's Q-value against alternatives (counterfactuals), practitioners can verify whether the agent selected the highest-expected-reward action. The heatmap visualization aggregates these comparisons across episodes.
- Core assumption: Q-values reliably reflect expected outcomes under the learned policy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the jet's action choices are analyzed by comparing the rewards of the actual chosen action (factual action) with those of alternate actions (counterfactual actions)."
  - [section IV.A] "Diagonal values represent chosen actions (factual), and others display alternative actions (counterfactual)."
  - [corpus] SymbXRL paper explores symbolic explainability for DRL; limited corpus on counterfactual-based XAI specifically.
- Break condition: If Q-values are poorly calibrated (e.g., all actions have similar Q-values), the explainability signal degrades.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Q-Learning and Value Function Approximation
- Why needed here: DDQN extends tabular Q-learning to continuous state spaces via neural network approximation.
- Quick check question: Can you explain why using the same network for action selection and evaluation causes overestimation bias?

### Concept: Reward Shaping for Multi-Objective RL
- Why needed here: The agent must balance navigation efficiency, combat engagement, and resource conservation simultaneously.
- Quick check question: How would adding a penalty for steps taken affect the agent's exploration vs. efficiency tradeoff?

### Concept: Epsilon-Greedy Exploration
- Why needed here: The agent must discover effective strategies before exploiting them; linear epsilon decay schedules the transition.
- Quick check question: What would happen if epsilon decayed too quickly relative to environment complexity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Environment (Pygame simulation) -> State Vector (13 dimensions) -> DDQN Agent (3×256 FC layers, ReLU) -> Action Selection (6 discrete actions) -> Experience Replay Buffer (500K) -> Target Network (updated every 5000 steps)
- Critical path: State extraction -> Q-value computation -> Action execution -> Reward calculation -> Transition storage -> Batch sampling -> Loss computation -> Gradient update -> Periodic target sync
- Design tradeoffs: Discrete action space simplifies learning but limits maneuver granularity; 13-dim state provides situation awareness but may miss tactical nuances; replay buffer size trades memory for sample diversity.
- Failure signatures: (1) Reward curve flat or decreasing—check learning rate or reward scale; (2) Agent consistently destroyed early—enemy avoidance subpolicy underdeveloped; (3) High variance in episode outcomes—insufficient exploration or unstable Q-values.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablate one reward component (e.g., remove bullet penalty) and observe policy shift in action distribution.
  2. Vary epsilon decay fraction (0.5 vs. 0.7 vs. 0.9) and measure convergence speed vs. final success rate.
  3. Reduce network capacity (e.g., 2×128 layers) and compare average reward trajectory and explainability heatmap sharpness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the agent's performance and learned strategy scale in environments featuring multiple interacting agents or adversarial teams?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states future work will focus on extending the simulation to "incorporate... multi-agent interactions."
- Why unresolved: The current study limits the scenario to a single agent and a single enemy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics (success rate, episode length) and stability analysis derived from training in a multi-agent setting.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Which advanced explainability methods provide deeper insight into the agent's decision-making than the current factual vs. counterfactual reward comparison?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion proposes "integrating advanced explainability methods" to improve interpretability.
- Why unresolved: The current XAI approach is limited to heatmap comparisons of immediate rewards for chosen versus alternative actions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP, attention mechanisms) showing greater transparency in long-term strategy explanation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific architectural or training modifications are necessary to adapt the current simulation-based framework for real-world autonomous flight systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion identifies adapting the framework for "real-world autonomous systems" as a future goal.
- Why unresolved: The agent is currently trained and tested exclusively in a customized 2D Pygame simulation with simplified physics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful deployment or Sim-to-Real transfer results on physical hardware or high-fidelity flight simulators.

## Limitations
- Custom Pygame simulation may not capture realistic fighter jet dynamics, including aerodynamic constraints and sensor noise
- Discrete action space (6 actions) simplifies decision-making but may not represent continuous maneuver capabilities
- Reward function weighting determined through trial and error rather than systematic optimization
- Explainability analysis depends on Q-value calibration assumptions that may not hold if the value function is poorly learned

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: DDQN algorithm implementation and basic learning behavior (supported by reward curve evidence and established RL literature)
- **Medium Confidence**: Multi-objective reward function effectiveness (supported by task completion rates but lacks ablation studies)
- **Medium Confidence**: Explainability analysis validity (methodologically sound but Q-value interpretation depends on network quality)
- **Low Confidence**: Real-world transferability (simulation-based results without validation against physical or high-fidelity simulation constraints)

## Next Checks

1. Perform systematic ablation studies on reward function components to quantify each component's contribution to mission success and identify potential reward hacking behaviors
2. Validate the DDQN agent against a more sophisticated physics-based simulation or compare performance against baseline rule-based or non-DRL approaches
3. Test the explainability analysis by introducing deliberate reward hacking scenarios and verifying whether the counterfactual analysis correctly identifies suboptimal decision patterns
