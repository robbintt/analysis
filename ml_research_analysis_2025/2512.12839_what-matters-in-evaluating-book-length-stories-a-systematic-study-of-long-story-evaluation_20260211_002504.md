# What Matters in Evaluating Book-Length Stories? A Systematic Study of Long Story Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.12839
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12839
- **Authors**: Dingyi Yang; Qin Jin
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces LongStoryEval benchmark and NovelCritique model, achieving up to 27.7% Kendall correlation with human ratings for book-length story evaluation.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of evaluating book-length stories (>100K tokens), a task underexplored due to data annotation constraints, inconsistent evaluation criteria, and long context processing difficulties. The authors introduce LongStoryEval, a large-scale benchmark of 600 books with organized reader reviews and metadata, and propose a hierarchical evaluation criteria structure derived from actual reader feedback. They compare three evaluation methods—aggregation-based, incremental-updated, and summary-based—finding that aggregation- and summary-based evaluations perform best. Building on these insights, they propose NovelCritique, an 8B model trained on their dataset that outperforms commercial models like GPT-4o in aligning with human evaluations.

## Method Summary
The study introduces LongStoryEval, a benchmark of 600 books averaging 121K tokens, with organized reader reviews processed into structured critiques by aspect. The authors derive a hierarchical evaluation criteria structure from 1000+ aspects extracted from reviews, organizing them into 8 top-level categories. They compare three evaluation methods (aggregation-based, incremental-updated, and summary-based) using incremental summarization to compress book content. The NovelCritique model is trained via instruction tuning on Llama 3.1-8B using filtered, normalized reviews with summary inputs, achieving superior alignment with human ratings compared to commercial models.

## Key Results
- Summary-based evaluation achieves up to 27.7% Kendall correlation with human ratings, outperforming commercial models
- Aggregation- and summary-based methods outperform incremental-updated approaches for book-length evaluation
- Plot and characters are the most influential objective aspects; emotional impact and enjoyment are critical subjective aspects
- NovelCritique's 8B model outperforms GPT-4o despite smaller size through domain-specific training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Summary-based evaluation balances efficiency and effectiveness for book-length story evaluation.
- Mechanism: Incremental summarization preserves narrative structure while compressing content to fit context windows, then evaluation on structured summaries (plot, character, excerpts) captures key quality signals without processing full text repeatedly.
- Core assumption: Readers' holistic judgments are shaped by memorable plot points, character arcs, and stylistic samples rather than every detail.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "aggregation- and summary-based evaluations perform best, with the former excelling in detail assessment and the latter offering greater efficiency."
  - [section 5.4] "summary-based models... offer two main benefits: (1) Efficiency—they require less time and resources per evaluation. By generating a single high-quality summary, we can reuse it across multiple evaluations."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; related work on long-form generation (StoryBox, Long Story Generation via Knowledge Graph) suggests summary/outline-based approaches are common but not specifically for evaluation.
- Break condition: If summaries fail to preserve critical narrative coherence signals (e.g., non-linear timelines, subtle foreshadowing), evaluation quality degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical evaluation criteria derived from real reader reviews improve alignment with human judgments over predefined criteria.
- Mechanism: Extracting 1000+ aspects from actual reviews and organizing them into 8 top-level categories ensures evaluation dimensions match reader priorities; experiments then identify which aspects (plot, characters) most strongly correlate with overall ratings.
- Core assumption: Reader review content reflects genuine evaluation priorities rather than platform-specific or performative behaviors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By analyzing all user-mentioned aspects, we propose an evaluation criteria structure... identify the most significant aspects among the 8 top-level criteria."
  - [section 5.4] "for objective aspects, plot and characters are the most influential... For subjective aspects, emotional impact, enjoyment & engagement, and expectation fulfillment all play critical roles."
  - [corpus] Limited corpus evidence on criteria derivation; related work on personalized story generation and evaluation exists but not with this systematic reader-driven approach.
- Break condition: If review distributions are skewed by selection bias (moderate ratings underrepresented), derived criteria may misrepresent true reader priorities.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain-specific training with review bias mitigation and rating normalization enables a smaller model (8B) to outperform larger commercial models in alignment.
- Mechanism: Instruction tuning on structured, aspect-organized reviews teaches narrative-specific critique patterns; bias filtering and score normalization address distributional issues in training data; summary-based input makes task tractable for 8B model.
- Core assumption: The gap between commercial model performance and human alignment stems from lack of domain-specific training data and inconsistent evaluation frameworks rather than model capacity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "NovelCritique... outperforms commercial models like GPT-4o in aligning with human evaluations, achieving Kendall correlations of up to 27.7%."
  - [section 5.3] "The primary issue with closed-source LLMs is their inconsistency... NovelCritique demonstrates the highest correlation with human ratings."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific claim; related work on LLM evaluators (Prometheus, generative judges) shows fine-tuning improves evaluation but not specifically for long narratives.
- Break condition: If training reviews contain systematic biases not addressed by filtering/normalization, or if summary quality varies significantly, model alignment degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kendall-Tau correlation for ordinal rating alignment
  - Why needed here: Primary metric for comparing model-generated scores to human ratings; measures rank correlation rather than absolute score differences.
  - Quick check question: Why is Kendall-Tau preferred over Pearson correlation for 1-5 star rating comparisons?

- Concept: Hierarchical evaluation criteria in narrative theory
  - Why needed here: Understanding how plot, character, writing, themes, etc. relate structurally helps interpret why certain aspects dominate overall ratings.
  - Quick check question: Which top-level criteria are "objective" (story properties) vs. "subjective" (reader experience)?

- Concept: Incremental summarization for long-context management
  - Why needed here: Core technique for making book-length content tractable; maintains coherence across chapters while building condensed representation.
  - Quick check question: How does incremental summarization handle non-linear narratives compared to single-pass summarization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data pipeline: Raw Goodreads reviews → LLM-based reformatting/organization → aspect-extraction → hierarchical structuring → bias filtering
  - Summarization module: Incremental chapter processing → cumulative plot summary + character profiles + excerpt selection
  - Evaluation framework: Three parallel approaches (aggregation-based, incremental-updated, summary-based) with shared prompt templates
  - NovelCritique model: Llama 3.1-8B base + LoRA fine-tuning on structured reviews + summary inputs

- Critical path:
  1. Generate incremental summaries using GPT-4o (or cheaper alternative per efficiency analysis)
  2. Apply summary-based evaluation prompt with hierarchical criteria definitions
  3. For NovelCritique: fine-tune on filtered, normalized reviews with summary inputs

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Aggregation vs. Summary-based**: Aggregation captures more detail (~3x cost, Table 8); summary-based enables reuse and early evaluation
  - **Summary quality vs. cost**: GPT-4o-mini summaries show minimal performance drop (Table 7), suggesting cost-efficient path
  - **Criteria definitions**: Help smaller models significantly; less impact on powerful models (Table 6)
  - **Review organization**: Structured aspect-guided format improves training signal vs. raw reviews (Figure 8)

- Failure signatures:
  - **Inconsistency in closed-source LLMs**: High variance even at temperature=0; requires averaging 5 runs (section 5.2)
  - **Incremental-updated method**: Tendency to maintain early impressions, cumulative inconsistency (section 5.4, Appendix D)
  - **Review bias**: Moderate ratings (3-star) underrepresented in written reviews; requires distribution-based filtering (section 4.2)
  - **Generic critiques**: Models focus on strengths, miss nuanced weaknesses; leads to inflated scores for poor stories (Figure 6)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline comparison**: Run summary-based evaluation with GPT-4o vs. GPT-4o-mini on 10-book subset; compare Kendall correlations and cost to validate efficiency claims
  2. **Criteria ablation**: Test evaluation prompts with vs. without detailed definitions on Llama 3.1-8B to confirm improvement magnitude for smaller models
  3. **Incremental summarization validation**: Manually inspect summaries for 3 books with non-linear narratives; verify temporal/POV shifts are preserved per prompt design (Table 12)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Pairwise comparison strategies**: The paper suggests exploring pairwise comparisons as a method to yield more stable results than direct scoring, noting that while comparisons are often more stable, they are computationally more expensive and efficient strategies for implementing them at book-length scale are undefined.

- **Personalized reviewer metadata**: The current work emphasizes general assessment over personalized preferences, but the dataset contains anonymized reviewer information that could be used to explore personalized evaluation, as current models optimize for consensus ratings rather than individual preferences.

- **Optimal trade-off between summary length and detail**: While detailed summaries can improve performance, they require more memory and complex reasoning. The paper suggests future work must find a balance between detail and length, as it's unclear how much detail is strictly necessary for high-quality evaluation versus computational cost.

## Limitations

- **Copyright restrictions**: The full text of 600 copyrighted novels is not released, making it impossible to reproduce the core training pipeline for NovelCritique without purchasing/acquiring ebooks independently.
- **Platform-specific biases**: The dataset from Goodreads may introduce demographic and genre biases, with moderate ratings (3-star) underrepresented in written reviews, requiring ad-hoc filtering that may not generalize.
- **Computational constraints**: While summary-based evaluation is more efficient, the paper doesn't provide clear guidance on how much summary quality can degrade before evaluation performance suffers significantly.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Effectiveness of summary-based evaluation over incremental-updated approaches, impact of review organization on model performance, and general finding that aggregation and summary-based methods outperform incremental approaches.
- **Medium Confidence**: Specific performance gains of NovelCritique over commercial models (27.7% Kendall correlation) are harder to verify independently due to training data access issues; hierarchical criteria structure is well-supported methodologically but universality across different reader populations is uncertain.
- **Low Confidence**: Practical significance of claimed improvements given computational constraints, particularly regarding how much summary quality can degrade before evaluation performance suffers significantly.

## Next Checks

1. **Summary Quality Impact Test**: Systematically vary the quality of generated summaries (using GPT-4o vs. GPT-4o-mini vs. lower-quality models) on a subset of books to quantify the relationship between summary fidelity and evaluation accuracy, directly testing the assumption that summaries preserve critical narrative signals.

2. **Cross-Platform Generalizability**: Apply the evaluation framework to book reviews from a different platform (e.g., Amazon, LibraryThing) to test whether the hierarchical criteria structure and identified significant aspects remain consistent across different reader communities and review ecosystems.

3. **Bias Mitigation Effectiveness**: Conduct an ablation study where review filtering and score normalization steps are systematically removed to quantify their individual contributions to model performance, testing whether the current implementation adequately addresses the identified review biases.
