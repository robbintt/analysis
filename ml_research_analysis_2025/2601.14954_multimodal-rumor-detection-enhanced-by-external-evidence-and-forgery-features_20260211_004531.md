# Multimodal Rumor Detection Enhanced by External Evidence and Forgery Features

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14954
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14954
- Authors: Han Li; Hua Sun
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Achieves 94.9% macro-accuracy on Weibo and 94.1% on Twitter datasets for multimodal rumor detection

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting multimodal rumors in social media by integrating external evidence and forgery features into a unified detection framework. The authors propose a model that combines Fourier-based forgery feature extraction, dual contrastive semantic alignment, and a gated adaptive fusion mechanism to improve detection accuracy. The approach effectively identifies subtle inconsistencies between text and images while detecting image manipulation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on both Weibo and Twitter datasets.

## Method Summary
The proposed model integrates three key components: forgery feature extraction using Fourier transformation to capture frequency-domain tampering traces, dual contrastive learning for semantic alignment between text and images, and a gated modulation module for adaptive feature fusion. The forgery extraction process analyzes image frequency components to detect manipulation artifacts, while the contrastive learning framework aligns text representations with both original images and generated image descriptions. The gated fusion mechanism dynamically adjusts the contribution of different features to minimize redundancy and noise, resulting in more accurate rumor detection.

## Key Results
- Achieves macro-accuracy of 94.9% on Weibo dataset
- Achieves macro-accuracy of 94.1% on Twitter dataset
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multimodal rumor detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's effectiveness stems from its multi-pronged approach to rumor detection. Fourier-based forgery features capture subtle manipulation traces that are invisible to conventional analysis methods. The dual contrastive learning framework ensures semantic consistency between text and image content by aligning representations across multiple modalities. The gated adaptive fusion mechanism prevents feature redundancy and dynamically weights contributions based on their relevance, allowing the model to focus on the most informative signals for rumor detection.

## Foundational Learning
- **Fourier Transform Analysis**: Essential for detecting image manipulation through frequency-domain analysis, revealing tampering artifacts invisible in spatial domain. Quick check: Apply Fourier analysis to both authentic and manipulated images to observe characteristic frequency patterns.
- **Contrastive Learning**: Critical for establishing semantic relationships between multimodal content by maximizing similarity between aligned pairs while minimizing similarity between misaligned pairs. Quick check: Verify semantic alignment quality by measuring representation similarity across text-image pairs.
- **Adaptive Feature Fusion**: Necessary for dynamically weighting and combining multimodal features to reduce redundancy and emphasize discriminative information. Quick check: Monitor fusion weights to ensure meaningful feature contributions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Fourier Feature Extractor -> Contrastive Learning Module -> Gated Fusion Module -> Classification Layer

**Critical Path:**
Forgery features are extracted first, then passed through contrastive learning for semantic alignment, followed by gated fusion, and finally to the classification layer for rumor detection decision.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The model balances computational complexity against detection accuracy. While Fourier analysis and contrastive learning improve detection capabilities, they increase computational overhead. The gated fusion mechanism adds complexity but improves feature utilization efficiency.

**Failure Signatures:**
- High false positives may indicate overfitting to specific forgery patterns
- Poor performance on compressed images suggests sensitivity to Fourier feature extraction
- Inconsistent results across platforms may reveal domain adaptation issues

**First Experiments:**
1. Test Fourier feature extraction sensitivity to image compression levels
2. Evaluate contrastive learning effectiveness with varying text-image semantic distances
3. Assess gated fusion performance under different feature redundancy scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Fourier-based forgery extraction may be sensitive to image compression artifacts and quality variations across platforms
- Model performance requires validation across diverse cultural contexts and platform-specific noise patterns
- Real-world deployment robustness needs testing against evolving multimodal deception tactics

## Confidence

- High confidence in the methodological soundness of the contrastive learning approach and its contribution to semantic alignment
- Medium confidence in the generalization of forgery feature extraction across diverse image types and compression levels
- Medium confidence in the fusion mechanism's ability to consistently outperform simpler alternatives
- Low confidence in real-world deployment scenarios without further validation on dynamic, in-the-wild data

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of Fourier-based forgery features versus semantic alignment components across different rumor categories
2. Test model performance on out-of-domain datasets with varying image qualities, compression levels, and cultural contexts
3. Implement cross-platform evaluation using real-time social media streams to assess robustness against evolving multimodal deception tactics and platform-specific noise patterns
