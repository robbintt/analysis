# AnyECG-Lab: An Exploration Study of Fine-tuning an ECG Foundation Model to Estimate Laboratory Values from Single-Lead ECG Signals

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.22301
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22301
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: ECG signals can be used to estimate certain laboratory values, with AUC ≥ 0.65 for 33 out of 108 indicators

## Executive Summary
This study explores the feasibility of estimating laboratory values from single-lead ECG signals using transfer learning on a pre-trained ECG foundation model (ECGFounder). Researchers fine-tuned the model on the MC-MED emergency department dataset containing over 20 million standardized 10-second ECG segments to predict whether 108 laboratory indicators were abnormal. The approach successfully identified 33 laboratory markers with strong performance (AUC ≥ 0.65), including notably low LDH levels with AUC of 0.851. However, performance was moderate for 59 indicators and limited for 16 indicators, highlighting that while non-invasive laboratory estimation from ECG is feasible, it remains partially reliable for most biomarkers.

## Method Summary
The researchers fine-tuned ECGFounder, a pre-trained ECG foundation model, on the MC-MED emergency department dataset. They processed standardized 10-second single-lead ECG segments, training the model to classify whether 108 different laboratory indicators were abnormal. The dataset consisted of over 20 million ECG segments from emergency department patients. The model's performance was evaluated using AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) for each laboratory indicator, with binary classification tasks distinguishing normal from abnormal values.

## Key Results
- Strong performance (AUC ≥ 0.65) achieved for 33 out of 108 laboratory indicators
- Best prediction accuracy for low LDH levels with AUC of 0.851
- Moderate performance (0.55 ≤ AUC < 0.65) for 59 laboratory indicators
- Limited performance (AUC < 0.55) for 16 laboratory indicators

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying this approach relies on the physiological relationship between cardiac electrical activity and systemic biochemical states. Certain laboratory abnormalities can manifest as specific ECG changes - for example, electrolyte imbalances often produce characteristic waveform alterations. The ECGFounder model, pre-trained on large-scale ECG data, has learned general representations of cardiac electrical patterns that can be adapted to recognize these subtle correlations with laboratory values. Transfer learning allows the model to leverage these pre-existing ECG representations rather than learning from scratch, making it possible to detect complex, non-obvious relationships between ECG patterns and various biochemical markers.

## Foundational Learning
- **ECG signal processing**: Essential for extracting meaningful features from raw cardiac electrical data; quick check: verify signal normalization and noise filtering steps
- **Transfer learning in medical imaging**: Critical for adapting pre-trained models to new tasks; quick check: confirm appropriate fine-tuning strategy and learning rate scheduling
- **AUC metric interpretation**: Necessary for understanding model discrimination capability; quick check: verify ROC curve generation and AUC calculation
- **Single-lead ECG limitations**: Important for understanding information constraints; quick check: compare performance across different ECG leads if available
- **Binary classification threshold selection**: Key for clinical applicability; quick check: examine sensitivity-specificity tradeoff at different thresholds
- **Emergency department population characteristics**: Relevant for understanding potential selection bias; quick check: analyze demographic and clinical distribution of the dataset

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw ECG Signal -> ECGFounder Backbone -> Laboratory Value Classifier -> Binary Output

**Critical Path**: ECG signal preprocessing → Foundation model feature extraction → Laboratory-specific fine-tuning → Binary classification output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The use of single-lead ECG segments prioritizes standardization and scalability but sacrifices potentially valuable information available in multi-lead configurations. Fine-tuning an existing foundation model reduces training time and data requirements compared to training from scratch, but may limit the model's ability to learn entirely new ECG patterns not present in the pre-training data.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on specific laboratory indicators may indicate either absence of ECG manifestations for those biochemical states or insufficient signal-to-noise ratio in the ECG data. Uniform underperformance across multiple markers could suggest issues with data quality, preprocessing, or inappropriate transfer learning configuration.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate model performance on a held-out validation set from the same distribution to establish baseline capability
2. Test model generalization by applying it to ECG data from different clinical settings or time periods
3. Analyze feature importance using attention mechanisms or SHAP values to verify physiologically plausible decision-making

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Majority of laboratory indicators (59/108) showed only moderate performance (AUC 0.55-0.65), limiting clinical reliability
- Emergency department dataset composition may introduce selection bias, reducing generalizability to other clinical settings
- Binary classification approach doesn't capture the magnitude of laboratory value deviations, which may be clinically important
- 10-second single-lead segments may miss relevant cardiac information compared to longer or multi-lead recordings

## Confidence

| Major Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------------|------------------|
| Feasibility of non-invasive laboratory estimation from ECG | Medium |
| ECGFounder's generalisability across diverse laboratory markers | Low |
| Single-lead ECG sufficiency for laboratory estimation | Low |

## Next Checks
1. External validation on independent datasets from different clinical settings (primary care, outpatient clinics, different geographic regions) to assess generalizability
2. Prospective clinical study comparing model predictions with actual laboratory measurements in real-time patient care to evaluate practical utility
3. Investigation of model interpretability using attention mechanisms or feature importance analysis to determine whether predictions are based on physiologically plausible ECG patterns or confounding factors
