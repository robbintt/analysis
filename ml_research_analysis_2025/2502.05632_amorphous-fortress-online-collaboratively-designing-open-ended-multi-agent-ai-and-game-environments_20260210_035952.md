# Amorphous Fortress Online: Collaboratively Designing Open-Ended Multi-Agent AI and Game Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.05632
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05632
- Reference count: 18
- Platform enables collaborative design of multi-agent simulation environments using FSM agents

## Executive Summary
Amorphous Fortress Online is a web-based platform enabling collaborative design of petri-dish-like environments and games using transparent finite-state machine agents. The system combines open-ended simulation environments with community-centric content creation to provide a database of thematically diverse AI environments. During a short study period after release, the system received 174 plays and 33 fortress submissions from six authors, with 34.38% of fortresses being remixed from others.

## Method Summary
The platform uses a JavaScript-ported engine from Python original to implement a finite-state machine simulation loop. Entities have 13 action nodes (10 autonomous, 3 player-controlled) and 5 conditional edge types evaluated in priority order. The system features interactive editors for designing entities with FSM behaviors and fortress layouts, a backpack feature for saving and reusing entity definitions, and a play screen with an X-ray feature for visualizing agent behavior. The platform aims to support future AI research in reinforcement learning, recommendation systems, and generative models using user-submitted data.

## Key Results
- 174 total plays and 33 fortress submissions during short study period
- 143 total entities created by six authors
- 34.38% of fortresses were remixed from others (up to 4 remixes deep)
- System supports open-ended multi-agent simulation with emergent behaviors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Finite-state machine (FSM) agents with simple action nodes and conditional edges can produce emergent multi-agent interactions when composed in shared environments.
- Mechanism: Each entity maintains a current state node; at each simulation tick, the engine evaluates edge conditions in priority order (none < step < within < nextTo < touch) to determine state transitions. Multiple autonomous agents acting independently within a 16×8 grid create interaction cascades (e.g., chase, take, transform chains).
- Core assumption: Emergent behaviors arise from local agent-to-agent interactions without centralized coordination.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "transparent finite-state machine agents that interact with each other"; [Section III-A] Tables I and II define 13 action nodes and 5 conditional edge types with priority ordering.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Entity portability via the backpack feature enables cross-environment remixing, potentially accelerating content diversity and revealing reusable behavioral patterns.
- Mechanism: Users save entity definitions (FSM graphs with character representations) to a personal "backpack" (max 10). When imported into a new fortress, character references not present are randomly remapped, preserving behavioral structure while adapting to local context.
- Core assumption: Users will discover and reuse well-designed entity archetypes (e.g., "chaser," "item," "decoration"), creating de facto behavioral taxonomies.
- Evidence anchors: [Section III-G-1] "Up to 10 entities can be saved to the user's 'backpack' storage"; [Section III-G-1] Describes character remapping logic when target characters are absent.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: User-generated fortress and entity data can serve as training scaffolding for future generative AI systems (entity recommendation, sprite generation).
- Mechanism: The platform logs fortress definitions, entity FSM structures, and usage metadata. Planned systems would apply quality-diversity methods or small generative models to recommend entities and generate sprites based on accumulated data.
- Core assumption: User submissions will reach sufficient volume and diversity to support meaningful model training.
- Evidence anchors: [Section V-B] "Using the quality diversity methodology from previous work on the Amorphous Fortress [15], we will build a recommendation system"; [Section V-C] Plans for sprite generation using "$5 model" architecture with user-submitted text-sprite pairs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Finite State Machines (FSMs) for game AI**
  - Why needed here: All agent behaviors are defined as FSM graphs; understanding nodes (actions) and edges (conditions) is essential for entity design.
  - Quick check question: Given an entity with nodes [idle, move, die] and edges [(idle→move, step 3), (move→die, touch X)], what happens after 3 ticks if the entity touches X?

- Concept: **Emergent behavior in multi-agent systems**
  - Why needed here: The platform's core value proposition is that simple local interactions produce complex global patterns.
  - Quick check question: If two entities both have chase edges targeting each other, what long-term dynamics might emerge?

- Concept: **Grid-based simulation environments**
  - Why needed here: Fortresses are 16×8 grids with positional logic (within, nextTo, touch); spatial reasoning is required for fortress design.
  - Quick check question: In a 14×6 playable grid, what is the maximum Manhattan distance between two entities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Amorphous Fortress Engine (JavaScript) -> Entity Editor -> Fortress Editor -> Play Screen -> Main Page / Database

- Critical path:
  1. Define entities in Entity Editor (assign character, add nodes, connect edges)
  2. Validate FSM logic via Play Screen simulation
  3. Place entities in Fortress Editor grid
  4. Test full fortress in Play Screen with X-ray enabled
  5. Submit to database or save entities to backpack

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **ASCII-only rendering** vs. visual engagement: Abstract representation limits accessibility but simplifies engine; sprite generation planned
  - **Single-use nodes** (no duplicates per entity) vs. expressiveness: Prevents redundancy but constrains expressiveness; permutation nodes are allowed
  - **Fixed 16×8 grid** vs. complexity: Simplifies computation but limits complexity; not configurable per fortress
  - **Browser-based only** vs. offline development: Low barrier to entry but no offline/local development mode

- Failure signatures:
  - **Immediate extinction**: All entities have die nodes with no conditional guards
  - **Inactivity timeout**: No entity has actionable nodes (all idle with no exit edges)
  - **Overpopulation crash**: Clone or add nodes without termination conditions exceed 168 entities
  - **X-ray shows stuck state**: Edge conditions never met; entity loops or stalls on a node

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Create a minimal 2-entity fortress (one chaser, one evader) and observe chase dynamics; verify via X-ray that state transitions match edge definitions.
  2. Import an entity via backpack from an existing fortress into a new fortress with different entity characters; confirm remapping logic.
  3. Construct a fortress with clone nodes and test population growth until overpopulation termination; measure tick count and entity count at termination.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a mixed-initiative fortress evolver system significantly increase user engagement and fortress submission rates compared to the current from-scratch design interface?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "The lack of fortress submissions is one of the most pertinent areas we would like to address for future work. To remedy the intimidation factor of using the system... we will introduce the fortress evolver system."
- Why unresolved: The current system had only 5 non-author fortress submissions, suggesting high barriers to entry, but no intervention has been tested yet.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled study comparing submission rates and user retention between the current interface and a version with AI-generated starting points.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can a quality-diversity-based recommendation system effectively suggest thematically coherent entities that enhance emergent multi-agent interactions in user-designed fortresses?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Using the quality diversity methodology from previous work on the Amorphous Fortress, we will build a recommendation system for the entity editor. This system will suggest thematically relevant entities to the user that also enhance the multi-agent interactions within the fortress."
- Why unresolved: The recommendation system is proposed but not yet implemented or evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies measuring whether recommended entities are accepted and whether fortresses with recommended entities exhibit more diverse emergent behaviors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What factors caused the large gap between fortress plays (174) and fortress creations (33), and can specific interface improvements close this engagement gap?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes "a stark difference of fortress plays vs. fortress creation" and speculates about "a large learning curve to using the system" and "unfamiliarity with the engine," but does not empirically validate these hypotheses.
- Why unresolved: No user research or exit surveys were conducted to identify specific barriers.
- What evidence would resolve it: User surveys, analytics on editor drop-off points, or A/B testing of simplified interfaces.

## Limitations
- Limited user study duration with only 174 plays and 33 fortress submissions from six authors
- Absence of validation data demonstrating meaningful emergent behaviors beyond usage metrics
- Technology stack opacity with unspecified frontend framework and backend architecture choices
- Feature incompleteness with planned systems (sprite generation, recommendation systems) not yet implemented

## Confidence
- High confidence: Platform architecture is technically coherent with clear specifications for FSM mechanics and editor interfaces
- Medium confidence: Claims about open-ended multi-agent environments enabling emergent behavior are supported by related work but not directly validated for this specific FSM architecture
- Low confidence: Claims about future AI research applications are speculative with no validation data and currently insufficient dataset size

## Next Checks
1. **Behavioral emergence validation**: Deploy a controlled study measuring emergent patterns in fortress populations with varying agent densities and FSM complexity. Quantify interaction diversity and persistence using information-theoretic metrics.

2. **Backpack feature effectiveness**: Track cross-fortress entity remixing frequency and analyze whether remixed fortresses show higher engagement or behavioral diversity compared to non-remixed submissions.

3. **Dataset sufficiency assessment**: Model the projected growth of user submissions and entity definitions to determine when the dataset would reach thresholds sufficient for training generative models or recommendation systems.
