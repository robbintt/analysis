# Ultra-short-term solar power forecasting by deep learning and data reconstruction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.17095
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17095
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Ultra-short-term solar power forecasting using deep learning and data reconstruction with improved accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a deep learning approach for ultra-short-term solar power forecasting that combines data decomposition with specialized neural network architectures. The method decomposes PV power generation data using CEEMDAN into high- and low-frequency components, applies different deep learning models (CNN for high-frequency, iTransformer for low-frequency, BiLSTM for meteorological data) to extract features, and fuses them using multi-head attention before final prediction through an EQN network. The approach includes a width constraint in the loss function to penalize overly wide prediction intervals.

## Method Summary
The proposed method integrates data decomposition and reconstruction with deep learning models for solar power forecasting. PV power generation data is first decomposed using CEEMDAN (Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise) into high- and low-frequency components. Different deep learning architectures are then employed: CNN extracts spatial-temporal features from high-frequency components, iTransformer captures long-range dependencies in low-frequency components, and BiLSTM processes meteorological data. These features are fused using a multi-head attention mechanism before being fed into an EQN (Equivariant Neural Network) for final probabilistic prediction. The loss function includes a width constraint to optimize prediction interval accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieves R² of 0.9844 and nMAE of 0.0558 on one dataset
- Demonstrates improved generalization compared to baseline models
- Shows higher prediction accuracy through effective data decomposition and specialized model architecture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the complementary strengths of different deep learning architectures for distinct signal components. CEEMDAN decomposition separates PV power data into high-frequency components (rapid fluctuations) and low-frequency components (gradual changes), allowing specialized models to capture their unique characteristics. CNN excels at extracting spatial-temporal patterns from high-frequency data, iTransformer effectively models long-range temporal dependencies in low-frequency components, and BiLSTM processes sequential meteorological information. The multi-head attention mechanism intelligently fuses these diverse feature representations, while the width-constrained loss function optimizes prediction interval reliability.

## Foundational Learning
- **CEEMDAN decomposition**: Separates complex signals into intrinsic mode functions for better modeling - why needed to handle non-stationary PV power data; quick check verify decomposition preserves signal energy
- **Multi-head attention**: Enables parallel feature fusion across different modalities - why needed to combine CNN, iTransformer, and BiLSTM outputs; quick check compare with single-head attention performance
- **Width constraint in loss function**: Penalizes overly wide prediction intervals for practical utility - why needed to balance accuracy and reliability; quick check sensitivity analysis on constraint weight

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: PV Data -> CEEMDAN Decomposition -> High-Freq (CNN) + Low-Freq (iTransformer) + Meteorology (BiLSTM) -> Multi-head Attention Fusion -> EQN Network -> Prediction

**Critical Path**: The critical computational path is CEEMDAN decomposition followed by parallel feature extraction (CNN, iTransformer, BiLSTM) and multi-head attention fusion before EQN prediction.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational complexity for accuracy by using multiple specialized models versus a single monolithic architecture. The width constraint in the loss function optimizes for practical prediction intervals but may introduce bias in extreme conditions.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when CEEMDAN decomposition fails to properly separate signal components, when meteorological data is missing or noisy, or when the multi-head attention mechanism cannot effectively fuse heterogeneous feature representations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test CEEMDAN decomposition effectiveness on clean versus noisy PV power data
2. Evaluate individual model performance (CNN, iTransformer, BiLSTM) before fusion
3. Compare width-constrained loss function performance against standard loss functions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The CEEMDAN decomposition's effectiveness across diverse PV installations and weather conditions remains unverified
- The multi-head attention fusion mechanism's robustness to missing or noisy data inputs is not explicitly tested
- Generalizability to PV systems with different configurations (panel types, orientations, geographic locations) is not thoroughly explored

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Experimental methodology and dataset selection are clearly described with multiple datasets used for validation
- Reported performance metrics (R² = 0.9844, nMAE = 0.0558) are specific and verifiable

**Medium Confidence**:
- Superiority over baseline models is demonstrated, but baseline model selection and tuning details are not fully provided
- Direct comparison with existing methods is challenging due to incomplete baseline information

**Low Confidence**:
- Cross-installation validation and real-world deployment scenarios are not thoroughly investigated

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Installation Validation: Test the model on PV installations with different technical specifications and geographic locations to assess generalizability
2. Extreme Weather Robustness: Evaluate model performance under extreme weather conditions (storms, heatwaves) to validate the width constraint's effectiveness
3. Computational Efficiency: Measure the computational overhead of the multi-head attention fusion mechanism and its impact on real-time forecasting capabilities
