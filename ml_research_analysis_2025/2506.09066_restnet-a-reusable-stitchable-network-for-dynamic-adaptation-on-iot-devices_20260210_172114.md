# ReStNet: A Reusable & Stitchable Network for Dynamic Adaptation on IoT Devices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.09066
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09066
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces a method for dynamically constructing hybrid models by stitching components from different pre-trained models for IoT devices

## Executive Summary
ReStNet presents a reusable and stitchable network architecture that enables dynamic adaptation of deep learning models across heterogeneous IoT devices with varying computational and memory constraints. The method leverages Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify optimal stitching points between pre-trained models, allowing for the construction of hybrid networks that balance accuracy and efficiency. By fine-tuning only the stitching layer rather than entire models, ReStNet significantly reduces training costs while maintaining competitive performance across diverse benchmark tasks.

## Method Summary
ReStNet operates by decomposing pre-trained models into reusable components and identifying optimal stitching points using CKA similarity metrics. The framework supports both homogeneous stitching (CNN-CNN, Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous stitching (CNN-Transformer) scenarios. When a device requests model adaptation, ReStNet selects appropriate pre-trained components based on the device's computational constraints and available data, then constructs a hybrid model by stitching these components at identified optimal points. Only the stitching layer undergoes fine-tuning during adaptation, enabling rapid deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices while maintaining model accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieves flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime across heterogeneous IoT devices
- Reduces training costs by fine-tuning only stitching layers rather than entire models
- Demonstrates effectiveness across five benchmark datasets with both homogeneous and heterogeneous model combinations
- Maintains competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to training individual models from scratch

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ReStNet works by exploiting the compositional nature of deep learning models, where different components capture different feature hierarchies. The CKA metric provides a principled way to identify semantically similar layers across different architectures, enabling meaningful information transfer during stitching. By focusing fine-tuning effort on the stitching layer, the method preserves the learned representations from pre-trained models while adapting only the critical interface between components. This approach reduces the parameter space that needs optimization, making adaptation feasible on devices with limited computational resources.

## Foundational Learning

**Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)**: A similarity metric for comparing representations between neural network layers. Needed to identify optimal stitching points between different model architectures. Quick check: Verify CKA scores correlate with actual downstream task performance after stitching.

**Dynamic Model Construction**: The process of assembling hybrid models at runtime based on device constraints. Needed to provide flexible adaptation across heterogeneous IoT hardware. Quick check: Measure the overhead of model assembly and its impact on deployment latency.

**Transfer Learning via Fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models to new tasks by updating a subset of parameters. Needed to reduce training costs while maintaining accuracy. Quick check: Compare performance when fine-tuning different fractions of the model.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Pre-trained Models -> CKA Analysis -> Stitching Layer Identification -> Hybrid Model Construction -> Fine-tuning -> Deployed Model

Critical path: CKA similarity computation → stitching point selection → hybrid model assembly → stitching layer fine-tuning → deployment

Design tradeoffs: The method balances between reusing existing knowledge (favoring pre-trained components) and task-specific adaptation (requiring fine-tuning), with the stitching layer serving as the critical interface.

Failure signatures: Poor CKA similarity scores may indicate incompatible architectures; excessive fine-tuning may suggest insufficient pre-training; runtime stitching overhead may indicate unsuitable for extremely resource-constrained devices.

First experiments: 1) Test CKA-based stitching between simple CNN pairs on MNIST, 2) Evaluate heterogeneous CNN-Transformer stitching on CIFAR-10, 3) Measure runtime adaptation latency on embedded devices with varying constraints.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Dependency on high-quality CKA scores for optimal stitching point identification, with limited evaluation under noisy or limited data conditions
- Heterogeneous stitching between CNN and Transformer architectures demonstrated but not thoroughly analyzed for architectural compatibility
- Runtime overhead and latency of dynamic stitching and fine-tuning on constrained IoT devices remains unclear
- Effectiveness may be limited by requirement of pre-trained models for both components, which may not always be available

## Confidence
- High: The core concept of reusable and stitchable network components is technically sound and well-supported by experimental results
- Medium: The CKA-based stitching methodology and its effectiveness across different model pairs
- Medium: The claimed accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and training cost reductions, though dependent on specific benchmark conditions
- Low: Runtime performance and adaptation latency on actual resource-constrained IoT devices

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments measuring the actual runtime overhead and latency of dynamic model stitching and fine-tuning on target IoT hardware
2. Test CKA-based stitching performance under data-limited and noisy conditions to evaluate robustness
3. Evaluate the method's performance across a wider range of heterogeneous device capabilities and task types beyond the five benchmark datasets used
