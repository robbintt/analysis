# NICE: Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model for Orthognathic Surgery Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05920
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05920
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: 0.88±0.08 mm P2PL and 2.65±0.12 mm CD on the entire face for orthognathic surgery prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces NICE (Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model), a novel deep learning approach for accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction in orthognathic surgery. The method employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct facial, maxillary, and mandibular anatomy, and region-specific deformation decoders driven by a shared surgery latent code to model complex biomechanical responses. By capturing nonlinear skeletal-to-soft-tissue interactions while preserving anatomical consistency through localized landmark constraints, NICE demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and clinical relevance.

## Method Summary
NICE uses a two-stage framework: first, a shared encoder extracts surgery-relevant features from preoperative CT images and surgery plans; then, region-specific decoders predict facial geometry before and after surgery. The approach employs implicit SDF representation for smooth surface reconstruction, with separate decoders for facial, maxillary, and mandibular regions to capture localized biomechanical responses. The model predicts 71 facial landmarks with strong correlations to clinical measurements, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both point-to-plane loss (P2PL) and Chamfer distance (CD) metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.88±0.08 mm P2PL and 2.65±0.12 mm CD on the entire face
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.2% in P2PL and 5.6% in CD on the entire face
- Shows significant improvements in critical regions like lips (15.1% improvement) and chin (6.2% improvement)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NICE's effectiveness stems from its ability to model the complex biomechanical interactions between skeletal movements and soft tissue deformation during orthognathic surgery. The region-specific architecture allows for localized modeling of anatomical differences, while the shared surgery latent code ensures consistency across regions. The implicit SDF representation provides smooth, continuous surface reconstruction that captures subtle anatomical variations better than explicit mesh representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Implicit Signed Distance Functions (SDFs)**: Used to represent 3D surfaces as the distance to the nearest surface point. Needed because they provide smooth, continuous surface representation that can capture fine anatomical details. Quick check: Verify the SDF is differentiable and provides smooth gradients for training.
- **Region-specific decoders**: Separate neural networks for facial, maxillary, and mandibular regions. Needed because different craniofacial regions have distinct anatomical structures and biomechanical properties. Quick check: Confirm each region decoder captures unique anatomical features.
- **Shared surgery latent code**: A common embedding that drives deformation predictions across all regions. Needed to ensure anatomical consistency and capture the global impact of surgical interventions. Quick check: Validate that the latent code captures meaningful surgical features.
- **Chamfer Distance and P2PL metrics**: Evaluation metrics for comparing predicted and actual 3D surfaces. Needed to quantify reconstruction accuracy in clinically meaningful ways. Quick check: Ensure metrics align with clinical evaluation standards.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: CT input -> Shared Encoder -> Surgery Latent Code -> Region-specific SDF Decoders (Facial, Maxillary, Mandibular) -> Predicted Postoperative Surface

Critical Path: The shared encoder extracting surgery-relevant features, combined with region-specific decoders that capture localized biomechanical responses, forms the critical path for accurate predictions.

Design Tradeoffs: The region-specific approach improves accuracy but increases model complexity and computational requirements. The implicit SDF representation provides smooth surfaces but requires careful handling of inside/outside surface classification.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance may occur with severe anatomical variations not well-represented in training data, or when surgical plans deviate significantly from learned patterns. The model may also struggle with extreme soft tissue deformations.

First Experiments:
1. Train and evaluate each region-specific decoder independently to quantify their individual contributions
2. Compare implicit SDF representation against explicit mesh-based approaches on the same dataset
3. Test the impact of landmark constraints by training versions with and without landmark regularization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Relatively small sample size of 40 patients used for training and evaluation, potentially limiting generalizability
- Reliance on high-quality CT data which may not be universally available in all clinical settings
- Computational complexity of region-specific decoders may challenge real-time clinical applications

## Confidence

Performance claims (P2PL and CD metrics): High - supported by extensive quantitative evaluation
Clinical utility claims: Medium - based on simulation rather than prospective clinical validation
Generalizability across diverse patient populations: Low - limited by sample size and demographic representation

## Next Checks
1. Prospective clinical validation study comparing NICE predictions with actual postoperative outcomes in a larger, more diverse patient cohort
2. Ablation study isolating the contribution of each architectural component (region-specific decoders, shared latent code) to quantify their individual impact on prediction accuracy
3. Computational efficiency analysis to optimize inference speed for integration into clinical workflow and real-time surgical planning applications
