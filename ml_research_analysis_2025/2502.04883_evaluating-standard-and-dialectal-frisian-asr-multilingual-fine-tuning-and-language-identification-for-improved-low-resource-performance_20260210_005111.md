# Evaluating Standard and Dialectal Frisian ASR: Multilingual Fine-tuning and Language Identification for Improved Low-resource Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.04883
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04883
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Multilingual fine-tuning with Dutch and German data reduces WER from 14.2% to 13.1% for Standard Frisian, while dialectal speech remains challenging at 24.1% WER

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance for Frisian and its regional dialects (Clay Frisian, Wood Frisian, and South Frisian) using self-supervised learning approaches. The authors fine-tune a pre-trained XLS-R 1B model using multilingual data (Frisian, Dutch, German, and English) and implement an auxiliary language identification task to enhance recognition accuracy. The experimental results show that incorporating Dutch and German data into the fine-tuning process reduces the Word Error Rate (WER) from 14.2% to 13.1% on Standard Frisian test data. However, adding English data slightly increases the WER to 13.4%. The language identification tokens provide marginal improvements on Standard Frisian but more substantial benefits on dialectal speech data, reducing WER by approximately 1%. The study also reveals that ASR models perform significantly worse on dialectal speech compared to standard speech, with WERs reaching 24.1% for South Frisian when using multilingual fine-tuning with language identification. These findings highlight the importance of multilingual fine-tuning and language identification for low-resource ASR systems, particularly in languages with substantial dialectal variation.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a multilingual fine-tuning approach using the XLS-R 1B model, a large-scale self-supervised learning architecture pre-trained on multiple languages. The model is fine-tuned on a corpus combining Frisian speech data with Dutch, German, and English datasets. An auxiliary language identification task is integrated by adding special tokens to the model's output layer, allowing it to predict both the speech content and the language being spoken. The fine-tuning process involves training the model on the multilingual corpus with a combined loss function that accounts for both ASR transcription and language identification tasks. The approach is evaluated on four Frisian varieties: Standard Frisian, Clay Frisian, Wood Frisian, and South Frisian, comparing the performance of monolingual fine-tuning against multilingual fine-tuning with and without language identification tokens.

## Key Results
- Multilingual fine-tuning with Dutch and German data reduces WER from 14.2% to 13.1% on Standard Frisian test data
- Adding English data slightly increases WER to 13.4%, suggesting diminishing returns from distant language inclusion
- Language identification tokens provide marginal improvements on Standard Frisian but more substantial benefits on dialectal speech data, reducing WER by approximately 1%
- Dialectal speech remains significantly more challenging, with South Frisian reaching 24.1% WER despite multilingual fine-tuning with language identification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The improvement in ASR performance stems from leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning through multilingual fine-tuning. The XLS-R model, pre-trained on diverse linguistic data, contains transferable acoustic and linguistic representations that benefit from exposure to related languages (Dutch and German). These languages share phonological and lexical similarities with Frisian, enabling the model to better handle acoustic patterns and word forms specific to Frisian. The language identification tokens work by creating distinct output pathways for each language, allowing the model to adapt its predictions based on language context. This is particularly valuable for dialectal speech, where acoustic patterns may overlap between varieties but require different transcription strategies.

## Foundational Learning
**Self-supervised learning**: Why needed - enables training on unlabeled speech data, critical for low-resource languages; Quick check - model must demonstrate strong performance on pre-training benchmarks before fine-tuning
**Multilingual transfer learning**: Why needed - leverages knowledge from related languages to improve performance on target low-resource language; Quick check - performance gains should correlate with linguistic similarity between source and target languages
**Language identification integration**: Why needed - helps model distinguish between standard and dialectal variants, improving transcription accuracy; Quick check - language ID accuracy should correlate with ASR WER improvements
**Dialectal variation modeling**: Why needed - low-resource languages often have substantial dialectal variation that standard models struggle with; Quick check - model should show consistent performance across different dialect samples

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Pre-trained XLS-R 1B -> Multilingual fine-tuning (Frisian + Dutch + German + English) -> Auxiliary language ID task -> Fine-tuned model -> WER evaluation on Standard and dialectal Frisian

**Critical path**: XLS-R 1B pre-training -> Language-specific fine-tuning corpus assembly -> Joint ASR + language ID fine-tuning -> Evaluation on dialectal and standard speech

**Design tradeoffs**: The choice to include multiple languages in fine-tuning creates a tension between leveraging helpful linguistic transfer (Dutch, German) and potentially diluting language-specific representations with less relevant languages (English). The addition of language identification tokens increases model complexity but provides contextual information that proves more valuable for dialectal than standard speech.

**Failure signatures**: Degraded performance on dialectal speech despite multilingual fine-tuning suggests either insufficient dialectal representation in the training data or fundamental acoustic differences that standard fine-tuning cannot bridge. The slight WER increase with English data inclusion indicates that distantly related languages may introduce noise rather than helpful transfer.

**First experiments**:
1. Ablation study: Fine-tune separate models with each language individually to determine which provides the most beneficial transfer
2. Speaker adaptation: Fine-tune the multilingual model with speaker-specific adaptation data to assess whether individual speaker characteristics explain dialectal performance gaps
3. Cross-linguistic analysis: Compare feature representations across languages to identify which acoustic-phonetic patterns transfer successfully versus those that require language-specific modeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The relatively small corpus size (approximately 3,700 hours of multilingual data) may not fully represent the complexity of Frisian dialectal variation
- Evaluation focuses primarily on WER as a metric, without exploring other potential performance indicators such as transcription fluency or semantic preservation
- The experimental setup uses a single pre-trained model (XLS-R 1B), limiting conclusions about the approach's applicability to other self-supervised learning architectures

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The finding that multilingual fine-tuning with Dutch and German data improves Standard Frisian WER (14.2% to 13.1%) is well-supported by the experimental results and aligns with established cross-lingual transfer learning principles.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that language identification tokens provide marginal improvements for Standard Frisian but more substantial benefits for dialectal speech is supported but could benefit from additional statistical validation across more dialect samples.

**Medium confidence**: The observation that dialectal speech (particularly South Frisian at 24.1% WER) performs significantly worse than standard speech is well-documented but requires further investigation into whether this reflects true linguistic distance or data quality issues.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation with alternative self-supervised learning models (e.g., Wav2Vec2, HuBERT) to assess whether the multilingual fine-tuning approach generalizes beyond the XLS-R architecture
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the specific contribution of each language (Dutch, German, English) in the multilingual fine-tuning process, determining optimal language combinations for different Frisian varieties
3. Expand the dialectal speech evaluation to include speaker-level analysis, investigating whether certain speakers or demographic groups show systematically different ASR performance patterns across the four Frisian varieties
