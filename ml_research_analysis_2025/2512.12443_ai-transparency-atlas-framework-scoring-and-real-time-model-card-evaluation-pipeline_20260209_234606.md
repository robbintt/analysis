# AI Transparency Atlas: Framework, Scoring, and Real-Time Model Card Evaluation Pipeline

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12443
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12443
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Weighted transparency framework with 8 sections and 23 subsections, automated LLM-based scoring pipeline evaluates 50 models for under $3 total

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the fragmentation of AI model documentation by analyzing 947 unique section names across 100 Hugging Face model cards and 5 frontier models. The authors develop a weighted transparency framework aligned with EU AI Act Annex IV and Stanford Transparency Index, prioritizing safety-critical disclosures (Safety Evaluation: 25%, Critical Risk: 20%) over technical specifications. An automated multi-agent pipeline extracts and scores documentation from public sources using LLM consensus, revealing that frontier labs achieve ~80% compliance while most providers score below 60%. The framework surfaces critical gaps in safety disclosures, particularly for deception behaviors, hallucinations, and child safety evaluations.

## Method Summary
The methodology combines framework development with automated evaluation. The weighted transparency framework consists of 8 sections and 23 subsections derived from EU AI Act Annex IV and Stanford Transparency Index, with safety-critical categories receiving higher weights (25% for Safety Evaluation, 20% for Critical Risk). The automated pipeline uses Perplexity Search API to retrieve documentation from public sources, then employs three independent LLM agents to evaluate completeness for each subsection using Detailed/Mentioned/Absent criteria. Majority-vote consensus determines final scores, which are aggregated using the predefined weights. The approach enables external auditing without developer cooperation and costs under $3 to evaluate 50 models.

## Key Results
- Extreme naming variation: 97 different labels for "usage information" alone across analyzed documentation
- Cost efficiency: Less than $3 total to evaluate 50 models using automated pipeline
- Performance gap: Frontier labs (xAI, Microsoft, Anthropic) achieve ~80% compliance while most providers score below 60%
- Critical safety gaps: Deception behaviors, hallucinations, and child safety evaluations account for 148, 124, and 116 aggregate points lost respectively across all models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Weighted scoring surfaces safety-critical transparency gaps that unweighted metrics obscure. By assigning 60% of total score weight to three safety-critical categories (Safety Evaluation: 25%, Critical Risk: 20%, Model Data: 15%), the framework penalizes missing safety disclosures more heavily than technical specifications, making governance-relevant deficits visible in aggregate scores. Core assumption: Safety-critical disclosures are more important for oversight than technical details like compute requirements or architecture descriptions.

### Mechanism 2
Multi-agent LLM consensus reduces scoring noise from variable documentation formats. Three independent LLM agents evaluate the same retrieved documentation chunk using standardized criteria (Detailed / Mentioned / Absent), with majority vote determining the final label. This compensates for individual agent errors when parsing inconsistent section naming. Core assumption: LLM agents can reliably distinguish "detailed" from "mentioned only" documentation when given explicit criteria.

### Mechanism 3
Public-source-only extraction enables scalable external auditing without developer cooperation. The pipeline uses Perplexity Search API to retrieve documentation from model cards, system cards, technical reports, blog posts, and GitHub repositories—sources accessible to any external stakeholder—rather than requiring self-reported data from developers. Core assumption: Publicly available documentation is sufficient for meaningful transparency assessment.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **EU AI Act Annex IV Technical Documentation Requirements**
  - Why needed here: The framework explicitly grounds its 8 sections and 23 subsections in these regulatory requirements, making outputs usable for compliance assessment.
  - Quick check question: Can you name three categories of technical documentation that Annex IV requires for high-risk AI systems?

- Concept: **Model Cards vs. System Cards**
  - Why needed here: The paper analyzes both artifact types; understanding their scope differences (model-level vs. deployment-level transparency) is essential for interpreting category presence rates.
  - Quick check question: What information would appear in a system card but not in a model card?

- Concept: **Weighted Scoring Design Principles**
  - Why needed here: The framework's policy relevance depends on weight allocation reflecting governance priorities; understanding tradeoffs helps evaluate whether the 25%/20%/15% split is appropriate.
  - Quick check question: If you weighted all 23 subsections equally, how might provider rankings change?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input -> Query Generation -> Retrieval -> Evaluation -> Consensus -> Aggregation
- Critical path: Query quality -> retrieval relevance -> agent classification accuracy -> consensus reliability
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Public-only sources vs. developer cooperation: Limits scope but enables independent verification
  - Weighted vs. unweighted scoring: Surface safety gaps but risk gaming
  - Three-agent consensus vs. single-agent: Higher cost (~3x) but lower variance
- Failure signatures:
  - High score, low substance: Provider adds verbose but non-specific safety sections; agents classify as "detailed"
  - Inconsistent cross-model comparison: Same section name means different things across providers (97 variations for "usage")
  - Temporal drift: Documentation not updated after model changes; score reflects stale information
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the pipeline on 5 models you know well; manually verify agent classifications against retrieved chunks to establish baseline accuracy.
  2. Compare weighted vs. unweighted scores for the same model set to identify which providers' rankings change most.
  3. Re-run the pipeline on one model after 30 days to test whether documentation changes are captured (version tracking validation).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does automated LLM-based consensus scoring reliably match human expert evaluation of documentation completeness? The paper evaluates documentation using three LLM agents with majority-vote consensus but does not report validation against human auditors or inter-rater reliability metrics. No comparison between LLM consensus scores and human expert assessments is provided, leaving uncertainty about scoring accuracy.

### Open Question 2
Will providers strategically optimize documentation to maximize transparency scores rather than improve genuine disclosure quality? The framework has not been deployed long enough to observe whether gaming behaviors emerge, and the paper only speculates about mitigation. Longitudinal analysis comparing score trends against independent audits of documentation substance would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How do transparency scores evolve across model versions, and can the pipeline detect transparency regressions? The current evaluation provides point-in-time scores only; version-level tracking is planned but not yet implemented or validated. Applying the pipeline to multiple versions of the same model family would enable analysis of score trajectories.

## Limitations
- LLM-based scoring reliability without ground truth validation data
- Unknown exact LLM models and prompts used for agents
- Assumption that public documentation alone provides sufficient transparency assessment
- No specification of numeric mapping for Detailed/Mentioned/Absent labels

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Framework structural design and observed naming variation are empirically verifiable; cost-efficiency claim is directly measurable
- **Medium confidence**: Weighted scoring effectiveness depends on providers not optimizing for weight distribution rather than actual transparency
- **Low confidence**: Multi-agent consensus reliability in distinguishing detailed from mentioned documentation lacks independent validation

## Next Checks
1. **Ground truth validation**: Manually review a sample of 10 models where LLM agents scored "detailed" vs "mentioned" to verify classification accuracy against human judgment.
2. **Weight sensitivity analysis**: Re-run the pipeline with uniform weights across all 23 subsections to quantify how rankings change and assess whether safety-critical categories genuinely drive policy-relevant differences.
3. **Temporal consistency test**: Evaluate the same 5 models weekly for 4 weeks to measure scoring stability and detect whether the pipeline captures documentation updates or suffers from temporal drift.
