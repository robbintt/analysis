# Likelihood-Preserving Embeddings for Statistical Inference

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.22638
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22638
- **Reference count**: 3
- **Primary result**: Introduces Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric Δₙ and proves it is necessary and sufficient for preserving all standard inferential procedures including hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and Bayes factors.

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a rigorous theory of likelihood-preserving embeddings: learned representations that enable likelihood-based statistical inference without raw data. The central contribution is the Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric Δₙ, which quantifies the maximum error in log-likelihood ratios induced by an embedding. The Hinge Theorem establishes that controlling Δₙ is necessary and sufficient for preserving all standard inferential procedures including hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, model selection criteria (AIC/BIC), and Bayes factors.

The work proves an impossibility result showing universal likelihood preservation requires essentially invertible embeddings, motivating model-class-specific guarantees. A constructive framework using neural networks is developed, with explicit bounds connecting training loss to inferential guarantees. Experiments on Gaussian and Cauchy distributions validate sharp phase transitions predicted by exponential family theory, while applications to distributed clinical inference demonstrate practical utility.

## Method Summary
The method trains encoder-decoder neural networks to approximate log-likelihoods. The encoder T_ϕ maps raw data X to m-dimensional embeddings, which are aggregated as sample means S_ϕ. The decoder h_ψ takes parameter θ and embedding z to predict the log-likelihood. Training minimizes pointwise MSE between true and predicted log-likelihoods over a distribution of parameters. The Likelihood-Ratio Distortion Δₙ measures the maximum log-likelihood ratio error across all parameter pairs, with the Hinge Theorem showing Δₙ = o_p(1) preserves all standard inference procedures.

## Key Results
- The Hinge Theorem proves Δₙ control is necessary and sufficient for preserving LRT statistics, MLEs, and Bayes factors
- Sharp phase transitions occur at m=p for exponential families (Gaussian: m=2 preserves inference perfectly)
- Impossibility result shows universal preservation requires near-invertible embeddings
- Distributed clinical inference experiments show m=8 embeddings achieve >95% relative efficiency vs. pooled analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Likelihood-Ratio Distortion as the Hinge Quantity
Controlling Δₙ (maximum log-likelihood ratio error) is necessary and sufficient for preserving all standard inferential procedures. Statistical inference depends on likelihood ratios rather than absolute values. If |(Lₙ(θ)−Lₙ(θ′))−(L̃ₙ(θ)−L̃ₙ(θ′))| ≤ Δₙ uniformly, then LRT statistics converge to the same χ² distribution, MLEs converge to the same optimizer, and posterior ratios are preserved. This cascades through three tiers: (1) ratio distortion control, (2) MLE equivalence and test preservation via ratios, (3) AIC/BIC/posterior preservation requiring absolute likelihood accuracy.

### Mechanism 2: Pointwise Approximation Cascades to Full Inference Hierarchy
Pointwise error εₙ = o_p(1/n) implies ratio distortion control, which cascades to test preservation, MLE equivalence, and (with stronger conditions) AIC/BIC/posterior preservation. By Proposition 2.13, Δₙ ≤ 2nεₙ. If εₙ = o_p(1/n), then Δₙ = o_p(1). This connects the neural training objective to the inferential guarantees through the explicit bound Δₙ ≤ 2nεₙ.

### Mechanism 3: Model-Class-Specific Embeddings Via Neural Sufficient Statistics
Training encoder T_ϕ and decoder h_ψ to minimize pointwise MSE causes the network to approximate sufficient statistics for the training model class F. The training objective forces the embedding to capture all features affecting likelihood ratios. For exponential families, if m ≥ p (parameter dimension), the network converges to a one-to-one function of the canonical sufficient statistic; ancillary information is filtered automatically.

## Foundational Learning

- **Fisher Sufficiency and Factorization Theorem**: The framework generalizes Fisher's sufficiency to ε-sufficiency. Without understanding that T(X) is sufficient iff L(θ) = g(θ, T(X)) + h(X), the notion of "approximate sufficiency" is incoherent.
  - Quick check: Given Lₙ(θ) = θᵀΣᵢT(Xᵢ) − nA(θ) + Σᵢlog h(Xᵢ), what is the sufficient statistic and why?

- **Exponential Families and Pitman-Koopman-Darmois Theorem**: The paper proves sharp phase transitions for exponential families (finite sufficient statistics exist) vs. non-exponential families (Cauchy: smooth decay, never zero). Understanding why only exponential families admit finite-dimensional sufficient statistics is essential for interpreting the dimension bounds.
  - Quick check: Why does Cauchy lack finite-dimensional sufficient statistics, and what does this imply for embedding dimension m?

- **Likelihood Ratio Tests and Wilks' Theorem**: The Hinge Theorem's proof relies on Λₙ = 2(sup Lₙ − Lₙ(θ₀)) converging to χ²_p. If this convergence is unfamiliar, the significance of preserving |Λ̃ₙ − Λₙ| ≤ 4Δₙ is lost.
  - Quick check: Under H₀, what distribution does the LRT statistic converge to, and what condition must Δₙ satisfy to preserve this convergence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: X -> Encoder T_ϕ -> R^m -> S_ϕ (mean) -> Decoder h_ψ -> R -> L̃ₙ(θ)
- **Critical path**: 1) Sample θ ~ Π, 2) Sample batch X₁:n ~ P_θ₀, 3) Compute S = (1/n)ΣᵢT_ϕ(Xᵢ), 4) Compute target = (1/n)Lₙ(θ) and pred = h_ψ(θ, S), 5) Update ϕ, ψ on MSE(pred, target), 6) Validate Δₙ on held-out parameters
- **Design tradeoffs**: m vs. compression (m ≥ p required for exponential families); pointwise vs. ratio objective (pointwise preserves AIC/BIC); local vs. global Π (local yields strong guarantees near θ₀)
- **Failure signatures**: Δₙ not converging to zero (m < p, under-expressive decoder, wrong F); AIC/BIC rankings perturbed (ratio-only objective); power loss vs. pooled analysis (incomplete summary statistics)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Gaussian phase transition: Train encoder on N(μ, σ²) with m ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. Verify εₙ, Δₙ drop to machine precision at m=2. 2) Cauchy smooth decay: Train encoder on Cauchy(θ, 1) using quantile-based embeddings with m ∈ {1, ..., 8}. Verify monotonic decay without reaching zero. 3) Distributed regression pilot: Implement 5-site linear regression trial. Compare summary-based (16 numbers), compressed (m=8), meta-analysis, and pooled. Verify summary = pooled power and m=8 achieves >95% relative efficiency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the optimal decay rates of the Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric (Δₙ) as the embedding dimension (m) increases for non-exponential families?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.4 identifies "Optimal rates" as an open problem, noting the connection to approximation theory is likely but unresolved.
- Why unresolved: The paper proves sharp phase transitions for exponential families but only demonstrates smooth decay empirically for others (e.g., Cauchy).
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical bounds linking the function class complexity of the log-likelihood to the distortion decay rate.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can likelihood-preserving embeddings be updated incrementally in an online or streaming setting without full recomputation?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.4 lists "Online/streaming" updates as an open problem.
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies on aggregating fixed datasets (S_ϕ), making it potentially inefficient for dynamic data environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: A recursive update mechanism for embeddings that maintains the Δₙ = o_p(1) guarantee as n increases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How should the model class F be selected when the true data-generating process is unknown?
- Basis in paper: Section 7.4 lists "Model uncertainty" as an open problem; Section 7.2 notes guarantees degrade under misspecification.
- Why unresolved: The constructive framework assumes the model class is known, leaving the choice of F in ambiguous real-world scenarios undefined.
- What evidence would resolve it: A minimax framework for selecting F that bounds the worst-case distortion across a set of candidate models.

## Limitations
- Universal likelihood preservation requires essentially invertible embeddings (Theorem 3.6), severely limiting practical applicability when F at deployment differs from training F
- Guarantees degrade under model misspecification; the framework assumes the true data-generating process belongs to the training model class F
- Real-world data often exhibits heavier tails, multimodality, or dependence structures that may not fit standard exponential families, limiting the sharp phase transition predictions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The Hinge Theorem's mathematical derivation and the connection between Δₙ control and inference preservation (Tier 1-2 guarantees). The impossibility result (Theorem 3.6) is rigorously proven.
- **Medium confidence**: The exponential family phase transition predictions (Theorem 3.8) based on theoretical sufficient statistic dimension requirements. The constructive neural framework works in controlled experiments but lacks extensive validation on realistic, messy data.
- **Low confidence**: The practical applicability of model-class-specific guarantees when F at deployment differs from training F, and the robustness of Δₙ bounds under model misspecification or non-i.i.d. data structures.

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness to Model Misspecification**: Train embeddings on Gaussian data but evaluate on t-distributed data with varying degrees of freedom. Quantify degradation in Δₙ and subsequent impact on Type I error and power preservation.
2. **High-Dimensional Non-Exponential Family**: Implement the GMM experiment in ℝ¹⁰ with n=1000, but evaluate embedding performance as dimensionality increases beyond p=16. Test whether the monotonic improvement predicted by Pitman-Koopman-Darmois theory holds empirically.
3. **Real Clinical Trial Simulation**: Generate synthetic multi-site trial data with realistic features: site-specific random effects, patient dropout, measurement error, and censoring. Compare summary-statistics inference, m=8 compressed inference, and pooled analysis for power and Type I error control.
