# BlurDM: A Blur Diffusion Model for Image Deblurring

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03979
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03979
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces a diffusion model that jointly denoises and deblurs images via dual noise and blur diffusion

## Executive Summary
BlurDM is a diffusion-based approach for image deblurring that explicitly models the physics of blur formation. Unlike standard diffusion models, it introduces a dual noise and blur diffusion process that simulates the accumulation of motion blur during continuous exposure in the forward pass, and jointly denoises and deblurs during the reverse pass. Implemented in latent space, BlurDM acts as a prior generation network whose learned priors are fused into existing deblurring backbones, enabling consistent and significant performance improvements across multiple state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
BlurDM models dynamic scene image deblurring by explicitly simulating blur formation physics through a dual noise and blur diffusion process. In the forward pass, both noise and blur are progressively added to a sharp image to mimic the accumulation of motion blur during continuous exposure. The reverse pass then jointly denoises and deblurs, starting from pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred input. To integrate with existing deblurring networks and improve efficiency, BlurDM is implemented in latent space as a prior generation network. The learned priors are fused into the latent features of the deblurring backbone, enabling seamless integration and performance gains without requiring architectural changes to the base deblurring method.

## Key Results
- Average PSNR gains of 0.53 dB across benchmark datasets
- SSIM improvement of 0.004 and LPIPS reduction of 0.0028
- Consistent performance improvements across four state-of-the-art deblurring methods
- Demonstrated effectiveness on four benchmark datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BlurDM's dual noise and blur diffusion process explicitly models the physics of blur formation, capturing the progressive accumulation of motion blur during exposure. By jointly denoising and deblurring in the reverse pass, the model can recover sharp images from pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred input. The latent space implementation and fusion with existing deblurring backbones enable efficient integration and leverage the strengths of both diffusion priors and established deblurring architectures.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Models**: Why needed - to model complex, high-dimensional image distributions; Quick check - review the forward and reverse diffusion processes
- **Dual Noise and Blur Diffusion**: Why needed - to explicitly simulate blur formation physics; Quick check - verify the progressive addition of noise and blur in the forward pass
- **Latent Space Implementation**: Why needed - for efficiency and seamless integration with existing deblurring backbones; Quick check - confirm the fusion of learned priors into latent features
- **Image Deblurring**: Why needed - to restore sharp images from blurry inputs; Quick check - review common deblurring architectures and metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS)

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Sharp image -> Dual noise and blur diffusion -> Latent space representation -> Prior generation network -> Fusion with deblurring backbone -> Deblurred image
- **Critical Path**: Forward pass (noise and blur addition) -> Latent space representation -> Prior generation -> Fusion with deblurring features -> Reverse pass (joint denoising and deblurring)
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Explicit physics modeling vs. computational complexity; Latent space efficiency vs. potential information loss; Integration with existing backbones vs. architectural constraints
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on complex or mixed blur types; Sensitivity to hyperparameter choices; Limited generalization beyond benchmark datasets
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test BlurDM on a simple synthetic blur dataset to verify basic functionality
  2. Evaluate performance on a standard deblurring benchmark to compare with existing methods
  3. Conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of the latent space implementation and prior fusion

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains rely heavily on synthetic benchmark datasets, which may not fully capture real-world blur variability
- Computational overhead of the diffusion-based prior module is not thoroughly discussed
- Limited qualitative assessments of perceptual quality and user studies
- Unclear generalization to architectures beyond those tested and to real-world scenarios with complex, mixed blur types

## Confidence
- High: Technical soundness of the dual noise and blur diffusion process and latent space implementation
- Medium: Reported performance improvements based on quantitative metrics and benchmark datasets
- Low: Claims about computational efficiency and scalability due to insufficient empirical evidence

## Next Checks
1. Test BlurDM on real-world blurry images and videos with complex, mixed blur types to assess robustness and generalization
2. Conduct a comprehensive ablation study to quantify the computational overhead and latency introduced by the diffusion-based prior module in practical applications
3. Evaluate perceptual quality using user studies or alternative metrics (e.g., NIQE, perception-distortion tradeoff) to complement the quantitative results
