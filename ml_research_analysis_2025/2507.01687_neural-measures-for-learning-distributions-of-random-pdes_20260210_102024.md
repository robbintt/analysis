# Neural Measures for learning distributions of Random PDEs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.01687
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01687
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces Neural Measures framework integrating PINNs with generative modeling for uncertainty quantification in random PDEs

## Executive Summary
This work introduces Neural Measures, a novel framework that integrates Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) with uncertainty quantification (UQ) for random partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach combines Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with generative modeling techniques to represent and control uncertainty in forward problems while maintaining predictive accuracy. The framework is validated through numerical experiments on three representative problems: a bistable ODE, a diffusion PDE, and a reaction-diffusion PDE.

## Method Summary
The Neural Measures framework constructs discrete neural measure spaces parameterized by neural network functions and reference probability measures. Three distinct architectures are proposed: fully network-based, Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)-NN, and Galerkin-NN. These spaces are shown to be expressive enough to approximate appropriate subspaces of probability measures on infinite-dimensional spaces. The method minimizes Wasserstein distance between physics-residual measures, reducing to expectations of norm differences for tractable training. The approach separates stochastic and deterministic components via basis expansions to reduce learning complexity while maintaining approximation guarantees.

## Key Results
- Neural Measure spaces can approximate any probability measure in relevant function spaces under universal approximation theorems
- Generative PINN models accurately capture both mean and higher-order statistical properties of solutions
- Wasserstein distance between physics-residual measures simplifies to expectations of norm differences for tractable training
- PCE-NN and Galerkin-NN architectures reduce learning complexity through basis decomposition while maintaining approximation guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Neural networks parameterize pushforward measures that approximate solution distributions of random PDEs.
- **Mechanism:** A neural network g_θ maps (x,t;ξ) → output. Composing with reference measure γ on ξ induces a pushforward measure [X_θ]#γ ∈ P(H). This transforms the problem from "solve one PDE" to "learn a distribution over solution functions" where the neural measure space V*_N is constructed by collecting all such pushforwards.
- **Core assumption:** The true solution U ∈ L²(γ; H), ensuring finite second moments and measurability.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 3] "V*_N = {[X_θ]#γ ∈ P²_γ(H) : where X_θ(ξ) = g_θ(·;ξ) for some g_θ ∈ V_N]"

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Wasserstein distance between physics-residual measures reduces to expectation of norm differences, enabling tractable training.
- **Mechanism:** The variational problem minimizes d(A⊙μ_θ, ν_F) + d(B⊙μ_θ, ν_g). When using Wasserstein distance and when one measure is atomic (δ_f), W^p(μ, δ_f)^p = E_{X∼μ}[∥X - f∥^p_H]. For residual operators Ã, B̃, this becomes L² norms over the reference measure γ.
- **Core assumption:** Operators A_ξ, B_ξ preserve L²-integrability: A_Q ∈ L²(γ; H̃) for Q ∈ L²(γ; H).
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.1] Derives W^p(μ, δ_g)^p = ∫∥x - g∥^p_H μ(dx) and shows simplification to ∥AU - AX_θ∥²_{L²(γ;H̃)}

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Separating stochastic and deterministic components via basis expansions reduces learning complexity while maintaining approximation guarantees.
- **Mechanism:** Three architectures decompose differently: (1) Fully NN learns joint (x,t;ξ)→u mapping; (2) PCE-NN expands in stochastic basis {φ_n(ξ)} with neural coefficient functions g^(n)_θ(x,t); (3) Galerkin-NN expands in spatial basis {ψ_n(x,t)} with neural coefficient functions g^(n)_θ(ξ).
- **Core assumption:** Existence of countable orthonormal bases for L²(γ) and H (separability conditions).
- **Evidence anchors:** [Appendix A, Theorem A.4] Proves universal approximation for PCE-NN under separability assumptions

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pushforward (pushforward) measure**
  - **Why needed here:** Core construction for neural measures—transforms a known reference distribution through a neural network to generate the target solution distribution.
  - **Quick check question:** Given random variable ξ ∼ γ and function f, can you explain why [f]#γ(A) = γ(f^{-1}(A))?

- **Concept: Wasserstein distance**
  - **Why needed here:** Provides both the theoretical framework (metric on P^p(H)) and practical computational advantage (simplifies to expectations against Dirac measures).
  - **Quick check question:** For two measures μ, ν on R, can you sketch why W^2(μ, ν) involves finding optimal coupling plans?

- **Concept: Bochner space L²(γ; H)**
  - **Why needed here:** Formalizes the space of random variables taking values in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space H; framework assumes solutions live here.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does ∫_Ξ ∥U(ξ)∥²_H γ(dξ) < ∞ ensure the solution has finite second moments?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Sample ξ from γ → Forward pass through X_θ → Compute PDE residuals at collocation points → Evaluate expectation over γ → Backpropagate → Update θ via L-BFGS optimizer

- **Critical path:** Sample ξ batch → forward pass through X_θ → compute residuals at collocation points → evaluate expectation over γ → backprop → optimizer step. Resampling of (x,t) and ξ at different intervals is essential for generalization.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Fully NN: Most flexible, no basis assumptions, but highest dimensionality
  - PCE-NN: Lower-dimensional if stochastic basis well-chosen, requires polynomial chaos knowledge
  - Galerkin-NN: Leverages finite element expertise, basis-dependent
  - Snake activation (sinusoidal-based) improved convergence over tanh in experiments

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Training/testing loss divergence indicates overfitting
  - Sharply peaked distributions (Dirac-like) cause Wasserstein sensitivity; residuals may not fully collapse
  - Boundary errors at initial times observed in reaction-diffusion

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Linear diffusion PDE with uniform parameter distributions a,k ∼ U(1,3). Start here—analytical solution available for validation; tests both PINN and PINN-PCE architectures.
  2. Bistable ODE with u_0 ∼ U(0,4), r ∼ U(0.8,1.2). Tests multi-modal distribution capture; watch for concentration into Dirac peaks increasing Wasserstein distance over time.
  3. Reaction-diffusion PDE with four random parameters in forcing/reaction terms. Higher complexity; tests nonlinear operator handling and boundary behavior.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does adaptive resampling of training points effectively eliminate the boundary errors observed in reaction-diffusion problems within this framework?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 5.3 notes that absolute errors are larger at domain boundaries for initial times and states, "This flaw can probably be fixed by using adaptive selection of the training points."
  - **Why unresolved:** The authors propose adaptive selection as a likely solution but do not implement or validate the strategy in the current experiments.

- **Open Question 2:** Can the PCE-NN architecture be modified to consistently outperform the fully network-based approach, given its current underperformance?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 5.2 reports that the PINN-PCE model yields consistently higher training and testing errors than the plain PINN model, persisting even when the polynomial degree is increased.
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper presents this as an unexpected observation without providing a theoretical explanation or architectural fix for the PCE variant's lower accuracy.

- **Open Question 3:** How can the Neural Measure framework be extended to utilize Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) subspaces for problems requiring non-conforming spaces?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 3.3 states that while possible using the DG framework, considering spaces that are not subspaces of $H$ is "more involved and is beyond the scope of this work."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current formulation is restricted to standard Galerkin subspaces, limiting the method's applicability to PDEs best solved with discontinuous basis functions.

## Limitations
- Assumes separable Hilbert spaces requiring countable orthonormal bases, limiting applicability to non-separable function spaces
- Boundary behavior remains problematic with early-time errors observed in the reaction-diffusion example
- Performance on truly high-dimensional random inputs (beyond the 1-4 parameter cases tested) remains unproven

## Confidence
- High: Mathematical framework construction and universal approximation theorems
- Medium: Empirical validation scope across three relatively simple problems
- Low-Medium: Computational expense and scalability for high-dimensional problems

## Next Checks
1. Test on a problem with known non-Gaussian solution distribution to validate higher-order moment capture
2. Conduct ablation study comparing snake vs. standard activations across all three architectures
3. Perform scaling experiment with increasing parameter dimension (5-10 random inputs) to assess computational tractability limits
