# Suppressing VLM Hallucinations with Spectral Representation Filtering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12220
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12220
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SRF reduces hallucination rates on VLMs by filtering structured biases in feature covariance without retraining

## Executive Summary
Vision-language models often hallucinate objects, attributes, or relations absent from images due to over-reliance on language priors and imprecise cross-modal grounding. Spectral Representation Filtering (SRF) introduces a lightweight, training-free approach to suppress these hallucinations by analyzing and correcting the covariance structure of model representations. SRF identifies low-rank hallucination modes through eigendecomposition of the covariance of differences between features collected for truthful and hallucinatory captions, revealing structured biases in the feature space. A soft spectral filter then attenuates these modes in the feed-forward projection weights of deeper vLLM layers, equalizing feature variance while preserving semantic fidelity. Across three families of VLMs (LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, and mPLUG-Owl2), SRF consistently reduces hallucination rates on MSCOCO, POPE-VQA, and other visual tasks benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading caption quality.

## Method Summary
SRF is a training-free method that suppresses hallucinations in VLMs by identifying and filtering structured biases in the feature space. The method computes the covariance of difference vectors between truthful and hallucinatory activations across deep layers, performs eigendecomposition to isolate low-rank hallucination modes, and applies a soft spectral filter to the feed-forward projection weights. This filter attenuates the identified hallucination directions while preserving semantic content, reducing hallucination rates without requiring model retraining or adding inference overhead.

## Key Results
- SRF consistently reduces hallucination rates across VLMs (LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, mPLUG-Owl2) on MSCOCO, POPE-VQA, and other visual benchmarks
- Achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading caption quality or semantic fidelity
- Demonstrates effectiveness through CHAIR and POPE metrics showing reduced hallucination while maintaining reasoning capability
- Introduces a training-free approach that operates by analyzing and correcting covariance structure of model representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Hallucinations in VLMs manifest as low-rank, structured subspaces in the feature covariance rather than random noise.
- **Mechanism:** By computing the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix of difference vectors (hallucinated vs. truthful activations), dominant "hallucination modes" (high-variance eigenvectors) are isolated. These modes capture the systematic bias toward language priors.
- **Core assumption:** The geometric difference between truthful and hallucinatory activations is consistent and low-dimensional across the dataset.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "SRF identifies low-rank hallucination modes... revealing structured biases in the feature space."
  - [section 3.2] References Figure 3 showing "highly anisotropic spectra with a few dominant eigenvalues," rejecting the null hypothesis of isotropic noise.
  - [corpus] Related work *EigenTrack* supports spectral geometry analysis for detecting hallucinations, though it focuses on detection rather than suppression.
- **Break condition:** If hallucinations were stochastic (random), the eigenvalue spectrum would be flat, and this method would fail to find suppressible directions.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Modifying the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) output projection weights in deeper layers suppresses hallucinations without retraining.
- **Mechanism:** The method constructs a soft suppression operator $P_\alpha$ and applies it to the FFN output weights ($W_{out}$) of deeper layers. This re-weights the transformation from hidden states to output representations, dampening directions aligned with hallucination modes.
- **Core assumption:** The semantic abstraction and grounding errors occur primarily in the deeper LLM layers (16–32), making them the optimal intervention point.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.4] "We apply the suppression operator to the feed-forward weights in selected layers... corresponding in our experiments to the deeper layers."
  - [section 4.7] Ablation study confirms that early-layer interventions have limited impact compared to deeper layers ($\ell \in [16,32]$).
  - [corpus] N/A (No direct corpus evidence for layer specificity in this specific context).
- **Break condition:** If hallucinations originated primarily in the early visual encoder or input embedding layers, modifying deep LLM weights would fail to correct the cross-modal grounding error.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Soft spectral damping preserves semantic fidelity better than hard projection (removal).
- **Mechanism:** Instead of zeroing out top-k eigenvectors (hard projection), SRF uses a damping function $f(\lambda) = \frac{1}{1+\alpha\lambda}$ to scale eigenvalues. This contracts high-variance hallucination directions while retaining some signal, preventing the loss of valid semantic information.
- **Core assumption:** Hallucination modes are not pure noise; they share directions with valid semantic content, requiring attenuation rather than excision.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...preserving semantic fidelity."
  - [section 3.3] "Hard projection can cause loss of semantic information, while our soft suppression keeps all directions but reduces problematic ones gradually."
  - [corpus] *Nullu* (cited in paper) is identified as a hard projection baseline which this method improves upon.
- **Break condition:** If the hallucination subspace were perfectly orthogonal to semantic content, hard projection would be superior; soft damping would unnecessarily retain hallucinatory signal.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Covariance Eigendecomposition**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the mathematical engine of SRF. You must understand how eigenvalues represent variance "energy" and how eigenvectors define the axes of that variance to grasp how "hallucination modes" are isolated.
  - **Quick check question:** If a covariance matrix has one very large eigenvalue and many small ones, what does that imply about the dimensionality of the data's primary variance?

- **Concept: Feed-Forward Networks (FFN) in Transformers**
  - **Why needed here:** The method specifically patches the $W_{out}$ projection in the FFN blocks. Understanding where the FFN sits relative to self-attention is crucial for knowing *where* the weight modification happens.
  - **Quick check question:** In a standard Transformer layer, does the FFN process the output of the self-attention mechanism, or does it run in parallel?

- **Concept: Spectral Filtering (Signal Processing)**
  - **Why needed here:** The method borrows from signal processing to "filter" weights. Understanding how a transfer function (like the damping function) modifies a frequency spectrum helps in understanding how the suppression operator $P_\alpha$ modifies the feature space.
  - **Quick check question:** Does a high damping factor $\alpha$ increase or decrease the magnitude of the filtered signal (eigenvalue)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** LURE benchmark (paired truthful/hallucinated captions) -> Feature Extractor (hooks into VLM layers 16-32) -> Covariance Analyzer (computes difference vectors and $\Sigma_H$) -> Spectral Filter (computes $P_\alpha$) -> Patching Module (updates $W_{out}$ weights)

- **Critical path:** The estimation of the hallucination covariance $\Sigma_H$ is the most critical step. If the dataset used to compute $\Sigma_H$ does not accurately represent the model's failure modes, the identified eigenvectors will not align with actual hallucination directions.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Alpha ($\alpha$) Selection:** High $\alpha$ (e.g., 70) aggressively suppresses hallucinations (CHAIR benchmark) but may over-dampen features needed for reasoning; lower $\alpha$ (e.g., 6) is safer for reasoning tasks (A-OKVQA)
  - **Layer Selection:** Ablation shows layers 16-32 are optimal. restricting to layers 8-16 drops performance significantly
  - **Soft vs. Hard:** Soft damping preserves fluency but leaves residual hallucination trace; hard projection (Nullu) removes it but damages semantics

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Over-damping:** The model generates vague or empty captions ("An image of...") → Lower $\alpha$
  - **No Effect:** Hallucination rates unchanged → Check if the correct layers are being patched or if the calibration dataset is too small/noisy
  - **Semantic Drift:** Correct objects described with wrong attributes → The "hallucination mode" overlaps with attribute semantics; consider reducing the rank of suppression

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Spectrum Visualization:** Extract features from a held-out set, compute $\Sigma_H$, and plot the eigenvalue spectrum. Verify it follows a power law (spiked) rather than being flat
  2. **Parameter Sensitivity Sweep:** Run POPE benchmark with $\alpha \in \{1, 10, 50, 100\}$ on a single model (e.g., LLaVA-1.5) to find the "knee" of the performance curve before semantic degradation
  3. **Layer Ablation:** Apply SRF only to layers 0-8, then 8-16, then 16-32. Verify that the intervention is only effective in the deeper layers as claimed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What specific semantic priors or linguistic constructs are encoded in the dominant hallucination eigenmodes identified by SRF?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper observes that the hallucination spectrum is highly anisotropic and hypothesizes that dominant modes "likely correspond to semantic priors or overgeneralized object templates," but does not decode the specific linguistic content of these vectors.
- **Why unresolved:** The analysis focuses on the spectral structure (eigenvalue magnitude) rather than the semantic interpretation of the eigenvectors themselves.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying interpretability techniques, such as the logit lens or linear probing, to the top eigenvectors to map them to specific tokens, objects, or syntactic structures in the vocabulary.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent do spectral corrections derived from general-purpose datasets like LURE generalize to specialized domains with distinct error distributions?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The method relies on collecting features from the LURE dataset (based on MSCOCO) to compute the hallucination covariance $\Sigma_H$, but it is unclear if these "hallucination modes" capture domain-specific biases found in medical or satellite imagery.
- **Why unresolved:** Experiments are limited to general visual reasoning benchmarks (MSCOCO, POPE) and do not test cross-domain transfer of the computed filter.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluating the SRF filter (calibrated on MSCOCO/LURE) on specialized benchmarks (e.g., medical VQA) to see if "object hallucination" modes correlate with domain-specific hallucinations.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does suppressing object-hallucination modes inadvertently degrade the model's ability to perform complex relational reasoning or negate valid linguistic priors?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper defines hallucinations broadly (objects, attributes, relations) but evaluates primarily on object existence (CHAIR, POPE); meanwhile, the method attenuates directions associated with "language priors" which are also necessary for fluent reasoning.
- **Why unresolved:** While A-OKVQA results suggest retained reasoning capability, the specific impact on relational and attribute accuracy is not isolated or quantified.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation on relation-focused hallucination benchmarks (e.g., HallusionBench) to verify that spectral filtering does not increase false negative rates for existing objects or valid attributes.

## Limitations

- **Dataset dependence and generalization:** SRF relies on the LURE benchmark to compute the hallucination covariance matrix. If the hallucination patterns in LURE do not generalize to other domains (e.g., medical imaging, industrial defect detection), the identified eigenvectors may not suppress real-world hallucinations.

- **Alpha hyperparameter sensitivity:** The paper uses α = 70 for hallucination-heavy tasks (CHAIR) and α = 6 for reasoning tasks (POPE/A-OKVQA). However, the justification for these specific values is heuristic (based on η = 0.1 target sparsity). No systematic sensitivity analysis or automatic tuning procedure is provided.

- **Computational and storage overhead:** Although inference is claimed to be "zero overhead," the method requires extracting and storing hidden states from 17 layers (16-32) for paired captions during a calibration phase. For large-scale models or streaming applications, this could be prohibitive without further optimization.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The core mathematical mechanism (covariance eigendecomposition to isolate low-rank hallucination modes) is sound and well-supported by the eigenvalue spectrum analysis in Figure 3. The soft spectral filtering approach is a novel and plausible method for suppressing structured biases.

- **Medium confidence:** The empirical results show consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks and VLM families. However, the lack of a systematic ablation for α selection and the reliance on a single hallucination dataset (LURE) reduce confidence in robustness and generalization.

- **Low confidence:** The claim of "zero inference overhead" is technically true but potentially misleading, as the calibration phase is computationally heavy. The paper does not address how often recalibration is needed if the model or data distribution shifts.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset hallucination covariance transfer:** Compute $\Sigma_H$ on LURE, then apply SRF to a VLM evaluated on a completely different dataset (e.g., Flickr30k or real-world medical images). Measure whether hallucination suppression transfers or degrades, indicating dataset dependence.

2. **Dynamic α selection via held-out calibration:** Instead of fixing α per task, implement an automatic α selection procedure: run SRF with α ∈ [1, 100] on a small held-out validation set, choose α that maximizes POPE F1 while keeping CHAIR_S < 5%. Report whether this adaptive approach matches or exceeds the fixed-α results.

3. **Ablation of layer range and FFN component:** Systematically vary the layer range (e.g., [0-8], [8-16], [16-32], [24-32]) and FFN component (up_proj vs down_proj) in a single VLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5). Quantify how performance degrades outside the claimed optimal range, and verify that down_proj in layers 16-32 is uniquely effective.
