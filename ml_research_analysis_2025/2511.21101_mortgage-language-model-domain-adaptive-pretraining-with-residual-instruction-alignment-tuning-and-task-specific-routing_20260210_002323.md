# Mortgage Language Model: Domain-Adaptive Pretraining with Residual Instruction, Alignment Tuning, and Task-Specific Routing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21101
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21101
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Domain-adaptive mortgage LLM achieving 4.58 LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score vs 3.99 baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of applying large language models to specialized mortgage finance domains while preserving instruction-following capabilities. The authors propose a dual-track specialization framework combining continued pretraining with instruction residual technique and task-specific supervised fine-tuning, plus an intelligent routing mechanism. The approach involves creating two specialist models - one for conversational Q&A using instruction residuals and another for structured tasks using supervised fine-tuning, with a routing system to direct queries appropriately. Evaluation on domain-specific benchmarks shows significant improvements over baselines across multiple metrics including LLM-as-a-judge scores and BERTScore.

## Method Summary
The proposed Mortgage Language Model (MLM) employs a dual-track specialization approach. First, domain-adaptive pretraining on 150,000 mortgage-specific documents enhances domain knowledge. Second, instruction residual technique is applied during continued pretraining, where mortgage domain instructions are added to standard tasks, allowing the model to maintain instruction-following capabilities while specializing. A separate task-specific model undergoes supervised fine-tuning on mortgage domain tasks. An intelligent routing mechanism analyzes incoming queries and directs them to either the instruction-tuned model for conversational tasks or the task-specific model for structured operations. The routing decision is based on query characteristics such as conversational cues or structured data patterns.

## Key Results
- MLM v2 achieves 4.58 LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score vs 3.99 baseline
- Q&A performance improves to 4.09 score vs 4.0 baseline
- Classification task shows marked improvement from 1.2 to 2.6 score
- BERTScore improvements demonstrate enhanced semantic alignment: 0.77 vs 0.74 for summarization, 0.68 vs 0.58 for Q&A, and 0.75 vs 0.73 for classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-track approach works by preserving complementary capabilities through parallel specialization rather than forcing a single model to excel at all tasks. Instruction residuals maintain the model's ability to follow natural language instructions by keeping conversational patterns alive during domain adaptation. Task-specific supervised fine-tuning creates a specialist for structured operations that require precision. The routing mechanism ensures each query reaches the most appropriate model, avoiding the performance degradation that occurs when generalist models handle specialized tasks. This architecture prevents the common pitfall of domain adaptation destroying instruction-following abilities while also avoiding the brittleness of purely task-specific models.

## Foundational Learning
- **Domain-Adaptive Pretraining**: Continued training on mortgage-specific documents to build specialized knowledge; needed because base LLMs lack domain expertise; quick check: measure domain-specific perplexity on mortgage corpus
- **Instruction Residual Technique**: Adding domain-specific instructions during pretraining to preserve instruction-following; needed to prevent catastrophic forgetting of conversational abilities; quick check: evaluate instruction-following on mixed domain-general/domain-specific prompts
- **Task-Specific Supervised Fine-Tuning**: Specialized training on mortgage task datasets; needed for high-precision structured operations; quick check: measure task performance on held-out mortgage domain test sets
- **Intelligent Query Routing**: Classification mechanism to direct queries to appropriate model; needed to leverage specialization benefits; quick check: verify routing accuracy on query type classification benchmark
- **LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation**: Using language models to score output quality; needed for scalable, consistent evaluation; quick check: correlate LLM-as-a-judge scores with human evaluations
- **BERTScore Metric**: Automated semantic similarity measurement; needed for objective quality assessment; quick check: validate BERTScore improvements align with qualitative improvements

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Mortgage Domain Corpus -> Domain-Adaptive Pretraining -> Instruction Residual Model; Mortgage Task Dataset -> Supervised Fine-Tuning -> Task-Specific Model; Query Router -> (Instruction Residual Model OR Task-Specific Model) -> Output

**Critical Path:** Query → Router Analysis → Model Selection → Specialized Processing → Response

**Design Tradeoffs:** Dual-track specialization vs unified model (performance vs complexity), instruction residuals vs pure domain adaptation (capability preservation vs domain depth), LLM-as-a-judge vs human evaluation (scalability vs reliability)

**Failure Signatures:** Routing misclassification leading to poor responses, instruction residual dilution causing loss of conversational ability, task-specific overfitting reducing generalization

**First Experiments:** 1) Test router accuracy on mixed query types, 2) Compare instruction-following performance with and without residuals, 3) Measure domain knowledge gap between adapted and base models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on LLM-as-a-judge metrics without external validation raises bias concerns
- Small evaluation dataset (46 summarization samples, 22 classification cases, 18 Q&A instances) limits statistical significance
- Lack of ablation studies makes it difficult to isolate individual component contributions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Domain-specific knowledge improvements (clear quantitative improvements in domain-specific benchmarks)
- **Medium confidence**: Overall performance gains (limited by evaluation methodology concerns)
- **Low confidence**: Instruction-following preservation claims (reliance on LLM-as-a-judge without external validation)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct external human evaluation on a larger, diverse mortgage finance dataset to validate LLM-as-a-judge scores and assess real-world performance
2. Perform ablation studies comparing performance with and without instruction residuals, task-specific routing, and domain-adaptive pretraining to quantify individual component contributions
3. Test model robustness against adversarial prompts and out-of-distribution queries beyond the reported security resistance tests to evaluate generalization limits
