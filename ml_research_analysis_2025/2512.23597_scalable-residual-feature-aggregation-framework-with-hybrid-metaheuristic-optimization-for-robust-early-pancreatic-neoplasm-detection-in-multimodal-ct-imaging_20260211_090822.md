core_contribution: This study addresses the challenge of early pancreatic neoplasm
  detection in CT imaging, where subtle lesions with minimal contrast margins are
  difficult to identify due to high anatomical variation. The proposed Scalable Residual
  Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework integrates advanced preprocessing, MAGRes-UNet
  segmentation, DenseNet-121 with Residual Feature Stores, hybrid HHO-BA feature selection,
  and a ViT-EfficientNet-B3 hybrid classifier optimized by SSA-GWO.

# Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation Framework with Hybrid Metaheuristic Optimization for Robust Early Pancreatic Neoplasm Detection in Multimodal CT Imaging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23597
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23597
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: SRFA framework achieves 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score, and 94.83% specificity for early pancreatic neoplasm detection in multimodal CT imaging.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a novel SRFA framework integrating advanced preprocessing, MAGRes-UNet segmentation, DenseNet-121 with Residual Feature Stores, hybrid HHO-BA feature selection, and ViT-EfficientNet-B3 hybrid classifier optimized by SSA-GWO. The approach addresses the challenge of detecting subtle pancreatic lesions with minimal contrast margins in CT imaging. Experimental results on multimodal CT data demonstrate significant performance gains over traditional CNNs and transformer-based baselines, offering a clinically reliable tool for early pancreatic cancer detection.

## Method Summary
The SRFA framework processes multimodal CT scans through a pipeline beginning with CLAHE-based preprocessing, followed by MAGRes-UNet segmentation for pancreatic region isolation. DenseNet-121 with Residual Feature Stores extracts hierarchical features, which are then refined through hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection. A ViT-EfficientNet-B3 fusion classifier with SSA-GWO hyperparameter optimization produces the final classification. The implementation is available at github.com/jananipc/pancreatic-neoplasm-detector, using the Kaggle pancreatic CT dataset.

## Key Results
- 96.23% accuracy on multimodal CT dataset for pancreatic neoplasm detection
- 95.58% F1-score demonstrating balanced precision and recall
- 94.83% specificity with 93.33% sensitivity for tumor identification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Residual Feature Stores
DenseNet-121's dense connectivity is extended with RFS that caches intermediate features at multiple depths, enabling fusion of low-level textures and high-level semantics. This preserves gradient flow and fine-grained spatial details that would degrade in deep networks.

### Mechanism 2: Hybrid HHO-BA Feature Selection
The combination of Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) for global search and Bat Algorithm (BA) for local refinement selects compact feature subsets that maximize class separability while reducing dimensionality.

### Mechanism 3: ViT-EfficientNet-B3 Fusion with SSA-GWO Optimization
The fusion classifier combines global attention mechanisms from ViT with local convolutional features from EfficientNet-B3, optimized through a dual-stage SSA-GWO hyperparameter search for improved generalization across CT imaging settings.

## Foundational Learning

- **DenseNet Architecture & Dense Connectivity**
  - Why needed here: Core to understanding how RFS extends DenseNet-121's feature propagation
  - Quick check question: Explain how dense connectivity differs from residual skip connections in terms of feature reuse

- **Attention Gating in U-Net**
  - Why needed here: MAGRes-UNet uses multi-attention gates to suppress irrelevant background while highlighting pancreatic structures
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of attention gates in encoder-decoder segmentation networks?

- **Metaheuristic Optimization Fundamentals**
  - Why needed here: Understanding HHO, BA, SSA, GWO is necessary to debug convergence and tune population size, iterations, and objective functions
  - Quick check question: Describe the difference between exploration and exploitation phases in swarm intelligence algorithms

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input CT → Preprocessing (CLAHE → Gaussian → Median → Normalize)
  → MAGRes-UNet Segmentation (attention-gated, residual blocks)
  → DenseNet-121 + RFS Feature Extraction
  → HHO-BA Feature Selection
  → ViT + EfficientNet-B3 Fusion Classifier (SSA-GWO optimized)
  → Prediction (neoplasm / normal)

- **Critical path:** Preprocessing quality directly affects segmentation accuracy; segmentation errors propagate through feature extraction. Feature selection determines classifier input dimensionality—overly aggressive selection discards discriminative features; insufficient selection increases computational burden and overfitting risk.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - RFS memory vs. feature richness: More stored features improve fusion but increase GPU memory
  - HHO-BA search iterations vs. training time: More iterations may improve subset quality but delay pipeline completion
  - ViT patch size vs. lesion resolution: Larger patches reduce computational cost but may miss small lesions

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Segmentation under-segmenting pancreas borders → CLAHE clipLimit may be too low; adjust contrast enhancement
  - Feature selection returns empty or single-feature subset → Objective function may be poorly scaled; verify fitness criteria
  - Classifier overfits training data (high training accuracy, low validation) → SSA-GWO may have converged prematurely; increase population diversity or early-stopping patience

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation on preprocessing: Train pipeline with/without CLAHE and median filtering on held-out test set; measure segmentation Dice coefficient and final classification accuracy
  2. Feature selection sensitivity: Vary HHO-BA population size (10, 20, 50) and iterations (50, 100); log selected feature counts and classifier F1-score to identify saturation point
  3. Classifier fusion weighting: Grid-search fusion coefficients between ViT and EfficientNet-B3 outputs; compare against SSA-GWO-optimized weights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of the SRFA framework change when extended from 2D slices to 3D volumetric segmentation and multi-phase dynamic CT imaging? The current study validates the model primarily on 2D axial slices, which may lack the full spatial context required for complex 3D anatomical structures.

### Open Question 2
Does the integration of radiomics and clinical metadata with deep learning features significantly improve prediction reliability over the current visual-only approach? The current framework relies exclusively on image-based features, potentially ignoring non-visual clinical risk factors.

### Open Question 3
How robust is the proposed hybrid metaheuristic optimization against overfitting when applied to highly heterogeneous, multi-center external datasets? While the model claims high accuracy on the utilized dataset, generalization across centers and protocols remains a persistent challenge in the field.

## Limitations

- Limited cross-site validation on multi-institutional CT datasets to assess generalizability
- No comparison with traditional filter or wrapper feature selection methods under varying sample sizes
- Absence of confidence intervals or cross-validation results to quantify result stability

## Confidence

- DenseNet-121 + RFS feature aggregation: High
- HHO-BA hybrid feature selection: Medium
- ViT-EfficientNet-B3 fusion with SSA-GWO optimization: Medium
- Clinical applicability to early-stage detection: Low

## Next Checks

1. Conduct 5-fold cross-validation on the multimodal CT dataset and report mean ± std for all metrics
2. Test SRFA performance on an external, multi-vendor CT dataset to assess domain adaptation
3. Perform ablation studies removing RFS, HHO-BA, and SSA-GWO components individually to quantify their marginal contributions
