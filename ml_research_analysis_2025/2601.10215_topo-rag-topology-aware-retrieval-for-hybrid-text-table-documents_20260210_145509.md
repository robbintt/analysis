# Topo-RAG: Topology-aware retrieval for hybrid text-table documents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.10215
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10215
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** 18.4% nDCG@10 improvement on hybrid queries over linearization baselines

## Executive Summary
Topo-RAG introduces a dual-path retrieval framework for hybrid text-table documents, using dense embeddings for narrative text and cell-aware late interaction for tabular data. Evaluated on a synthetic SEC-25 corpus, it achieves 18.4% higher nDCG@10 than standard linearization approaches on hybrid queries, with lower hallucination rates in table lookups. The method leverages specialized indexing and pruning to balance accuracy, latency, and storage.

## Method Summary
The framework processes text and tables separately: narrative content is embedded using dense encoders, while tabular data is indexed via late-interaction pooling over cells. A lightweight router directs queries to the appropriate retrieval path, and retrieval results are merged for final output. Pruning and quantization further optimize storage and latency without significant accuracy loss.

## Key Results
- 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries versus linearization baselines
- Markedly lower hallucination rates in table-based lookups
- Robust performance as table density increases, with controlled latency and storage costs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Topo-RAG treats text and tabular data with distinct retrieval strategies, avoiding the information loss inherent in flattening heterogeneous content into single vectors. Dense embeddings preserve semantic relationships in narrative, while cell-aware late interaction captures fine-grained table structure. The lightweight routing ensures efficient query processing, and optimized indexing mitigates resource overhead.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dense text embeddings:** Capture semantic relationships in narrative; needed for high-quality text retrieval; quick check: evaluate embedding similarity for paraphrases.
- **Late interaction for tables:** Allows fine-grained matching of table cells; needed to avoid losing structural context; quick check: measure recall on cell-level queries.
- **Dual-path architecture:** Separates text and table retrieval to preserve topology; needed to overcome limitations of single-vector approaches; quick check: compare hybrid vs. linearized retrieval accuracy.
- **Pruning and quantization:** Reduce storage and latency; needed for scalable deployment; quick check: measure index size and query speed before/after optimization.
- **Query routing:** Directs queries to appropriate path; needed for efficiency; quick check: evaluate routing accuracy on mixed queries.
- **Index merging:** Combines retrieval results; needed for coherent final output; quick check: assess end-to-end hybrid query performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Query -> Router -> [Text Embedder, Table Indexer] -> [Dense Retriever, Late-Interaction Retriever] -> Merger -> Output

**Critical path:** Query is routed, embedded/retrieved via the relevant path, and merged for output.

**Design tradeoffs:** Dual-path retrieval preserves content topology but adds routing complexity; late interaction for tables increases retrieval accuracy but may incur higher latency; pruning/quantization reduce resource use at potential cost to recall.

**Failure signatures:** Poor routing accuracy leads to irrelevant retrievals; over-aggressive pruning causes recall drop; incorrect table parsing degrades cell-level matching.

**First experiments:**
1. Test hybrid query accuracy with and without routing.
2. Compare recall and latency for pruned vs. full table indices.
3. Benchmark hallucination rates on mixed text-table queries.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to synthetic SEC-25 corpus and custom benchmark, constraining generalizability.
- Lacks direct comparison to state-of-the-art multi-vector or column-aware table retrieval models.
- Metrics and error categorization for hallucination reduction are not fully detailed.

## Confidence
- Topology-aware dual-path architecture improves hybrid retrieval accuracy: **High**
- 18.4% nDCG@10 improvement over linearization baselines: **Medium** (domain-specific)
- Lower hallucination rates in table-based lookups: **Low** (lacks detailed metrics)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate on diverse, real-world enterprise corpora beyond synthetic SEC-25 to confirm robustness.
2. Benchmark against leading multi-vector and column-aware table retrieval systems to establish relative gains.
3. Conduct ablation studies on pruning and quantization to quantify real-world latency and storage trade-offs.
