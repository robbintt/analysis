# EulerESG: Automating ESG Disclosure Analysis with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21712
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21712
- Reference count: 16
- Automates ESG disclosure extraction from PDFs with up to 0.95 average metric-level accuracy

## Executive Summary
EulerESG is an LLM-powered system designed to automate the extraction and analysis of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosures from unstructured PDF reports. By leveraging dual-channel retrieval and compliance classification, the system maps extracted content to standardized ESG metrics, enabling efficient and consistent benchmarking across industries. The system integrates an interactive dashboard and chatbot, facilitating user exploration and explanation of ESG data. Evaluated on four major companies across 12 Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) sub-industries, EulerESG demonstrates strong performance, achieving up to 0.95 average metric-level accuracy and practical end-to-end runtimes, significantly reducing manual effort in ESG reporting.

## Method Summary
EulerESG employs a dual-channel retrieval approach to extract ESG-related content from unstructured PDF reports. The system uses large language models (LLMs) to classify and map the extracted content to standard ESG metrics, such as those defined by the SASB framework. The architecture includes an interactive dashboard and chatbot, allowing users to explore and explain ESG data interactively. The system's design focuses on automating the extraction and analysis process, reducing the need for manual intervention and enabling standardized benchmarking across different industries and reporting frameworks.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 0.95 average metric-level accuracy on SASB metrics
- Demonstrates practical end-to-end runtimes for ESG report analysis
- Reduces manual effort in ESG reporting while enabling standardized benchmarking

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EulerESG leverages the power of LLMs to automate the extraction and analysis of ESG disclosures from unstructured PDF reports. The dual-channel retrieval mechanism ensures comprehensive content extraction, while compliance classification maps the content to standardized metrics. The integration of an interactive dashboard and chatbot enhances user engagement and facilitates deeper exploration of ESG data. The system's design is optimized for efficiency and accuracy, making it a valuable tool for organizations seeking to streamline their ESG reporting processes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
PDF Reports -> Text Extraction -> Dual-Channel Retrieval -> LLM Classification -> Compliance Mapping -> Interactive Dashboard/Chatbot

**Critical Path**
Text Extraction -> Dual-Channel Retrieval -> LLM Classification -> Compliance Mapping

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Accuracy vs. speed in LLM classification
- Comprehensiveness vs. efficiency in dual-channel retrieval
- User interface complexity vs. accessibility in dashboard design

**Failure Signatures**
- Incomplete text extraction leading to missing disclosures
- Misclassification of ESG metrics due to ambiguous language
- Non-compliance with industry-specific reporting standards

**3 First Experiments**
1. Test text extraction accuracy on diverse PDF report formats
2. Evaluate LLM classification performance across different ESG frameworks
3. Assess user engagement with the interactive dashboard and chatbot

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed information about underlying LLM architecture and retrieval mechanisms
- Evaluation focused on SASB metrics, limiting generalizability to other frameworks
- No discussion of potential biases in LLM extraction or classification

## Confidence
- System performance and accuracy metrics: High
- Generalizability to other ESG frameworks: Medium
- Robustness to real-world document variability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a blind external evaluation on ESG reports from companies not included in the original test set, across multiple reporting frameworks (e.g., GRI, TCFD).
2. Perform an error analysis focusing on false positives/negatives and categorize failure modes (e.g., ambiguous language, missing context).
3. Test the system's resilience to adversarial or "greenwashed" disclosures by including reports known to contain misleading ESG information.
