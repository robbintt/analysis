# Tracing the Interactions of Modular CMA-ES Configurations Across Problem Landscapes

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.02331
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02331
- **Reference count:** 36
- **Primary result:** Algorithm footprints identify distinct performance regions driven by landscape feature interactions, showing five CMA-ES variants behave similarly while one struggles with separable ill-conditioned problems.

## Executive Summary
This study applies algorithm footprints to analyze six modular CMA-ES configurations across 24 BBOB benchmark problems in 5D and 30D settings. The methodology uses multi-target regression (MTR) to model algorithm performance based on landscape features, with SHAP values revealing which features drive performance differences. The analysis identifies distinct performance regions where configurations excel or fail, primarily driven by interactions between problem characteristics. The approach demonstrates that algorithm footprints can provide interpretable insights into configuration performance, guiding better algorithm selection and tuning.

## Method Summary
The study applies algorithm footprints to six modular CMA-ES variants on 24 BBOB benchmark problems. Performance data and 46 ELA features are retrieved from prior work, with features reduced via forward selection. MTR models (Multi-Task Elastic Net, Random Forest, Neural Network) are trained using 4-fold stratified cross-validation with Optuna hyperparameter tuning (50 trials). The best model is retrained on all training instances and evaluated on held-out test data. SHAP values are computed for test instances, generating meta-representations that are clustered hierarchically to identify performance regions. Feature importance is analyzed through SHAP-based clustering, with distance metrics chosen to maximize Silhouette coefficient.

## Key Results
- Five of six CMA-ES configurations show similar behavior patterns, while one struggles with separable ill-conditioned problems
- Performance regions are distinctly characterized by interactions between landscape features
- MTR model performance is evaluated with MAE and R² metrics, showing reasonable predictive capability
- SHAP-based feature importance reveals specific landscape characteristics driving performance differences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm footprint methodology works by mapping configuration performance to landscape features through MTR, then using SHAP values to identify which features drive performance differences. This creates interpretable performance regions that explain why certain configurations excel on specific problem types.

## Foundational Learning
- **Algorithm Footprints**: Mapping configuration performance to problem characteristics - needed to understand how different algorithms behave across problem landscapes
- **Multi-Target Regression**: Modeling multiple performance metrics simultaneously - needed because each configuration's performance across multiple targets must be predicted
- **SHAP Values**: Quantifying feature importance in black-box models - needed to identify which landscape features drive performance differences
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Grouping similar performance patterns - needed to identify distinct performance regions
- **Silhouette Coefficient**: Measuring clustering quality - needed to validate and select optimal clustering parameters
- **Forward Feature Selection**: Reducing feature dimensionality - needed to prevent overfitting when dealing with many landscape features

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Performance Data -> Feature Extraction -> MTR Training -> SHAP Analysis -> Clustering -> Performance Regions

**Critical Path:** MTR model training (with hyperparameter tuning) -> SHAP value computation -> Hierarchical clustering -> Performance region identification

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study uses Random Forest as the MTR model despite exploring Neural Networks, likely trading predictive power for interpretability. The choice of 46 features (reduced via forward selection) balances comprehensiveness with model complexity.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor clustering quality (low Silhouette coefficient) indicates the MTR model fails to capture meaningful relationships between features and performance. Inconsistent feature importance rankings suggest model instability or insufficient training data.

**First Experiments:**
1. Train MTR models with different configurations and compare MAE/R² scores
2. Compute SHAP values for the best MTR model and visualize feature importance
3. Apply hierarchical clustering with different distance metrics and compare Silhouette scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1:** How do algorithm footprints differ when analyzing a maximally diverse portfolio of configurations selected via automated methods, rather than a set where five of six variants exhibit similar behavior?

**Open Question 2:** Do the landscape feature interactions identified for modular CMA-ES generalize to other modular algorithm frameworks like modular Differential Evolution (modDE) or PSO-X?

**Open Question 3:** Can deep learning techniques enhance the predictive capability of Multi-Target Regression (MTR) models when the number of algorithm configurations (targets) significantly exceeds the number of landscape features?

**Open Question 4:** How sensitive are the identified performance regions (clusters) to the choice of clustering strategy and distance metrics?

## Limitations
- Lack of diversity in the configuration portfolio limits the generalizability of findings
- Sensitivity of performance regions to clustering method choice is unexplored
- Potential overfitting due to limited training data relative to feature space
- MTR predictive power diminishes when target dimensionality exceeds feature dimensionality

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the core methodology and its validity for mapping configuration performance to landscape features.

**Medium confidence** in the reproducibility of specific numerical results due to unknown hyperparameter ranges and final model choice.

**Low confidence** in exact clustering outcomes without knowing the final distance metric and precise feature set.

## Next Checks
1. Reconstruct the full MTR pipeline (normalization, 4-fold CV, Optuna tuning with specified ranges, retraining) and compare model performance metrics (MAE, R²) on the test set.

2. Generate SHAP values for the selected MTR model on test instances, compute meta-feature representations, and perform hierarchical clustering with both Euclidean and cosine distances to verify which maximizes Silhouette.

3. Visualize and compare footprint patterns across the 6 CMA-ES configurations, ensuring the clustering results align with reported performance regions and feature interaction insights.
