# An approach to Fisher-Rao metric for infinite dimensional non-parametric information geometry

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.21451
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21451
- Reference count: 6
- Key outcome: Introduces Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM) to make infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metrics tractable for non-parametric information geometry

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental intractability barrier in infinite-dimensional non-parametric information geometry where the Fisher-Rao metric becomes an intractable functional. The authors introduce an orthogonal decomposition of the tangent space into observable covariate subspace S and residual subspace S⊥, yielding a finite-dimensional Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM). They prove the Trace Theorem establishing G-entropy as a fundamental geometric invariant and demonstrate applications including Manifold Hypothesis testing through rank-deficiency analysis of Gf, providing a rigorous method for estimating intrinsic dimensionality in high-dimensional data.

## Method Summary
The paper decomposes the infinite-dimensional tangent space Tf M = S ⊕ S⊥, where S represents the observable covariate subspace and S⊥ the residual subspace. This decomposition yields the Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM), Gf, which is finite-dimensional and computable from data. The Geometric Efficiency Estimation Procedure involves non-parametric density estimation, computation of Stein scores via ∇x log f̂, and empirical cFIM estimation through averaging outer products of scores. The intrinsic dimension d is identified via eigenvalue spectral gap analysis. The framework establishes G-entropy HG(f) = Tr(Gf) as a fundamental invariant and connects cFIM to efficient estimation theory.

## Key Results
- The Trace Theorem proves HG(pf q = Tr(Gf), establishing G-entropy as a fundamental geometric invariant measuring total explainable statistical information
- The cFIM is congruent to the Efficient Fisher Information Matrix, providing fundamental variance limits for semi-parametric estimators
- Manifold Hypothesis testing via rank-deficiency analysis of Gf offers a rigorous method for estimating intrinsic dimensionality in high-dimensional data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by decomposing the infinite-dimensional information geometry problem into tractable finite-dimensional components. By partitioning the tangent space into observable and residual subspaces, the intractable Fisher-Rao functional becomes a computable matrix. The Covariate Fisher Information Matrix captures all statistically explainable variation through the covariate scores, while the orthogonal complement accounts for residual variation. This decomposition preserves the essential geometric structure needed for statistical inference while making computation feasible.

## Foundational Learning
**Information Geometry**: Mathematical framework studying statistical models as Riemannian manifolds; needed to understand Fisher-Rao metric and its limitations; check by verifying understanding of Fisher information as metric tensor.
**Tangent Space Decomposition**: Partitioning infinite-dimensional spaces into finite-dimensional observable and residual components; needed to make infinite-dimensional problems tractable; check by confirming ability to compute orthogonal projections.
**Stein Scores**: ∇x log f(x) as gradient of log-density; needed for efficient score estimation from data; check by verifying automatic differentiation implementation works on density estimates.
**Spectral Gap Analysis**: Identifying intrinsic dimension through eigenvalue ratios; needed for Manifold Hypothesis testing; check by confirming spectral gap detection on synthetic manifolds.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Density Estimation -> Score Computation -> cFIM Estimation -> Eigen-decomposition -> Dimension Identification
**Critical Path**: The pipeline is sequential - density estimation must complete before scores can be computed, which must complete before cFIM can be estimated, etc.
**Design Tradeoffs**: KDE vs normalizing flows for density estimation (bias-variance tradeoff), bandwidth selection for KDE (undersmoothing vs oversmoothing), score matching vs automatic differentiation (accuracy vs implementation complexity).
**Failure Signatures**: Singular or near-singular Gf indicates covariate scores are linearly dependent; no clear spectral gap suggests violated Manifold Hypothesis or poor density estimation; high score variance indicates instability in low-density regions.
**First Experiments**: 1) Implement KDE on synthetic Gaussian mixture to verify density estimation; 2) Compute scores on known distributions to validate ∇x log f̂ implementation; 3) Generate synthetic low-dimensional manifold data to test dimension recovery.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: How can the orthogonal decomposition framework be extended to the third-order Amari-Chentsov Cubic Tensor (T) to isolate statistical skewness within the explainable subspace S? This depends on defining a Covariate Cubic Tensor and proving its relation to KL-divergence asymmetry restricted to the covariate subspace.

**Open Question 2**: Can Covariate Dual Connections (∇(1)G and ∇(-1)G) be constructed on subspace S to optimize learning paths based on minimal statistical skewness? This requires successful decomposition of the third-order Cubic Tensor and derivation of connection coefficients.

**Open Question 3**: What is the precise asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of estimated Covariate FIM (Ĝf) under the null hypothesis to rigorously test the Manifold Hypothesis? The paper lacks the theoretical derivation of null distribution needed for computing p-values.

## Limitations
- No empirical results or validation datasets provided to demonstrate practical effectiveness
- Score estimation method details are external references, requiring additional implementation work
- Spectral gap significance thresholds not quantified, making hypothesis testing ambiguous

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical framework and decomposition approach
- Medium confidence in practical implementation due to unspecified score estimation details
- Low confidence in Manifold Hypothesis testing without empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Implement complete pipeline on synthetic manifolds with known intrinsic dimension (e.g., Swiss roll, S-curve) to verify dimension recovery accuracy
2. Compare cFIM-based dimension estimation against established manifold learning techniques (Isomap, LLE, diffusion maps) on benchmark datasets
3. Test robustness to density estimation bandwidth selection and score estimation noise through systematic sensitivity analysis
