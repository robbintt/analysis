# The Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language: Official Guideline

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20969
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20969
- Reference count: 30
- One-line primary result: EPDDL provides a standardized PDDL-like language for representing epistemic planning tasks in Dynamic Epistemic Logic, enabling uniform specifications and meaningful planner comparisons.

## Executive Summary
EPDDL addresses the fragmentation in epistemic planning by providing a standardized language for representing tasks in Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL). The language uses a PDDL-like syntax while capturing complete DEL semantics through multi-pointed epistemic models, event models, and product update rules. EPDDL includes novel features like list comprehensions and supports various epistemic planning formalisms beyond DEL. The authors present a formal development of abstract event models as the foundation for action semantics, along with a precise specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL.

## Method Summary
The method involves defining EPDDL specifications (domain + problem + optional action type libraries) representing epistemic planning tasks using the PDDL-like syntax described in Sections 4-5. The `plank` toolkit parses, type-checks, and grounds EPDDL specifications to JSON format. The approach uses abstract event models to parameterize observability patterns and action type libraries to define reusable DEL fragments. Validation involves generating valid ground abstract planning tasks in JSON that can be consumed by epistemic planners.

## Key Results
- EPDDL provides a unified PDDL-like syntax capturing complete DEL semantics through multi-pointed epistemic models and product updates
- Abstract event models reduce specification complexity by parameterizing observability patterns rather than explicit enumeration
- Action type libraries enable modular definition of DEL fragments for meaningful planner comparisons

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
EPDDL enables interoperability across diverse epistemic planners by providing a unified syntax that captures the full DEL semantics. The language uses a PDDL-like syntax (familiar to planning practitioners) while encoding complete DEL semantics through multi-pointed epistemic models, event models, and product update rules. This allows different planners targeting different DEL fragments to share benchmark specifications without semantic drift.

### Mechanism 2
Abstract event models reduce specification complexity by parameterizing observability patterns rather than explicitly enumerating agent-specific accessibility relations. Instead of defining separate event models for each combination of observer states, EPDDL uses observability types (e.g., Fully, Partially, Oblivious) with conditions that dynamically assign agents to types based on state formulas.

### Mechanism 3
Action type libraries enable modular definition of DEL fragments, allowing meaningful planner comparisons by constraining the space of allowed action types. Libraries define reusable action types (multi-pointed abstract frames). A domain imports specific libraries, implicitly restricting which action types are available.

## Foundational Learning

- **Epistemic Models and Multi-Agent Accessibility Relations**
  - Why needed here: EPDDL's initial states and product updates require understanding how possible worlds and accessibility relations encode agent knowledge/beliefs
  - Quick check question: Given an S5 model with worlds {w1, w2, w3} and universal accessibility for agent A, what does agent A know in w1?

- **DEL Product Update Semantics**
  - Why needed here: The core execution model for EPDDL actions is the product update (Definition 12), which combines state and action models to produce new states
  - Quick check question: If state s has world w with label {p} and action a has event e with precondition p and postcondition p↔q, what atoms hold in the updated world (w,e)?

- **Observability Types and Conditional Observability**
  - Why needed here: Abstract event models assign agents to observability types based on state conditions, determining how accessibility relations are constructed during product updates
  - Quick check question: In a private action with types {Fully, Oblivious}, if agent i's obs condition for Fully is (looking i), what happens when (looking i) is false?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Problem (.epddl problem file) -> Domain (.epddl domain file) -> Action Type Libraries -> plank toolchain -> JSON exporter
- **Critical path**: 1. Define or import action type libraries matching your planner's supported DEL fragment 2. Define domain with predicates, events, and actions binding to library types 3. Define problem with initial state and goal 4. Use plank to ground and export to JSON for planner input
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Finitary S5-theories vs. explicit initial states: Finitary theories are concise but only capture S5-states with distinct world labels; explicit states are verbose but fully general
  - Action type abstraction vs. direct specification: Abstraction reduces redundancy but requires understanding the mapping from abstract to concrete frames
  - Requirements declaration: More requirements increase expressivity but reduce the set of compatible planners
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Type mismatches: Event parameters don't match action type event variable types
  - Incomplete observability conditions: Agents without obs conditions and no default trigger semantic errors
  - Unsatisfiable finitary S5-theories: Type 1 formulas inconsistent with type 2 constraints yield empty world sets
  - Invalid list comprehension conditions: Modal formulas in list conditions violate the "facts only" requirement
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Parse and ground the provided Epistemic Blocks World example (Listings 4, 10, 7) using plank, inspect the JSON output to verify correct grounding of the initial state and action set
  2. Create a minimal problem using finitary S5-theory syntax for a single-agent public announcement scenario; verify the induced state matches expectations by checking world count and accessibility relations
  3. Define a custom action type library with a new observability type (e.g., "PartiallyDistracted") and create a domain action using this type; trace the abstract product update to confirm correct behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the EPDDL language be effectively extended to include modal operators beyond the currently supported knowledge and belief modalities, such as distributed knowledge? The authors state they plan to consider other kinds of modalities to further increase the expressivity of the language, but the current logic focuses on individual/group knowledge and common knowledge.

### Open Question 2
How can the syntactic representation of initial epistemic states be expanded to cover a broader class of models while avoiding the scalability issues of explicit definitions? While finitary S5-theories are concise, they capture only a subclass of states, and explicit definitions scale poorly as model size grows.

### Open Question 3
What are the computational trade-offs (e.g., grounding time vs. search speed) when using abstract event models compared to standard event models in planning algorithms? The paper introduces abstract epistemic actions to provide a cleaner representation but does not evaluate if this abstraction layer imposes computational overhead or offers search benefits during planning.

## Limitations
- Practical validation is limited; no empirical evaluation of the `plank` toolchain's correctness or performance is provided
- The claim that EPDDL "facilitates reproducible evaluation" remains theoretical without demonstrated adoption by multiple epistemic planners
- While aiming to capture "the entire DEL semantics," no formal proof of completeness or translation correctness between EPDDL and various DEL formalisms is presented

## Confidence
- **Mechanism 1 (Interoperability)**: High confidence - The PDDL-like syntax and formal semantics mapping to DEL product updates is clearly specified with appropriate theoretical grounding
- **Mechanism 2 (Abstract Event Models)**: Medium confidence - While Proposition 1 and 2 establish equivalence with standard product updates, no empirical evidence demonstrates practical simplification benefits
- **Mechanism 3 (Action Type Libraries)**: Medium confidence - The library concept is well-defined, but the paper doesn't demonstrate how existing planners map to specific library configurations

## Next Checks
1. Implement a minimal `plank` toolchain to parse the Epistemic Blocks World example and verify the JSON output matches the expected ground state structure with correct world accessibility relations.

2. Create a test suite of EPDDL specifications covering edge cases: empty initial states from unsatisfiable finitary S5-theories, actions with complex observability conditions, and nested modal formulas in goals to stress-test the type checker.

3. Translate an existing epistemic planner's benchmark into EPDDL and back to assess information preservation and identify any semantic drift in the round-trip conversion process.
