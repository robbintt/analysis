# An Explainable Machine Learning Framework for Railway Predictive Maintenance using Data Streams from the Metro Operator of Portugal

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.05388
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05388
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Over 98% F-measure and 99% accuracy in real-time railway predictive maintenance.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a transparent, real-time machine learning framework for predictive maintenance in railway operations. The method combines statistical and frequency-based feature engineering using FIR filters with incremental classification via Adaptive Random Forest and natural language/visual explainability. Experiments using the MetroPT dataset from Porto, Portugal, demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in handling class imbalance and noise while providing interpretable insights for maintenance decision-making in real-world railway environments.

## Method Summary
The framework processes continuous sensor streams from railway Air Production Units using a four-stage pipeline. Raw analog signals are first filtered through four sliding-window FIR filters with sizes 1399, 116, 531, and 864 samples to remove noise. These windows extract statistical features (quartiles, standard deviation) and frequency-domain information via FFT. The features are then fed into an Adaptive Random Forest Classifier that updates incrementally to handle concept drift. The system provides intrinsic explainability by traversing decision paths in the trees and mapping the most relevant features to natural language templates, offering actionable insights for maintenance teams.

## Key Results
- Achieved over 98% F-measure and 99% accuracy on MetroPT dataset for railway fault prediction
- Demonstrated superior performance compared to static models and non-adaptive classifiers
- Successfully handled class imbalance and noise in real-world railway sensor data
- Provided interpretable explanations through decision path traversal and natural language templates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Noise-Adaptive Feature Engineering
The high classification accuracy (>99%) depends on transforming raw, noisy sensor streams into robust statistical and frequency-domain features. Four sliding-window FIR filters smooth random oscillations while capturing distributional statistics and frequency anomalies, creating a "robust configuration against errors or outliers" by purging spurious measurements. This mechanism assumes noise is random/white and that failure signatures manifest as statistical distribution shifts persisting within defined window lengths.

### Mechanism 2: Incremental Ensemble Learning (ARFC)
The system maintains performance in non-stationary environments using Adaptive Random Forest Classifier that updates incrementally rather than retraining on static datasets. The ARFC uses ensemble of Hoeffding trees with drift detectors, weighting tree votes based on test-then-train accuracy. This allows the model to "forget" outdated information and adapt to new operating conditions or fault modes without full retraining. The mechanism assumes the relationship between sensor features and faults evolves over time (concept drift) and that online adaptation is superior to static models for long-term deployment.

### Mechanism 3: Intrinsic Explainability via Decision Path Traversal
The framework provides actionable insights by extracting feature importance directly from model's decision paths rather than using post-hoc approximation tools. Instead of treating classifier as black box, the system traverses nodes of Hoeffding Trees to identify which features met threshold conditions for specific classification. It maps these to natural language templates, assuming decision splits in Random Forest correlate strongly with physical causal reality rather than spurious correlations.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filters**
- **Why needed here:** The paper relies on FIR filters to preprocess raw analog signals; without understanding this, one cannot adjust window sizes or interpret the "cleaned" data.
- **Quick check question:** How does changing the FIR window size affect the trade-off between signal latency and noise reduction?

**Concept: Prequential Evaluation (Test-Then-Train)**
- **Why needed here:** The results (>98% F-measure) are derived using this specific online protocol where the model is tested on current sample before learning from it.
- **Quick check question:** In a stream, does prequential accuracy typically under- or over-estimate performance compared to a held-out test set if concept drift is present?

**Concept: Variance Thresholding**
- **Why needed here:** This is the specific feature selection method used to reduce dimensionality by discarding low-variance inputs.
- **Quick check question:** Why is a low-variance feature often considered less relevant in a classification context, and when might this assumption be wrong?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Raw Stream -> Preprocessing (FIR Filters + Variance Threshold) -> Feature Buffer (Stats + FFT) -> ARFC Classifier -> Decision Path Traverser -> NLP Template Engine -> Dashboard

**Critical path:** The preprocessing module is the most brittle link; specifically, the dynamic calculation of window sizes and the Variance Threshold. If these are misconfigured, the downstream classifier receives garbage.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- *Performance vs. Explainability:* The paper argues ARFC provides both, but runtime (209.65s for ARFC) is significantly higher than GNB (15.36s).
- *Robustness vs. Latency:* Large FIR windows (up to 1399 samples) increase robustness against noise but delay detection of rapid changes.

**Failure signatures:**
- *Air leak dryer:* High oil temperature + TP2 anomalies + broader Reservoirs wave
- *Oil leak compressor:* High Flowmeter + H1 + broader Motor Current (MC) wave
- *False alarms:* Often triggered by failing to filter noise in "Flow rate" digital signal or incorrect variance thresholds

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Window Sensitivity:** Re-run pipeline with FIR window sizes halved/doubled to observe impact on 98% F-measure
2. **Baseline Comparison:** Train static Random Forest on first 50% of data and test on rest to quantify gain from ARFC's adaptive nature
3. **Explanation Verification:** Inject synthetic "Air leak" data into stream and manually verify if NLP template correctly identifies "DV pressure" as root cause

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the framework's predictive performance be maintained when deployed across heterogeneous datasets from different railway operators with varying sensor configurations?
- **Basis:** The conclusion states that future research will consider "additional datasets... to validate the method's applicability."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study validates the framework exclusively using the MetroPT dataset from a single operator in Porto, Portugal.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical results showing comparable F-measure and accuracy when the pipeline is applied to distinct railway sensor datasets without extensive domain-specific re-engineering.

### Open Question 2
Does modeling the propagation of anomalies between neighboring sensors improve fault detection accuracy compared to the current individual sensor-level approach?
- **Basis:** The conclusion suggests the current detection "can be more holistic, e.g., taking into account the propagation of anomalies between neighboring sensors."
- **Why unresolved:** The current method classifies samples based on features engineered from individual sensors, ignoring potential causal relationships or spatial dependencies between sensors.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis showing a statistically significant increase in F-measure or earlier detection times when inter-sensor propagation features are integrated into the classification model.

### Open Question 3
Can the static configuration of FIR filter window lengths and model hyperparameters be replaced by a dynamic update mechanism triggered by concept drift?
- **Basis:** The conclusion identifies the "primary weakness" as static parameter configuration and suggests overcoming this by updating parameters "whenever data drifts."
- **Why unresolved:** Currently, window lengths are determined by the first two days of data, and hyperparameters are fixed at the start of the classification phase, potentially leading to obsolescence as train components wear.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation of an adaptive monitoring loop that automatically resizes window lengths or retrains models during operation, demonstrating sustained accuracy over long-term streams with simulated drift.

### Open Question 4
What are the quantitative benefits regarding productivity improvements and cost reductions for the operator when using this system in a live operational environment?
- **Basis:** The conclusion notes the intent to "gather quantitative data related to productivity improvements from the operator to validate our solution's positive impact further."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper validates the framework using machine learning metrics (accuracy, F-measure) rather than operational KPIs, such as reduced downtime or maintenance hours.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A longitudinal study post-deployment reporting specific reductions in mean time to repair (MTTR) and maintenance costs relative to historical baselines.

## Limitations
- The specific method for deriving optimal FIR window sizes is not fully detailed, creating reproducibility challenges
- The impact of downsampling by a factor of 50 on minority class detection remains unclear
- The decision path-based explainability method lacks quantitative validation against established methods like SHAP

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in ARFC framework's ability to achieve >99% accuracy on MetroPT dataset
- **Medium confidence** in superiority of online learning over static models for railway maintenance
- **Low confidence** in generalizability of FIR-based feature engineering approach to other railway systems without recalibration

## Next Checks
1. **Window Sensitivity Test:** Re-run the pipeline with halved/doubled FIR window sizes to quantify the impact on the 98% F-measure and minority class detection
2. **Static vs. Online Comparison:** Train a static Random Forest on the first 50% of data and test on the remainder to isolate the performance gain from ARFC's adaptive nature
3. **Explanation Verification:** Inject synthetic fault data and verify if the NLP template correctly identifies the root cause features based on the decision path traversal
