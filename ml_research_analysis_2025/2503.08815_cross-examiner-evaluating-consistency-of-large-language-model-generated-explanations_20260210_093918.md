# Cross-Examiner: Evaluating Consistency of Large Language Model-Generated Explanations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.08815
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08815
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Neuro-symbolic method outperforms LLM-only approaches for generating probing follow-up questions, achieving 45% top scores vs 38% for LLM-only

## Executive Summary
Cross-Examiner is a neuro-symbolic method for evaluating the consistency of large language model-generated explanations through follow-up questioning. The approach combines symbolic information extraction with language model-driven question generation to produce more effective probing questions than LLM-only methods. Manual evaluation demonstrates that Cross-Examiner questions achieve higher quality ratings and successfully detect inconsistencies in explanations, with failures being automatically identifiable through simple metrics.

## Method Summary
The method extracts key information from explanations using a rule-based classifier that identifies entity-attribute-value triples, then leverages this structured information to generate targeted follow-up questions through an LLM. This neuro-symbolic approach contrasts with LLM-only generation by grounding questions in the semantic content of the original explanation. The system employs a consistency evaluation framework that measures how well generated questions probe the internal coherence of explanations, using both automated metrics (QDiff) and manual quality assessments to validate performance.

## Key Results
- Cross-Examiner generated questions received top manual quality scores 45% of the time, compared to 38% for LLM-only generation
- The method successfully detected inconsistencies in explanations, with failures being automatically identifiable
- Cross-Examiner questions performed particularly well with longer explanations, achieving R² ≥ 0.94 correlation with explanation quality based on sentence count

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The neuro-symbolic approach works by extracting structured semantic information from explanations before generating questions, ensuring that follow-ups are grounded in the actual content rather than being purely generative. This structured approach enables more targeted and relevant questioning that can effectively probe for inconsistencies. The symbolic extraction component identifies key relationships and facts within explanations, while the language model component leverages this structured information to generate contextually appropriate questions that are more likely to reveal contradictions or gaps in reasoning.

## Foundational Learning

**Symbolic Information Extraction**: Rule-based classification to identify entity-attribute-value triples from text. Needed to ground question generation in concrete semantic content rather than surface patterns. Quick check: Can the system correctly extract "dog - color - brown" from "The brown dog ran quickly"?

**Consistency Metrics**: Automated measures (QDiff) that quantify how well questions probe explanation coherence. Needed to provide objective evaluation beyond manual assessment. Quick check: Does QDiff score decrease when questions fail to detect obvious contradictions?

**Follow-up Question Quality**: Manual evaluation framework for assessing question relevance and probing effectiveness. Needed to capture nuances that automated metrics miss. Quick check: Do human annotators agree on whether questions effectively probe inconsistencies?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Explanation -> Symbolic Extractor -> Structured Information -> LLM Prompt -> Follow-up Questions -> Consistency Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The extraction-to-generation pipeline forms the critical path, where symbolic information extraction quality directly impacts question generation effectiveness. The rule-based classifier's accuracy in identifying entity-attribute-value triples is particularly crucial, as errors here propagate through the entire questioning process.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades the flexibility of pure LLM generation for the precision of structured semantic grounding. While this may limit creative or unexpected questioning, it ensures questions are contextually relevant and more likely to probe meaningful inconsistencies. The rule-based extraction offers interpretability but may struggle with complex linguistic structures.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor question quality manifests as either too-generic questions that don't probe specific content, or overly narrow questions that miss broader inconsistencies. Automated failure detection through QDiff provides a safety net for identifying when the system is underperforming.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test extraction accuracy on diverse explanation types with varying linguistic complexity
2. Compare question quality across different extraction rule configurations
3. Evaluate consistency detection on explanations with known contradictions of varying subtlety

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on single-round questioning without iterative probing may miss deeper inconsistencies
- Evaluation limited to GPT-4-generated explanations on specific task domains
- Manual evaluation involved only two annotators, raising potential bias concerns

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core finding that neuro-symbolic approaches outperform LLM-only methods for follow-up question generation is well-supported by both automated metrics (QDiff) and manual evaluation showing a 7 percentage point improvement in top-scoring questions (45% vs 38%).

**Medium Confidence**: The correlation between explanation length and cross-examiner performance (R² ≥ 0.94) appears strong but requires validation across diverse explanation types and models.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability of these findings to real-world applications where explanations may be more complex, domain-specific, or generated by different model architectures remains uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Cross-model validation: Test cross-examiner against explanations generated by multiple model families (e.g., Claude, LLaMA, PaLM) to assess generalizability beyond GPT-4.

2. Multi-round probing evaluation: Implement iterative questioning to determine whether consistency detection improves with sequential follow-ups, and measure how many rounds are optimal before diminishing returns.

3. Bias and robustness analysis: Conduct inter-annotator agreement studies with 5+ annotators to establish confidence intervals for manual quality ratings, and test symbolic extraction rules on edge cases including negations, metaphors, and domain-specific terminology.
