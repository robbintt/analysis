# Read Quietly, Think Aloud: Decoupling Comprehension and Reasoning in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.03327
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03327
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Proposed techniques improve LLM reasoning accuracy by 7-11 percentage points on multiple-choice benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in current Large Language Models: their lack of distinct comprehension before response generation. Unlike human cognition which involves silent reading and deliberation, LLMs typically begin generating responses immediately without dedicated internal comprehension phases. The authors propose two complementary techniques to encourage models to "read quietly" before generating output, leading to significant improvements in reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and model scales.

The proposed methods, READQ and READQBUDDY, were tested on Llama 3.2 3B and Llama 3.1 70B models across ARC Challenge, OpenBookQA, and MedQA benchmarks. Results show consistent accuracy improvements ranging from 7 to 11 percentage points, demonstrating that encouraging initial comprehension significantly enhances reasoning capabilities. The work provides compelling evidence that architectural modifications promoting thoughtful processing can yield substantial performance gains in LLM reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two techniques to encourage LLMs to build context understanding before generating responses. READQ masks the loss for initial tokens during training, allowing the model time to comprehend the input without prediction pressure. This creates a dedicated comprehension phase where the model can process information without being penalized for incorrect early predictions. READQBUDDY adds an auxiliary "buddy" module that processes the full input context and provides semantic representations to the primary generation model throughout the generation process, enabling continuous access to comprehensive context information.

Both methods were evaluated on Llama 3.2 3B and Llama 3.1 70B models across multiple benchmarks. The techniques aim to decouple comprehension from reasoning by giving models dedicated time and resources for understanding before response generation. This architectural modification addresses the fundamental limitation where current models lack the ability to "read quietly" before producing output, mimicking human cognitive processes that involve silent reading and deliberation before verbal response.

## Key Results
- READQ improved ARC Challenge accuracy by 8.6 percentage points on Llama 3.2 3B
- READQBUDDY achieved 11.86 percentage point improvement on ARC Challenge with Llama 3.1 70B
- READQ increased MedQA accuracy by 7.9 percentage points on scientific domain data
- OpenBookQA showed 6.8-8.2 percentage point improvements across both methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methods work by creating dedicated comprehension phases that allow models to build comprehensive understanding before generating responses. READQ achieves this by masking early token losses, removing the pressure to predict immediately and giving the model time to process context. READQBUDDY provides continuous semantic representations through an auxiliary module, ensuring the generation model has access to rich context information throughout the generation process. This separation of comprehension and reasoning phases mimics human cognitive processes and enables more thoughtful, accurate responses by preventing premature prediction and ensuring thorough understanding of the input.

## Foundational Learning
- Masked loss training: Why needed - to prevent early prediction pressure; Quick check - verify loss values during initial token generation
- Auxiliary semantic modules: Why needed - to provide continuous context representations; Quick check - validate semantic vector quality
- Comprehension-reasoning decoupling: Why needed - to mimic human cognitive processing; Quick check - measure response quality improvement
- Multi-task training: Why needed - to ensure generalization across reasoning tasks; Quick check - test on held-out benchmarks
- Context embedding quality: Why needed - to ensure rich semantic representations; Quick check - analyze embedding similarity metrics

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Context -> READQ/READQBUDDY Module -> Primary Generation Model -> Output Response

Critical Path:
The critical path involves input processing through the comprehension phase (either masked loss or buddy module), followed by context-aware generation. The buddy module adds an additional processing step but provides continuous semantic feedback to the generation model throughout the response sequence.

Design Tradeoffs:
The methods introduce computational overhead through the buddy module and masked loss formulation, but trade this against significant accuracy improvements. The masked loss approach is computationally lighter but may provide less comprehensive context than the buddy module. The buddy module requires additional parameters and computation but offers richer semantic representations throughout generation.

Failure Signatures:
Potential failures include overfitting to the comprehension phase, where models become too reliant on the auxiliary context and struggle with direct inference. Another failure mode could be context overload, where the additional semantic information overwhelms the generation model's capacity to process and utilize it effectively.

3 First Experiments:
1. Compare baseline vs READQ performance on a small subset of ARC Challenge questions
2. Test buddy module output quality independently of the generation model
3. Measure training stability with masked loss versus standard cross-entropy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on multiple-choice question answering, limiting generalization claims
- Additional computational overhead from buddy module and masked loss formulation not quantified
- Unclear whether improvements reflect genuine comprehension versus enhanced pattern matching

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Benchmark results show clear performance gains | High |
| Improvements reflect true comprehension vs pattern matching | Medium |
| Scalability to larger models/architectures | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test methods on open-ended generation tasks and creative reasoning benchmarks
2. Conduct ablation studies removing buddy module to quantify its contribution
3. Perform qualitative analysis of model outputs to distinguish comprehension from memorization
