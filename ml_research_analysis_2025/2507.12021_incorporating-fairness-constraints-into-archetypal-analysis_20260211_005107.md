# Incorporating Fairness Constraints into Archetypal Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.12021
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12021
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: FairAA and FairKernelAA significantly reduce group separability while maintaining high explained variance on synthetic and ANSUR I datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FairAA and FairKernelAA, the first fairness-constrained extensions of archetypal analysis for unsupervised representation learning. The methods add a fairness regularization term that enforces statistical independence between archetype coefficients and sensitive attributes, effectively reducing linear separability of demographic groups in the learned representation. The approach extends to multiple groups and nonlinear structures via kernelization, with experiments demonstrating that fairness can be achieved without sacrificing data structure or interpretability.

## Method Summary
FairAA modifies standard archetypal analysis by adding a regularization term λ||zS||²_F to the reconstruction objective, where z are centered group indicators and S are coefficient vectors. This forces archetype weights to have near-zero correlation with group membership. FairKernelAA extends this to nonlinear structures by replacing inner products with a kernel matrix K, enabling the fairness constraint to operate in an implicit high-dimensional feature space. For multiple groups, one-vs-all encoding is used to stack group indicator matrices and apply the same covariance constraint simultaneously.

## Key Results
- FairAA and FairKernelAA significantly reduce group separability (lower MMD and LS metrics)
- Methods maintain high explained variance (0.75–0.95) on tested datasets
- FairKernelAA effectively handles nonlinear group boundaries while preserving fairness
- Multi-group extension successfully obscures multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fairness Regularization via Covariance Minimization
FairAA augments the AA objective with λ||zS||²_F, pushing optimization toward solutions where archetype weights have near-zero correlation with group membership. This directly reduces linear separability in the learned representation.

### Mechanism 2: Kernelization for Nonlinear Group Structures
FairKernelAA substitutes the Gram matrix XXT with a kernel matrix K, allowing the fairness constraint to operate in an implicit high-dimensional feature space where nonlinear group boundaries become harder to distinguish linearly.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Group Extension via One-vs-All Encoding
For multiple groups, stacking one-hot encoded group indicator matrices and applying the same covariance constraint simultaneously obscures multiple group memberships across different sensitive attributes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Archetypal Analysis (AA) - Why needed: FairAA modifies the standard AA objective; understanding AA's representation of data as convex combinations of extreme points is prerequisite. Quick check: Can you explain why AA's constraint that archetypes are convex combinations of data points improves interpretability compared to PCA?

- Concept: Fairness via Representation Learning - Why needed: The paper frames fairness as learning representations that hide demographic information while preserving utility. Quick check: What is the trade-off between hiding sensitive information and maintaining reconstruction quality (explained variance)?

- Concept: Kernel Methods and the Kernel Trick - Why needed: FairKernelAA requires understanding how replacing inner products with kernel evaluations implicitly maps data to higher-dimensional spaces. Quick check: Why does an RBF kernel allow linear methods to capture nonlinear structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: X (data) -> S (coefficients) and C (archetypes) with fairness term λ||zS||²_F; Kernel extension: Replace XXT with K(X)

- Critical path: 1) Center sensitive attribute indicators, 2) Initialize S and C, 3) Alternate gradient updates with simplex projection, 4) Monitor EV, MMD, and LS

- Design tradeoffs: λ selection balances fairness and utility; number of archetypes k affects structure retention; kernel choice impacts nonlinear structure capture

- Failure signatures: Sharp EV drop (>10%) indicates λ too high; high LS (>80%) suggests λ too low or kernel mismatch; NaN/Inf gradients indicate centering issues

- First 3 experiments: 1) Replicate toy dataset (Figure 1) with k=3 archetypes, 2) Nonlinear moons dataset (Figure 2) with RBF kernel, 3) ANSUR I real data (Figure 4) with binary gender attribute

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the FairAA formulation be extended to explicitly balance reconstruction errors across different demographic groups? The current objective minimizes global reconstruction error but does not ensure equitable reconstruction quality for all sensitive groups.

### Open Question 2
Can the method be refined to align both the means and covariances of group representations to ensure comprehensive statistical parity? The current regularization primarily enforces mean indistinguishability but does not explicitly address higher-order statistics like covariance.

### Open Question 3
Is the relaxation of statistical independence to linear uncorrelation sufficient to prevent sensitive attribute inference by non-linear adversaries? While validated against linear classifiers, the method does not evaluate whether non-linear models could still extract sensitive information.

## Limitations
- Missing experimental details including exact λ values, learning rates, and kernel bandwidth parameters
- Fairness evaluation relies on proxy metrics rather than downstream task performance
- Method primarily demonstrated on binary/grouped attributes, limiting generalizability to complex intersectional attributes

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core mathematical formulation is sound with clear gradient derivations and principled fairness regularization approach

**Medium confidence**: Empirical results show expected trade-off but exact hyperparameter values are missing, making robustness assessment difficult

**Low confidence**: Generalizability to datasets with more complex intersectional attributes or continuous sensitive variables is unclear

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Systematically vary λ (0.01 to 1.0) on toy dataset and plot EV vs. MMD/LS to verify fairness-utility trade-off

2. **Kernel Bandwidth Impact**: For moons dataset, test multiple RBF bandwidths (0.1, 1.0, 10.0) in FairKernelAA and confirm appropriate bandwidths achieve both low LS and acceptable EV

3. **Downstream Task Validation**: Train classifier on FairAA representations and measure accuracy disparity across groups to complement MMD/LS metrics with task-specific fairness evaluation
