# Sketch2BIM: A Multi-Agent Human-AI Collaborative Pipeline to Convert Hand-Drawn Floor Plans to 3D BIM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20838
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20838
- Authors: Abir Khan Ratul; Sanjay Acharjee; Somin Park; Md Nazmus Sakib
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Converts hand-drawn floor plans into semantically consistent 3D BIM models via a two-phase, human-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline, with precision, recall, and F1 scores above 0.83 and geometric errors converging to zero.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Sketch2BIM, a multi-agent pipeline for converting hand-drawn floor plans into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The system employs a human-in-the-loop approach, utilizing multimodal large language models to iteratively refine a JSON representation of walls, doors, and windows, followed by automated generation of executable Revit scripts for BIM creation. Tested on ten diverse floor plans, the pipeline achieves high detection accuracy and geometric precision through iterative feedback.

## Method Summary
Sketch2BIM is a two-phase, human-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline for converting hand-drawn floor plans into 3D BIM models. In Phase 1, the system extracts a JSON representation of architectural elements (walls, doors, windows) from sketches using multimodal LLMs, with human feedback iteratively refining the layout. In Phase 2, the refined JSON is used to generate executable Revit scripts that create the 3D BIM model. The approach leverages iterative refinement and human oversight to ensure semantic consistency and accuracy, bridging conceptual design and digital modeling for both experts and non-experts.

## Key Results
- Precision, recall, and F1 scores for layout detection all exceed 0.83.
- Geometric errors (RMSE, MAE) converge to zero through iterative human feedback.
- Pipeline demonstrates robust BIM creation from informal sketches across ten diverse floor plans.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline's effectiveness stems from its human-in-the-loop design, which combines the flexibility of multimodal LLMs to interpret informal sketches with iterative human feedback to correct errors and ensure semantic accuracy. By refining the JSON representation through multiple feedback cycles, the system achieves high precision in detecting architectural elements. The use of executable Revit scripts in Phase 2 ensures seamless translation from the refined JSON to a fully functional 3D BIM model, leveraging industry-standard tools for final output.

## Foundational Learning
The approach builds on advances in multimodal LLMs capable of interpreting visual and textual inputs simultaneously, enabling the extraction of structured JSON representations from hand-drawn sketches. It also leverages iterative human-AI collaboration, a paradigm proven effective in tasks requiring both automation and nuanced judgment. The pipeline's design reflects lessons from prior sketch-to-BIM methods, addressing limitations in accuracy and semantic consistency through human oversight and refinement.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Sketch -> ML-based Layout Extraction (Phase 1) -> Human Feedback Loop -> Refined JSON -> BIM Script Generation (Phase 2) -> 3D BIM Model

### Critical Path
1. Extract layout from sketch using multimodal LLM
2. Human-in-the-loop iterative refinement of JSON representation
3. Generate executable Revit script from refined JSON
4. Create 3D BIM model in Revit

### Design Tradeoffs
- Human-in-the-loop feedback enables high accuracy but may limit scalability.
- Use of multimodal LLMs allows for flexible interpretation of informal sketches.
- Iterative refinement balances automation with manual oversight for semantic consistency.

### Failure Signatures
- Low detection accuracy if sketches are unclear or contain ambiguous symbols.
- Slow pipeline performance if human feedback is delayed or inconsistent.
- Errors propagate if initial JSON extraction is incorrect and not corrected by feedback.

### First Experiments
1. Test the pipeline on a larger, more varied dataset of hand-drawn floor plans, including sketches of varying quality and complexity.
2. Conduct a user study to assess the iterative feedback process, measuring both task completion time and user satisfaction.
3. Compare the method's accuracy and efficiency against established baseline approaches for sketch-to-BIM conversion, including both automated and manual workflows.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the pipeline be scaled to handle larger and more complex floor plans without compromising accuracy?
- What are the optimal feedback mechanisms to minimize human intervention while maintaining high semantic consistency?
- Can the system be extended to support other BIM platforms beyond Revit, and how would this impact performance?
- How does the pipeline perform on sketches with varying levels of detail and artistic style, and what preprocessing steps might be needed?

## Limitations
- Dataset limited to ten hand-drawn floor plans, insufficient for robust generalization.
- No public dataset provided for independent verification.
- No baseline comparisons or statistical significance testing reported.
- Reliance on human feedback may limit scalability for large-scale or real-time applications.

## Confidence
- Technical feasibility of pipeline: High
- Accuracy and convergence results: Medium
- Scalability and usability: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the pipeline on a larger, more varied dataset of hand-drawn floor plans, including sketches of varying quality and complexity.
2. Conduct a user study to assess the iterative feedback process, measuring both task completion time and user satisfaction.
3. Compare the method's accuracy and efficiency against established baseline approaches for sketch-to-BIM conversion, including both automated and manual workflows.
