# Kandinsky 5.0: A Family of Foundation Models for Image and Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.14993
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14993
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces Kandinsky 5.0 family of high-resolution image and video generation models with up to 19B parameters

## Executive Summary
Kandinsky 5.0 introduces a family of foundation models for image and video generation designed to overcome computational and scalability challenges in generative AI. The framework includes three variants: Kandinsky 5.0 Image Lite (6B parameters), Video Lite (2B parameters), and Video Pro (19B parameters), all based on a unified Diffusion Transformer architecture. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual quality and motion dynamics through innovations like the Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention (NABLA) mechanism, which reduces attention computation complexity by up to 2.7x while maintaining quality.

The models are trained through a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline combining pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, distillation, and reinforcement learning-based post-training. Human evaluations on benchmarks like MovieGen demonstrate that Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite outperforms competitors such as Sora and Wan in visual fidelity, while the Video Pro variant excels in both visual quality and motion dynamics. The entire system is open-sourced under the MIT license, enabling broad access and responsible use.

## Method Summary
Kandinsky 5.0 employs a unified Diffusion Transformer architecture (CrossDiT) with three model variants optimized for different use cases. The system introduces the Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention (NABLA) mechanism to reduce attention computation complexity while maintaining quality. Training follows a multi-stage approach: pre-training on large-scale datasets, supervised fine-tuning for task-specific adaptation, distillation for efficiency, and reinforcement learning-based post-training using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Direct Preference Optimization. The architecture supports high-resolution outputs up to 1024x1024 for images and variable resolutions for videos.

## Key Results
- Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite achieves 61.3% human preference over Sora and 56.3% over Wan on MovieGen benchmark
- NABLA mechanism reduces attention computation by up to 2.7x while maintaining visual quality
- Three-tier model family (6B Image Lite, 2B Video Lite, 19B Video Pro) provides scalable options for different deployment needs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages Diffusion Transformers with cross-attention mechanisms to generate high-quality images and videos. The NABLA mechanism optimizes attention computation by adapting to local neighborhood structures, significantly reducing computational overhead. The multi-stage training pipeline enables progressive refinement from general capabilities to specialized performance through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning optimization.

## Foundational Learning
- Diffusion Transformers: Why needed - handle complex sequential generation tasks; Quick check - verify attention mechanisms properly model temporal dependencies
- Cross-attention mechanisms: Why needed - enable conditioning on text prompts; Quick check - test prompt understanding across diverse inputs
- Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention (NABLA): Why needed - reduce computational complexity; Quick check - measure speed-accuracy tradeoff curves
- Multi-stage training pipeline: Why needed - progressive capability building; Quick check - validate each stage's contribution to final performance
- Reinforcement Learning with Direct Preference Optimization: Why needed - align outputs with human preferences; Quick check - test preference consistency across evaluators

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Text Prompt -> CrossDiT Architecture -> Diffusion Process -> Output Generation
Critical path: Input encoding → Attention computation (with NABLA) → Denoising steps → Output generation
Design tradeoffs: Parameter efficiency vs. quality (6B vs 19B models), computational cost vs. generation speed, fine-tuning flexibility vs. generalization
Failure signatures: Attention collapse in NABLA, mode collapse in generation, prompt injection vulnerabilities
First experiments:
1. Test basic text-to-image generation with simple prompts to verify core functionality
2. Measure attention computation time with and without NABLA to validate efficiency claims
3. Run ablation studies removing NABLA to quantify its contribution to quality and speed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Human evaluation methodology lacks demographic diversity analysis and consistency metrics across visual styles
- Computational requirements for multi-stage training pipeline may limit reproducibility
- Generalization performance across out-of-distribution scenarios and specialized domains remains unvalidated

## Confidence
High: Diffusion Transformer architecture foundation, parameter counts (6B/2B/19B), MIT license release
Medium: Human preference scores and state-of-the-art claims against specific models on MovieGen benchmark
Low: "Highest quality" assertions without comprehensive quantitative metrics, generalizability across diverse contexts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies quantifying individual contributions of NABLA, CrossDiT architecture, and training stages using both quantitative metrics (FID, IS) and qualitative assessments
2. Perform demographic and cultural bias analysis by recruiting diverse evaluator pools and analyzing preference patterns across different visual styles, cultural contexts, and demographic groups
3. Test model generalization across out-of-distribution scenarios including different aspect ratios, resolutions beyond 1024x1024, long-form video generation, and specialized domains like medical imaging
