# HyM-UNet: Synergizing Local Texture and Global Context via Hybrid CNN-Mamba Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17988
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17988
- Reference count: 17
- Achieves IoU of 81.82%, Dice Similarity Coefficient of 88.97%, HD of 4.03 mm, and Precision of 90.91% on ISIC 2018 dataset

## Executive Summary
HyM-UNet introduces a hybrid architecture combining CNNs and Mamba for medical image segmentation, addressing the trade-off between local texture capture and global context modeling. The method uses CNNs in shallow layers for high-frequency details and Mamba in deep layers for efficient long-range dependencies. A novel Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection filters out background noise using deep semantic features, demonstrating strong performance on skin lesion segmentation tasks.

## Method Summary
The architecture employs CNNs in early layers to capture local texture and high-frequency details, while Mamba layers in deeper stages efficiently model long-range dependencies. The proposed Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection integrates deep semantic features to filter background noise during skip connections. The model is evaluated on the ISIC 2018 dataset for skin lesion segmentation, showing superior performance compared to traditional U-Net variants.

## Key Results
- IoU of 81.82% on ISIC 2018 dataset
- Dice Similarity Coefficient of 88.97%
- Hausdorff Distance of 4.03 mm
- Precision of 90.91%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach leverages CNNs' strength in capturing local features and high-frequency details in shallow layers, while Mamba's efficient sequence processing models global context in deeper layers. The Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection uses deep semantic information to selectively filter background noise, improving segmentation quality. This complementary design addresses limitations of pure CNN architectures in capturing long-range dependencies and pure attention-based models in computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning

**CNN Feature Extraction**: Convolutional layers detect local patterns and textures through learned filters. Why needed: Medical images contain fine structural details requiring precise local feature detection. Quick check: Verify receptive field size matches target lesion scale.

**Mamba Sequence Processing**: State Space Models process sequential data efficiently through selective state updates. Why needed: Global context modeling requires capturing long-range dependencies beyond CNN receptive fields. Quick check: Measure effective context window size.

**Skip Connection Fusion**: Direct feature propagation from encoder to decoder maintains spatial information. Why needed: Deep networks lose fine details through multiple downsampling operations. Quick check: Compare feature maps at corresponding scales.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> CNN Blocks -> Mamba Blocks -> CNN Blocks -> Output, with Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connections between encoder and decoder paths.

**Critical Path**: Shallow CNN layers extract local features → Mamba blocks model global context → Deep CNN layers refine features → Skip connections preserve spatial details.

**Design Tradeoffs**: CNN-Mamba hybrid balances computational efficiency with modeling capacity, but adds architectural complexity. Skip connections improve detail preservation at the cost of additional parameters.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on small lesions (CNN limitations), failure to capture global context (Mamba limitations), checkerboard artifacts (improper convolution parameters).

**First Experiments**: 1) Test single-layer CNN vs Mamba for local vs global feature extraction, 2) Evaluate standard skip connections vs Mamba-Guided variant, 3) Compare computational complexity across different depths.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single-dataset validation limits generalizability to other medical imaging domains
- No computational efficiency or parameter count analysis provided
- Ablation studies missing to quantify Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection contribution

## Confidence
- Performance metrics on ISIC 2018: High
- Architectural innovation claims: Medium
- Generalizability to other medical imaging tasks: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate HyM-UNet on at least two additional medical image segmentation datasets (e.g., BraTS, DRIVE) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection to quantify its contribution.
3. Compare computational complexity and inference speed against pure CNN and pure attention-based baselines on identical hardware.
