# Gender Stereotypes in Professional Roles Among Saudis: An Analytical Study of AI-Generated Images Using Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.21466
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21466
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Analysis of 1,006 AI-generated images across 56 Saudi professions revealed strong gender imbalance and cultural misrepresentations across three models (ImageFX, DALL-E V3, Grok).

## Executive Summary
This study examines gender stereotypes and cultural accuracy in AI-generated images of Saudi professionals using three language models: ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok. The research analyzes 1,006 images across 56 professions, evaluating them across five dimensions using a structured 5-point Likert scale with annotators achieving Cohen's Kappa reliability of 0.72. The findings reveal significant gender imbalance favoring males across all models, with DALL-E V3 showing the highest male dominance at 96%. Cultural misrepresentations were prevalent, including inappropriate combinations of traditional and Western attire, and inaccurate professional settings. The study concludes that AI models perpetuate societal biases, emphasizing the need for diverse training data and culturally sensitive evaluation frameworks.

## Method Summary
The study employed a systematic approach to analyze AI-generated images of Saudi professionals. Three language models (ImageFX, DALL-E V3, Grok) were used to generate images across 56 Saudi professions, resulting in a dataset of 1,006 images. Annotators evaluated these images using a structured 5-point Likert scale across five dimensions, with inter-annotator reliability measured at Cohen's Kappa = 0.72. The evaluation focused on gender representation, cultural accuracy, traditional attire appropriateness, professional setting accuracy, and overall authenticity. The methodology aimed to quantify both gender stereotypes and cultural misrepresentations in AI-generated visual content.

## Key Results
- Strong gender imbalance found across all three models, with DALL-E V3 showing 96% male dominance, followed by Grok (86.6%) and ImageFX (85%)
- Cultural misrepresentations prevalent, including inappropriate combinations of traditional Saudi attire (Shemagh) with Western business suits
- Counter-stereotypical images often reflected cultural misunderstandings rather than progressive representation, highlighting the complexity of addressing bias in AI outputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that AI models perpetuate societal biases by reflecting and amplifying existing gender stereotypes present in their training data. The mechanism operates through the models' learned associations between professions and gender, which are then materialized in visual outputs. When training data contains historical gender imbalances or cultural stereotypes, the models reproduce these patterns in their generated images, creating a feedback loop that reinforces rather than challenges existing societal norms.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gender bias in AI systems**: Understanding how historical data patterns influence model outputs; why needed to identify sources of bias; quick check: analyze training data composition
- **Cultural representation in visual AI**: Recognizing the importance of accurate cultural context in generated images; why needed to prevent harmful misrepresentations; quick check: expert cultural review of outputs
- **Inter-annotator reliability metrics**: Using statistical measures like Cohen's Kappa to validate subjective assessments; why needed to ensure evaluation consistency; quick check: calculate agreement scores
- **Likert scale methodology**: Structured rating systems for subjective evaluations; why needed to quantify qualitative observations; quick check: validate scale reliability
- **AI model bias detection**: Frameworks for identifying and measuring bias in generated content; why needed to establish accountability; quick check: compare output distributions against baseline data
- **Cultural sensitivity in AI development**: Incorporating cultural expertise into model training and evaluation; why needed to ensure authentic representation; quick check: conduct cultural expert reviews

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Data Collection -> Image Generation -> Annotation -> Statistical Analysis -> Bias Detection
- **Critical path:** Profession Selection → AI Model Input → Image Generation → Annotator Evaluation → Statistical Analysis → Findings Interpretation
- **Design tradeoffs:** Balancing comprehensive profession coverage with manageable annotation workload; choosing between quantitative metrics and qualitative cultural assessment
- **Failure signatures:** Inconsistent annotator interpretations (low Kappa scores), model outputs that don't match profession prompts, cultural inaccuracies that go undetected by annotators
- **First experiments:** 1) Test model consistency by generating multiple images for same profession, 2) Conduct expert cultural review of randomly selected images, 3) Analyze correlation between profession type and gender representation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited diversity of professions examined, with selection criteria unclear
- Inter-annotator reliability score of 0.72 suggests moderate disagreement among evaluators
- Cultural assessment framework may not fully capture nuanced interpretations of traditional Saudi dress codes

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Gender imbalance findings across AI models, given large sample size (1,006 images) and clear statistical patterns
- **Medium confidence:** Cultural misrepresentation findings due to potential subjectivity in evaluating traditional attire combinations
- **Medium confidence:** Conclusion about AI models perpetuating societal biases, based on correlation without direct training data analysis

## Next Checks
1. Expand profession analysis to include additional sectors and validate selection criteria for profession inclusion
2. Conduct expert cultural consultation to verify interpretations of traditional Saudi dress codes and professional settings
3. Analyze actual training datasets of AI models to establish direct links between training data composition and output biases
