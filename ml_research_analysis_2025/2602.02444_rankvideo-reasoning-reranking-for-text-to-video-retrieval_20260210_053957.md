- Improves nDCG@10 by 31% on MultiVENT 2.0 vs text-only and vision-language rerankers

## Executive Summary
RANKVIDEO introduces a video-native reasoning reranker that improves text-to-video retrieval by using video content to assess relevance. It employs a two-stage curriculum: perception-grounded supervised fine-tuning followed by reranking training with combined pointwise, pairwise, and teacher confidence distillation objectives. A data synthesis pipeline creates reasoning-intensive query-video pairs. On MultiVENT 2.0, RANKVIDEO achieves 31% average nDCG@10 improvement over alternatives while being more efficient through adaptive reasoning allocation.

## Method Summary
RANKVIDEO uses a two-stage training approach with QWEN3-VL-8B-INSTRUCT as base model. Stage 1 applies perception-grounded SFT on captioning tasks (9,267 samples, 2 FPS, max 32 frames) to establish visual grounding. Stage 2 performs ranking finetuning with a combined loss function (pairwise, pointwise, distillation) on 7,995 queries/23,985 videos. The model scores query-video pairs using logit delta (yes-no) without generating reasoning traces. Hard negative mining partitions candidates using teacher model judgments, retaining ambiguous negatives for reranking error focus. Inference uses logit delta scoring at the answer token position.

## Key Results
- Achieves 31% average nDCG@10 improvement on MultiVENT 2.0 over text-only and vision-language rerankers
- Demonstrates consistent gains across diverse first-stage retrievers (OmniEmbed, CLIP, LanguageBind)
- Shows effectiveness in retrieval-augmented generation settings
- Improves efficiency by engaging in deeper reasoning only when necessary

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Separating perception training from ranking training improves multimodal reranking stability and effectiveness. Stage 1 trains the model to generate grounded video captions, forcing it to attend to discriminative visual content. This creates a perception-grounded initialization before applying ranking-specific supervision in Stage 2. Core assumption: Dense captioning supervision provides better grounding signals than binary relevance alone for learning video representations.

### Mechanism 2
Logit delta scoring (ℓ_yes − ℓ_no) provides a monotonic relevance signal without generating reasoning traces, improving efficiency. Rather than decoding long rationales, the model computes a scalar score from logits at the decision token position. This enables fast scoring while preserving ranking quality. Core assumption: The model's internal confidence at the yes/no decision point correlates with true relevance ranking.

### Mechanism 3
Hard negative mining with teacher confidence filtering reduces false negative contamination and focuses learning on the reranking error regime. Non-positive candidates are partitioned using a teacher model's binary judgment and confidence margin. Suspected positives (high teacher confidence they're relevant) are dropped; trusted negatives (high confidence they're irrelevant) and ambiguous hard negatives are retained. Core assumption: The teacher model provides sufficiently accurate relevance judgments for filtering.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-encoder reranking architecture
  - Why needed here: RANKVIDEO operates as a cross-encoder that jointly processes query-video pairs, unlike bi-encoders used in first-stage retrieval.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why cross-encoders are more expressive but slower than bi-encoders?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation for calibration
  - Why needed here: The teacher probability distillation term transfers calibrated confidence beyond binary labels.
  - Quick check question: How does soft-label distillation differ from hard-label classification for ranking tasks?

- Concept: Pairwise vs. pointwise ranking objectives
  - Why needed here: The combined loss uses both—pairwise for ranking order, pointwise for calibration stability.
  - Quick check question: What failure mode might a purely pairwise objective have that pointwise helps address?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: First-stage retriever (e.g., OmniEmbed) → Top-1000 candidates → RANKVIDEO cross-encoder → Logit delta scorer → Reranked list

- Critical path:
  1. Ensure video preprocessing (2 FPS, max 32 frames) matches training configuration
  2. Verify yes/no token positions in your tokenizer align with the model's decision layer
  3. Apply logit delta scoring at inference—do not generate text

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frame rate vs. compute: 2 FPS with 32 frames was chosen for training feasibility; lower rates may miss temporal cues
  - Teacher distillation weight (λ_teacher=5) balances calibration vs. ranking signal; tuning may be needed for different domains
  - Hard negative thresholds (α₁=-6, α₂=-8) were empirically set; may require adjustment for different first-stage retrievers

- Failure signatures:
  - High false positive rate at early ranks: Check if hard negatives are too easy; re-examine negative mining thresholds
  - Score distribution collapse (all scores near zero): Pointwise loss weight may be too low; increase λ_pt
  - Poor performance on non-visual queries (e.g., "opinion rigging scandal"): Expected—model relies on visually anchorable content

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Stage 1→Stage 2 training on a small data subset; validate that score separation increases (Figure 3 pattern)
  2. Ablate each loss term (pairwise, pointwise, distillation) and measure nDCG@10 impact; compare to Table 7
  3. Test on different first-stage retrievers (CLIP, LanguageBind) to confirm cross-retriever generalization per Table 2

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance primarily evaluated on English-language queries with visually grounded content, limiting applicability to non-English or highly abstract queries
- Hard negative mining approach relies heavily on teacher model judgments, which may propagate systematic biases
- Data synthesis pipeline may introduce distribution shift between synthetic and real user queries

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- 31% nDCG@10 improvement on MultiVENT 2.0 is well-supported by experimental results
- Two-stage curriculum shows consistent gains across different first-stage retrievers
- Logit delta scoring provides efficiency benefits without sacrificing ranking quality

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Adaptive reasoning allocation is supported by efficiency metrics but needs more direct measurement
- Effectiveness in retrieval-augmented generation settings is demonstrated but not extensively explored

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Generalization to "diverse first-stage retrievers" based on only two additional retrievers
- Efficiency claims relative to CLIP-based baselines may not hold against other efficient vision-language models

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate on non-English and abstract queries from other benchmarks to assess performance beyond visually grounded English content. Measure performance degradation and identify query characteristics that trigger reasoning engagement.

2. **Teacher Model Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary teacher model confidence thresholds and evaluate impact on ranking performance. Compare results using different teacher architectures to quantify sensitivity to teacher model choice.

3. **Real vs. Synthetic Query Distribution Shift**: Conduct controlled experiment comparing performance on synthetically generated training queries versus naturally occurring queries. Measure performance gap and identify specific query characteristics where synthetic training underperforms.
