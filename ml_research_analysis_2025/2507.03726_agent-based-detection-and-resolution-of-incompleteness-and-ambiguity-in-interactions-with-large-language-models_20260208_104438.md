core_contribution: This paper proposes an agent-based approach to automatically detect
  and resolve incomplete or ambiguous questions in interactions with large language
  models (LLMs). The authors implement a question-transducer using LLM-based agents
  that classify questions as incomplete, ambiguous, or normal, then resolve identified

# Agent-Based Detection and Resolution of Incompleteness and Ambiguity in Interactions with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.03726
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03726
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM-based agent approach improves answer accuracy by 3-40% on incomplete/ambiguous questions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an agent-based system for automatically detecting and resolving incomplete or ambiguous questions before they reach large language models (LLMs). The approach uses a question-transducer with LLM-based agents that classify questions into three categories - incomplete, ambiguous, or normal - and then resolve identified deficiencies through targeted follow-up questions. Tested across six datasets with varying levels of question incompleteness and ambiguity, the system demonstrates significant accuracy improvements compared to direct LLM responses, particularly for questions that lack sufficient context or contain multiple interpretations.

## Method Summary
The authors implement a question-transducer system that acts as an intermediary between users and LLMs. When a question is received, LLM-based agents first classify it as incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. For incomplete questions lacking context, the system generates clarifying questions to gather missing information. For ambiguous questions with multiple interpretations, the system seeks disambiguation through targeted follow-ups. Once resolved, the complete and unambiguous question is forwarded to the LLM for answer generation. This approach maintains explainability throughout the interaction while reducing the overall conversation length compared to traditional back-and-forth exchanges.

## Key Results
- Accuracy improvements of 3-40% compared to direct LLM responses across six test datasets
- Most significant gains in datasets with mid-to-high levels of incompleteness or ambiguity
- Minimal performance benefits when questions already contain sufficient context
- Reduced interaction length in many cases through targeted clarification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by intercepting questions before they reach the LLM and applying intelligent classification to identify deficiencies. LLM-based agents analyze the question structure and content to determine if additional information is needed. By resolving incompleteness and ambiguity through automated clarification before generating answers, the system ensures that the LLM receives well-formed queries that can be answered accurately. This pre-processing step reduces the likelihood of misinterpretation and eliminates the need for multiple back-and-forth exchanges that would otherwise occur when users manually clarify their questions.

## Foundational Learning

**Question Classification** - Categorizing questions as incomplete, ambiguous, or normal is essential for determining the appropriate resolution strategy. Quick check: Verify classification accuracy across diverse question types and domains.

**Context Resolution** - Identifying and gathering missing information to complete incomplete questions. Quick check: Measure the effectiveness of generated follow-up questions in obtaining necessary context.

**Ambiguity Resolution** - Determining multiple interpretations of ambiguous questions and selecting appropriate disambiguation strategies. Quick check: Evaluate whether disambiguated questions lead to more accurate answers.

**Explainable AI** - Providing transparent reasoning for classification and resolution decisions. Quick check: Assess user comprehension of generated explanations and their impact on trust.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Question -> Classification Agent -> Resolution Agent -> (Clarifying Questions) -> Answer Generation Agent -> LLM -> Answer Response

**Critical Path:** The sequence from question reception through classification, potential resolution, and answer generation represents the core workflow. Each step depends on successful completion of the previous one.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades additional LLM invocations for improved accuracy and reduced overall interaction length. While each question may require multiple LLM calls, the total conversation length often decreases compared to manual clarification processes.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor classification accuracy can lead to inappropriate resolution strategies. Over-aggressive clarification may frustrate users with straightforward questions. Resolution failures occur when follow-up questions don't effectively gather needed context.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test classification accuracy across diverse question types and domains, 2) Measure response time impact of additional LLM invocations, 3) Compare user satisfaction between direct LLM responses and agent-mediated interactions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Performance gains are dataset-dependent, with minimal benefits for well-formed questions
- Additional LLM invocations introduce latency that wasn't quantified for user experience impact
- Explainable resolutions weren't systematically evaluated for quality or user utility
- Results rely on synthetically constructed test cases rather than real-world conversational data

## Confidence

**Performance improvement metrics (High):** Empirical results across multiple datasets support accuracy gains, though baseline performance varies considerably between datasets.

**Explainability benefits (Medium):** While explanations are generated, their quality and usefulness to end-users wasn't rigorously assessed through user studies.

**Latency and invocation costs (Low):** The paper acknowledges additional LLM calls but doesn't quantify practical impact on response times or user experience.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user studies measuring whether explainable resolutions actually improve user understanding and satisfaction compared to direct answers
2. Test the approach on real-world conversational datasets with natural incompleteness rather than synthetically constructed test cases
3. Measure end-to-end latency including all LLM invocations and compare against user tolerance thresholds for conversational interactions
