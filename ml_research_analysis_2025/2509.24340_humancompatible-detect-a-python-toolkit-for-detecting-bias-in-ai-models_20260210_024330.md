# humancompatible.detect: a Python Toolkit for Detecting Bias in AI Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.24340
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24340
- **Reference count**: 39
- **Primary result**: Introduces humancompatible.detect, a Python toolkit for detecting bias in AI models using MSD and subsampled ℓ∞ distances

## Executive Summary
This paper presents humancompatible.detect, a Python toolkit designed to detect bias in AI models, particularly addressing the challenge of intersectional bias across multiple protected attributes. The toolkit introduces two novel methods - maximum subgroup discrepancy (MSD) and subsampled ℓ∞ distances - to enable efficient bias detection even with limited data samples. The toolkit provides an easy-to-use API with multiple input options and supports both bias detection and evaluation tasks.

## Method Summary
The toolkit addresses scalability and computability issues in traditional fairness evaluation by implementing two key methods. The MSD method identifies the most biased subgroup by maximizing probability differences between distributions across all possible subgroup intersections. The subsampled ℓ∞ approach tests whether bias exceeds specified thresholds through approximation sampling. The toolkit supports multiple input formats including in-memory tables, CSV files, and two-sample comparisons, making it accessible for various use cases in bias detection and evaluation.

## Key Results
- Successfully identifies intersectional bias missed by marginal fairness checks alone
- Demonstrates linear sample complexity in the number of protected attributes for practical dataset sizes
- Provides guaranteed optimal solutions for MSD method under discrete protected attributes
- Enables efficient bias detection with limited data samples through subsampled ℓ∞ approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The toolkit works by combining two complementary approaches to bias detection. The MSD method systematically searches through all possible subgroup intersections to find the maximum discrepancy between protected groups, while the subsampled ℓ∞ method provides a computationally efficient approximation for threshold-based bias detection. Together, these methods address both the computational complexity and scalability challenges inherent in traditional fairness evaluation metrics.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Intersectional bias**: Bias that occurs at the intersection of multiple protected attributes (why needed: traditional methods often miss these complex interactions; quick check: compare results across individual vs. combined attribute groups)
2. **Maximum subgroup discrepancy**: A method that finds the most biased subgroup by maximizing probability differences (why needed: identifies worst-case bias scenarios; quick check: verify the identified subgroup has maximum statistical distance)
3. **Subsampled ℓ∞ distances**: Approximation technique for efficient threshold-based bias detection (why needed: reduces computational complexity for large datasets; quick check: measure approximation error against exact calculations)
4. **Discrete protected attributes**: Assumption that protected attributes have finite, countable values (why needed: enables exact subgroup enumeration; quick check: confirm all attributes meet this requirement)
5. **Linear sample complexity**: Relationship between sample size and number of protected attributes (why needed: ensures scalability; quick check: plot sample complexity against attribute count)

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Input -> Preprocessing -> MSD/Subsampling Module -> Results Output

**Critical Path**: Data ingestion → Attribute discretization → Subgroup enumeration → Maximum discrepancy calculation → Result generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Exact MSD calculation guarantees optimal solutions but may be computationally expensive for large attribute sets, while subsampled ℓ∞ provides faster results at the cost of approximation accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on continuous attributes, missed bias patterns in high-dimensional spaces, false negatives in subsampled ℓ∞ approach near threshold boundaries.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test toolkit on synthetic datasets with known intersectional bias patterns
2. Compare MSD results against traditional marginal fairness metrics
3. Evaluate subsampled ℓ∞ accuracy by comparing against exact calculations at various sample sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- MSD method optimality is constrained by assumptions of discrete protected attributes and known subgroup boundaries
- Subsampled ℓ∞ approach may miss subtle bias patterns near threshold boundaries with unknown false negative rates
- Experimental validation primarily on synthetic datasets with limited real-world production data testing
- Linear sample complexity claims demonstrated only on practical sizes, not theoretically proven for arbitrary dimensions

## Confidence
- MSD method optimality and mathematical foundation: High
- Linear sample complexity claims: Medium
- Real-world effectiveness and robustness: Medium
- Subsampled ℓ∞ approximation accuracy: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the toolkit on production datasets with known bias patterns to evaluate real-world detection accuracy
2. Measure false negative rates of the subsampled ℓ∞ approach across varying threshold values and sample sizes
3. Conduct user studies with ML practitioners to assess the toolkit's usability and interpretability of results
