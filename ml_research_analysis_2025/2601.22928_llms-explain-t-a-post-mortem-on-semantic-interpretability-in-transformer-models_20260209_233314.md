# LLMs Explain't: A Post-Mortem on Semantic Interpretability in Transformer Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.22928
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22928
- **Reference count:** 34
- **Primary result:** Two widely-used interpretability methods for LLMs (attention analysis and embedding-based property inference) fail to reveal genuine semantic understanding, instead producing convincing but misleading artifacts.

## Executive Summary
This paper critically examines two standard approaches for interpreting Large Language Models: attention-based relational explanations and embedding-based property inference. The authors attempted to detect linguistic abstraction in BERT models using these established techniques but discovered fundamental flaws in both methods. Attention-based analyses fail because deeper layer representations no longer correspond to individual tokens, making inferred relations artifacts of residual mixing rather than genuine semantic operations. Embedding-based property inference produces high predictive scores not because embeddings encode semantic knowledge, but due to methodological artifacts and dataset structure - even random features yield strong results. The core lesson is that interpretability methods can create convincing outputs without revealing actual understanding, necessitating explicit assumption-testing in interpretability work.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted systematic experiments on BERT-base and BERT-large models, examining both attention mechanisms and embedding-based property inference. For attention analysis, they traced residual streams to observe how token representations evolve across layers and tested whether attention patterns persisted when semantic content was destroyed through shuffling. For embedding analysis, they trained predictive models to infer semantic features from embeddings using established feature norms, comparing performance on original versus shuffled data to identify methodological artifacts. The experiments included control conditions and perturbation tests to validate interpretability claims.

## Key Results
- Attention-based relational explanations fail because later-layer representations no longer correspond to individual tokens, making inferred relations artifacts rather than genuine model-internal structure
- Embedding-based property inference produces high predictive scores driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure, with even random or corrupted features yielding strong results
- Visual plausibility of attention maps is not evidence of mechanistic relevance, as structured patterns persist even when semantic content is destroyed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Residual Token Dissolution
- **Claim:** Attention-based explanations fail because the assumption that later-layer hidden states correspond to individual input tokens is invalid.
- **Mechanism:** In Transformer architectures, the residual stream aggregates information from all prior layers via residual connections. The paper argues that this causes representations to "melt" together (Section IV.A). By mid-depth layers, a hidden vector at position $i$ is a composite mixture of the entire sequence context, making the attribution of a "relation" between token $i$ and token $j$ an artifact of residual mixing rather than a discrete semantic operation.
- **Core assumption:** The "Token Identity" assumption—that the hidden state at position $i$ in layer $L$ still represents the lexical token at input position $i$.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "later-layer representations no longer correspond to individual tokens."
  - [section IV.A]: "Residual-stream tracing showed that token representations rapidly become mixtures of multiple upstream positions."
- **Break condition:** This failure mechanism applies less to Layer 0 or Layer 1 attention heads where mixing is minimal, but dominates in mid-to-late layers.

### Mechanism 2: Sparsity-Induced Prediction Ceilings
- **Claim:** High predictive performance in embedding-based property inference (e.g., predicting semantic features from vectors) is driven by dataset geometry and sparsity rather than semantic understanding.
- **Mechanism:** Standard regression methods (like PLSR) and feature norms (like McRae/Buchanan) suffer from structural artifacts. The paper demonstrates that these methods effectively map "sparsity" or "distributional structure" rather than meaning. Because feature norms are sparse and structured, even random or shuffled feature matrices yield high predictive scores (high "upper bounds"), misleading researchers into believing semantic knowledge has been decoded.
- **Core assumption:** The "Prediction-as-Explanation" assumption—that successful prediction of a property from an embedding implies the embedding encodes that property.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure."
  - [section IV.B]: "shuffled feature matrices... reached nearly the same scores as the original system mapping."
  - [corpus]: The related work "Prediction is not Explanation" (Abdelhalim et al.) serves as the foundational evidence base for this mechanism.
- **Break condition:** The mechanism implies that interpretability methods relying solely on predictive accuracy (F1, Spearman's $\rho$) are insufficient without controlled ablations.

### Mechanism 3: The Visualization Fallacy (Perturbation Invariance)
- **Claim:** Visual plausibility of attention maps is not evidence of mechanistic relevance; structure persists even when semantic content is destroyed.
- **Mechanism:** Attention mechanisms often default to structural priors (e.g., attending to adjacent tokens or [CLS] tokens) or distribute attention broadly due to softmax normalization. The paper shows that shuffling embeddings or injecting noise—thereby destroying semantic relations—still results in "linguistically structured" visualizations. The visual pattern is an artifact of the architecture's processing flow, not the specific semantic content.
- **Core assumption:** Attention weights are direct indicators of information flow or relational importance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section IV.A]: "Shuffling token embeddings... produced attention visualizations that still appeared linguistically structured."
  - [corpus]: ULTra (Unveiling Latent Token Interpretability) attempts to address similar opacity but relies on latent patterns; this paper suggests such patterns may be structural defaults.
- **Break condition:** This critique targets "passive" visualization. It may not apply to methods that actively intervene (e.g., causal tracing or activation patching) to test the functional role of specific attention heads.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transformer Residual Stream**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand Mechanism 1. One must grasp that the hidden state $h_l$ is a function of $h_{l-1}$ plus the layer's output, meaning information accumulates and mixes non-linearly, dissolving strict token boundaries.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the hidden state at layer 12, position 5, only contain information about the 5th input token?

- **Concept: Probing Classifier Validity (vs. Causality)**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand Mechanism 2. It is crucial to distinguish between a probe *detecting* a pattern (correlation) and the model *using* that pattern (causation).
  - **Quick check question:** If a probe achieves 90% accuracy on a corrupted/shuffled dataset, does the model "know" the uncorrupted features?

- **Concept: Dataset Artifacts & Sparsity**
  - **Why needed here:** To interpret the "Upper-bound" results in Section IV.B. Understanding how low-rank structure in sparse matrices allows regressors to fit noise is key to seeing why the embedding results are flawed.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a regressor predict "random" features with high accuracy if the feature matrix is sparse?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** [Input] -> [Model] -> [Internal State Extraction] -> **[Assumption Check Module]** -> [Interpretation/Visualization]
- The paper effectively critiques pipelines that skip the bolded **[Assumption Check Module]**

- **Critical path:** The validation of interpretability claims rests on **Control Experiments** (Section III.B.7). Without running random/shuffled baselines and upper-bound analyses, no interpretability result should be trusted.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Visual Plausibility vs. Rigor:** Visual tools (BertViz) are intuitive but highly misleading (Section IV.A)
  - **Predictive Power vs. Explanatory Power:** High F1/Spearman scores are easy to achieve via artifacts (Section IV.B); true semantic decoding is harder to verify

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Attention:** High attention weights between tokens that have no semantic relation (due to residual mixing)
  - **Embeddings:** Predictive scores on "System" mapping that are nearly identical to "Shuffle" or "Random" baselines

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Token Identity Trace:** Calculate cosine similarity between a token's hidden state at layer $L$ and its input embedding. Observe the drop-off (Section IV.A)
  2. **Sanity Check / Shuffle Test:** Train the property inference probe on the original feature set and a shuffled version. If scores are comparable, the method is invalid (Section IV.B)
  3. **Perturbation Stress Test:** Pass corrupted/noisy input through the model and generate attention visualizations. Check if "meaningful" patterns persist despite destroyed semantics (Section IV.A)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What representational unit effectively replaces individual tokens for analyzing deep transformer layers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors find that "representations in deeper layers no longer correspond cleanly to individual tokens" due to residual mixing, rendering token-level attention analysis invalid.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the failure of the "token continuity assumption" but does not propose an alternative structural mapping for deep layers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Identification of a stable semantic unit (e.g., phrase or concept vectors) that persists through non-linear transformations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can probing metrics distinguish genuine semantic encoding from structural dataset artifacts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors show that high predictive scores in property inference are driven by sparsity and geometry, persisting even with corrupted or shuffled features.
- Why unresolved: Standard metrics like F1@10 and Spearman's $\rho$ failed to differentiate between meaningful semantic content and random noise.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of evaluation metrics that yield chance-level performance on shuffled data while retaining sensitivity to valid semantic features.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can interpretability methods be designed to remain robust against the perturbation tests that invalidated attention and embedding analyses?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The conclusion calls for "mechanism-aware interpretability work" because current methods produced convincing outputs that failed under assumption-testing.
- Why unresolved: The paper functions as a post-mortem identifying failure modes rather than proposing a solution that passes such stress tests.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new interpretability pipeline that maintains validity when subjected to the specific ablation and control experiments detailed in the study.

## Limitations
- Experiments focus on BERT-base and BERT-large, raising questions about generalizability to decoder-only or encoder-decoder architectures
- Attention analysis relies primarily on qualitative visualization rather than rigorous quantitative metrics
- The paper assumes McRae et al.'s feature norms as ground truth, which may have inherent limitations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The finding that attention visualizations remain structured even with shuffled embeddings is well-supported by experimental evidence
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that predictive accuracy primarily reflects dataset artifacts is strongly supported but could benefit from additional control experiments
- **Low Confidence:** The broader claim that all current attention-based and embedding-based interpretability methods are fundamentally flawed requires more extensive validation across diverse model families

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Architecture Validation:** Test the same interpretability methods on GPT-style models and encoder-decoder architectures to determine if residual token dissolution and sparsity artifacts are universal phenomena across transformer variants
2. **Intervention-Based Analysis:** Move beyond passive visualization to implement causal intervention experiments (activation patching, ablation studies) to verify whether attention weights actually influence model predictions in ways that correlate with semantic relationships
3. **Alternative Embedding Probing:** Evaluate whether modern embedding interpretation methods like SVCCA or CKA are similarly susceptible to dataset artifacts, or whether they provide more robust semantic interpretation signals
