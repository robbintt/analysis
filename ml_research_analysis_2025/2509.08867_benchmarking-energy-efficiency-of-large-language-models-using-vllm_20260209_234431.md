# Benchmarking Energy Efficiency of Large Language Models Using vLLM
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.08867
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08867
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: vLLM benchmark shows energy per request decreases with concurrent requests, plateauing at 100 simultaneous requests

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the LLM Efficiency Benchmark to evaluate energy efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) under realistic deployment conditions using vLLM, a high-performance serving backend. The benchmark measures GPU energy consumption per request across various model sizes (70M-6.9B parameters) and architectures (Pythia, Dolly, BLOOM, RedPajama). Results show that energy consumption per request decreases with higher concurrent request volumes, reaching a plateau at 100 simultaneous requests. The study highlights that vLLM's optimizations may minimize architectural differences in energy efficiency, suggesting that modern serving solutions are crucial for accurate energy efficiency assessments.

## Method Summary
The LLM Efficiency Benchmark evaluates energy efficiency by measuring GPU energy consumption per request across different model sizes and architectures using vLLM as the serving backend. The study systematically varies concurrent request volumes to assess their impact on energy efficiency, testing models ranging from 70M to 6.9B parameters across multiple architectures. Energy measurements are taken under realistic deployment conditions to provide practical insights into LLM energy consumption patterns.

## Key Results
- Energy consumption per request decreases with higher concurrent request volumes, plateauing at 100 simultaneous requests
- There is a close-to-linear relationship between model parameter size and energy consumption when comparing models of the same architecture
- No significant differences in energy efficiency were observed between different architectures of comparable size

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark demonstrates that vLLM's optimizations effectively reduce energy consumption per request as concurrent request volumes increase, likely through improved resource utilization and batching efficiencies. The lack of significant architectural differences in energy efficiency suggests that modern serving backends like vLLM may standardize energy consumption patterns across different model architectures, making the choice of serving solution more critical than inherent architectural differences for energy efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- GPU Energy Measurement: Understanding how to accurately measure GPU energy consumption is essential for benchmarking - quick check: verify measurement tools capture real-time power draw
- Concurrent Request Scaling: Knowledge of how concurrent requests affect resource utilization and energy efficiency - quick check: test with varying request loads to identify optimization thresholds
- Model Architecture Impact: Understanding the relationship between model size, architecture, and energy consumption - quick check: compare models of different sizes within the same architecture

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: LLM -> vLLM Backend -> GPU -> Energy Measurement
- Critical Path: Request Processing -> Model Inference -> GPU Computation -> Energy Consumption
- Design Tradeoffs: The study prioritizes realistic deployment conditions over controlled laboratory measurements, potentially sacrificing some measurement precision for practical relevance
- Failure Signatures: Inaccurate energy measurements may occur if GPU power states change during measurement or if concurrent request handling is not properly synchronized
- First Experiments: 1) Test single request energy consumption baseline, 2) Gradually increase concurrent requests to identify optimization threshold, 3) Compare energy consumption across different model architectures of similar size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on vLLM as serving backend may underrepresent inherent architectural differences in energy efficiency
- Benchmark only considers energy consumption per request without accounting for total system energy including CPU, memory, and storage
- Limited parameter range (70M-6.9B) and specific model architectures may not represent full spectrum of LLM deployments

## Confidence
- LLM Efficiency Benchmark Validity: Medium - The benchmark methodology appears sound for measuring energy per request under specific conditions, but the exclusive use of vLLM as backend limits architectural comparison validity
- Energy Consumption Scaling: High - The observed relationship between parameter size and energy consumption within architectures shows clear patterns, supported by multiple model comparisons
- Concurrent Request Impact: High - The systematic observation that energy per request decreases with concurrent requests up to 100 is well-supported by the data across multiple model sizes

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the benchmark using multiple serving backends (not just vLLM) to determine if observed architectural efficiency differences persist without vLLM's optimizations
2. Extend testing to include extreme parameter sizes (both smaller and larger than tested range) and additional architectures to verify scaling relationships hold across the full LLM spectrum
3. Conduct measurements on edge hardware platforms with different power profiles and thermal constraints to assess how concurrent request optimization strategies translate to resource-constrained environments
