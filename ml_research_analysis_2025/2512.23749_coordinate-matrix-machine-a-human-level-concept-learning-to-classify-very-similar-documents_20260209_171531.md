# Coordinate Matrix Machine: A Human-level Concept Learning to Classify Very Similar Documents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23749
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23749
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Achieves 100% accuracy on bank statement classification with only 53 training samples (one per class) using spatial keyword coordinates

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Coordinate Matrix Machine (CM2), a novel approach to one-shot document classification that leverages spatial keyword positions rather than semantic content. By extracting OCR coordinates of predefined keywords and computing Manhattan distances between their positions, CM2 achieves perfect classification accuracy on highly similar bank statement templates with minimal training data. The method demonstrates significant advantages over traditional vectorizers and deep learning models in terms of computational efficiency, interpretability, and sample efficiency, particularly for structurally similar documents where traditional methods struggle to distinguish between classes.

## Method Summary
CM2 preprocesses PDFs to 300 DPI, extracts word coordinates via OCR to XML, and uses manually defined CSV key-value pairs per document class. The core algorithm builds a coordinate matrix of (document_id, keyword, top, left) tuples, then classifies test documents by computing mean Manhattan distances between keyword positions across classes, capped by a maximum penalty threshold (θ=200 pixels optimal). Classification returns the class with minimum mean distance. The method requires only one training sample per class and operates entirely on CPU, making it computationally efficient and inherently explainable through its geometric decision process.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% accuracy on bank statement classification across 53 templates with only 53 training samples
- Outperformed traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models across various classifiers and vectorization methods
- Demonstrated Green AI advantages with CPU-only optimization and minimal computational resources
- Showed robustness against unbalanced classes and inherent explainability through spatial reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Spatial coordinates of keywords provide stronger class-discriminative signal than term frequency for structurally similar documents.
- Mechanism: CM2 extracts (top, left) pixel coordinates of keywords from OCR output, building a matrix where position—not just occurrence—defines class membership. Manhattan distance aggregates positional deviation across keywords.
- Core assumption: Documents within a template class share consistent keyword placement; between-class variation in coordinate space exceeds within-class variation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CM2 uses a coordinate matrix approach where it identifies keywords and their spatial positions in documents, then computes Manhattan distances between these positions to determine similarity."
  - [section 3.2] Algorithm 1 formally constructs ⟨ti, ki_j, xij, yij⟩ tuples for each keyword per document.
  - [corpus] Weak—neighbor papers focus on matrix eigenvalues and attention dynamics, not spatial document layout.
- Break condition: If documents within a class exhibit high coordinate variance (e.g., variable-length tables, dynamic layouts), the mean distance aggregation may conflate classes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: One-sample-per-class learning succeeds when structural features are manually curated as "important."
- Mechanism: A human selects keywords via CSV key-value pairs (Example 3.1). The algorithm requires no weight updates—classification is nearest-neighbor in coordinate space. This is "lazy learning" (Section 1.2).
- Core assumption: The selected keywords are both necessary and sufficient for discrimination; omitted keywords are irrelevant or noisy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "With only 53 training samples, CM2 achieved 100% accuracy on bank statement classification across 53 templates."
  - [section 1.2] "Only one sample per template is sufficient, and we should consider not only the content but also the locations of specific words."
  - [corpus] No direct corroboration—Lake et al. [1] (cited) addresses one-shot character recognition, not document layout.
- Break condition: If keyword selection is incomplete or template-defining features are non-keyword (e.g., logos, borders, fonts), accuracy degrades. The paper does not test automated keyword discovery.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Maximum penalty threshold provides robustness against OCR noise and minor layout shifts.
- Mechanism: When a keyword is missing or its distance exceeds θ (maximum penalty), the algorithm substitutes θ rather than the raw distance. This caps outlier influence on the mean similarity score.
- Core assumption: Large coordinate deviations indicate missing or misidentified keywords, not legitimate class variation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] Definition 3.1 formally defines maximum penalty; Algorithm 2 implements the clipping logic.
  - [section 5, Figure 3] Parameter sensitivity shows 100% F-measure at θ=200 on the bank statement dataset.
  - [corpus] No external validation of this thresholding mechanism.
- Break condition: If θ is set too low, legitimate matches are rejected; if too high, distant keywords incorrectly contribute to similarity. The paper recommends estimating θ from document resolution (~10% of width), but this is heuristic.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Lazy Learning (Instance-Based Learning)**
  - Why needed here: CM2 stores training samples verbatim and defers computation to inference time. Understanding this clarifies why "no training" is possible.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why k-NN requires no explicit training phase?

- Concept: **Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm)**
  - Why needed here: The paper selects L1 over L2 (Euclidean) because document scanning introduces horizontal/vertical shifts, not diagonal ones.
  - Quick check question: Given points (100, 200) and (110, 210), compute both Manhattan and Euclidean distances. Which is larger?

- Concept: **OCR Coordinate Extraction**
  - Why needed here: The input pipeline depends on converting PDFs to XML with word-level (x, y) coordinates. OCR quality directly bounds system accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What failure modes might cause OCR to report incorrect coordinates for a keyword?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. **Preprocessing**: PDF → 300dpi normalization → OCR → XML (words + coordinates)
  2. **Keyword Definition**: Manual CSV per class specifying key-value pairs to extract
  3. **Coordinate Matrix Builder**: Algorithm 1 produces CM = ⟨doc_id, keyword, top, left⟩
  4. **Classifier**: Algorithm 2 computes per-keyword distances, clips at θ, averages, returns argmin class

- Critical path: OCR quality → keyword coordinate accuracy → distance computation → classification. Any drift in OCR coordinates propagates directly to similarity scores.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Interpretability vs. automation**: Manual keyword selection yields glass-box decisions but requires domain expertise per template class.
  - **Robustness vs. precision**: Higher θ tolerates OCR noise but risks false matches; lower θ is strict but brittle.
  - **CPU efficiency vs. semantic richness**: Static embeddings (GloVe) are fast but omit context; transformers capture semantics but violate Green AI constraints.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Low accuracy on new templates**: Likely missing keywords in CSV or template has no discriminative keywords.
  - **All predictions same class**: θ may be too high, flattening distance differences.
  - **High variance across runs**: OCR inconsistency—check DPI normalization and scanner quality.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Run CM2 on the provided bank statement dataset with θ=200. Verify 100% F-measure. If not achieved, audit OCR XML outputs for coordinate drift.
  2. **Ablation on θ**: Sweep θ ∈ {50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500}. Plot F-measure. Confirm the paper's claim of peak at 200 and degradation beyond 250.
  3. **Domain transfer test**: Apply CM2 to a different structured document class (e.g., invoices, receipts). Manually define keywords. Report samples required to reach >90% accuracy. This tests generalization beyond bank statements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can CM2 be adapted for broader multi-modal contexts without losing its computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states future work will "explore the application of CM2 in broader multi-modal contexts."
- Why unresolved: The current architecture relies heavily on spatial coordinates derived from text (OCR), and it is unclear how visual or non-textual data would be integrated into the coordinate matrix.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified CM2 framework tested on datasets containing mixed text and image data, demonstrating retention of "Green AI" efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the keyword selection process be automated to remove the dependency on subject-matter expert inputs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The methodology states that each XML file is accompanied by a CSV file containing key-value pairs, implying manual definition of structural features by an expert.
- Why unresolved: The paper asserts the method requires "minimal data," but does not quantify the human effort required to define the keywords for the coordinate matrix for new document classes.
- What evidence would resolve it: An automated keyword extraction step that identifies structural markers without prior human labeling, achieving comparable accuracy to the manual CSV method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is CM2 against semantic variations where keywords appear as synonyms rather than exact string matches?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Algorithm 1 (`GetCoordinates`) relies on exact string matching (`if k ∈ D`), which fails if different templates use different terms (e.g., "Account No" vs "Acct #") to denote the same structural element.
- Why unresolved: The bank statements tested likely used standardized terminology, but real-world "very similar documents" often use synonymous terminology that preserves structure but alters text.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics on a dataset where key structural terms vary semantically but maintain spatial consistency.

## Limitations

- The keyword selection process remains entirely manual and domain-specific, requiring expert input for each new document class
- Success on bank statements may not generalize to documents with high within-class coordinate variance (e.g., variable-length tables or dynamic layouts)
- The 100% accuracy claim is demonstrated on a single dataset; performance on other structured document types remains unverified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The coordinate matrix approach and Manhattan distance computation are clearly specified and reproducible. The one-shot learning mechanism (storing training samples and deferring computation to inference) is well-established in lazy learning literature.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that spatial coordinates provide stronger discriminative signal than term frequency for similar documents is plausible but lacks comparative analysis against traditional layout-aware methods. The paper does not test whether OCR coordinates alone (without keywords) would suffice.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that CM2 achieves "human-level" concept learning is unsupported. The paper does not define or measure what constitutes "human-level" performance, nor does it compare against human classification baselines on the same task.

## Next Checks

1. **Automated keyword discovery test**: Implement an unsupervised keyword extraction method (e.g., TF-IDF or keyBERT) to automatically identify potential discriminative keywords. Compare CM2's accuracy using manual vs. automatic keyword selection on the same bank statement dataset.

2. **Cross-domain generalization study**: Apply CM2 to at least two additional structured document types (e.g., invoices and medical forms) with varying layouts. Document the samples required to achieve >90% accuracy and identify failure modes when keyword selection is incomplete.

3. **OCR robustness evaluation**: Systematically degrade OCR quality (via image compression, noise addition, or font variation) and measure CM2's accuracy degradation. Determine the threshold at which coordinate drift causes classification failure, validating the max_penalty mechanism's effectiveness.
