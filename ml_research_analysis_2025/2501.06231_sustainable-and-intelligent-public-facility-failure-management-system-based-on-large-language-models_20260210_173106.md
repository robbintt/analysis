# Sustainable and Intelligent Public Facility Failure Management System Based on Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06231
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06231
- Authors: Siguo Bi; Jilong Zhang; Wei Ni
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM-based framework successfully identifies and predicts device failures in library prototype testing

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Smart Device Management framework to address challenges in managing intelligent devices in public facilities, with a focus on libraries. The framework leverages LLMs to analyze and predict device failures, enhancing operational efficiency and reliability through prototype validation in real-world library settings. The core innovation involves integrating heterogeneous data from multi-source devices using LLMs to provide fault identification and prevention strategies.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates heterogeneous data (logs, text, images, video) from multiple smart devices through unified semantic representation using LLMs. It employs local knowledge extraction from device manuals to enhance failure prevention recommendations and uses locally deployed LLMs (Llama 3.2-Vision) for privacy-preserving processing. The system processes four types of user queries: device availability inquiry, fault queries, fault cause diagnosis, and comprehensive assessment.

## Key Results
- Successfully implemented LLM-based framework in library prototype testing
- Demonstrated effective semantic integration of heterogeneous device data for failure analysis
- Validated local LLM deployment for privacy-preserving facility management

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can semantically integrate heterogeneous data from multi-source smart devices to enable unified failure analysis.
- Mechanism: The framework uploads heterogeneous data (tables, text logs, images, video) to a central system where an LLM performs "unified semantic representation" and fusion. Timestamps from surveillance images are recognized and correlated with log timestamps to verify data fusion effectiveness.
- Core assumption: LLMs can reliably extract semantically meaningful information from diverse modalities and align them temporally without significant information loss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "integrating heterogeneous data from multi-source devices using LLMs to provide fault identification"
  - [section 3] "heterogeneous data from multi-source intelligent devices is centrally uploaded and undergoes integration and fusion through a unified semantic approach"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers on facility management do not address LLM-based semantic fusion for IoT failure analysis.
- Break condition: If device data formats change without schema updates, or if timestamp synchronization drifts across devices, the semantic fusion may produce misaligned correlations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Local knowledge extraction from product manuals enhances LLM failure prevention recommendations with device-specific guidance.
- Mechanism: Safety instructions and troubleshooting sections from device manuals are extracted and structured into a local knowledge base. The LLM combines this localized expertise with its general knowledge to provide "standardized and professional fault-handling suggestions."
- Core assumption: Product manuals contain sufficient implicit failure prevention strategies that can be extracted and applied to real operational contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "provide fault identification and prevention strategies"
  - [section 4.3] "extracting failure or failure prevention schemes from the product manuals of smart devices has become a very promising approach"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for manual-to-knowledge-base extraction in facility management.
- Break condition: If manuals are incomplete, outdated, or use terminology inconsistent with operational logs, extracted knowledge may not transfer to real failure scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Localized LLM deployment enables privacy-preserving failure management for public facilities handling sensitive audio/video data.
- Mechanism: The framework uses locally deployed LLMs (Llama 3.2-Vision) to process sensitive data on-premises, avoiding external data transmission. Audio and video processing leverages local RESTful web API services for semantic transformation.
- Core assumption: Local deployment infrastructure can support LLM inference workloads with acceptable latency for real-time monitoring needs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "Our LLM foundation is based on Llama 3.2-Vision"
  - [section 4.2] "constructed the capability of the LLM to recognize semantic text from video images into a RESTful local web API service"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence on local LLM deployment for public facility management.
- Break condition: If inference latency exceeds operational response requirements, or if local hardware cannot handle peak concurrent requests, the system may fail to provide timely failure alerts.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Semantic Data Fusion**
  - Why needed here: The framework's core value proposition depends on integrating log data, surveillance images, and audio into a coherent representation for failure analysis.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how timestamp alignment between video metadata and text logs enables cross-modal correlation?

- Concept: **Local vs. Cloud LLM Deployment Trade-offs**
  - Why needed here: Privacy requirements for public facilities (libraries) handling patron data necessitate understanding on-premise deployment constraints.
  - Quick check question: What are the minimum hardware requirements for running Llama 3.2-Vision inference with acceptable latency for real-time monitoring?

- Concept: **Knowledge Base Construction from Unstructured Documentation**
  - Why needed here: The framework's prevention strategy relies on extracting structured knowledge from product manuals, requiring understanding of document parsing and knowledge representation.
  - Quick check question: How would you validate that extracted troubleshooting steps from a manual correctly map to observed failure patterns?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects logs (text/tabular) from Self-service Machines, Silent Booths, Smart Bookshelves; captures images from Surveillance Cameras
  2. **Semantic Integration Layer**: LLM-based unified representation; RESTful API for multimodal semantic transformation
  3. **Local Knowledge Base**: Device manual extractions (safety precautions, troubleshooting guides)
  4. **Query Processing Layer**: Four workflow paths (availability inquiry, fault queries, cause diagnosis, comprehensive assessment)
  5. **Response Generation**: LLM synthesizes knowledge base + operational data for recommendations

- Critical path: Data ingestion → Timestamp synchronization → Semantic fusion → Knowledge base retrieval → LLM reasoning → User response. The timestamp correlation step (aligning surveillance image timestamps with log timestamps) is identified as the verification point for effective heterogeneous data fusion.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Local deployment ensures privacy but limits scalability and requires hardware investment
  - Manual-based knowledge provides device-specific accuracy but requires maintenance as device fleets evolve
  - Multimodal fusion increases diagnostic capability but adds complexity and failure points

- Failure signatures:
  - Mismatched timestamps between video and log data producing false correlations
  - Knowledge base returning irrelevant troubleshooting steps due to terminology gaps
  - Inference latency spikes during concurrent user queries causing timeout failures

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate timestamp correlation accuracy by comparing LLM-extracted video timestamps against known log timestamps across 50+ sample events.
  2. Test knowledge base retrieval quality by querying for specific failure modes and measuring precision of manual-extracted recommendations against expert-labeled ground truth.
  3. Measure inference latency under simulated concurrent load (5-10 simultaneous queries) to identify throughput bottlenecks in the local deployment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be effectively integrated with machine learning algorithms and IoT security protocols for real-time threat detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The abstract and conclusion state plans to "integrate it with cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies" and "machine learning algorithms for threat detection and response."
- Why unresolved: The current prototype focuses solely on failure management and maintenance using Llama 3.2-Vision, without implementing the proposed cybersecurity or automated threat mitigation layers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results from a revised framework that successfully detects and neutralizes simulated security threats in real-time.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the framework's performance differ when processing real-world noisy data compared to the manually generated synthetic data used in testing?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.1 states, "We have manually generated log data... as well as the synthetic image data," indicating the validation did not use live, noisy environmental data.
- Why unresolved: The prototype's success relies on idealized inputs; it is unclear if the semantic integration holds up against the "diversity and complexity" of real-world data described in the introduction.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study benchmarking failure identification accuracy using synthetic data versus live feeds from operational library devices.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the localized LLM deployment maintain real-time processing speeds when scaling to a facility-wide system with hundreds of heterogeneous devices?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The literature review notes that existing platforms "struggle with... scalability," and the experiment was limited to a simplified corridor scenario with a few devices.
- Why unresolved: While the paper proposes a localized solution for privacy, it does not analyze the computational latency or throughput required for a large-scale public facility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Latency metrics and hardware resource utilization statistics from a full-scale deployment involving high volumes of simultaneous multi-modal inputs.

## Limitations
- Multimodal fusion reliability lacks empirical validation for cross-modal timestamp alignment accuracy and semantic fusion error rates
- Manual-based knowledge extraction validation limited to single-device case studies without evidence of scalability across diverse device fleets
- Local deployment constraints not quantified in terms of inference latency or concurrent user capacity

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The conceptual framework for integrating heterogeneous data through LLMs is internally consistent and addresses real operational challenges in public facility management
- **Medium confidence**: The local deployment approach for privacy preservation is technically sound, though performance characteristics under load remain unvalidated
- **Low confidence**: Claims about semantic fusion accuracy and knowledge base effectiveness lack empirical validation beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations

## Next Checks
1. Validate timestamp correlation accuracy by comparing LLM-extracted video timestamps against known log timestamps across 50+ failure events
2. Evaluate manual-extracted troubleshooting recommendations against expert-labeled ground truth for 20+ failure scenarios across multiple device types
3. Characterize inference latency and throughput under concurrent load (5-10 simultaneous queries) using realistic hardware configurations
