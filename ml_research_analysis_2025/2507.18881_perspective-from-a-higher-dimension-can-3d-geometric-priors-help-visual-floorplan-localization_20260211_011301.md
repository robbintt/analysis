# Perspective from a Higher Dimension: Can 3D Geometric Priors Help Visual Floorplan Localization?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.18881
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18881
- Reference count: 40

- Primary result: 3D geometric priors improve visual floorplan localization by 4.1% to 33.1% over state-of-the-art

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc), which involves localizing RGB images within minimalist 2D floorplan representations. Existing methods struggle with the significant modal and geometric differences between visual data and floorplans, particularly due to repetitive structures and 3D object occlusions. The authors propose a novel approach that injects 3D geometric priors into the observation model to bridge this gap.

The proposed method enhances FLoc by incorporating two types of 3D geometric priors: Geometry-Constrained View Invariance (GCVI) and View-Scene Aligned Geometric (VSAG) priors. These priors are learned through self-supervised contrastive learning on RGB-D datasets without requiring additional annotations. The approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both Structured3D and Gibson datasets, demonstrating improvements ranging from 4.1% to 33.1% in success rates across various precision levels.

## Method Summary
The authors propose enhancing visual Floorplan Localization by injecting 3D geometric priors into the observation model. They introduce two types of priors: Geometry-Constrained View Invariance (GCVI) using multi-view constraints and View-Scene Aligned Geometric (VSAG) prior using surface reconstruction. Both priors are learned through self-supervised contrastive learning on RGB-D datasets, requiring no additional annotations. The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Structured3D and Gibson datasets, achieving improvements of +4.1% to +33.1% in success rates at various precision levels. The approach improves both single-frame and multi-frame FLoc performance.

## Key Results
- Significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on Structured3D and Gibson datasets
- Success rate improvements ranging from +4.1% to +33.1% at various precision levels
- No additional annotations required beyond RGB-D datasets
- Performance gains for both single-frame and multi-frame FLoc

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's mechanism relies on incorporating 3D geometric information to bridge the gap between RGB images and 2D floorplans. By using multi-view constraints and surface reconstruction, the method can better understand the spatial relationships and geometric structures that are lost when converting 3D scenes to 2D floorplans. This 3D understanding helps overcome challenges like repetitive structures and object occlusions that typically confuse FLoc algorithms.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: A self-supervised learning approach that learns representations by comparing similar and dissimilar samples. Why needed: To learn geometric priors without manual annotations. Quick check: Verify that positive/negative pairs are correctly formed in the training data.
- **Surface Reconstruction**: The process of creating a 3D surface model from depth data. Why needed: To generate the geometric prior (VSAG) that aligns views with floorplan structures. Quick check: Ensure reconstruction quality is sufficient for the task.
- **Multi-view Geometry**: Principles governing how 3D scenes project to multiple 2D views. Why needed: To establish geometric consistency across different viewpoints (GCVI). Quick check: Validate epipolar geometry constraints are satisfied.
- **Floorplan Localization**: The task of determining camera pose from images using floorplan maps. Why needed: This is the core problem being addressed. Quick check: Confirm localization accuracy metrics are properly computed.
- **Self-supervised Learning**: Learning without manual labels by leveraging inherent structure in data. Why needed: To learn geometric priors without expensive annotation. Quick check: Verify the self-supervision signals are meaningful.
- **3D-2D Alignment**: The process of relating 3D geometric information to 2D representations. Why needed: To connect the geometric priors with floorplan localization. Quick check: Test alignment accuracy on validation data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: RGB Images + Depth Data -> Multi-view Constraints -> GCVI Prior; RGB Images + Depth Data -> Surface Reconstruction -> VSAG Prior; Both Priors -> Contrastive Learning -> Enhanced FLoc Model

**Critical Path**: Depth data acquisition → Surface reconstruction → VSAG prior generation → Contrastive learning → Enhanced observation model → Floorplan localization

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (multi-view constraints and surface reconstruction) for improved localization accuracy. Self-supervised learning eliminates annotation costs but requires sufficient RGB-D data for effective training.

**Failure Signatures**: Localization failures may occur when: depth data is noisy or missing, surface reconstruction is inaccurate, geometric priors don't generalize to new environments, or the contrastive learning objective doesn't capture relevant geometric relationships.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate geometric prior quality by testing on scenes with known geometry
2. Compare single-frame vs. multi-frame performance with and without priors
3. Ablation study: test each prior (GCVI and VSAG) independently to measure individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance on real-world datasets beyond synthetic environments remains unclear
- Computational overhead of multi-view constraints and surface reconstruction not thoroughly analyzed
- Reliance on RGB-D datasets may limit generalizability to environments without depth data

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Mathematical formulation of GCVI and VSAG priors is sound with rigorous experimental methodology
- **Medium confidence**: Claimed improvements are significant but primarily validated on synthetic datasets
- **Medium confidence**: No additional annotations required is accurate but assumes access to RGB-D data for self-supervised learning

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method on real-world indoor datasets (e.g., Matterport3D) to assess performance in non-synthetic environments
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify computational overhead of multi-view constraints and surface reconstruction compared to baseline methods
3. Test robustness to varying levels of depth sensor noise and occlusion to understand practical deployment limits
