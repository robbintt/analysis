# Fine-Tuning Federated Learning-Based Intrusion Detection Systems for Transportation IoT

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.06099
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06099
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Hybrid server-edge federated learning reduces memory by 42% and training time by 75% while maintaining 99.2% accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of deploying intrusion detection systems in resource-constrained IoT environments like connected and autonomous vehicles, where computational and memory limitations on edge devices hinder traditional federated learning approaches. The authors propose a hybrid server-edge federated learning framework that offloads pre-training to a central server and performs lightweight fine-tuning on edge devices. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces memory consumption by up to 42% and decreases training time by up to 75% while maintaining competitive accuracy of up to 99.2%. The framework also demonstrates scalability, with minimal performance degradation as the number of clients increases.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework employs a hybrid federated learning approach that combines centralized pre-training with distributed fine-tuning. The central server performs initial model training using global data, then distributes the pre-trained model to edge devices. Edge devices conduct lightweight fine-tuning using local data before aggregating updates back to the server. This approach reduces the computational burden on resource-constrained edge devices while maintaining model accuracy. The framework is evaluated using NSL-KDD and BoT-IoT datasets, with experiments conducted across varying numbers of clients (up to 50) to assess scalability.

## Key Results
- Memory consumption reduced by up to 42% compared to traditional federated learning
- Training time decreased by up to 75% while maintaining accuracy
- Accuracy of up to 99.2% achieved across benchmark datasets
- Minimal performance degradation observed when scaling from 10 to 50 clients

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid server-edge approach works by leveraging the computational resources of a central server for the resource-intensive pre-training phase, while reserving edge devices for the less demanding fine-tuning process. By distributing pre-trained models to edge devices, the framework reduces the amount of computation required locally, making it feasible for resource-constrained IoT devices to participate in federated learning. The fine-tuning phase allows each edge device to adapt the global model to local data patterns while maintaining the core knowledge learned during pre-training.

## Foundational Learning
- Federated Learning: Distributed machine learning where multiple clients train a shared model while keeping data local - needed for privacy preservation in IoT networks, quick check: ensure clients can communicate with server without exposing raw data
- Resource-constrained IoT constraints: Limited computational power, memory, and energy - needed to understand why traditional FL fails, quick check: verify edge device specifications match real-world automotive IoT hardware
- Pre-training vs Fine-tuning: Pre-training builds general knowledge on large datasets, fine-tuning adapts to specific tasks - needed to justify hybrid approach, quick check: confirm pre-training reduces fine-tuning computational requirements by >50%
- Concept drift in IDS: Attack patterns evolve over time requiring model adaptation - needed to evaluate long-term effectiveness, quick check: test model performance across time-separated datasets

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Central Server -> Edge Devices -> Aggregation Server (cyclic communication pattern)
- Critical path: Pre-training → Model Distribution → Local Fine-tuning → Aggregation → Global Update
- Design tradeoffs: Centralized pre-training offers efficiency but creates single point of failure vs fully distributed approaches
- Failure signatures: Communication failures during aggregation, model divergence during fine-tuning, memory overflow on edge devices
- First experiments: 1) Baseline accuracy comparison with traditional FL, 2) Memory usage profiling across different edge device types, 3) Scalability testing with incremental client additions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on static benchmark datasets that may not reflect real-world connected vehicle dynamics
- Testing limited to 50 clients, with scalability to hundreds or thousands of vehicles unaddressed
- Assumes reliable central server availability, which may not hold in distributed vehicular networks with intermittent connectivity

## Confidence
- Memory and training efficiency improvements: High (supported by quantitative experimental data)
- Accuracy maintenance at 99.2%: Medium (based on benchmark datasets that may not reflect operational complexity)
- Scalability to larger client numbers: Medium (limited testing scope, real-world factors unaddressed)

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework with dynamic, real-world connected vehicle traffic datasets that include concept drift scenarios and evolving attack patterns
2. Evaluate performance with 100+ clients to assess scalability under realistic vehicular network conditions with varying connectivity
3. Conduct field tests in actual connected vehicle environments to validate memory and computational efficiency claims on production hardware
