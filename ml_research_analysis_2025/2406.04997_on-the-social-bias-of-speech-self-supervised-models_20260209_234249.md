# On the social bias of speech self-supervised models

## Quick Facts

- This study investigates social bias in self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, revealing that SSL representations amplify bias compared to traditional acoustic features like MFCC and spectrograms.

## Executive Summary
This research examines social bias propagation in self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, comparing their performance against traditional acoustic features. The study evaluates three prominent SSL models—HuBERT, Wav2Vec2, and MelHuBERT—across gender, age, and nationality bias dimensions. Key findings reveal that SSL representations amplify bias, with longer pretraining steps increasing bias levels. The research identifies architectural preferences for bias mitigation and tests various compression techniques as potential debiasing strategies.

## Method Summary
The study employs the SpEAT metric to quantify social bias across multiple dimensions in SSL speech models. Researchers compare SSL representations with traditional acoustic features (MFCC and spectrograms) and evaluate three major SSL architectures under varying conditions including pretraining duration, model size, and architectural depth. Compression techniques including weight-pruning, head-pruning, row-pruning, and distillation are systematically applied to assess their effectiveness in reducing social bias while maintaining model performance.

## Key Results
- SSL representations amplify bias compared to traditional acoustic features like MFCC and spectrograms
- Longer pretraining steps increase bias in SSL models
- Row-pruning effectively mitigates social bias, while weight-pruning, head-pruning, and distillation show limited effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The amplification of social bias in SSL speech models likely stems from the unsupervised learning process that captures patterns present in training data without explicit fairness constraints. As models undergo longer pretraining, they become more sensitive to subtle statistical correlations that may reflect societal biases. The architectural findings suggest that wider and shallower networks may distribute learning across more parameters, potentially diluting bias concentration compared to narrower, deeper architectures that create more specialized representations.

## Foundational Learning

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in Speech
Why needed: Understanding the fundamental differences between supervised and self-supervised approaches in speech processing
Quick check: SSL models learn representations from unlabeled data through pretext tasks like masked prediction

Social Bias Metrics
Why needed: Quantifying and measuring bias in machine learning systems requires standardized approaches
Quick check: SpEAT metric provides systematic evaluation across multiple bias dimensions

Model Compression Techniques
Why needed: Understanding how different compression methods affect model behavior and potential unintended consequences
Quick check: Various pruning strategies target different aspects of model architecture

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input audio -> Feature extraction (MFCC/Spectrogram/SSL) -> Bias evaluation (SpEAT) -> Compression application -> Retrained model -> Bias reassessment

Critical Path: Audio input → SSL pretraining → Feature extraction → SpEAT bias measurement → Compression → Bias evaluation

Design Tradeoffs: Model capacity vs. bias amplification; pretraining duration vs. bias accumulation; compression effectiveness vs. downstream task performance

Failure Signatures: Increased bias with longer pretraining; bias amplification in SSL vs. traditional features; inconsistent debiasing across compression methods

First Experiments: 1) Compare SpEAT scores across MFCC, spectrogram, and SSL representations on same dataset; 2) Vary pretraining steps systematically while measuring bias; 3) Apply different compression techniques and measure bias reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations

- Analysis focuses primarily on three SSL models (HuBERT, Wav2Vec2, and MelHuBERT), limiting generalizability to other architectures
- The study examines bias across gender, age, and nationality, but other protected attributes may exhibit different patterns
- Does not investigate underlying mechanisms causing architectural choices to affect bias differently

## Confidence

High confidence: SSL representations amplify bias compared to traditional acoustic features; row-pruning effectively mitigates social bias; model size has minimal impact on bias propagation

Medium confidence: Longer pretraining steps increase bias; wider and shallower architectures exhibit less bias than narrower and deeper ones; all pruning methods reduce Age bias

Low confidence: Compression techniques as a general debiasing strategy; specific parameter thresholds for bias reduction

## Next Checks

1. Replicate findings across a broader range of SSL architectures including those not based on transformer models, and test with additional bias metrics to verify the robustness of the amplification effect

2. Conduct controlled experiments varying pretraining duration while holding other factors constant to establish causality between pretraining steps and bias increase

3. Evaluate the downstream task performance impact of row-pruning and other compression techniques to quantify the trade-off between bias reduction and model utility
