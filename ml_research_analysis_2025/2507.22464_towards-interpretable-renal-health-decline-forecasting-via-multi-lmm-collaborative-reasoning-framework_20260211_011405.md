# Towards Interpretable Renal Health Decline Forecasting via Multi-LMM Collaborative Reasoning Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.22464
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22464
- Reference count: 40
- This study proposes a collaborative multi-LMM framework to improve open-source LMM performance in eGFR forecasting while generating clinically interpretable explanations

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a collaborative multi-LMM framework for forecasting renal health decline through eGFR prediction with interpretable clinical explanations. The approach combines knowledge transfer from proprietary vision-language models, abductive reasoning for clinical explanations, and short-term memory mechanisms to maintain reasoning continuity. The framework addresses the challenge of making interpretable predictions using open-source models while leveraging stronger proprietary models' visual interpretation capabilities. Evaluated on real clinical data from Kaohsiung Medical University, the method achieves prediction accuracy comparable to proprietary models while generating explanations that combine data-driven and hypothesis-based reasoning.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a two-stage approach: (1) Teacher LMM (T-LMM) interprets patient eGFR trend charts and generates structured textual summaries, which are passed to (2) Student LMM (S-LMM) for prediction and explanation. The S-LMM employs chain-of-thought prompting and short-term memory mechanisms to improve prediction consistency and enable self-correction across sequential forecasts. Explanations are generated through structured abductive reasoning combining selective abduction (data-driven) and creative abduction (hypothesis-based). The model was trained on 570 observations from 50 outpatients with a 70/30 train/validation split, achieving MAE of 3.62 and 3.87 in training and validation sets respectively.

## Key Results
- Llama 3.2 vision with knowledge transfer and memory mechanisms achieves MAE of 3.62 (training) and 3.87 (validation)
- Framework generates explanations combining data-driven and hypothesis-based abductive reasoning
- Modular design enables local deployment, addressing privacy and cost concerns
- Prediction accuracy comparable to proprietary models while maintaining interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Visual knowledge transfer from stronger models improves weaker open-source model performance on clinical prediction tasks
- T-LMM produces structured interpretations for each chart, which serve as external knowledge for the next stage of prediction
- If T-LMM interpretations are inaccurate or hallucinated, transferred knowledge degrades S-LMM predictions
- Models with strong native visual-language integration (e.g., Qwen 2.5 Vision 32B) show diminishing returns from this mechanism

### Mechanism 2
- Short-term memory improves prediction consistency and enables self-correction across sequential clinical forecasts
- When the model proceeds to the next step, it retrieves this memory along with the ground truth of the prior prediction, allowing it to self-correct and refine its reasoning
- Memory provides no benefit if predictions are independent or if ground truth feedback is unavailable
- Some models (Gemini 2.0 Pro, Qwen 2.5 Vision with memory) showed performance degradation, suggesting mechanism interacts unpredictably with model architecture

### Mechanism 3
- Structured abductive reasoning generates more clinically plausible and comprehensive explanations than surface-level feature attribution
- By combining data-driven and hypothesis-based reasoning, the model can generate more comprehensive interpretations
- Creative abduction may generate incorrect or misleading hypotheses if unchecked by domain experts
- Clinical validity remains unvalidated per authors' limitations section

## Foundational Learning

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: Enables step-by-step reasoning for prediction-then-explanation sequencing, reducing hallucination
  - Quick check question: Can you design a prompt that forces the model to predict a value before explaining it, and explain why this order matters?

- **Social Learning in LLMs**: Conceptual foundation for knowledge transfer between models using natural language as the exchange medium
  - Quick check question: How does exchanging knowledge via natural language differ from fine-tuning or weight sharing?

- **Abductive vs. Deductive vs. Inductive Reasoning**: The framework specifically uses abductive reasoning to generate plausible clinical hypotheses under uncertainty
  - Quick check question: Given an eGFR decline with incomplete data, would you use deduction, induction, or abduction to propose a cause?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> T-LMM interpretation -> E-LMM evaluation -> S-LMM prediction & explanation -> Memory storage
- Critical path:
  1. Generate M sequential line charts per patient
  2. Obtain T-LMM interpretations with evaluator scoring
  3. Pass interpretations + raw data to S-LMM
  4. S-LMM predicts, explains, stores in short-term memory
  5. At next step, retrieve memory + ground truth for self-correction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - T-LMM choice: Stronger models (Gemini, GPT-4o) give better interpretations but raise privacy/cost concerns; can process offline and discard
  - Memory mechanism: Helps some models (Llama 3.2, Gemma 3) but harms others (Qwen 2.5 Vision 32B, Gemini 2.0 Pro)—requires per-model validation
  - Creative abduction: Increases explanation richness but risks unsubstantiated claims; needs clinical review before deployment

- Failure signatures:
  - MAE validation significantly higher than training suggests overfitting or memory contamination
  - Explanations disconnected from predicted values indicate CoT chain broken
  - T-LMM interpretations with low evaluator scores propagate errors downstream
  - Models with strong native visual capabilities may degrade with unnecessary knowledge transfer

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline calibration: Run S-LMM zero-shot on held-out patients without T-LMM interpretations or memory; record MAE, MAPE
  2. Ablation by component: Add knowledge transfer alone, then memory alone, then both; measure incremental gains per Table I patterns
  3. Explanation validation: Sample 20 predictions; have clinical reviewers rate selective vs. creative abduction components for plausibility and relevance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: To what extent does the integration of structured abductive reasoning improve clinical trust and decision-making utility compared to standard predictive outputs?
  - Basis: "practical value in real-world decision-making has yet to be validated in collaboration with domain experts" (Page 5)
  - Why unresolved: Current evaluation relies on metric-based plausibility rather than expert assessment
  - Evidence needed: User study with nephrologists assessing accuracy and helpfulness in clinical workflows

- **Open Question 2**: Does the framework maintain predictive performance and explanation coherence when deployed across multi-center datasets with varying demographics?
  - Basis: "developed and evaluated using a single dataset... which may constrain its generalizability" (Page 5)
  - Why unresolved: Reliance on data from a specific institution limits understanding of population distribution handling
  - Evidence needed: External validation using independent cohorts from different regions or hospital systems

- **Open Question 3**: Why does the short-term memory mechanism degrade performance in certain models like Qwen 2.5 Vision while improving others?
  - Basis: Table 1 shows Qwen 2.5 training MAE increased from 2.99 to 4.10 with memory; "model-specific variability remains insufficiently understood" (Page 5)
  - Why unresolved: Interaction between memory module and specific model architectures is inconsistent and not mechanistically explained
  - Evidence needed: Ablation studies analyzing attention patterns or context utilization in models where memory causes degradation

## Limitations
- Clinical dataset is relatively small (50 patients, 570 observations), limiting external validity
- Framework's effectiveness depends on quality of T-LMM interpretations, but no systematic evaluation of hallucination or error rates provided
- Clinical validation of abductive explanations remains unperformed, raising questions about practical utility in real-world decision-making

## Confidence
- **High**: Prediction accuracy improvements via multi-LMM framework (validated on test data)
- **Medium**: Knowledge transfer mechanism effectiveness (conceptually sound but corpus lacks direct evidence)
- **Medium**: Abductive reasoning quality (plausible mechanism, no clinical validation)
- **Low**: Creative abduction hypotheses (potentially useful but unverified for clinical accuracy)

## Next Checks
1. **Clinical Expert Review**: Have nephrologists evaluate 50 random explanations for clinical plausibility, distinguishing selective from creative abduction components
2. **Dataset Scaling**: Test framework on larger CKD cohorts (>500 patients) to assess performance stability and identify overfitting patterns
3. **Memory Mechanism Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies on memory buffer size, retrieval frequency, and content to understand which model architectures benefit versus degrade
