# 3D-TDA -- Topological feature extraction from 3D images for Alzheimer's disease classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08663
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08663
- Reference count: 0
- Achieves 97.43% accuracy and 99.09% sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease classification using persistent homology

## Executive Summary
This study presents 3D-TDA, a novel approach for Alzheimer's disease classification using persistent homology and topological data analysis. The method extracts topological features from 3D MRI scans by converting them into cubical complexes and computing Betti numbers across multiple dimensions. These topological features are then integrated with XGBoost classifiers, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models. The approach demonstrates high accuracy in both binary (Alzheimer's vs normal) and three-class (Alzheimer's vs normal vs MCI) classification tasks using the ADNI dataset.

## Method Summary
The 3D-TDA method combines persistent homology with machine learning for Alzheimer's disease classification. It begins with preprocessing of T1-weighted MRI scans, followed by conversion into cubical complexes. Persistent homology is applied to extract topological features, which are summarized as Betti functions across multiple dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D). These features are then used as input to XGBoost classifiers. The method employs 10-fold cross-validation on the ADNI dataset and achieves high classification accuracy without requiring extensive data augmentation or preprocessing.

## Key Results
- Binary classification: 97.43% accuracy and 99.09% sensitivity
- Three-class classification: 95.47% accuracy and 94.98% sensitivity
- Superior performance compared to VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNet deep learning models
- Computational efficiency without extensive data augmentation requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The topological approach captures intrinsic structural patterns in brain morphology that are indicative of Alzheimer's disease. By representing MRI scans as cubical complexes and computing persistent homology, the method extracts multi-scale topological features that encode information about connected components, loops, and voids in the brain structure. These features provide a complementary perspective to traditional voxel-based or deep learning approaches, potentially capturing disease-related changes that are not easily detected through conventional methods.

## Foundational Learning
- Persistent homology: Why needed - Captures multi-scale topological features; Quick check - Verify Betti number calculations across filtration values
- Cubical complexes: Why needed - Converts image data into topological spaces; Quick check - Confirm correct cell adjacency relationships
- Betti functions: Why needed - Summarizes topological features into interpretable metrics; Quick check - Validate integration across filtration values
- XGBoost classification: Why needed - Handles high-dimensional topological features effectively; Quick check - Monitor feature importance scores
- Cross-validation: Why needed - Ensures robust performance estimation; Quick check - Verify fold distribution across classes

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: MRI scans -> Preprocessing -> Cubical complex conversion -> Persistent homology -> Betti functions -> XGBoost classifier

Critical path: MRI preprocessing -> Cubical complex construction -> Persistent homology computation -> Feature extraction -> Classification

Design tradeoffs: The method prioritizes interpretability and computational efficiency over raw feature extraction capacity. By using topological features instead of raw voxels or deep features, the approach reduces dimensionality but may miss some fine-grained spatial information. The choice of XGBoost balances performance with interpretability, though it may not capture as complex patterns as deep neural networks.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may result from inadequate preprocessing leading to noisy cubical complexes, incorrect filtration values affecting persistent homology calculations, or insufficient training samples causing overfitting in the XGBoost classifier. Class imbalance in the dataset could also lead to biased predictions.

First experiments:
1. Test with synthetic topological data to verify persistent homology calculations
2. Compare Betti function extraction with varying filtration parameters
3. Evaluate classification performance using only topological features versus combined features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on single dataset (ADNI) with potential generalization concerns
- Limited comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods
- Computational efficiency claims lack detailed benchmarking
- No evaluation of clinical applicability or real-world performance

## Confidence

High confidence: The topological feature extraction methodology using persistent homology is technically sound and well-established. The binary classification results (97.43% accuracy, 99.09% sensitivity) are internally consistent and reproducible given the described methodology.

Medium confidence: The three-class classification performance (95.47% accuracy) is promising but should be interpreted cautiously given the small number of ADNI dataset samples in this category (only 123) and the potential class imbalance effects.

Low confidence: Claims about clinical applicability and superiority over all existing methods require external validation. The study does not address potential confounding factors such as scanner variability, demographic differences, or clinical heterogeneity in Alzheimer's diagnosis.

## Next Checks

1. External validation: Test the model on independent MRI datasets from different institutions or countries to assess generalization beyond the ADNI cohort.

2. Ablation study: Systematically evaluate the contribution of topological features versus traditional imaging features by comparing models trained with: only topological features, only conventional features, and combined features.

3. Clinical utility assessment: Evaluate the model's performance on early-stage Alzheimer's cases and MCI patients who progress to AD, measuring both diagnostic accuracy and prediction timeliness compared to clinical assessment.
