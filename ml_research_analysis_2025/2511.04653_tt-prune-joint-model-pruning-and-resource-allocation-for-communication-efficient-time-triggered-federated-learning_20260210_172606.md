# TT-Prune: Joint Model Pruning and Resource Allocation for Communication-efficient Time-triggered Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.04653
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04653
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: 40% reduction in communication costs while maintaining comparable learning accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the communication inefficiency in time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed) by proposing TT-Prune, a framework that jointly optimizes model pruning ratios and wireless bandwidth allocation. The authors introduce adaptive model pruning based on weight importance and formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the l2-norm of gradients under latency constraints. The framework demonstrates significant communication cost reduction while maintaining learning performance across multiple datasets and data distribution scenarios.

## Method Summary
TT-Prune jointly optimizes model pruning ratios and wireless bandwidth allocation for time-triggered federated learning. The method employs importance-based pruning on fully connected layers, where weight importance is measured by the difference between current and previous weight values. A tiered aggregation scheme with configurable time intervals (ΔT) is implemented, where users are divided into tiers based on their computational capabilities. The joint optimization problem minimizes the l2-norm of gradients under latency constraints, with closed-form solutions derived using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for optimal pruning ratios and bandwidth allocation.

## Key Results
- Achieves 40% reduction in communication costs compared to TT-Fed without pruning
- Maintains comparable learning accuracy across MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets
- Demonstrates robustness under both IID and non-IID data distributions
- Shows effective balance between convergence speed and learning latency in resource-constrained wireless networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by strategically reducing the amount of data transmitted during each communication round through model pruning, while simultaneously optimizing wireless resource allocation to ensure efficient use of available bandwidth. The joint optimization ensures that the reduction in communication cost from pruning is balanced against any potential degradation in learning performance. The KKT-derived closed-form solutions enable real-time implementation in wireless networks, making the approach practical for resource-constrained environments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed)**: A federated learning framework where model aggregation occurs at fixed time intervals rather than after every communication round. Needed to provide predictable latency and resource allocation in wireless networks.
- **Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions**: First-order necessary conditions for a solution in nonlinear programming to be optimal, particularly useful for constrained optimization problems. Needed to derive closed-form solutions for the joint optimization problem.
- **Importance-based model pruning**: A technique that identifies and removes less important weights from neural networks based on their contribution to the model's output. Needed to reduce communication overhead while maintaining model performance.
- **Tiered aggregation**: A scheme where users are grouped into tiers based on computational capabilities, with different resource allocations for each tier. Needed to accommodate heterogeneous devices in wireless networks.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Partition -> Model Training -> Weight Importance Calculation -> Pruning Mask Application -> KKT Optimization -> Bandwidth Allocation -> Tiered Aggregation
**Critical Path**: Data preparation → Model training with pruning → KKT optimization → Bandwidth allocation → Tiered aggregation → Model update
**Design Tradeoffs**: Unstructured pruning of FC layers vs. structured pruning (simpler implementation vs. hardware efficiency); closed-form KKT solution vs. iterative optimization (speed vs. flexibility)
**Failure Signatures**: Accuracy collapse indicates pruning ratio too high or incorrect mask application; latency violations suggest bandwidth allocation miscalculation or incorrect unit conversions
**First Experiments**: 1) Implement basic TT-Fed with tiered aggregation and verify latency constraints; 2) Test importance-based pruning on a simple CNN with MNIST; 3) Validate KKT-derived bandwidth allocation under varying network conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
How can over-the-air computing (AirComp) and additional model compression techniques (e.g., quantization) be integrated into the joint optimization framework without violating the convexity required for the current KKT-based solution? The current optimization relies on a specific bandwidth allocation structure and latency model that assumes distinct transmission blocks and floating-point weights; AirComp introduces signal superposition which fundamentally changes the interference and bandwidth constraints.

### Open Question 2
Can the closed-form optimal solution be extended to support structured pruning (e.g., channel/filter pruning) or complex pruning criteria (e.g., second-order Taylor expansion) while maintaining tractability? Structured pruning changes the hardware latency model non-linearly (unlike simple weight reduction), and complex criteria increase the computational overhead ($O(n^2)$ or higher), potentially violating the per-round latency constraints used in the KKT derivation.

### Open Question 3
What is the trade-off between implementation complexity and convergence speed if the assumption of uniform pruning ratios within a tier is relaxed to allow per-user optimization? The current formulation simplifies the problem by treating users in a tier as an aggregate; individual optimization would increase the dimensionality of the constraint set, potentially making the problem non-convex or computationally infeasible for real-time wireless scheduling.

## Limitations
- Non-IID data partitioning method is vaguely described as "certain deviation" without specifying Dirichlet parameters or class skew
- Exact CNN architecture details (layer sizes, channels, kernel dimensions) are not provided, requiring reasonable assumptions
- Weight importance estimation timing (post-one-step vs post-local-epoch) is ambiguous in the description

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core optimization formulation using KKT conditions and tiered aggregation framework
- Medium confidence: Implementation of pruning mechanism and bandwidth allocation equations (Eq. 27-28)
- Low confidence: Exact reproduction of experimental results due to unspecified architecture and non-IID partitioning details

## Next Checks
1. Verify non-IID data partitioning by implementing Dirichlet α=0.5 distribution and comparing accuracy/failure rates against IID baseline
2. Validate KKT-derived solutions by testing edge cases (ρ=0, ρ=1) and ensuring gradient norm minimization under latency constraints
3. Benchmark communication cost reduction across different ΔT values (1-5 seconds) to confirm the claimed 40% improvement range
