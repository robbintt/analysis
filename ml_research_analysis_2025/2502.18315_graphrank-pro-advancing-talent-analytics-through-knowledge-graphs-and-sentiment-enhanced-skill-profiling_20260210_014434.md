# GraphRank Pro+: Advancing Talent Analytics Through Knowledge Graphs and Sentiment-Enhanced Skill Profiling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.18315
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18315
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Knowledge graph-based ranking with sentiment-enhanced skill profiling achieves 92% skill extraction accuracy, 85% sentiment analysis accuracy, and 90% top-10 resume ranking accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GraphRank Pro+, a novel talent analytics system that constructs weighted knowledge graphs from semi-structured resume data to enable more nuanced skill-based candidate ranking. The system extracts entities (job seekers, skills, organizations, projects) from resumes and encodes them as graph nodes with weighted edges that capture relationships and sentiment-derived skill strengths. By incorporating positive keywords from project descriptions into skill weighting through a gazetteer-based approach, the system provides recruiters with more accurate candidate evaluation capabilities compared to traditional keyword matching methods.

## Method Summary
The system converts resumes to text using Apache Tika, identifies sections via regex and header matching, and extracts entities using SpaCy POS tagging, regex entity matching, and gazetteer lookups. A manually-constructed skill-sentiment gazetteer maps skills to positive keywords with bootstrap weights (0-1), which are applied to project descriptions to calculate sentiment weights for skill-project edges. These weights aggregate to jobseeker-skill edges via averaging across projects. The resulting graph is stored in Neo4j and supports complex multi-skill queries with ranking based on edge weights and duration signals.

## Key Results
- Skill extraction accuracy: 92% precision, 88% recall, 90% F1 score
- Sentiment analysis accuracy: 85%
- Graph-based ranking: 90% accuracy for identifying top 10 relevant resumes
- System supports complex multi-skill queries with weight thresholds and duration constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Knowledge Graph Encoding of Semi-Structured Resume Data
Encoding resume data into a weighted graph structure enables more nuanced talent evaluation than keyword or rule-based matching. The system parses resumes to extract entities and encodes them as nodes with weighted edges, preserving structural relationships that keyword methods flatten.

### Mechanism 2: Sentiment-Weighted Skill Profiling via Gazetteer Matching
Assigning sentiment-derived weights to skill edges based on positive keywords in project descriptions improves skill strength estimation. A gazetteer maps skills to positive keywords with bootstrap weights, which are calculated from project descriptions and aggregated to jobseeker-skill edges.

### Mechanism 3: Graph-Based Ranking Through Edge Weight Aggregation
Aggregating skill-project edge weights into jobseeker-skill edges enables accurate ranking for complex multi-skill queries. The system supports queries with weight thresholds by matching skill requirements against weighted edges and ranking candidates accordingly.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Knowledge Graph Construction
Why needed here: The entire system relies on correctly building a graph with entity nodes and weighted relationship edges from unstructured resume text.
Quick check question: Given a resume with one jobseeker, two projects at one organization, using three skills (C++, Python, SQL), sketch the graph nodes and edge types.

### Concept: Gazetteer-Based Sentiment Scoring
Why needed here: Edge weights derive from a manually-constructed skill-sentiment gazetteer mapping keywords to bootstrap weights; understanding this mapping is essential for interpreting and debugging rankings.
Quick check question: If a project description contains "scalable distributed system design" and the skill-sentiment gazetteer maps these keywords to weights [0.8, 0.9, 0.7, 0.85], what is the average sentiment weight for the skill-project edge?

### Concept: Graph Databases (Neo4j)
Why needed here: The implementation uses Neo4j to store and query the knowledge graph; familiarity with graph traversal and Cypher query syntax is necessary for system operation and extension.
Quick check question: How would you write a Cypher query to find all jobseekers connected to a "C++" skill node with edge weight > 0.7?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map:
Resume Parser (Apache Tika) -> Section Identification (regex) -> Entity Extraction (SpaCy + gazetteers) -> JSON Output -> Graph Builder (Neo4j) -> Query Engine

### Critical Path:
1. Resume ingestion → Section identification → Entity extraction
2. Skill normalization → Gazetteer lookup
3. Project description parsing → Keyword extraction → Sentiment weight calculation
4. Edge weight assignment (skill→project, then jobseeker→skill via averaging)
5. Graph construction in Neo4j → Query execution → Ranked results

### Design Tradeoffs:
- No project normalization: Avoids cross-candidate project comparison for simpler processing
- Simple averaging: Uses averaging of project weights for computational simplicity
- Manual bootstrap weights: Gazeteer weights are manually assigned for interpretability but require domain expertise

### Failure Signatures:
- Low extraction accuracy on non-standard resumes due to section detection failures
- Sentiment weight sparsity when project descriptions lack gazetteer keywords
- Graph disconnectedness when resumes have incomplete organization or project information

### First 3 Experiments:
1. Parser robustness test: Ingest 50 resumes with varied formatting; measure section extraction accuracy
2. Gazetteer coverage audit: Sample 30 project descriptions; count keyword matches and identify missing terms
3. Ranking baseline validation: Run 15 multi-skill queries against held-out test set; compare to recruiter judgments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) improve the efficiency and accuracy of similarity searching compared to the current graph-based ranking approach?
The authors plan to use GNNs for efficient similarity searching in the future, suggesting current methods may lack scalability or nuance for complex similarity tasks.

### Open Question 2
Can enriching the graph topology with stochastic job shift data and applying DeepWalk accurately predict patterns of employee retention and volatility?
The authors plan to enrich the graph with job shift data and apply DeepWalk to find patterns of retainable and volatile employees.

### Open Question 3
How can the weighting mechanism be refined to assign distinct sentiment weights to different skills within the same project description, rather than applying a uniform average?
The current implementation assigns the same sentiment weight to all skills in a project description, potentially incorrectly boosting secondary skills mentioned alongside primary skills.

## Limitations

- Skill-sentiment gazetteer construction process is underspecified with no validation of keyword-to-weight mappings
- Evaluation protocol lacks detail on ground-truth labeling methodology and test distribution diversity
- No ablation studies comparing graph-based ranking against simpler approaches like TF-IDF or direct keyword matching

## Confidence

- High confidence: Graph construction methodology and basic parsing pipeline
- Medium confidence: Sentiment weighting mechanism (bootstrap weights specified but not validated)
- Medium confidence: Overall accuracy metrics reported without sufficient methodological transparency

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-domain performance testing: Evaluate system accuracy on resumes from industries/roles not represented in the training corpus to identify gazetteer coverage gaps
2. Perform ablation study: Compare graph-based ranking performance against baseline keyword matching to quantify the contribution of the knowledge graph architecture
3. Test resume format robustness: Systematically evaluate parsing accuracy across varied resume layouts (tables, columns, non-standard headers) to identify failure modes and necessary preprocessing improvements
