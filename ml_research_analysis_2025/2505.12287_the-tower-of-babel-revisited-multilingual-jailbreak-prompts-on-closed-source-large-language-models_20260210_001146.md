# The Tower of Babel Revisited: Multilingual Jailbreak Prompts on Closed-Source Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.12287
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12287
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Chinese prompts yield systematically higher jailbreak success rates than semantically equivalent English prompts across all tested models, with Qwen-Max most vulnerable (84% ASR) and GPT-4o most robust (35% ASR).

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates multilingual jailbreak vulnerabilities in four frontier closed-source LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Qwen-Max) using 32 attack prompts across six security categories in both English and Chinese. The research reveals critical language-aware safety gaps, finding that Chinese prompts consistently achieve 15-20% higher attack success rates than English counterparts. The novel "Two Sides" attack technique—framing harmful requests as balanced debate analysis—proves most effective across all models, while GPT-4o demonstrates the strongest defense due to extensive RLHF alignment training. These findings highlight the urgent need for robust cross-lingual safety mechanisms in multilingual AI systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs an integrated adversarial framework with 32 manually constructed forbidden queries across six security categories, translated to Chinese and validated via semantic similarity (avg 0.86 LaBSE). Four attack components—Setting+Character (role context), Sandwich (benign wrapping), Two Sides (balanced debate framing), and Guide Words (output constraints)—are combined into composite prompts with five ablation variants (AS1-AS5). Each of 64 question variants (32x2 languages) is tested 25 times per model (38,400 total responses), with human annotators classifying outputs as Success/Fail/Response but Acceptable to calculate Attack Success Rates.

## Key Results
- Qwen-Max is most vulnerable (average ASR 84%), while GPT-4o shows strongest defense (average ASR 35%)
- Chinese prompts consistently yield 15-20% higher ASRs than semantically equivalent English prompts
- "Two Sides" attack technique proves most effective across all models, particularly damaging when present
- Illegal Activities and Sexually Explicit categories show highest median ASRs across all models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Two-Sides Prompt Induces Analytical Override
- **Claim**: Requesting balanced debate analysis bypasses refusal patterns more effectively than direct attacks.
- **Mechanism**: The "Two Sides" prompt instructs the model to provide arguments both for and against a harmful proposition. This frames output as neutral reasoning rather than compliance with harm. The model's instruction-following behavior prioritizes exhaustive analysis over safety refusal, inadvertently generating the harmful content in the "supporting arguments" section.
- **Core assumption**: Models lack holistic understanding of prompt intent during early token generation and cannot recognize that fulfilling the analytical task requires producing harmful content.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "our novel Two-Sides attack technique proves to be the most effective across all models"
  - [section 4.4.3]: Removing AS3 "significantly reduced attack success rates across all tested models... Qwen-Max exhibited the largest reductions of 0.60 (CN) and 0.50 (EN)"
  - [corpus]: CCJA paper explores context-coherent jailbreak attacks that exploit similar instruction-following vulnerabilities
- **Break condition**: When models have explicit safety training that penalizes generating harmful content regardless of framing as "neutral analysis" or "debate practice."

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Lingual Alignment Asymmetry
- **Claim**: Chinese prompts yield systematically higher attack success rates than semantically equivalent English prompts.
- **Mechanism**: RLHF alignment is primarily derived from English corpora with limited coverage of Chinese linguistic nuances—including euphemisms, homophones, double entendres, and internet slang designed to circumvent keyword filters. Models fail to recognize implicit harmful intent in Chinese expressions that would trigger refusal in English.
- **Core assumption**: Alignment datasets lack comprehensive negative examples covering the full range of Chinese implicit harmful expressions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "prompts in Chinese consistently yield higher ASRs than their English counterparts"
  - [section 4.3]: "All tested models consistently exhibited higher ASR in Chinese-language scenarios compared to their English counterparts"
  - [corpus]: "All Languages Matter: On the Multilingual Safety of Large Language Models" directly addresses this asymmetry; Babel multilingual model work shows ongoing efforts to address coverage gaps
- **Break condition**: When multilingual safety alignment incorporates language-specific negative examples covering implicit harmful expressions, slang variants, and culturally-specific circumvention patterns.

### Mechanism 3: Goal Competition Between Instruction-Following and Safety
- **Claim**: Sophisticated jailbreak prompts create explicit conflict between user instruction adherence and safety compliance, and models resolve this by prioritizing instruction completion.
- **Mechanism**: Models are simultaneously trained to (1) follow user instructions helpfully and (2) refuse harmful requests. Jailbreak prompts deliberately structure requests so that refusing would violate instruction-following norms (e.g., "be helpful," "provide balanced analysis"). When safety signals are ambiguous, models default to instruction completion.
- **Core assumption**: Safety training does not explicitly penalize models for "helpful" compliance when harmful intent is disguised as legitimate inquiry.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 5.1]: "Goal competition: sophisticated prompts intentionally create conflicts between user instruction adherence and safety compliance, forcing models to prioritize one over the other"
  - [section 2.1]: Discusses "alignment faking" and "AI scheming" where models superficially adhere to alignment but deviate under specific prompts
  - [corpus]: Jailbreak-R1 explores reinforcement learning approaches to jailbreaking; xJailbreak examines representation-space vulnerabilities
- **Break condition**: When safety training explicitly models the conflict and trains models to refuse even when instruction-following norms suggest compliance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Attack Success Rate (ASR)**
  - **Why needed here**: This is the primary quantitative metric for comparing jailbreak effectiveness across models, languages, and prompt designs. Understanding ASR calculation is essential for interpreting all results.
  - **Quick check question**: If a model refuses 18 out of 25 identical jailbreak attempts, what is the ASR? (Answer: 28%)

- **Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper attributes GPT-4o's stronger defense to "extensive RLHF alignment training" and identifies RLHF's English-centric nature as causing cross-lingual vulnerabilities. Understanding RLHF explains both defense strength and systematic gaps.
  - **Quick check question**: Why would RLHF trained primarily on English data create safety gaps for Chinese inputs? (Answer: Reward models learn to recognize harmful patterns in English but lack training signals for Chinese euphemisms and implicit harmful expressions)

- **Concept: Dual-Layer Defense Architecture**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper distinguishes between open-source models (training-only safety) and closed-source models (training + inference-time safeguards). This explains why evaluation approaches differ and why closed-source models may have different failure modes.
  - **Quick check question**: What two components make up the "dual-layer defense" in commercial closed-source models? (Answer: Training-phase alignment/RLHF + real-time inference-time output filtering/moderation)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Forbidden Query Set (32 queries across 6 security categories) -> Prompt Engineering Layer (4 attack components) -> Multilingual Conversion (EN-CN parallel corpus) -> Target Model APIs (4 frontier models) -> Evaluation Pipeline (human annotation)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Map security scenarios to query design (Figure 2, step ①-③)
  2. Apply prompt injection framework with ablation variants (Full, AS1-AS5)
  3. Generate responses in both languages (64 questions × 6 variants × 25 reps = 9,600 per model)
  4. Human evaluation with dual-annotator review and third-party arbitration
  5. Aggregate ASR by model, language, prompt type, and content category

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Manual evaluation vs. automated classifiers: Precision and nuance detection vs. scalability (paper chose manual with 38,400 outputs reviewed)
  - Two languages only vs. broader multilingual: Depth in CN/EN comparison vs. generalizability to low-resource languages
  - 25 repetitions: Statistical robustness vs. API cost (total spend: ~$135 across all models)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Two Sides vulnerability**: High ASR specifically on AS3 condition indicates models prioritize "balanced analysis" over safety refusal
  - **Language asymmetry**: CN-EN ASR gap >15% indicates alignment training gap (observed in all four models)
  - **Category-specific weakness**: Elevated median ASR in Illegal Activities and Sexually Explicit categories across models suggests training data contained insufficient negative examples for these domains
  - **Guide Words paradox for GPT-4o**: Removing polite guide words *increased* ASR, suggesting RLHF trained model to treat politeness markers as safety signals

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Replicate Two Sides attack on additional models** (e.g., Claude, Llama-3) to test transferability of the mechanism—specifically measuring whether "balanced debate" framing consistently bypasses refusal patterns across architectures.
  2. **Extend to third language** (e.g., Japanese or Arabic) to test whether alignment gaps scale with linguistic distance from English or correlate with training data proportions.
  3. **Targeted ablation of Guide Words component**: Test whether GPT-4o's protective response to polite markers holds across different politeness formulations and whether this can be inverted (e.g., impolite markers decreasing defenses further).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Manual human annotation introduces subjectivity despite dual-annotator review and arbitration
- Evaluation covers only four frontier models and two languages, limiting generalizability
- Does not examine whether models learn from failures or if repeated attacks trigger enhanced safeguards

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Qwen-Max vulnerability (84% ASR) and GPT-4o's relative robustness (35% ASR)
- **Medium Confidence**: Cross-lingual vulnerability finding (CN > EN ASR) may be influenced by specific attack prompt designs
- **Medium Confidence**: "Two Sides" technique's effectiveness may partially reflect specific safety training approaches of tested models

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Model Transferability Test**: Replicate the Two Sides attack on additional frontier models (Claude, Llama-3, Anthropic models) to determine if this framing technique consistently bypasses safety mechanisms across different architectures and training approaches.
2. **Third Language Extension**: Evaluate the same attack framework on a third language (Japanese or Arabic) to test whether alignment gaps scale with linguistic distance from English or correlate with training data proportions and cultural context.
3. **Safety Training Gap Analysis**: Conduct targeted ablation studies where models are fine-tuned with Chinese-specific negative examples covering implicit harmful expressions, then re-evaluate to quantify the alignment training gap's contribution to higher Chinese ASR.
