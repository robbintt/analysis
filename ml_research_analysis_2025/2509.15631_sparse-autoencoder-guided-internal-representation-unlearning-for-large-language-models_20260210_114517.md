## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel method for entity-level unlearning in large language models by directly manipulating internal representations. The approach uses sparse autoencoders to identify activation patterns associated with target entities and aligns them with patterns from genuinely unknown entities. This technique avoids reliance on oracle models and provides a more stable alternative to suppression-based methods. The method demonstrates superior unlearning performance while preserving general model capabilities and non-target knowledge.

## Method Summary
The proposed method leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose model activations into interpretable latent factors. For a target entity to be unlearned, the method identifies latents associated with that entity and aligns their activation patterns with those of truly unknown entities. This alignment is achieved by minimizing the difference between known entity latents and unknown entity latents during fine-tuning. The approach operates at the representation level rather than relying on output suppression, making it more robust and stable. The method is particularly effective for question-answering tasks where precise control over entity knowledge is required.

## Key Results
- Achieves significant reduction in recall of target entity knowledge across multiple question-answering benchmarks
- Maintains general model utility and preserves non-target knowledge better than suppression-based baselines
- Internal representation analysis shows effective suppression of known latents and enhancement of unknown latents
- Demonstrates superior stability compared to oracle-dependent unlearning methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by directly manipulating the internal representation space of the language model. By using sparse autoencoders to decompose activations into interpretable latents, the approach can precisely identify which neural features correspond to specific entities. The alignment process then reshapes these features to match patterns from genuinely unknown entities, effectively "rewriting" how the model represents the target knowledge internally. This representation-level intervention is more robust than output-level suppression because it modifies the underlying knowledge encoding rather than just attempting to block its expression.

## Foundational Learning

**Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**: Neural networks that decompose activations into sparse, interpretable latent factors. Needed for identifying specific neural features associated with entities. Quick check: Verify SAE can reconstruct original activations with minimal loss.

**Representation Alignment**: Technique for minimizing differences between activation patterns of different entities. Needed to reshape how the model represents target knowledge. Quick check: Measure cosine similarity between aligned and target latents.

**Latent Space Manipulation**: Direct modification of internal model representations during fine-tuning. Needed for precise control over knowledge encoding. Quick check: Compare pre- and post-unlearning activation distributions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> SAE Encoder -> Latent Space -> SAE Decoder -> Output, with alignment module operating on latents

**Critical Path**: Input text → SAE decomposition → Target latent identification → Alignment optimization → Fine-tuned model with modified representations

**Design Tradeoffs**: Direct representation manipulation vs. output suppression (better stability but requires SAE training); precision vs. computational overhead (SAE decomposition adds complexity)

**Failure Signatures**: Incomplete unlearning (target entity still recalled); collateral damage (loss of related knowledge); SAE misidentification (incorrect latent alignment)

**First Experiments**:
1. Test SAE reconstruction quality on held-out data to ensure interpretability
2. Verify alignment effectiveness on synthetic known/unknown entity pairs
3. Measure unlearning performance on simple entity recall tasks before full evaluation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope focused primarily on named entities in question-answering tasks
- Dependency on accurate sparse autoencoder identification of known/unknown latents
- Computational overhead from SAE training and additional forward passes
- Unclear generalizability to other knowledge domains beyond named entities

## Confidence

**High confidence**:
- Core unlearning mechanism and its superiority over baselines
- Representation analysis showing effective suppression of known latents

**Medium confidence**:
- Claims about preservation of general capabilities across diverse tasks

**Low confidence**:
- Scalability considerations for larger models or frequent unlearning updates

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on diverse knowledge types beyond named entities, including factual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and domain-specific expertise, to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct ablation studies varying SAE architecture and training procedures to quantify robustness to misclassification errors and establish failure modes.

3. Evaluate the method's effectiveness against adaptive adversaries that attempt to recover unlearned knowledge through prompt engineering or fine-tuning, testing the durability of unlearning.
