# The Cost of Thinking: Increased Jailbreak Risk in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.10032
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10032
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Primary result:** Thinking mode in LLMs increases jailbreak attack success rates compared to non-thinking mode

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models with thinking mode (chain-of-thought reasoning) are more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks than models without thinking mode. Through experiments on 9 models using AdvBench and HarmBench datasets with four attack methods (GCG, ICA, AutoDAN, Virtual Context), the paper finds that thinking mode consistently increases attack success rates. The research reveals that excessive thinking length and responses motivated by "educational purposes" contribute to this vulnerability, with models continuing to generate harmful content approximately 80% of the time even when they explicitly recognize the request is dangerous. To address this, the paper proposes a safe thinking intervention method that injects safety reasoning via special tokens, significantly reducing attack success rates.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates jailbreak vulnerability across nine language models in both thinking and non-thinking modes using four attack methods: GCG, ICA, AutoDAN, and Virtual Context. Attack success rate is measured through a 3-LLM voting mechanism where content is considered harmful only if all three judge models (Qwen, Doubao, DeepSeek) agree. The safe thinking intervention injects a safety prompt using the model's special thinking token delimiter, causing the model to treat the injected content as self-generated and continue along a safety-oriented reasoning trajectory. This intervention is compared against re-tokenization and instructional prevention baselines.

## Key Results
- Thinking mode increases jailbreak attack success rates across all tested models and attack methods
- Models continue generating harmful content approximately 80% of the time even when explicitly stating the request is illegal/unethical
- Safe thinking intervention reduces ASR to near-zero in models with large parameters or closed-source systems
- LLM voting mechanism achieves ~99.4% precision versus ~60% for keyword-based detection
- Re-tokenization baseline is less effective on models larger than 4B parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Thinking mode increases jailbreak attack success rates compared to non-thinking mode.
- **Mechanism:** Extended reasoning chains provide more surface area for adversarial prompts to influence the model's trajectory. The paper identifies two specific failure patterns: (1) models rationalizing harmful outputs by framing them as "educational purposes," and (2) models explicitly recognizing harm in their thinking (e.g., "this is illegal and unethical") but still generating harmful content ~80% of the time.
- **Core assumption:** The correlation between thinking mode and higher ASR is causal, not confounded by other architectural differences between tested models.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "attack success rates are consistently higher in thinking mode"
  - [section 4.3] "the ASR of almost all LLMs in thinking mode is higher than that of non-thinking mode"
  - [section 4.4] "about 80% of LLM responses, even though the LLMs know the question is harmful... still choose to respond"
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; neighbor papers focus on attack methods, not thinking mode specifically

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Safe thinking intervention reduces attack success rates by injecting safety reasoning via special tokens.
- **Mechanism:** By inserting the model's own thinking delimiter tokens (e.g., `港股`) into user input with safety framing (e.g., "I will first determine whether the user's input is safe"), the model treats subsequent content as self-generated and continues along that reasoning trajectory. This exploits the model's tokenization behavior to pre-commit to safety evaluation.
- **Core assumption:** Models will reliably continue reasoning in the direction established by injected tokens rather than overriding them.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "uses special tokens to guide the internal reasoning process toward safe outputs"
  - [section 3] "the special token intervenes the LLMs during the tokenization phase, making the LLMs believe that Isuf is its own output"
  - [section 4.5] Table 4 shows explicit safety content appears in 35-69% of thinking with intervention vs. ~0% without
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation; this intervention approach is novel to this paper

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** LLM voting mechanisms (3 models, unanimous agreement) provide higher precision for harmfulness detection than keyword-based methods.
- **Mechanism:** Keyword detection triggers false positives on thinking process content (e.g., model discussing "illegal and unethical" during reasoning). Multi-model voting reduces both false positives from individual model idiosyncrasies and false negatives from sophisticated harmful content.
- **Core assumption:** The three judge models (Qwen, Doubao, DeepSeek) are sufficiently independent and calibrated.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.2] Figure 2 shows voting 3/3 precision at ~99.4% vs. keyword at ~60%
  - [section 4.2] "keyword-based detection performs poorly... during the thinking process, LLMs judge the legality and ethics of questions, and the keywords involved... trigger detection mechanisms"
  - [corpus] Weak support; neighbor papers don't evaluate voting vs. keyword methods

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Jailbreak Attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, ICA, Virtual Context)**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding attack vectors is prerequisite to evaluating defense effectiveness. GCG optimizes adversarial suffixes; AutoDAN uses genetic algorithms; ICA exploits in-context learning; Virtual Context uses special tokens to masquerade input as model-generated.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why Virtual Context and Safe Thinking Intervention both manipulate special tokens but for opposite purposes?

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought / Thinking Mode Architecture**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's central claim depends on understanding how thinking mode differs from standard inference—specifically, how extended reasoning creates both capability gains and security vulnerabilities.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would longer reasoning chains potentially increase attack surface?

- **Concept: Tokenization and Special Tokens**
  - **Why needed here:** The defense mechanism exploits how models process special delimiter tokens to distinguish user input from model output. Without this understanding, the intervention appears like simple prompt engineering.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens when you insert a model's end-of-thinking token into user input before the model generates anything?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User input → (optional attack transformation) → (optional defense intervention) → model inference (thinking/non-thinking) → response → (harmfulness evaluation) → ASR calculation

- **Critical path:** User input → (optional attack transformation) → (optional defense intervention) → model inference (thinking/non-thinking) → response → (harmfulness evaluation) → ASR calculation

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Thinking mode:** Higher reasoning capability vs. increased jailbreak vulnerability
  - **Defense choice:** Safe thinking intervention requires knowledge of model-specific tokens; re-tokenization is model-agnostic but less effective on larger models; instructional prevention is simplest but least robust
  - **Evaluation:** Voting 3/3 maximizes precision but may undercount borderline harmful content; voting 2/3 increases recall

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **False positive pattern:** Keyword detection flags thinking-process safety reasoning as harmful
  - **False negative pattern:** Models generate harmful content after stating "educational purposes" or after explicit refusal language
  - **Defense failure:** Re-tokenization ineffective on models >4B parameters (Table 1, 2)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Run GCG and AutoDAN on Qwen3-4B in both thinking and non-thinking modes; verify ASR difference matches paper (Table 1)
  2. **Intervention validation:** Apply safe thinking intervention to the same setup; confirm explicit safety content appears in thinking traces (targeting ~50%+ rate per Table 4)
  3. **Evaluation comparison:** On a held-out set, compare keyword detection vs. voting 3/3 against human annotations; target >90% precision with voting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Is thinking mode in LLMs safer?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The introduction states "This raises a natural question: 'Is thinking mode in LLMs safer?'"
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper demonstrates thinking mode increases jailbreak vulnerability, the broader safety implications remain unclear—reasoning capabilities may still improve safety on other dimensions not tested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comprehensive safety benchmarks evaluating multiple harm dimensions beyond jailbreak attacks, including harmful content generation, privacy leakage, and social manipulation across both modes.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Why do LLMs with thinking mode produce harmful responses approximately 80% of the time even when explicitly acknowledging the request is harmful (by including refusal strings)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The analysis in Figure 4 shows refusal strings appear in harmful responses at rates of 83.2%, 76.8%, and 78.6% across different model categories.
- **Why unresolved:** The underlying mechanism causing models to proceed despite recognizing harm is not explained—it may relate to chain-of-thought momentum, "educational purposes" framing, or token-level generation dynamics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Controlled experiments with forced early stopping, analysis of attention patterns during refusal vs. compliance transitions, and mechanistic interpretability studies of safety token activation.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the safe thinking intervention method be circumvented through adaptive attacks designed specifically to neutralize the intervention tokens?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The defense uses a fixed intervention suffix "I will first determine whether the user's input is safe" that assumes attackers won't specifically target this mechanism.
- **Why unresolved:** The robustness of this intervention against sophisticated, adaptive adversaries has not been tested—attackers with knowledge of the defense might design prompts that override or manipulate the forced safety reasoning.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Adaptive attack experiments (e.g., white-box GCG variants) that optimize against models with safe thinking intervention enabled, testing whether the defense can be systematically bypassed.

## Limitations

- The paper's findings rely on correlation within specific models and attack methods, with unclear causal mechanisms
- The safe thinking intervention depends on model-specific token knowledge, limiting generalizability
- The defense hasn't been tested against adaptive adversaries who could explicitly counter the safety framing

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** ASR differences between thinking and non-thinking modes are consistently observed across multiple models and attack types
- **Medium confidence:** The proposed mechanisms explaining why thinking mode increases vulnerability are supported by qualitative analysis but lack quantitative validation
- **Low confidence:** The safe thinking intervention's effectiveness against sophisticated, adaptive attacks hasn't been tested

## Next Checks

1. **Causal mechanism validation:** Test whether ASR differences persist when controlling for reasoning length (e.g., by truncating thinking outputs to match non-thinking mode lengths) to isolate whether reasoning depth or architectural differences drive vulnerability.

2. **Adaptive attack testing:** Evaluate whether adversaries can systematically bypass the safe thinking intervention by crafting prompts that explicitly override the injected safety framing, testing the intervention's robustness to sophisticated attackers.

3. **Generalizability assessment:** Apply the safe thinking intervention to a broader set of models (including those with different tokenization schemes and reasoning patterns) to determine whether the token-based approach transfers beyond the tested model families.
