core_contribution: This paper presents a scalable knowledge representation and reasoning
  framework for a game-based democracy simulation called e-polis, where real users
  respond to social challenges associated with democratic institutions structured
  as Smart Spatial Types. The framework uses a dual-layer knowledge representation
  mechanism similar to a two-level cache to manage low-level game state events and
  high-level abstract knowledge about player choices and philosophical doctrines.

# Knowledge representation and scalable abstract reasoning for simulated democracy in Unity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.05783
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05783
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Scalable knowledge representation framework enabling real-time abstract reasoning in democracy simulation game with 70% gender prediction accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a knowledge representation and reasoning framework for e-polis, a Unity-based democracy simulation game where players respond to social challenges structured as Smart Spatial Types. The system uses a dual-layer architecture (Sensor Abstract Layer for low-level events, Deductive Abstract Layer for high-level reasoning) to manage real-time physics processing separately from semantic reasoning about political doctrines. The framework enables adaptive game flow based on player choices and supports explainability by making the logical chain from player action to architectural transformation visible.

## Method Summary
The method involves a Unity game engine connected to a CLIPS-based knowledge base via a shared text interface. Players navigate a 3D environment and respond to 20 dilemmas, each with 5 choices mapped to political doctrines. The system ingests high-frequency physics events through SAL while DAL processes low-frequency predicates using a Rete network. A separate analysis applied PCA/UMAP dimensionality reduction to 128 participants' responses, then used lazypredict library to test multiple classifiers for gender prediction and K-Means clustering to identify response patterns.

## Key Results
- Dual-layer architecture successfully separates real-time physics from semantic reasoning
- 70% accuracy in predicting participant gender from dilemma responses
- Clustering revealed 9-10 distinct response patterns with silhouette score of 0.4165
- Majority of responses aligned with Democratic Radicalism and Liberalism formations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Layer Abstraction for State Management
- **Claim:** Decoupling real-time physics processing from semantic reasoning improves development flexibility
- **Mechanism:** Sensor Abstract Layer ingests high-frequency events while Deductive Abstract Layer processes low-frequency predicates using Rete network
- **Core assumption:** Synchronization overhead via shared text space doesn't negate performance benefits
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions dual-layer cache mechanism; Section 6 describes SAL matching predicates against patterns; corpus supports geometric-semantic fusion value
- **Break condition:** Event volume exceeding SAL's ability to write to shared space before next frame

### Mechanism 2: Spatial-Temporal Mapping of Logical Consequences
- **Claim:** Linking abstract logical choices to concrete 3D architectural changes creates visible feedback loop
- **Mechanism:** UserChoice predicate triggers rule asserting H_SmartSpatialTypeTransformed, passed back to Unity to enable PoliticisedSpatialType
- **Core assumption:** Latency between inference and rendering is <100ms for perceived immediacy
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 4 describes choice causing SmartSpatialType to change; Section 9.2 defines H_SmartSpatialTypeTransformed predicate; corpus emphasizes doctrinal consistency
- **Break condition:** Rete network fails to match rule due to conflicting facts

### Mechanism 3: Rule-Based Deduction for Adaptive Flow
- **Claim:** Offloading game flow logic to deductive engine enables dynamic adaptation based on complex historical states
- **Mechanism:** CLIPS stores historical predicates (e.g., H_UserInDilemma) to determine completion and trigger phase changes
- **Core assumption:** Rete network memory usage is more efficient than custom C# history log iteration
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 7 explains Rete's speed advantage; Section D shows rule 4 triggers transport to "Sky" location; corpus notes dynamics-computation interplay
- **Break condition:** Accumulated historical facts increase inference cycle time, degrading frame rate

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: The Rete Algorithm**
  - **Why needed here:** Core logic engine in DAL for efficient rule matching
  - **Quick check question:** Does system re-evaluate all rules when new event arrives, or only update partial matches?

- **Concept: State Synchronization (Shared File Space)**
  - **Why needed here:** Architecture relies on PlayerPreferences/text file to bridge Unity and knowledge base
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to logic engine state if Unity crashes before writing "end_time" of event?

- **Concept: Predicate Logic (Facts vs. Rules)**
  - **Why needed here:** Distinguish raw data from derived knowledge to design ontology correctly
  - **Quick check question:** Is L_AtomicLocation a derived fact or static constant defined by scene layout?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Unity (Frontend) -> Shared Space (Bridge) -> CLIPS (Logic Core) -> Firebase (Storage)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Player Collision (Unity) -> OnTriggerEnter writes to Shared Space
  2. Middleware detects change -> Asserts fact into SAL
  3. Rete Network matches facts -> Fires Rule in DAL
  4. DAL modifies export file -> Middleware reads change
  5. Unity Script (Update()) reads change -> Modifies GameObject/Scene

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Expressiveness vs. Latency: Gains semantic reasoning but introduces file I/O latency
  - Memory vs. Speed: Rete trades high memory usage for faster inference cycles

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Logic Deadlock: Building geometry flickers or fails to update (conflicting rules or missing retract)
  - Event Drowning: Game stutters (SAL flooded with physics events)
  - State Desync: Logic engine thinks player in dilemma but Unity shows main map (file locking issues)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Trace the Handshake: Trigger single collision and trace log output from Unity -> Shared Space -> CLIPS -> Unity to verify round-trip latency
  2. Stress Test SAL: Spawn 50 agents moving simultaneously to see if physics event rate crashes middleware buffer
  3. Rule Validation: Manually assert UserChoice fact in CLIPS shell to verify correct PoliticisedSpatialType identification without full game loop

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How can machine-readable semantically annotated politicised material be integrated to automate dilemma updating in response to current affairs?
2. Can the middleware architecture sustain real-time performance in high-concurrency, large-scale multiplayer environments?
3. To what extent can abstract or procedural layout components be developed to balance realistic depiction with reusability in diverse environments?

## Limitations
- Text-based shared-space interface introduces single point of latency and potential desynchronization
- Knowledge base design relies on predefined ontological structures that may not generalize
- Gender prediction accuracy of 70% is only moderately above random chance for 3-class problem
- No user experience metrics validating whether spatial transformations enhance understanding

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Dual-layer abstraction mechanism for separating physics from semantic reasoning is technically sound and well-documented
- **Medium confidence:** Rule-based deduction approach for adaptive game flow is valid, but real-world performance depends on unmeasured latency factors
- **Low confidence:** Gender prediction results are presented without proper significance testing or comparison to baseline models

## Next Checks
1. Measure round-trip latency from Unity collision to visual transformation to quantify real-time performance impact of shared-space interface
2. Conduct A/B testing comparing user understanding and engagement between Smart Spatial Types system and traditional menu-based democracy simulation
3. Perform ablation studies removing knowledge base layer to determine specific reasoning capabilities it enables versus native Unity scripting alone
