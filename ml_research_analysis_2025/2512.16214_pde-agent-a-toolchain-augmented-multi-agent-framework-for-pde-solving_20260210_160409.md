## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of automating Partial Differential Equation (PDE) solving, which traditionally requires significant manual effort and domain expertise. The authors introduce PDE-Agent, a toolchain-augmented multi-agent framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to solve PDEs from natural language descriptions through coordinated tool invocation. The framework employs two key innovations: a Prog-Act approach with graph memory for effective multi-agent collaboration and error correction, and a Resource-Pool with tool-parameter separation for efficient multi-tool coordination. The authors also develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE benchmark with approximately 100 test cases, and propose multi-level evaluation metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations demonstrate that PDE-Agent achieves superior applicability and performance in complex, multi-step PDE solving tasks, with an overall success rate of 90% across diverse PDE problems, outperforming comparable methods like OctoTools, OpenAlita, and LLM-DS.

## Method Summary
PDE-Agent is a toolchain-augmented multi-agent framework for automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. The method comprises four core components: Planner (decomposes queries into subtasks), Parser/Solver (extracts PDE objects/conditions and configures neural networks), Executor (invokes tools with parameters), and Orchestrator (validates subtask accuracy and implements error correction). The framework introduces Prog-Act, a dual-loop error correction mechanism using graph memory for dependency tracking, and Resource-Pool for centralized management of runtime artifacts. The system uses DeepSeek-v3 as the primary LLM and DeepXDE-based PDE toolkits. Evaluation is performed on PDE-Bench, a benchmark with ~100 test cases across 11 PDE types, using multi-level metrics including Pass@1 success rate, graph-based logical metrics, and local tool invocation metrics.

## Key Results
- PDE-Agent achieves 90% overall success rate on PDE-Bench benchmark
- Outperforms OctoTools (81% with Resource-Pool adaptation), OpenAlita, and LLM-DS on logical collaboration metrics
- Demonstrates superior applicability to complex, multi-step PDE solving tasks requiring toolchain collaboration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Prog-Act Dual-Loop Error Correction with Graph Memory
- **Claim:** Progressive checkpoint-based validation with graph-structured memory enables efficient error recovery in multi-step PDE solving without the overhead of step-wise verification.
- **Mechanism:** The system operates via two interconnected loops. The inner loop performs localized error correction at fixed checkpoints (after critical tool invocations or predefined subtask counts) using graph memory to trace which tools/subtasks are tainted by erroneous data. The outer loop triggers global plan revision when inner-loop recovery fails, prompting the Planner to refine or fully replan. Graph memory models tool/subtask dependencies
