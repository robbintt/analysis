# Beyond the Battlefield: Framing Analysis of Media Coverage in Conflict Reporting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.10421
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10421
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: War-oriented framing dominates conflict coverage across US, UK, and Middle Eastern media, with distinct regional differences in how assailants and victims are portrayed

## Executive Summary
This paper operationalizes Galtung's war vs peace journalism framework using computational methods to analyze Israel-Palestine conflict reporting. The authors apply large language models and frame semantic parsing to a dataset of 22,000 news articles from US, UK, and Middle Eastern publishers. They find that war-oriented framing is more prevalent than peace-oriented, with adversarial language, focus on visible conflict effects, and elite-oriented reporting dominating. Semantic analysis reveals distinct regional patterns in attributing blame and victimhood, with US and UK media frequently identifying Hamas as assailants while Middle Eastern outlets show the opposite pattern.

## Method Summary
The study employs a multi-method computational approach combining three analytical layers: generic frame classification using Mistral-7b on Media Frames Corpus taxonomy, issue-specific frame extraction via Command-R LLM for Galtung's war/peace indicators, and semantic frame parsing using FrameNet-based models. The dataset of ~22k articles (Oct 2023 - Feb 2024) was collected via MediaCloud API, filtered using BERTopic topic modeling and length criteria, then analyzed in parallel streams. Generic frames were extracted from the full corpus, while issue-specific analysis was conducted on a 9k subset due to compute constraints. Semantic parsing was applied to all articles to identify frame elements like Assailant and Victim across regions.

## Key Results
- War-oriented framing indicators are significantly more prevalent than peace-oriented indicators across all regions
- Middle Eastern outlets show higher focus on health, regulation, and security frames compared to US/UK political/public opinion framing
- Semantic analysis reveals systematic regional differences in attributing assailant/victim roles, with US/UK more frequently labeling Hamas as assailants
- Elite-oriented reporting and adversarial language dominate across all regions, consistent with war journalism patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LLMs with structured prompts can extract communicative framing indicators from conflict news articles at scale. The authors use a JSON-structured prompt requiring specific excerpts, targets, and reasoning for each indicator, grounding outputs in article text to reduce hallucination. Command-R is applied to 9k sampled articles with qualitative validation showing faithful outputs.

### Mechanism 2
FrameNet-based semantic parsing captures visible and invisible effects of war through structured frame elements. The Frame Semantic Transformer parses sentences into semantic frames (Attack, Killing, Hostile_Encounter) and extracts elements like Assailant and Victim to identify who is portrayed as assailant vs victim across regions.

### Mechanism 3
Regional comparison across three framing levels reveals systematic differences that single-level analysis would miss. Generic frames from Media Frames Corpus taxonomy provide high-level topic framing, issue-specific frames operationalize Galtung's indicators, and semantic frames capture lexical patterns. Cross-regional aggregation reveals divergent patterns in conflict representation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Galtung's War vs Peace Journalism Framework**: Theoretical foundation operationalized in the study. Understanding the indicators (conflict vs solution orientation, elite vs people focus, visible vs invisible effects) is prerequisite to interpreting all results.
  - *Quick check*: Can you name three indicators that distinguish war journalism from peace journalism according to Table 2?

- **Semantic Frame Parsing (FrameNet)**: Mechanism for extracting "visible effects of war" through semantic frames and frame elements. Understanding this distinction is necessary to interpret Figure 4-6 and Table 5.
  - *Quick check*: What is the difference between a "frame" (e.g., Attack) and a "frame element" (e.g., Assailant)?

- **Multi-label Frame Classification**: Generic frame extraction uses multi-label setup where articles can have multiple frames simultaneously. Understanding precision/recall in this context (Table 4: macro precision 0.39, recall 0.58) is necessary to assess method reliability.
  - *Quick check*: Why would recall be higher than precision in multi-label frame classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Collection (MediaCloud API) -> Filtering (BERTopic + Length) -> [Parallel: Generic frames via Mistral-7b, Issue frames via Command-R, Semantic frames via Frame Semantic Transformer] -> Regional aggregation -> Comparative visualization
- **Critical path**: Data collection → Filtering (domain + topic + length) → [Parallel: Generic frames via Mistral-7b, Issue frames via Command-R, Semantic frames via Frame Semantic Transformer] → Regional aggregation → Comparative visualization
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  1. LLM choice: Mistral-7b (open, evaluable on benchmark) for generic frames vs Command-R (proprietary API) for issue-specific frames
  2. Sample size: Issue-specific analysis on 9k subset due to compute constraints
  3. English-only: Explicitly excludes regional languages, limiting generalizability
  4. No human annotation: Relies on qualitative validation rather than inter-annotator agreement metrics
- **Failure signatures**:
  1. LLM hallucination: Structured prompt with excerpt extraction mitigates but does not eliminate
  2. Frame element misattribution: If "Israel" and "Hamas" are incorrectly assigned to Assailant/Victim roles
  3. Topic drift in BERTopic: Unrelated articles passing topic filter
  4. Regional imbalance: 4K ME articles vs 9.5K US
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Validate LLM frame extraction on held-out sample with manual annotation
  2. Cross-validate semantic frame findings with LLM extraction on same articles
  3. Temporal stability check on monthly subsets to verify regional differences persist

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the exclusion of regional languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi) skew the comparative analysis of framing between Western and Middle Eastern media? The current dataset omits the primary languages of the conflict participants and regional neighbors.

### Open Question 2
To what extent do the intrinsic biases of the LLMs used (Mistral-7b, Command-R) affect the classification of "adversarial" vs. "victimizing" language? The study relies on LLM predictions without comparing them against a ground-truth human-annotated dataset for issue-specific frames.

### Open Question 3
Does the computational operationalization of Galtung's framework generalize to other geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Ukraine, Sudan) without re-engineering prompts? The transferability of the specific prompts and semantic frame lists to different conflict contexts is untested.

## Limitations
- Exclusive use of English-language sources may not capture framing patterns in regional languages
- Reliance on LLM-based analysis introduces potential biases without quantitative benchmarking against human annotations
- FrameNet semantic parsing may not fully capture cultural nuances in conflict representation across different media ecosystems

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Regional differences in generic frame classification (political vs security focus) - aligns with established media studies patterns
- **Medium Confidence**: Semantic frame element assignments (Assailant/Victim roles) - robust method but potential for systematic misattribution
- **Medium Confidence**: War vs peace indicator extraction via LLM - validated qualitatively but not benchmarked

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-annotator agreement study on 100 randomly sampled articles to benchmark LLM frame extraction accuracy
2. Run semantic frame analysis on Arabic-language subset of Middle Eastern articles to test generalizability beyond English
3. Implement temporal analysis by re-running all methods on monthly subsets to verify stability of regional differences over time
