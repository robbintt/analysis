# The Optimal Sample Complexity of Linear Contracts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01496
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01496
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: EUM algorithm achieves ε-approximation of optimal linear contract with O(ln(1/δ)/ε²) samples, matching lower bound

## Executive Summary
This paper determines the optimal sample complexity for learning optimal linear contracts in the offline setting, where agent types are drawn from an unknown distribution. The key insight is leveraging the structural property that expected rewards of linear contracts are non-decreasing, which enables a chaining argument with fine-grained nets to establish uniform convergence. This allows the simple Empirical Utility Maximization (EUM) algorithm to achieve an ε-approximation of the optimal linear contract with probability at least 1−δ using O(ln(1/δ)/ε²) samples, matching a lower bound from previous work.

## Method Summary
The EUM algorithm operates by constructing a discretization of the contract parameter space and querying an oracle for empirical utilities at each grid point. The core innovation is the chaining argument that exploits the non-decreasing reward property to create fine-grained nets of size O(1/ν²), enabling uniform convergence across all linear contracts. The algorithm returns the contract parameter achieving maximum empirical utility on the sample, which with sufficient samples will be an ε-approximation of the true optimal contract.

## Key Results
- EUM algorithm achieves ε-approximation of optimal linear contract with probability ≥ 1−δ using s ≥ 6912·ln(4/δ)/ε² samples
- Sample complexity matches known lower bound up to constant factors, proving optimality
- The result is independent of the number of agent actions, unlike previous bounds
- Uniform convergence is achieved: empirical utility is ε-close to true expectation for all linear contracts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Reward Monotonicity Enables Efficient Covering
The sample complexity is independent of the number of agent actions because the expected reward function is non-decreasing. This allows discretization of the y-axis (expected reward) rather than just the x-axis (contract parameter), creating fine-grained nets of size O(1/ν²).

### Mechanism 2: Chaining Argument for Uniform Convergence
A chaining argument (via Rademacher complexity) shows that covering numbers derived from reward monotonicity lead to uniform convergence, ensuring empirical utility is ε-close to true expectation for every linear contract.

### Mechanism 3: Oracle-Based Empirical Utility Maximization
The EUM algorithm queries an oracle for empirical utility on a discretized grid of size O(1/ε). Due to uniform convergence, the maximizer on the sample is an ε-approximation of the true maximizer.

## Foundational Learning

- **Principal-Agent Problem (Hidden Action)**: The economic context where agents choose actions based on private types and contracts, while principals only observe outcomes. Quick check: Why can't the principal simply dictate the action i to the agent?

- **Sample Complexity (PAC Learning)**: Understanding how many samples are needed to guarantee a specific error rate with (ε, δ) notation. Quick check: Does the sample complexity depend on the number of actions n in this result?

- **Uniform Convergence**: The stronger guarantee that learning holds for the entire class rather than just finding the best single point. Quick check: Does uniform convergence guarantee that empirical utility is close to expected utility for all contracts, or just the optimal one?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (Sample S or Oracle) -> Grid Generator (Constructs D_{ε/4}) -> Utility Oracle (Computes uₚ(S, α)) -> Optimizer (Finds arg max) -> Output (Contract parameter α̂)

- **Critical path**: Grid Definition → Oracle Queries → Max Selection. The computational cost is low (O(1/ε) queries), shifting the burden entirely to sample size.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Grid resolution vs. error (smaller ε increases both queries and sample size quadratically); Oracle vs. full data (oracle preserves privacy but limits secondary analysis).

- **Failure signatures**: High variance/small sample causes noisy empirical utility; model misspecification invalidates approximation guarantees.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Implement EUM on synthetic data with known optimal α to verify O(1/ε²) scaling. 2) Test performance when non-decreasing reward property is violated. 3) Compare EUM against naive pseudo-dimension approach to quantify improvement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Infinite Action Spaces**: Can the O(ln(1/δ)/ε²) bound extend to settings with infinite action spaces? The paper notes this requires different technical treatment since optimal actions may not be well-defined.

2. **Other Contract Classes**: Can the chaining argument leveraging structural monotonicity be applied to obtain optimal bounds for other contract classes like general or combinatorial contracts?

3. **Optimal Constants**: What are the optimal constants (not just O-notation) in the sample complexity bound? The paper did not attempt to optimize these constants.

## Limitations
- Analysis critically depends on non-decreasing reward property of linear contracts
- Assumes i.i.d. sampling of agent types and access to accurate utility oracle
- Proof relies on specific technical lemmas (Rebeschini [2021] Prop 5.3) requiring careful verification
- Performance under model misspecification is not characterized

## Confidence
- **High**: Matching lower bound proof and non-decreasing reward property are mathematically rigorous
- **Medium**: Chaining argument application to contract setting is sound but depends on cited Rebeschini result
- **Low**: Algorithm performance under model misspecification and practical deployment requirements are unexplored

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness Verification**: Test EUM on synthetic data where non-decreasing reward property is violated to establish stability margins.

2. **Empirical Scaling Study**: Implement EUM and empirically validate O(1/ε²) scaling of sample size across varying numbers of actions and outcomes.

3. **Oracle Accuracy Impact**: Investigate algorithm performance with noisy oracle estimates to characterize trade-offs between accuracy, sample size, and approximation guarantees.
