# Content Moderation in TV Search: Balancing Policy Compliance, Relevance, and User Experience

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17207
- Reference count: 16
- Over eight weeks, true positive detections increased from 168 to 371 and precision improved from 0.06 to 0.15

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a content moderation framework for TV search that dynamically flags contextually inappropriate results while preserving the full content catalog. The system combines meta-heuristic filtering with sensitivity scores derived from curated lexicons and LLM-based validation to adapt to evolving language semantics and user intent. Over an eight-week evaluation processing nearly a million queries daily, the approach significantly improved true positive detection rates and precision while reducing false positives. By iteratively refining sensitivity scores through feedback loops, the framework provides a scalable, policy-compliant solution for real-time content moderation in entertainment platforms.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a two-stage content moderation pipeline that separates retrieval from policy enforcement. First, transformer embeddings of queries, results, and metadata are filtered using cosine similarity and sensitivity scores derived from curated lexicons with time-adaptive weighting. A result is flagged when its sensitivity exceeds threshold β while the query score remains below it. Flagged instances undergo LLM validation (LLAMA 3.1-8B) with multi-task scoring covering query irrelevancy, age estimation, policy violation detection, and chain-of-thought reasoning. The system iteratively updates lexicon sensitivity scores using batch-averaged validation feedback, progressively reducing dependency on LLM inference while improving precision from 0.06 to 0.15 over eight weeks.

## Key Results
- True positive detections increased from 168 to 371 over eight weeks
- Precision improved from 0.06 to 0.15 during evaluation period
- False positives decreased from 2,780 to 220 as lexicon sensitivity scores were refined

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Two-Stage Filtering with Dynamic Sensitivity Scores
- Claim: Separating moderation from retrieval stabilizes policy enforcement and allows adaptive flagging without catalog modification
- Mechanism: Predefined lexicons carry time-adaptive sensitivity scores; a result is flagged when its sensitivity exceeds threshold β while the query score remains below it. Cosine similarity filters redundant matches first
- Core assumption: Sensitivity scores derived from historical occurrence frequencies and LLM feedback meaningfully capture evolving semantic connotations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "approach combines meta-heuristic filtering with sensitivity scores derived from curated lexicons"
  - [section 2.1]: "A result is flagged as sensitive if its sensitivity score exceeds a predefined threshold while the corresponding query remains below it"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus support for time-adaptive lexicon scoring specifically; neighbor papers focus on policy-as-prompt approaches rather than score dynamics
- Break condition: If language evolution outpaces score update frequency, or if α weighting over-smooths rapid semantic shifts, false negatives will increase

### Mechanism 2: LLM-as-Validator with Multi-Task Scoring
- Claim: LLMs provide contextual validation that static classifiers cannot, reducing false positives while explaining flagging decisions
- Mechanism: LLM computes weighted validation score V across tasks (query irrelevancy, age estimation, policy violation detection, chain-of-thought reasoning). Validation feedback updates lexicon sensitivity via batch-averaged scores
- Core assumption: LLM validation scores correlate with human editorial judgments sufficiently to replace manual review for most cases
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LLM-based validation to adapt to evolving language semantics and user intent"
  - [section 2.2]: "LLMs assign validation confidence scores to flagged instances while simultaneously performing auxiliary tasks"
  - [corpus]: "Policy-as-Prompt" paper supports LLM-based moderation but flags policy interpretation variability as a challenge
- Break condition: If LLM systematically misclassifies edge cases (e.g., cultural context nuances), false positives or false negatives propagate back into sensitivity scores, degrading system calibration

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Feedback Loop with Batch-Stabilized Updates
- Claim: Continuous feedback from LLM validation refines lexicon sensitivity scores, progressively reducing dependency on LLM inference
- Mechanism: Equation 2 updates S(Li, t+1) using α-weighted historical retention and batch-averaged validation feedback. Large batch sizes |B| stabilize updates against noise
- Core assumption: False positive corrections from LLM validation generalize across query distributions over time
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By refining sensitivity scores iteratively and reducing false positives"
  - [section 3]: "LLM validation dynamically adjusted sensitivity scores, reducing false positives" and precision improved from 0.06 to 0.15 over 8 weeks
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for batch-stabilized lexicon update dynamics in moderation systems
- Break condition: If query distribution shifts suddenly (e.g., trending topics), historical α-weighting may lag, causing temporary precision drops

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Transformer-based semantic embeddings**
  - Why needed here: Cosine similarity filtering relies on dense representations of queries, results, and metadata to identify misalignment
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why cosine similarity alone cannot distinguish between "relevant but inappropriate" and "relevant and appropriate" content?

- Concept: **Time-adaptive scoring functions**
  - Why needed here: Sensitivity scores must decay or grow based on usage frequency to track language evolution
  - Quick check question: If α = 0.9, what proportion of the new score comes from historical vs. real-time feedback? What tradeoff does this create?

- Concept: **LLM chain-of-thought prompting for validation**
  - Why needed here: Multi-task validation (age estimation, policy violation, irrelevancy) requires reasoning beyond binary classification
  - Quick check question: Why might an LLM's validation score be overconfident for culturally ambiguous queries?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. **Embedding layer**: Encodes Q, R, M into dense vectors using pretrained transformers
  2. **Meta-heuristic filter**: Applies lexicon matching with time-adaptive sensitivity scores (Algorithm 1)
  3. **LLM validator**: LLAMA-3.1-8B computes multi-task validation scores (Equation 1)
  4. **Feedback integrator**: Updates lexicon scores via batch-averaged validation (Equation 2)
  5. **Offline editorial review**: Human review of flagged instances before action

- Critical path: Query → Embedding + Cosine Filter → Sensitivity Scoring → (if flagged) LLM Validation → Feedback Update → Editorial Review

- Design tradeoffs:
  - High α prioritizes stability but slows adaptation to new slang or semantic shifts
  - Low β threshold catches more anomalies but increases LLM inference load
  - Large batch size |B| stabilizes updates but delays feedback incorporation

- Failure signatures:
  - Sudden precision drop: Check for query distribution shift or trending topics not in lexicons
  - Excessive false positives: α may be too low, allowing noisy validation feedback to dominate
  - Stagnant true positive rate: Lexicons may be outdated; validate LLM is not over-rejecting flags

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablate LLM validation**: Run meta-heuristic filter alone for 1 week; compare precision and FP rate to hybrid system to quantify LLM contribution
  2. **Vary α systematically**: Test α ∈ {0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95} on historical query logs; plot precision vs. adaptation speed to find optimal balance
  3. **Lexicon coverage audit**: Sample 200 flagged instances; manually categorize whether failure was due to missing lexicon terms, metadata errors, or embedding misalignment. Use this to prioritize lexicon updates vs. metadata correction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can the labeled data generated by the framework effectively train a smaller, distilled model to perform real-time moderation without relying on resource-intensive LLM inference?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states the iterative lexicon refinement "serves as a foundation for transitioning to a smaller, distilled model, ultimately enabling real-time content moderation without on-demand LLM inference"
  - Why unresolved: The current system depends on LLAMA 3.1-8B for validation, which is computationally expensive; the distillation process is proposed as future work to improve scalability
  - What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks (precision, recall, latency) showing a distilled model trained on the system's logs matching the validation quality of the larger LLM

- **Open Question 2**: How can standardized benchmarks be developed for content moderation in search when appropriateness is heavily dependent on subjective user intent and cultural context?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "no benchmark datasets or directly comparable models exist for evaluation" because content appropriateness varies significantly by intent and context
  - Why unresolved: The lack of public datasets forces reliance on proprietary editorial review, making it difficult to compare this approach against external academic or industry solutions
  - What evidence would resolve it: The release of a public, annotated dataset containing query-result pairs labeled for contextual appropriateness across diverse demographics

- **Open Question 3**: To what extent does the time-adaptive scoring function (S(Li, t)) mitigate model obsolescence caused by rapid semantic shifts in language?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper identifies "evolving semantics" as a key motivation and proposes a temporal scoring function, but the evaluation covers only an eight-week period
  - Why unresolved: Language evolution is a long-term phenomenon; an 8-week trial is insufficient to validate if the dynamic scoring successfully adapts to significant cultural shifts or new slang without manual intervention
  - What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal analysis demonstrating the system maintaining high precision over multiple quarters or years as language trends change

## Limitations

- The lexicon sensitivity update mechanism relies on batch-averaged LLM feedback without establishing whether batch size was sufficient to prevent noisy score updates
- The time-adaptive scoring function is described but not empirically validated against alternative approaches like exponential decay or attention-weighted frequency
- Cultural and linguistic nuances in content moderation are acknowledged but not quantified; the LLM's performance on edge cases remains uncertain

## Confidence

- Core moderation performance (168→371 TP, 0.06→0.15 precision): Medium confidence based on eight-week real-world deployment
- Lexicon update mechanism effectiveness: Low confidence due to lack of batch size validation and alternative method comparisons
- LLM validation quality on edge cases: Low confidence due to acknowledged cultural context limitations

## Next Checks

1. **Batch size sensitivity analysis**: Test how varying |B| affects precision stability across weeks to confirm updates are not dominated by outlier validation scores
2. **LLM vs human editorial benchmark**: Compare LLM validation accuracy against a sample of manually reviewed flagged instances to quantify automation quality
3. **Cross-platform generalizability test**: Apply the same framework to a different content domain (e.g., news or social media) to assess whether time-adaptive lexicons transfer effectively
