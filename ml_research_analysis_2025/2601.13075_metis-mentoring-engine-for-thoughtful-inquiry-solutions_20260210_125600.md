# METIS: Mentoring Engine for Thoughtful Inquiry & Solutions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.13075
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13075
- Authors: Abhinav Rajeev Kumar; Dhruv Trehan; Paras Chopra
- Reference count: 3
- Key outcome: LLM judges preferred METIS to Claude Sonnet 4.5 in 71% and to GPT-5 in 54% of pairwise comparisons; student-perspective rubric scores were higher across all stages, with largest gains in document-grounded stages D-F.

## Executive Summary
METIS is a tool-augmented AI mentor designed to guide undergraduate researchers through six writing stages (Pre-idea through Final) with stage-aware routing and document grounding. The system combines literature search, curated guidelines, methodology checks, and session memory with explicit self-explanation blocks. In single-turn evaluations, METIS outperformed baselines on LLM-judge preferences and student-perspective rubric scores, with gains concentrated in stages where document grounding was available.

## Method Summary
METIS uses a base Kimi-k2-0905 model with prompt-based stage detection and tool routing. The system processes conversation context to infer the current writing stage (A-F), then selects appropriate tools including Research Guidelines (RAG), Literature Search (arXiv/OpenReview), Methodology Checks, and Session Memory. Responses include explicit Intuition and Why this is principled blocks, next steps, and citations. Evaluation used 90 single-turn prompts and 5 multi-turn scenarios against GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 baselines, with LLM judges and student-perspective rubrics.

## Key Results
- METIS achieved 71% pairwise preference over Claude Sonnet 4.5 and 54% over GPT-5 in LLM-judge evaluations
- Student-perspective rubric scores were higher across all stages, with largest gains in document-grounded stages D-F
- In multi-turn scenarios, METIS achieved slightly higher final quality than GPT-5 with minimal efficiency trade-off
- Gains concentrated where document grounding was available; failure modes included premature tool routing and occasional stage misclassification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Stage-aware routing may improve tool selection relevance by matching guidance to the user's current progress point.
- Mechanism: A lightweight stage detector infers the current writing stage (A–F) from conversation context; the tool router then selects appropriate tools based on stage-specific needs.
- Core assumption: Research mentorship has stage-dependent information needs that general-purpose chat does not explicitly model.
- Evidence anchors: Gains concentrate in document-grounded stages (D–F); stage detection implemented via prompt instructions analyzing conversation context; weak direct evidence from corpus.
- Break condition: Stage misclassification leads to inappropriate tool routing; paper reports this as a failure mode.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Grounding responses in curated guidelines and retrieved literature may reduce hallucinated guidance and increase actionability.
- Mechanism: METIS retrieves from Research Guidelines, Literature Search, and attached documents; responses cite sources explicitly using [file:page] format.
- Core assumption: Retrieved grounding materials are relevant, accurate, and sufficient for the query.
- Evidence anchors: METIS grounds advice in conference instructions, research guides, and literature; near-perfect citation validity and strong stage awareness reported; neighbor papers suggest grounding helps but don't directly validate.
- Break condition: Shallow grounding reduces benefit; paper lists this as a failure mode.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Structured self-explanation blocks may help learners internalize reasoning and improve follow-up questions.
- Mechanism: Every response includes "Intuition" and "Why this is principled" blocks exposing the advisor's reasoning explicitly.
- Core assumption: Learners benefit from seeing reasoning structure, not just conclusions.
- Evidence anchors: Not explicitly tested as isolated mechanism; blocks presented to learners and used by rubrics; no direct corpus evidence on self-explanation effects.
- Break condition: If blocks become boilerplate or disconnected from user context, they may be ignored.

## Foundational Learning

- **Stage-aware workflow design**
  - Why needed here: METIS divides research into six stages with different tool needs; understanding this progression is prerequisite to debugging routing behavior.
  - Quick check question: Given a user asking "How do I design ablations for my draft experiment?", which stage (A–F) and which tools should be invoked?

- **RAG fidelity and citation validity**
  - Why needed here: The system's gains depend on retrieved grounding being faithful to sources; you must diagnose when retrieval fails vs. synthesis fails.
  - Quick check question: If a response cites [paper:3] but the claim isn't supported on page 3, is this a retrieval failure, synthesis failure, or both?

- **LLM-as-judge evaluation tradeoffs**
  - Why needed here: All reported gains use LLM judges; understanding position bias, verbosity bias, and rubric design is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: The pairwise protocol uses three diverse judges—why might this reduce but not eliminate systematic bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Stage Detector (prompt-based) → Tool Router (prompt-based) → Tools [Research Guidelines (RAG), Literature Search (arXiv/OpenReview), Methodology Checks, Session Memory] → Agent Synthesis (Kimi-k2-0905) → Response with [Intuition block, Why principled block, Next steps, Citations]

- **Critical path:**
  - First inference: Stage detection from conversation context (Stage C.7)
  - Second: Tool selection based on stage + query type (Section C.4)
  - Third: Retrieval from guidelines/docs, synthesis with explicit citations (Section C.5)
  - Fourth: Output structured with self-explanation blocks (Section C.8)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Heuristic routing vs. learned router: Current routing uses prompt instructions; paper suggests future work on learning from tool-trace logs.
  - Turn overhead vs. quality: Multi-turn results show METIS takes slightly more turns for higher final quality.
  - Guidelines tool invocation: Observational differences when guidelines are invoked vs. not, but this is non-randomized and potentially confounded.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Premature tool routing: Tools invoked when simple conversational response would suffice.
  - Shallow grounding: Retrieved context too generic or insufficient for query depth.
  - Stage misclassification: Responses misaligned with user's actual progress.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Stage detection accuracy audit: Run held-out prompts through stage detector; compare predicted stage vs. ground-truth stage labels; quantify misclassification rate by stage.
  2. Ablate Research Guidelines tool: Run METIS with guidelines tool disabled on same 90 prompts; compare pairwise win rates and student rubric scores to isolate contribution.
  3. Retrieval depth vs. response quality: For document-grounded stages (D–F), vary number of retrieved snippets (k=1, 3, 5); measure RAG fidelity, citation quality, and actionability to find saturation point.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do learned routing mechanisms improve upon the current heuristic, prompt-based routing in METIS?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion lists a "clear next step is to learn the router/evidence selector from tool-trace logs" to optimize performance.
- Why unresolved: The current system relies on prompt instructions for stage detection and tool selection rather than a model fine-tuned on interaction data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison between the current heuristic router and a learned router on tool-selection accuracy and final task success rates.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do the observed improvements in LLM-judge rubric scores translate to actual longitudinal gains in student research skills?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly note that "Student-judge trends are rubric-based proxies rather than longitudinal learning outcomes."
- Why unresolved: The study evaluates immediate response quality using synthetic personas and judges, not the long-term development of real students.
- What evidence would resolve it: A user study tracking the research output and skill acquisition of undergraduates using METIS versus baselines over a full semester.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What interventions can improve METIS's performance in early, ungrounded stages (A–B) where gains are currently modest?
- Basis in paper: Results show gains are "largest at document-grounded stages (D–F)" and "modest at early stages (A–B)," suggesting the current grounding tools are less effective for ideation.
- Why unresolved: The system relies heavily on document retrieval, which may not suit the abstract nature of early-stage brainstorming.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful integration of abstract ideation tools that yield statistically significant rubric improvements in stages A and B.

## Limitations

- Single-turn evaluation bias: All gains reported via LLM judges rather than actual learners
- Non-randomized tool invocation: Observational differences when guidelines are invoked are confounded by prompt/stage selection
- Tool routing heuristics underspecified: "Simple" routing described only in prompt instructions without quantified accuracy

## Confidence

- **High**: Document-grounded gains (stages D-F) where METIS outperforms baselines on citation validity, evidence integrity, and student rubric scores
- **Medium**: Overall pairwise preference (71% vs Claude, 54% vs GPT-5) given reliance on LLM judges with known position bias
- **Low**: Claims about multi-turn efficiency given minimal turn difference (1.4 vs 1.0) and small effect size (+0.088 quality, p=0.043)

## Next Checks

1. Stage detection accuracy audit: Measure stage misclassification rate on held-out prompts; quantify stage-awareness scores by ground-truth stage
2. Ablate Research Guidelines tool: Compare METIS performance with guidelines tool disabled vs enabled on identical prompts to isolate contribution
3. Retrieval depth experiment: For document-grounded stages, vary retrieved snippet count (k=1,3,5) and measure saturation point for citation quality and actionability
