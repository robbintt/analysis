# Regularization Through Reasoning: Systematic Improvements in Language Model Classification via Explanation-Enhanced Fine-Tuning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.02044
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02044
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Adding explanatory text to classification labels during fine-tuning consistently improves language model performance across six conversational quality assessment tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that adding brief explanatory text to classification labels during fine-tuning improves language model performance across multiple conversational quality assessment tasks. Fine-tuning a 7B-parameter model with label-plus-explanation pairs consistently outperformed label-only training across six diverse conversational datasets and three quality dimensions (naturalness, comprehensiveness, on-topic adherence). Remarkably, even incoherent but vocabulary-aligned random tokens as pseudo-explanations improved performance over label-only training, suggesting that extra token budget provides regularization benefits. Internal analysis revealed that explanation-augmented models exhibit higher activation entropy in intermediate layers and sharper output predictions, consistent with increased deliberation before decision-making.

## Method Summary
The method involves fine-tuning language models using classification labels enhanced with brief explanatory text. The approach tests LLaMA-3.1-8B across six conversational datasets (Chatbot Arena Conversations, HH-RLHF, Amazon QA, CoQA, Cornell Movie Dialog) with three quality dimensions. The study compares explanation-enhanced training against label-only training, analyzing token-level behavior using Ecco to examine entropy patterns and activation differences across 32 model layers. Experiments test both human-written explanations and model-generated pseudo-explanations, including random token sequences, to isolate the effect of additional context versus genuine reasoning.

## Key Results
- Explanation-augmented fine-tuning consistently improved accuracy across all six tested datasets and three quality dimensions
- Random but vocabulary-aligned token sequences as pseudo-explanations still outperformed label-only training
- Explanation-enhanced models showed higher activation entropy in intermediate layers and sharper final predictions
- The approach works with both genuine rationales and carefully constructed random sequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Explanation-enhanced classification improves accuracy by forcing structured reasoning that surfaces implicit quality judgments
- Mechanism: When LLMs generate explanations before classification, they decompose complex conversational quality into interpretable components (e.g., coherence, relevance, completeness), reducing shortcut reliance and improving generalization across datasets
- Core assumption: The act of articulating reasons causes the model to engage deeper semantic processing rather than surface-level pattern matching
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using explanations as reasoning chains... achieved best performance"
  - [section 4.1] Shows significant accuracy gains (e.g., ChatbotAC Naturalness: 82.2%→96.3% with explanations)
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—no corpus papers explicitly study explanation-driven classification for conversation quality
- Break condition: If models use explanations merely as templates rather than genuine reasoning (detectable via low explanation diversity or poor alignment with human reasoning)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: System instructions shape attention patterns toward task-relevant conversational features
- Mechanism: Explicit task framing via instructions activates specialized knowledge from pre-training, steering latent representations toward quality dimensions rather than generic response patterns
- Core assumption: Pre-trained LLMs encode rich but dormant conversational quality knowledge that can be accessed via appropriate prompting
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "With system instructions... improvement across all dimensions"
  - [section 5] Output token ranking analysis shows early-layer divergence between conditions with/without instructions
  - [corpus] Anchored SFT (arXiv:2509.23753) suggests instruction-based guidance improves task alignment
- Break condition: If performance gains disappear when instructions are paraphrased or translated (indicating memorization rather than attention shaping)

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-dimensional quality assessment emerges from compositional reasoning over pre-trained conversational patterns
- Mechanism: LLMs decompose quality into orthogonal dimensions (naturalness, comprehensiveness, on-topic) using learned conversational priors, enabling cross-dataset generalization without dimension-specific training
- Core assumption: Conversational quality dimensions are sufficiently universal across domains that pre-training provides a transferable foundation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Tested across "5 diverse conversational datasets" with consistent improvements
  - [section 4.2] Cross-dataset transfer shows non-trivial performance even on unseen datasets
  - [corpus] Latent traits paper (arXiv:2509.13624) suggests cross-task transfer depends on shared latent structure
- Break condition: If performance collapses when datasets have qualitatively different quality distributions (e.g., technical vs. casual conversations)

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **LLM-based classification with natural language labels**
  - Why needed here: The method uses text-based quality labels (1-5 ratings) rather than numerical vectors, requiring understanding of label semantics
  - Quick check question: Can you predict how an LLM might misinterpret "3" vs. "neutral" as quality labels?

- Concept: **Explanation-enhanced learning (chain-of-thought for classification)**
  - Why needed here: Core technique—generating rationales before predictions to improve both accuracy and interpretability
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes genuine reasoning chains from post-hoc rationalization in LLM outputs?

- Concept: **Conversational quality dimensions (naturalness, comprehensiveness, on-topic)**
  - Why needed here: The three evaluation axes have different characteristics—naturalness is subjective, comprehensiveness requires domain knowledge, on-topic needs context tracking
  - Quick check question: Which dimension would be hardest for a model trained only on single-turn QA data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer -> Prompting layer -> Model layer (LLaMA-3.1-8B) -> Evaluation layer (Ecco analysis)

- Critical path:
  1. Prepare dataset with explanation pairs (original + explanation-enhanced)
  2. Format prompts with/without system instructions
  3. Generate classifications and explanations
  4. Extract token rankings and entropy per layer
  5. Compare accuracy and interpretability metrics across conditions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Model size vs. interpretability**: Smaller models (8B) allow layer-wise analysis but may underperform larger models
  - **Explanation source**: Human-written vs. model-generated explanations trade authenticity for scalability
  - **Binary vs. ordinal classification**: 5-point scale captures nuance but increases difficulty vs. binary good/bad

- Failure signatures:
  - **Explanation-quality mismatch**: High accuracy but explanations contradict predictions (indicates shortcut use)
  - **Dataset-specific overfitting**: Large accuracy gaps between training and test datasets
  - **Dimension confusion**: Model mixes naturalness and on-topic scores (check cross-dimension correlations)
  - **Entropy collapse**: Final-layer entropy near zero across all predictions (overconfident but potentially brittle)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation study**: Remove explanations OR system instructions individually to isolate contribution of each component
  2. **Cross-dataset stress test**: Train on 4 datasets, test on held-out 5th—measure which dimensions transfer best
  3. **Explanation probing**: Use the output token ranking analysis to identify which layers specialize in each quality dimension (e.g., early layers for surface fluency, middle layers for relevance)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the inclusion of explanations alter the entropy reduction trajectory in the mid-to-late layers (layers 15–30) specifically for the CoQA dataset compared to the Chatbot Arena Conversations dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Figures 50 and 62 display the "Relative Entropy" difference plots for Chatbot Arena and CoQA, respectively, showing variance in how "With Explanation" conditions deviate from "Without Explanations" across layers.
- Why unresolved: While the difference plots show distinct fluctuation patterns for each dataset, the text does not explain why the entropy impact of explanations is more volatile in CoQA than in Chatbot Arena.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative statistical analysis of the variance in entropy differences between the two datasets across specific layer intervals.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the model exhibit faster convergence in output token rankings for "chosen" responses compared to "rejected" responses in the HH-RLHF dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Figures 33–35 (HH-RLHF chosen) and Figures 36–38 (HH-RLHF rejected) present output token rankings, allowing for a visual comparison of how quickly probabilities approach 1.0 across layers.
- Why unresolved: The figures present the data, but the paper does not quantify if the "chosen" responses stabilize their top rankings in earlier layers compared to the "rejected" ones.
- What evidence would resolve it: Layer-wise saturation curves measuring the number of layers required for top-ranked tokens to exceed a 0.95 probability threshold for both subsets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the causal factor for the significant drop in relative entropy difference (negative dip) observed around layer 10 in the "Naturalness" dimension of the AmazonQA dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Figure 57 shows the "Difference" plot for AmazonQA Naturalness, where the line dips below zero around layer 10 before rising, indicating a specific reaction to explanations at that depth.
- Why unresolved: The figure displays the phenomenon, but the text provides no explanation for why explanations would temporarily lower entropy specifically at this mid-layer stage for this specific dimension.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study analyzing the activation patterns of layer 10 attention heads when explanations are present versus absent.

## Limitations

- The study doesn't establish causal links between intermediate representations (entropy patterns) and final accuracy gains
- Performance gains may not generalize to non-conversational domains or highly technical contexts
- The finding that random tokens improve performance raises questions about the minimum explanation quality threshold

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core empirical finding that explanation-augmented fine-tuning improves classification accuracy across multiple datasets and quality dimensions
- **Medium Confidence**: The interpretation that higher intermediate-layer entropy reflects "increased deliberation" rather than alternative explanations like optimization dynamics
- **Low Confidence**: The mechanism claim that explanations work by "forcing structured reasoning" rather than through simpler explanations like increased token budget

## Next Checks

1. **Alternative Prompting Study**: Test whether explanation benefits persist when explanations are placed after classification rather than before, or when interleaved within reasoning chains

2. **Quality Threshold Analysis**: Systematically vary explanation quality from high-quality human rationales through coherent AI-generated explanations to random token sequences

3. **Cross-Domain Transfer Test**: Evaluate the approach on non-conversational text classification tasks (e.g., scientific abstracts, news articles) to test whether explanation benefits generalize beyond dialogue-focused domains
