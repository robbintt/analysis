# Symbol-Temporal Consistency Self-supervised Learning for Robust Time Series Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.19654
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19654
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: STC framework achieves 0.901 average accuracy on PAMAP2 cross-subject classification, outperforming TFC (0.888)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Symbol-Temporal Consistency (STC), a self-supervised learning framework that combines symbolic representations with temporal data for robust time series classification. The method transforms raw time series into bag-of-symbol representations that are inherently invariant to temporal distortions, then enforces consistency between symbolic and temporal embeddings through a contrastive learning framework. Experiments on the PAMAP2 dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for cross-subject classification tasks where distribution shifts are common.

## Method Summary
STC integrates symbolic and temporal representations through a consistency-based contrastive learning framework. Raw time series are discretized into bag-of-symbol representations using σ-based cutlines, then augmented and encoded independently from the temporal branch. Three contrastive losses train the system: time-based (L_T), symbol-based (L_S), and consistency (L_TS) between temporal and symbolic embeddings. The framework uses a dual-encoder architecture with separate projectors for each modality. At inference, only temporal embeddings (z_T) are used, as ablation studies show combined embeddings degrade performance.

## Key Results
- STC achieves 0.901 average classification accuracy on PAMAP2 cross-subject tasks
- Outperforms TFC baseline (0.888), MLP (0.872), and Logistic Regression (0.871)
- Demonstrates particular effectiveness when testing across different subjects
- Shows ablation evidence that z_T alone outperforms z_T+z_S at test time (0.901 vs 0.863)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Bag-of-symbol representations provide inherent invariance to temporal distortions in time series data.
- **Mechanism:** Raw time series values are discretized into n symbols using σ-based cutlines, then aggregated into frequency counts that discard temporal ordering. This abstraction removes sensitivity to when patterns occur (location shift), how long they last (warping), and minor value fluctuations (noise).
- **Core assumption:** The discriminative information for classification exists in pattern frequency rather than precise temporal ordering.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The bag-of-symbol representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts, and noise existed in time series data"
  - [Section III.C] "By focusing on symbol frequency rather than temporal order, this approach reduces sensitivity to noise and suits tasks where timing is less critical"
  - [corpus] Related work on symbolic representations for time series exists (SAX-VSM mentioned in refs), but corpus papers do not directly validate bag-of-symbol invariance properties for SSL—limited corpus support.
- **Break condition:** Fails when precise temporal dynamics (e.g., heart rate variability, sequential dependencies) are critical for the downstream task.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Cross-domain consistency regularization between symbolic and temporal embeddings forces the temporal encoder to learn shift-invariant representations.
- **Mechanism:** The consistency loss (L_TS) penalizes divergence between z_T (temporal embeddings) and z_S (symbolic embeddings). Since z_S is inherently invariant to warping/shifts, minimizing this divergence transfers those invariance properties to z_T through gradient pressure during training.
- **Core assumption:** Symbolic representations capture semantically meaningful patterns that the temporal representation should preserve.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III.G] "the time-symbolic loss enforces consistency between the time-based z_T and symbolic-based embeddings z_S"
  - [Section I] "converting the samples into symbolic representations reveals their similarity" where raw temporal data appeared dissimilar
  - [corpus] Joint embedding approaches (arXiv:2509.25449 "Joint Embeddings Go Temporal") support multi-view consistency principles, though not specific to symbolic-temporal pairing.
- **Break condition:** Fails if symbolic representation discards task-critical information that cannot be recovered through consistency pressure alone.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Independent contrastive learning within each domain before cross-domain alignment creates robust feature extractors for both views.
- **Mechanism:** Separate contrastive losses (L_T for temporal, L_S for symbolic) train domain-specific encoders to distinguish positive pairs (original + augmented) from negatives. This preconditions each encoder to capture meaningful structure before consistency loss binds them.
- **Core assumption:** Each representation type (temporal vs. symbolic) contains sufficient signal for self-supervised discrimination when augmented appropriately.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III.F] "the time-based loss is described as..." and "the symbol-based loss aims to ensure that the symbolic encoder E_S generates embeddings that are invariant to symbolic perturbations"
  - [Section III.B] "embeddings are then used to perform self-contrastive learning on the symbolic and temporal embeddings independently to enhance robustness"
  - [corpus] Self-supervised contrastive learning for time series is well-established (TS2Vec, TFC in refs; corpus confirms contrastive SSL viability for medical/wearable time series).
- **Break condition:** Fails if augmentations are too aggressive (destroy signal) or too weak (no discrimination challenge), causing encoder collapse or trivial solutions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning (SimCLR paradigm)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire framework builds on SimCLR-style instance discrimination—you must understand how positive/negative pairs, temperature parameters (τ), and InfoNCE-style losses work to interpret L_T and L_S.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why increasing the temperature τ makes the contrastive loss "softer" and what happens if τ → 0?

- **Concept: Symbolic Aggregation (SAX family)**
  - **Why needed here:** The discretization function in Section III.C creates bag-of-symbol representations—you need to grasp how σ-based bin boundaries create value-space quantization and why histogram aggregation discards temporal structure.
  - **Quick check question:** If you increase the number of symbols n from 64 to 128, would you expect more or less robustness to noise? Why?

- **Concept: Multi-view Consistency Learning**
  - **Why needed here:** The L_TS consistency loss assumes that different "views" of the same data should embed similarly—you must understand why cross-view alignment transfers invariance properties between representations.
  - **Quick check question:** What would happen to training dynamics if z_S and z_T were randomly permuted relative to each other before computing L_TS?

- **Critical path:** Input → dual preprocessing (temporal + symbolic) → dual augmentation → dual encoders → dual projectors → three-way loss computation. Only z_T is used at inference time.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Number of symbols (n=64):** More symbols = finer discretization (captures subtle patterns but reduces noise robustness); fewer symbols = coarser (more robust but may lose discriminative detail).
  - **λ weighting consistency loss:** High λ forces stronger alignment (may over-regularize temporal encoder); low λ underutilizes symbolic guidance.
  - **Augmentation strength:** Symbol insertion/deletion must be aggressive enough to create training signal but preserve semantic content; temporal noise injection must respect sensor characteristics.
  - **Inference embedding choice:** Table II shows z_T alone (0.901) outperforms z_T+z_S combined (0.863)—suggesting symbolic embeddings add noise at test time despite their training utility.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Mode collapse:** If consistency loss dominates (λ too high), z_T may converge to constant vectors that match z_S trivially—monitor embedding variance.
  - **Symbolic encoder undertraining:** If L_S doesn't decrease, symbolic encoder learns nothing useful → L_TS provides meaningless supervision.
  - **Cross-subject generalization gap:** If source→target accuracy varies wildly (e.g., 0.42 to 0.966 in Table II), the model overfits source-specific patterns rather than learning invariant features.
  - **Distribution shift unaddressed:** If test subjects exhibit behaviors outside ±3σ training range, discretization places them in overflow bins → symbol representation degrades.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline contrastive SSL (TFC vs. STC components):** Implement only L_T (temporal contrastive loss) without symbolic components, measure cross-subject accuracy to isolate symbolic contribution. Target: expect ~0.888 baseline per Table I.
  2. **Symbol count sensitivity analysis:** Vary n ∈ {16, 32, 64, 128} on held-out subject, plot accuracy vs. n. Hypothesis: performance peaks at intermediate n where noise robustness balances discriminative power.
  3. **Consistency loss ablation:** Train with λ ∈ {0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0} and analyze embedding space using t-SNE. Target: λ=0 should show no z_T-z_S alignment; optimal λ should show cluster structure preservation across views.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why does omitting symbolic embeddings ($z_s$) during the inference phase lead to higher classification accuracy compared to using combined embeddings, despite the symbolic modality being integral to the training consistency loss?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In the ablation study (Section IV-A), the authors note that using only temporal embeddings ($z_t$) yielded an average accuracy of 0.901, outperforming the combined $z_t + z_s$ strategy (0.863), leading to the conclusion that omitting $z_s$ at test time improves performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this counter-intuitive phenomenon but does not provide a theoretical explanation for why the symbolic representation acts as a beneficial training guide but appears to degrade the representation space when included during downstream evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A structural analysis of the latent space (e.g., probing for redundancy or conflicting gradients between $z_t$ and $z_s$) or experiments measuring the mutual information between the embeddings and the labels would clarify if $z_s$ introduces noise at inference.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is the Symbol-Temporal Consistency framework effective for datasets with high class granularity or domains outside of physical activity recognition, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) or electroencephalogram (EEG) signals?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The evaluation is conducted exclusively on the PAMAP2 dataset, restricted to a simple 3-class problem (standing, walking, running) using only 5 of the 9 available subjects.
- Why unresolved: While the method claims to address general "digital health" noise and warping, the limited scope of the experiments (simple motor activities) does not demonstrate if the "bag-of-symbol" approach loses critical fine-grained temporal information necessary for distinguishing complex medical patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the framework on datasets with a significantly larger number of classes (e.g., UCR archive) or on signal types where phase/warping is diagnostically significant would test the generalizability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the model's performance to the hyperparameters of the discretization function, specifically the number of symbols ($n$) and the range of standard deviations used for cut lines?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section III-C defines a specific discretization configuration (64 symbols, $\pm 3\sigma$ range), but the paper provides no ablative analysis on how these specific choices impact the model's ability to handle noise versus loss of information.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the observed robustness is intrinsic to the method or dependent on a "goldilocks" tuning of symbol granularity that may not transfer to data with different statistical distributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A parameter sweep varying the symbol count and $\sigma$ bounds on the PAMAP2 dataset would establish the robustness of the symbolic transformation component.

## Limitations
- Architecture Specification Gap: Encoder architectures (E_T, E_S, P_T, P_S) are unspecified, creating fundamental ambiguity in reproducing reported results.
- Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Critical hyperparameters (τ, λ, δ, batch size, augmentation strengths) are absent, suggesting results may be highly sensitive to tuning.
- Symbolic Representation Robustness: While bag-of-symbol claims insensitivity to temporal distortions, the method discards precise timing information—potentially losing task-critical patterns for complex activities.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The conceptual framework of symbolic-temporal consistency learning is sound and technically coherent.
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism of invariance transfer from symbolic to temporal representations is plausible but untested in isolation.
- **Low Confidence**: Numerical results and specific performance claims cannot be verified without architecture and hyperparameter details.

## Next Checks
1. **Component Ablation Analysis**: Implement and test each loss component independently (L_T only, L_S only, L_TS only) to quantify individual contributions and verify the claimed benefits of cross-view consistency.
2. **Distribution Shift Stress Test**: Systematically evaluate performance across source-target subject pairs with varying behavioral patterns (sedentary vs. active, indoor vs. outdoor) to identify failure modes and generalization boundaries.
3. **Symbolic Representation Sensitivity**: Conduct controlled experiments varying symbol count (n=16, 32, 64, 128) and discretization parameters to map the robustness-performance tradeoff and identify optimal configuration for PAMAP2.
