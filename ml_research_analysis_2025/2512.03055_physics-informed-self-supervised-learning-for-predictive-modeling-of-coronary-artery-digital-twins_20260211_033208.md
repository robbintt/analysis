# Physics-informed self-supervised learning for predictive modeling of coronary artery digital twins

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03055
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03055
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Physics-informed self-supervised learning framework achieves AUROC 0.724 for cardiovascular event prediction using 3D coronary digital twins

## Executive Summary
This paper presents PINS-CAD, a framework that predicts cardiovascular events using 3D coronary artery digital twins reconstructed from angiographic images. The approach combines physics-informed self-supervised learning with graph neural networks to predict pressure and flow patterns from anatomical geometry without requiring labeled hemodynamic data or computationally expensive CFD simulations. By pretraining on 200,000 synthetic coronary geometries augmented using anatomical-aware methods and guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations, the model learns physiologically consistent representations that generalize to clinical risk prediction.

## Method Summary
PINS-CAD reconstructs 3D coronary digital twins from biplane angiographic images and represents them as graphs with 64,000 nodes (1000 cross-sections × 64 boundary points). The framework uses a hierarchical GNN encoder with Top-K pooling to extract features, which are then aggregated to centerline points. During pretraining, the model predicts pressure and flow fields using a physics-informed loss based on 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, trained on synthetic data generated through anatomy-aware geometric augmentation. The pretrained encoder is frozen during fine-tuning, where a classification head predicts cardiovascular events using both geometric features and clinical tabular data.

## Key Results
- PINS-CAD achieves AUROC 0.724 for cardiovascular event prediction on FAME2 dataset
- Outperforms clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines (SysAblation AUROC 0.703)
- Generates interpretable pressure and fractional flow reserve curves that capture stenosis-specific hemodynamic patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Physics-Informed Inductive Bias
The model embeds 1D Navier-Stokes residual constraints into the loss function, forcing it to learn hemodynamically consistent representations without ground-truth labels. This acts as a regularizer that constrains the hypothesis space to physiologically plausible solutions.

### Mechanism 2: Anatomy-Aware Geometric Augmentation (A3M)
Synthetic data generation via recombining centerlines and radius profiles expands the geometric support of the training distribution, improving robustness. The model sees 200,000 variations, preventing overfitting to the limited anatomical quirks of the clinical cohort.

### Mechanism 3: Graph-Based Topological Reasoning
Representing the artery as a graph preserves topological connectivity, allowing the GNN to learn spatially dependent pressure gradients better than point-cloud methods. The edge construction enables message passing along the vessel axis for computing required gradients.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**
  - Why needed here: Standard neural networks approximate data distributions. PINNs approximate solution functions to PDEs.
  - Quick check question: Does the model require labeled pressure data to calculate the Navier-Stokes loss during pretraining? (No, it uses the equation itself).

- **Concept: Graph Convolutions (Message Passing)**
  - Why needed here: The model uses a hierarchical GCN encoder where node features are updated by aggregating features from immediate neighbors.
  - Quick check question: How does adding an edge between a node and its neighbor in the adjacent cross-section help predict pressure? (It allows the model to "sense" the vessel's direction and rate of expansion/contraction).

- **Concept: Self-Supervised Pretraining vs. Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: The model learns in two distinct phases - pretraining learns "how blood flows" (physics), fine-tuning learns "which flow patterns kill" (clinical risk).
  - Quick check question: Why freeze the encoder during the clinical fine-tuning phase? (To prevent the model from overfitting to the small clinical dataset and forgetting the general hemodynamic physics learned from the synthetic set).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (3D Digital Twin) -> Graph Construction -> Hierarchical GNN Encoder -> Centerline Aggregation -> Physics-Informed Pretraining Head -> Frozen Encoder -> Classification Head
- **Critical path:** The Centerline Aggregation module bridges graph node features (boundary) to centerline points. If this loses geometric details of the boundary (e.g., stenosis shape), the physics loss cannot enforce proper pressure drops.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - 1D vs 3D Physics: Uses 1D NS for speed and differentiability vs. lower accuracy in complex flows compared to 3D CFD
  - Synthetic Pretraining: Scales data easily vs. risk of "sim-to-real" gap where synthetic physics don't perfectly match patient-specific tissue properties
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Loss NaN/Explode: Check normalization of inputs in NS equation, especially $\frac{1}{A(x)}$ terms
  - Flat Pressure Curves: If physics loss weight is too low, model may ignore geometry and predict mean values
  - Overfitting on Finetuning: If encoder is not frozen, performance may initially improve but fail to generalize
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check: Train on straight cylinder with constant radius, verify predicted $\Delta P$ matches Hagen-Poiseuille solution
  2. Ablation: Compare PINS-CAD against identical architecture trained with only MSE loss on CFD data vs. only Physics loss
  3. Synthetic Diversity: Train models on A3M augmentations vs. standard scaling/rotation only, compare on "DS-FFR discordant" subgroup

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question 1:** What is the quantitative accuracy of the self-supervised pressure predictions compared to invasive measurements or high-fidelity CFD simulations?
  - Basis: The Discussion states pressure estimation is "not as quantitatively accurate as CFD-derived measurements" without formal quantitative validation.
  - Why unresolved: The model predicts pressure to learn representations, but absolute numerical error relative to gold standard remains unquantified.
  - Evidence needed: Validation study reporting correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis between predicted pressures and invasively measured FFR or 3D CFD results.

- **Question 2:** Can advanced multimodal fusion strategies improve performance over simple concatenation for integrating clinical tabular data?
  - Basis: The Discussion notes current fusion "relied on simple feature concatenation" and suggests investigating "more advanced fusion strategies."
  - Why unresolved: Simple concatenation may fail to capture complex interactions between geometric/hemodynamic features and systemic clinical risk factors.
  - Evidence needed: Comparative results showing attention-based or gating fusion mechanisms yield significant improvements in AUC or F1-score.

- **Question 3:** How well does PINS-CAD generalize to external cohorts with diverse demographics and imaging protocols?
  - Basis: Authors state "Future work should incorporate external validation using larger and more heterogeneous cohorts."
  - Why unresolved: The model was trained on FAME2 dataset which may not capture global diversity of patient anatomies and imaging standards.
  - Evidence needed: Evaluation on independent datasets from different geographical regions or hospital systems showing maintained AUC and calibration.

## Limitations

- Physics-informed pretraining approach shows only modest performance improvement (AUROC 0.724 vs 0.703) over data-driven baselines
- Clinical dataset contains only 635 patients with 176 events, creating potential overfitting concerns despite physics regularization
- Synthetic data augmentation pipeline lacks validation that recombined anatomies represent physiologically plausible flow conditions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core methodology of physics-informed self-supervision with graph neural networks is technically sound and well-implemented; ablation studies demonstrating value of pretraining and graph representation are methodologically rigorous
- **Medium Confidence:** Clinical performance claims are credible given established FAME2 dataset, but modest improvement over baselines suggests limited practical impact; synthetic data generation pipeline is innovative but not thoroughly validated
- **Low Confidence:** Assumption that 1D NS equations capture all relevant hemodynamics for risk prediction is questionable for complex flow patterns in bifurcations; generalizability of 200K synthetic pretraining samples to real anatomies remains unverified

## Next Checks

1. **Physiological Validation:** Compare PINS-CAD's predicted pressure/flow patterns against high-fidelity 3D CFD simulations on patient cases to quantify accuracy of 1D physics approximation for risk-relevant hemodynamic features

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization:** Evaluate pretrained model's performance on independent coronary dataset (different hospital/country) without fine-tuning to assess whether physics-informed representations capture universal hemodynamic principles

3. **Ablation of Synthetic Diversity:** Systematically vary A3M augmentation parameters to identify minimum synthetic data requirements and determine whether full 200K samples provide proportional benefit or represent over-engineering for downstream task
