core_contribution: This paper introduces MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework that enhances
  the effectiveness of Large Language Model (LLM) agents by conditioning them with
  psychological personality profiles based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).
  The method uses prompt-based priming to instill specific MBTI traits and validates
  the induced behaviors using the official 16Personalities test.

# Psychologically Enhanced AI Agents

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: MBTI personality priming via prompts induces consistent behavioral biases in LLMs without fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework that enhances LLM agent effectiveness by conditioning them with Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality profiles through prompt engineering. The method primes agents with distinct personality archetypes (e.g., Thinking vs. Feeling types) and validates the induced behaviors using the official 16Personalities test. Results demonstrate consistent, interpretable behavioral biases across tasks: emotionally expressive agents excel in narrative generation while analytically primed agents adopt more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. The framework also supports structured multi-agent communication where self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning quality.

## Method Summary
The MBTI-in-Thoughts framework conditions LLM agents with psychological personality profiles via prompt-based priming, validated across affective (storytelling) and cognitive (game theory) tasks without requiring fine-tuning. Agents are primed with MBTI profiles injected into system prompts, then verified using the 16Personalities test API. The framework implements three communication protocols: Majority Voting, Interactive Communication, and Interactive Communication with Self-Reflection (scratchpad). The approach uses LangChain and LangGraph for implementation, testing across multiple models including GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, and Qwen variants on datasets like WRITING PROMPTS and SOCKET.

## Key Results
- Prompt-based priming consistently induces MBTI personality traits measurable via 16Personalities test scores
- "Feeling" type agents generate narratives with significantly higher emotional chargedness compared to "Thinking" types
- "Thinking" type agents show lower strategy switch rates and higher defection in game-theoretic scenarios
- Self-reflection prior to multi-agent interaction reduces echoing and improves cooperation quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Personality Priming via In-Context Learning (ICL)
The framework relies on prompt-based priming to induce measurable behavioral biases without weight updates. The model retrieves stereotypical associations linked to personality archetypes from its pre-training data, acting as a strong semantic prior that steers token generation probabilities toward specific styles (e.g., stable strategies vs. emotional narratives).

### Mechanism 2: Pre-Interaction Self-Reflection (The "Scratchpad" Effect)
Forcing agents to deliberate privately before engaging in multi-agent dialogue improves cooperation by creating cognitive independence. This prevents the group from collapsing into homogeneous echo chambers by committing agents to an internal rationale grounded in their personality profile before exposure to peer pressure.

### Mechanism 3: Cognitive-Affective Axis Alignment
Performance optimization occurs by matching the agent's dominant MBTI axis to the task nature. "Thinking" types show lower strategy switch rates and higher defection in games, while "Feeling" types generate higher emotional realism in narratives by aligning the agent's implicit reward function with the task's objective.

## Foundational Learning

**In-Context Learning (ICL):** This entire framework relies on prompt-based priming rather than fine-tuning. Understanding ICL explains why a prompt can temporarily rewrite an agent's behavior without changing its weights. *Quick check:* Can you explain why a "persona prompt" changes the model's output distribution without changing its weights?

**Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI):** The framework uses MBTI axes (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) as control variables. You must understand what "Thinking" vs. "Feeling" implies for agent behavior to design priming prompts. *Quick check:* Which MBTI axis did the paper find most difficult to prime/verify (hint: it relates to information processing)?

**Blackboard Architecture (Shared Memory):** The multi-agent system uses a "blackboard" for communication. Understanding this pattern is essential for managing the "Interactive Communication" protocols. *Quick check:* In the "Interactive Communication" protocol, how do agents access and modify the shared memory (blackboard) to reach consensus?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Primer -> Agent Core -> Scratchpad -> Blackboard -> Verifier

**Critical path:**
1. **Inject:** Load personality prompt (e.g., "You are an INTJ...") into the agent context
2. **Verify:** Run the agent against the 16Personalities test API to ensure priming "took"
3. **Reflect:** (Optional) Agent writes to private Scratchpad before acting
4. **Interact:** Agent reads Blackboard, appends reasoning, and updates state

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Explicit vs. Implicit Priming:** Explicitly naming the MBTI type is simpler but may trigger shallow stereotypes; implicit trait description is more robust but requires longer prompts
- **Speed vs. Robustness:** Adding the "Self-Reflection" step doubles inference cost but is required to prevent echoing in multi-agent setups

**Failure signatures:**
- **Echoing:** Agents repeat the same solution without progress (fix: enable Self-Reflection)
- **Axis Drift:** An "Introvert" agent starts acting like an "Extravert" in long conversations (fix: periodic re-priming)
- **S/N Confusion:** The Sensing/Intuition axis fails to separate, leading to indistinguishable behavior (acknowledged in Section 4.1)

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Sanity Check:** Prime an agent as "Feeling" and verify it scores high on the "Feeling" axis using the integrated 16Personalities test logic
2. **Narrative Test:** Run a "Thinking" vs. "Feeling" agent on a story prompt; compare "Emotional Chargedness" scores to confirm axis alignment
3. **Game Theory Test:** Pit a "Thinking" agent against a "Feeling" agent in the Prisoner's Dilemma; verify if the Thinking agent defects more often and switches strategy less often

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How can personality conditioning be made persistent or adaptive in long-horizon interactions?
2. Does psychological priming transfer effectively to multimodal or embodied AI agents?
3. What causes the relative instability of the Sensing/Intuition (S/N) axis compared to other MBTI dimensions?

## Limitations
- Relies on black-box evaluation via the official 16Personalities website API, introducing external dependencies
- Only conditions agents with one dominant MBTI profile rather than exploring mixed or multi-dimensional trait combinations
- Shows minimal behavioral variation for purely factual tasks, suggesting personality priming may be domain-constrained

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Prompt-based personality priming inducing measurable behavioral biases
- **Medium Confidence:** Self-reflection scratchpad effect improving multi-agent cooperation
- **Medium Confidence:** Cognitive-affective axis alignment hypothesis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an ablation study on prompt structure to quantify the contribution of explicit MBTI naming versus implicit trait description to behavioral consistency
2. Validate the framework on a third, distinct task domain (e.g., creative problem-solving) to test cognitive-affective axis alignment generalization
3. Implement longitudinal tracking of agent personality scores across extended conversations to quantify how quickly induced MBTI traits degrade and test re-priming effectiveness
