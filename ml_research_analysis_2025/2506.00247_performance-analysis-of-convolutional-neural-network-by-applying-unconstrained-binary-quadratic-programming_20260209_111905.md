# Performance Analysis of Convolutional Neural Network By Applying Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00247
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00247
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Hybrid QUBO-SGD method achieves 10–15% accuracy improvement over standard backpropagation on MNIST while maintaining similar execution times

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the computational challenges of training convolutional neural networks on large datasets by proposing a hybrid optimization method that combines Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The approach reformulates the loss function as a QUBO matrix, which is then solved via quantum annealing to guide weight updates. Evaluated on the MNIST dataset, the method demonstrates significant accuracy improvements over conventional backpropagation while maintaining competitive execution times. The research illustrates the potential of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in high-performance computing environments for deep learning applications.

## Method Summary
The proposed hybrid method integrates QUBO formulation with SGD for CNN training. The process involves converting the CNN loss function (MSE or CE) into a QUBO matrix, solving this optimization problem using quantum annealing (via D-Wave's neal simulator), and using the resulting binary solution to update network weights through SGD. The CNN architecture consists of two convolutional layers with 5×5 kernels and 2×2 pooling, followed by fully connected layers. The method is evaluated on the MNIST dataset with 10-fold cross-validation across different data sizes and learning rates, comparing against standard backpropagation and simulated annealing baselines.

## Key Results
- The hybrid QUBO-SGD approach achieves 10–15% accuracy improvement over standard backpropagation on MNIST
- MSE loss function exhibits superior performance compared to cross-entropy when reformulated as QUBO
- The method maintains similar execution times to backpropagation while providing accuracy gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Hybrid QUBO-SGD optimization can accelerate CNN training convergence while maintaining competitive execution time compared to backpropagation.
- **Mechanism:** The loss function (MSE or CE) is reformulated as a QUBO matrix (Q-form), which is then solved via quantum annealing (or simulator). The resulting solution guides weight updates through SGD, effectively replacing iterative gradient descent with a combinatorial optimization step per batch.
- **Core assumption:** The loss landscape can be meaningfully discretized into binary variables without catastrophic information loss.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "hybrid optimization method that combines an Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) formulation with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)"
  - [Section III.C.1] "The QUBO formulation integrates smoothly with D-WAVE's annealing model, initiating QA to minimize the cost function"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support for this specific hybrid; neighbor papers address QUBO construction (arXiv:2506.08448) but not the CNN hybrid loop.
- **Break condition:** If discretization granularity is too coarse, the QUBO solution poorly approximates the true gradient, causing accuracy collapse.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Quantum tunneling enables more efficient escape from local minima than simulated annealing's thermal transitions.
- **Mechanism:** QA leverages quantum fluctuations rather than thermal jumps. The Hamiltonian evolution (H(t) = A(t)H₀ + B(t)Hp) allows the system to tunnel through energy barriers that SA must climb over probabilistically.
- **Core assumption:** The problem structure admits tunneling advantages (i.e., tall/thin barriers rather than wide/shallow ones).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section II-A.4] "while SA employs thermal jumps to avoid local minima, QA uses quantum tunneling"
  - [Section II-A.3] "QA distinctively leverages principles from quantum mechanics... quantum fluctuations that govern state transitions"
  - [corpus] No direct empirical comparison of tunneling vs. thermal escape in neighbors; assumption remains theoretical.
- **Break condition:** For wide barrier landscapes or ergodic systems, QA offers no asymptotic advantage over SA.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** MSE loss maps more naturally to QUBO formulation than cross-entropy for combinatorial optimization.
- **Mechanism:** MSE's quadratic structure (Σ(y - f)²) aligns with QUBO's quadratic objective form, whereas CE's logarithmic terms require additional approximation steps during Ising Hamiltonian transformation.
- **Core assumption:** The bias/coupling term calculations (ai = 2/N(f-yi) for MSE vs. ai = -1/N(yi-f) for CE) preserve sufficient optimization signal.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III.C.2] Detailed encoding procedures for both MSE and CE losses
  - [Section V-A] "The MSE function... exhibited superior performance over the logarithmic CE objective function, which is not inherently compatible with combinatorial optimization"
  - [corpus] No corpus papers validate MSE-vs-CE in QUBO; this is paper-specific.
- **Break condition:** If CE approximations introduce systematic bias, classification tasks may underperform regardless of faster convergence.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: QUBO Formulation (minimize xᵀQx)**
  - **Why needed here:** All quantum annealing optimization requires converting the problem into this canonical quadratic binary form; without understanding Q-matrix construction (symmetric vs. upper triangular), you cannot implement the loss-to-QUBO pipeline.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a 3-variable quadratic function with cross-terms, can you construct both symmetric and upper-triangular Q matrices?

- **Concept: Ising Model ↔ QUBO Equivalence**
  - **Why needed here:** D-Wave hardware natively solves Ising problems (H = Σaiσi + Σbijσiσj); understanding the spin {-1,+1} to binary {0,1} mapping is essential for debugging results.
  - **Quick check question:** How do you convert an Ising coupling term Jij to its equivalent QUBO qij coefficient?

- **Concept: Annealing Schedules (A(t), B(t))**
  - **Why needed here:** The transition from initial Hamiltonian H₀ to problem Hamiltonian Hp determines whether the system remains in ground state; poor scheduling causes non-adiabatic transitions and suboptimal solutions.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to solution quality if the annealing time is too short relative to the minimum spectral gap?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input Image → Conv Layers → Pooling Layers → FC Layer → Loss Compute → QUBO Formulation → Quantum Annealer (or neal simulator) → Decode Binary → Gradient Proxy → SGD Weight Update

- **Critical path:** The loss-to-QUBO conversion (Section III.C.2 steps 1-13) is the integration bottleneck; errors in bias/coupling term calculation propagate directly to weight updates.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Real QPU vs. simulator:** Free D-Wave access is time-limited (1 minute QPU); simulator enables extended testing but loses quantum advantage validation.
  - **MSE vs. CE:** MSE is QUBO-compatible; CE may underperform but is standard for classification—choose based on task priority.
  - **Qubit budget:** Hybrid approach only encodes loss, not full weights, keeping qubit count tractable (~hundreds vs. thousands for full-network encoding).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Validation accuracy stuck near random (10% for MNIST): QUBO matrix construction error or encoding bug.
  - Execution time exploding with data size: SA path triggered instead of QA (check configuration).
  - CE significantly underperforming MSE on classification: Expected per Section V; consider hybrid loss or accept tradeoff.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline reproduction:** Run CNN-BP and CNN-SA on MNIST subset (10K samples, 1 epoch, LR=0.1) to verify your setup matches paper's Figure 10 metrics (~87% CE accuracy for BP).
  2. **QUBO encoding validation:** Isolate the loss-to-QUBO step for a single batch; manually verify bias terms (ai) and coupling terms (bij) match equations in Section III.C.2.
  3. **Simulator sweep:** Run CNN-QA (neal simulator) across learning rates [1.0, 0.1, 0.01] with 10-fold cross-validation; confirm 10-15% accuracy improvement over CNN-BP at LR=0.1 per abstract claims.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the hybrid CNN-QA approach maintain its accuracy and efficiency advantages when scaled to more complex, larger-scale datasets beyond MNIST?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors acknowledge the study was "limited by encompassing... only one standard MNIST dataset using a simulator."
- **Why unresolved:** MNIST is a relatively simple benchmark with 28×28 grayscale images; real-world applications require handling higher-dimensional data with more classes and complexity.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic evaluation on datasets like CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, or domain-specific large-scale image datasets, comparing CNN-QA against baselines.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can cross-entropy and other non-quadratic loss functions be effectively reformulated for QUBO-based quantum annealing optimization?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "The MSE function... exhibited superior performance over the logarithmic CE objective function, which is not inherently compatible with combinatorial optimization."
- **Why unresolved:** The logarithmic nature of CE creates incompatibility with binary quadratic formulations, limiting the hybrid approach's applicability to standard deep learning loss functions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development and empirical validation of CE-to-QUBO transformation methods that preserve optimization properties while achieving comparable accuracy to MSE-QUBO.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What is the performance gap between simulated quantum annealing (using neal) and actual quantum hardware execution for CNN training?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The study conducted "subsequent more extensive evaluations... on an in-house system using DWAVE's 'neal' simulator" due to QPU time constraints, with only "minimal testing on DWAVE's real machine."
- **Why unresolved:** Simulators approximate quantum behavior classically; actual quantum annealers face noise, limited connectivity, and hardware-specific constraints that may affect results.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Controlled experiments comparing identical CNN-QA configurations on simulator versus D-Wave hardware, measuring accuracy, execution time, and solution quality.

## Limitations
- The study's claims rely heavily on theoretical advantages of quantum annealing, but experimental validation uses only a simulated annealer rather than actual quantum hardware
- The 10-15% accuracy improvement claim lacks detailed statistical analysis and comparative baselines across multiple quantum optimization approaches
- The restriction to MNIST limits generalizability to more complex datasets and real-world applications

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The hybrid QUBO-SGD framework architecture and its implementation details are clearly specified with reproducible code.
- **Medium Confidence:** The comparative performance metrics between BP, SA, and QA methods show consistent trends, though absolute values may vary with implementation details.
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about quantum tunneling advantages over simulated annealing lack direct empirical validation in the experimental results.

## Next Checks
1. **Statistical Validation:** Perform comprehensive statistical analysis including confidence intervals, p-values, and effect sizes for the claimed 10-15% accuracy improvement across multiple runs.
2. **Hardware Validation:** Replicate experiments on actual D-Wave quantum hardware to verify that simulated annealing results translate to quantum annealing performance.
3. **Generalization Testing:** Extend experiments to CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets to assess the method's robustness across different image classification tasks.
