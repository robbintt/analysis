core_contribution: This study examines how different translation modalities (machine

# To MT or not to MT: An eye-tracking study on the reception by Dutch readers of different translation and creativity levels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.19850
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19850
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Creative units significantly increase cognitive load across all translation modalities, with the highest effect in human translation and lowest in machine translation.

## Executive Summary
This eye-tracking study examines how machine translation, post-editing, human translation, and original source text affect Dutch readers' cognitive load, particularly focusing on creative units in a fictional text. Using eye-tracking metrics and retrospective think-aloud interviews, the research finds that units of creative potential significantly increase cognitive load across all modalities, with the strongest effect in human translation. While translation errors were expected to increase cognitive load, no significant effect was observed, possibly due to skim reading behavior in machine translation. The qualitative interviews revealed that readers enjoyed creative units and related them to personal experiences, suggesting a link between cognitive load and engagement.

## Method Summary
The study used eye-tracking to measure cognitive load while eight native Dutch speakers read "2BR02B," a 2548-word short story translated into four modalities: machine translation, post-editing, human translation, and original source text. The text was annotated for Units of Creative Potential (UCPs) and errors. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions (two per modality), and eye movements were recorded using an EyeLink Portable Duo eye tracker at 2000Hz. Two datasets were created: word-level metrics and segment-level normalized metrics. Data analysis combined generalized additive mixed effect models for TFD with non-parametric tests for other metrics, triangulated with retrospective think-aloud interviews.

## Key Results
- Units of creative potential significantly increase cognitive load across all translation modalities
- Human translation shows the strongest creative effect, while machine translation shows the lowest
- No significant effect of translation errors on cognitive load was observed, potentially due to skim reading behavior
- Readers reported enjoying creative units and relating them to personal experiences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's methodology effectively captures the relationship between translation creativity and reader cognitive load by combining physiological measurements (eye-tracking) with subjective experiences (RTA interviews). This dual approach allows researchers to identify both immediate cognitive responses and reflective interpretations, revealing that while creative units demand more processing effort, they also enhance reader engagement and enjoyment. The eye-tracking metrics serve as objective proxies for mental effort, while the qualitative data explains the underlying reader experiences that quantitative measures alone cannot capture.

## Foundational Learning
- **Eye-tracking Measures as Cognitive Proxies**: The entire experimental design relies on mapping physiological signals to cognitive states. Understanding what each metric captures is essential to interpret the "why" behind results. Quick check: What does an increase in Total Fixation Duration (TFD) on a segment primarily indicate about the reader's mental state?
- **Creative Shift vs. Reproduction (Translation Units)**: These core annotations create the "Creativity" independent variable. The study's main claim depends on distinguishing routine translation from creative translation. Quick check: What is the primary difference between a "Creative Shift" (CS) and a "Reproduction"?
- **Triangulation via RTA (Retrospective Think-Aloud)**: The paper uses qualitative RTA data to explain unexpected quantitative results, such as why errors didn't increase cognitive load. This methodology is central to the paper's conclusions. Quick check: How did the RTA data help researchers explain the lack of a significant effect for "Errors" on the eye-tracking metrics?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Stimuli (4 text modalities annotated for UCPs and errors) -> EyeLink Portable Duo eye tracker (2000Hz) -> Experiment Builder (presentation) -> Data Viewer (processing) -> Python (analysis with wordfreq library) -> R (GAM statistical models) -> Results
- **Critical path**: Stimulus annotation (professional translators annotate UCPs, then CS/Reproduction/Errors) -> Data acquisition (participant reads with eye-tracker, raw gaze data recorded) -> Processing (gaze data mapped to words/segments, metrics calculated) -> Analysis (GAM tests main effects of Modality, Creativity, and Errors, triangulated with RTA)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Granularity (Word vs. Segment) - tradeoff between statistical power and ecological validity; Sample Size vs. Depth - small sample limits generalizability but allows deep qualitative analysis; Error Metric - aggregated treatment may mask differential effects
- **Failure signatures**: No effect of Modality on TFD (check for skimming or high variance); Zero-inflated data (many segments with no fixations, handled with GAM with scaled t-distribution); RTA Discrepancy (contradiction between self-reported experience and eye-tracking data)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce dataset creation by joining raw eye-tracking output with annotation files; 2) Run frequency correlation using wordfreq library and reproduce scatter plot of Word Frequency vs. Log-transformed TFD; 3) Analyze RTA data by manually coding one transcript for mentioned themes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Do readers adopt skim-reading strategies in error-dense machine translation texts, thereby artificially lowering the cognitive load measurements that would otherwise be elevated by errors?** The authors hypothesize that increased skim reading in MT nullified the expected cognitive load increase from errors, as suggested by RTA interviews where readers "gave up trying to understand the text."
- **Is paragraph-level analysis more effective than document-level analysis for detecting the effects of translation modality and creativity on cognitive load?** The study used document-level approach which may have introduced too much variance; future research should focus on paragraph-level analysis with selected UCPs.
- **How does the translation modality of Large Language Models (LLMs) impact cognitive load and enjoyment compared to standard NMT and human translation in literary texts?** The authors' next experiment will include LLMs alongside existing modalities to explore the relationship between creativity and reader experience.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (N=8) creates substantial uncertainty in generalizability and limits confidence in effect sizes
- Single source text (2BR02B) may not represent broader literary translation contexts
- Analysis combines all error types into a single binary variable, potentially masking differential effects of various error categories

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Creative units increase cognitive load across all modalities; human translation shows strongest creative effect
- **Medium Confidence**: Machine translation shows lowest creative effect; readers engage differently with creative units
- **Low Confidence**: Lack of significant error effects on cognitive load is tentative, potentially explained by skim reading behavior

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with a larger, more diverse sample (N≥30) using multiple source texts to test generalizability of the creativity-cognitive load relationship
2. Conduct a controlled error-type analysis separating different categories of translation errors to determine if specific error types affect cognitive load
3. Compare Dutch-specific findings with equivalent eye-tracking studies in other languages to assess cross-linguistic validity of the creativity effect
