# Foundations of Artificial Intelligence Frameworks: Notion and Limits of AGI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18517
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18517
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Current neural network architectures are insufficient for achieving AGI regardless of scale

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a fundamental critique of current artificial intelligence approaches, arguing that neural network architectures cannot achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) regardless of scale. The author contends that popular approaches like neural scaling laws and the Universal Approximation Theorem address the wrong level of abstraction, focusing on statistical correlation rather than genuine understanding. Through philosophical arguments including the Chinese Room Argument and Godelian reasoning, the paper demonstrates that neural networks operate as static function approximators without the structural richness required for intelligence.

The paper proposes a new framework distinguishing between existential facilities (computational substrate) and architectural organization (interpretive structures), and outlines principles for what genuine machine intelligence would require. The author concludes that AGI predictions fail not from insufficient compute but from fundamental misunderstanding of what intelligence demands structurally. Key contributions include critiquing the theoretical foundations of AI, proposing a new neural architecture formalism, and outlining a learning theoretic framework that distinguishes structural learning from operational learning.

## Method Summary
The paper is fundamentally theoretical and philosophical rather than empirical. It critiques existing approaches through logical argumentation and proposes new conceptual frameworks without providing implementation details or experiments. The method involves analyzing current neural architectures through the lens of philosophical arguments (Chinese Room, Gödelian reasoning), critiquing established theorems (Universal Approximation Theorem, scaling laws), and proposing alternative frameworks based on primitive formalisms and structural learning distinctions. No training procedures, datasets, or quantitative metrics are specified, making the work a conceptual critique rather than a technical implementation.

## Key Results
- Current neural network architectures, regardless of scale, are structurally incapable of achieving AGI
- Neural scaling laws are empirical heuristics rather than fundamental laws of intelligence
- The Universal Approximation Theorem restricts models to smooth, continuous function spaces at the wrong level of abstraction
- AGI requires explicit distinction between structural learning (architecture/morphology changes) and operational learning (weight updates)
- A new neural architecture formalism based on primitive frameworks and constraint chains is proposed as an alternative approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Insufficiency of Static Function Approximation
Current neural networks are static function approximators that can only interpolate within fixed encoding frameworks, lacking genuine understanding or extrapolation capabilities. Scaling laws are empirical heuristics, not fundamental principles, and standard architectures lack dynamic restructuring capabilities needed for intelligence.

### Mechanism 2: Layered Analytic Machinery (Primitive Framework)
The proposed solution involves a rigorous Neural Architecture Formalism based on primitive frameworks and constraint chains, moving away from black-box interpolation toward interpretability-by-design. This uses a Primitive Framework (P₀) with cardinality and base analytical field, building architectures via specific constraint chains with typed, composable units.

### Mechanism 3: Structural vs. Operational Learning
AGI requires separating Operational Learning (weight updates) from Structural Learning (morphology/architecture changes). Current models rely solely on operational learning within fixed structures, while the proposed system allows adaptation of internal interface and structural organization in response to environment, not just numerical weights.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Universal Approximation vs. Structural Richness**
  - Why needed here: The paper pivots on critiquing that UAT is misapplied, requiring learners to distinguish between interpolation and structural understanding
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a universal approximator might still fail to "understand" a simple logical counterexample?

- **Concept: The Chinese Room Argument (CRA)**
  - Why needed here: Used to differentiate between symbol manipulation (syntax) and meaning (semantics), crucial for understanding why the author dismisses LLMs as lacking genuine intelligence
  - Quick check question: How does the "layer dilemma" attempt to resolve the Chinese Room Argument? (Hint: It involves recursive thresholds and dimensional compression)

- **Concept: Existential vs. Operational Facilities**
  - Why needed here: Core distinction separating substrate (machine) from dynamic processes, forcing design where substrate itself is variable in learning process
  - Quick check question: In a standard Transformer, which part represents the "existential facility" and which represents the "operational facility"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Primitive Framework (P₀) → Neuron Classes (N₀, N₁, N₂) → Construct (Machine + Process) → Specific Constraint Chain (Φ)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define Primitive: Establish encoding space (Cardinality + Field)
  2. Define Units: Implement base neuron classes (N₀) with strict I/O signatures
  3. Apply Constraints: Use specific constraint chain to stack units into higher-order frameworks
  4. Enable Learning: Implement dual-loop system for operational and structural adaptation

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Rigor vs. Flexibility: Strict Primitive Framework ensures interpretability but may limit flexibility that makes deep learning robust to noise
  - Static vs. Dynamic Structure: Implementing Structural Learning allows model to grow/contract but introduces instability compared to fixed-backpropagation

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Interpolation Trap: Perfect test performance but structural failure on novel logical inputs
  - Interface Collapse: Specific constraint chain breaks because invariant signatures cannot handle real-world variance without unstructured black-box layers

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Formalize N₀: Code definition of standard and multivariate neuron classes per Definitions 3.2–3.3
  2. Layer Dilemma Test: Construct recursive threshold (Q) where lower layer successfully infers higher layer logic
  3. Structural Learning Baseline: Compare fixed-architecture Transformer against prototype that modifies cardinality during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The proposed alternative architectures remain abstract without concrete implementation details or validation
- The "Primitive Framework" formalism lacks specification of learning rules, optimization procedures, or demonstrated superiority
- The distinction between structural and operational learning is described conceptually but no algorithm is given to implement or test it
- The paper is fundamentally theoretical rather than empirical, making practical validation challenging

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Critique that current architectures are static function approximators; argument that scaling laws are empirical heuristics
- **Medium Confidence:** Philosophical arguments (Chinese Room, Gödelian) and their application to neural networks
- **Low Confidence:** Proposed alternative architecture formalism and structural vs. operational learning distinction

## Next Checks

1. Implement the Minimal Formalism: Code base neuron classes (N₀, N₁, N₂) as defined with strict type signatures and test composability

2. Test LLM Reasoning Limits: Replicate empirical failures cited (e.g., GSM-Symbolic mathematical reasoning degradation) using modern LLMs

3. Structural Learning Prototype: Implement neural architecture that modifies its own structure during training and compare performance on out-of-distribution tasks against fixed architectures
