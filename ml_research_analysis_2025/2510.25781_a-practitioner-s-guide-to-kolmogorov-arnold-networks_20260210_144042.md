- Key outcome: This review provides the first systematic and comprehensive analysis of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), clarifying their relationship to the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, kernel methods, and MLPs. It establishes that shallow KANs are mathematically equivalent to kernel methods, while deep KANs diverge by constructing multivariate interactions through compositional layers rather than explicit tensor-product bases. The review introduces basis functions as a central design axis, surveying eighteen polynomial families, B-splines, Fourier, wavelets, and others, and demonstrates how each impacts accuracy, conditioning, and convergence. Empirical results show KANs achieve faster convergence and lower error on regression, PDE solving, and operator learning tasks compared to MLPs, especially when equipped with problem-specific bases (e.g., Chebyshev for smooth PDEs, Sinc for discontinuities). A practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide distills these insights into a step-by-step decision framework for practitioners. The review also identifies open research challenges in optimization, generalization theory, and architectural composition, establishing KANs as a modular, interpretable alternative to MLPs in scientific machine learning.

## Executive Summary
This review is the first systematic analysis of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), clarifying their mathematical foundations and practical implications. It shows that shallow KANs are equivalent to kernel methods, while deep KANs achieve multivariate expressivity through compositional layers rather than tensor-product bases. The paper establishes basis functions as a central design axis, surveying eighteen polynomial families, B-splines, Fourier, wavelets, and others, and demonstrates how each impacts accuracy, conditioning, and convergence. Empirical results show KANs achieve faster convergence and lower error on regression, PDE solving, and operator learning tasks compared to MLPs, especially when equipped with problem-specific bases. A practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide distills these insights into a step-by-step decision framework for practitioners.

## Method Summary
The review systematically analyzes KANs by first establishing their mathematical equivalence to kernel methods for shallow architectures, then exploring how depth enables multivariate interactions through compositional layers. It introduces basis functions as a central design axis, surveying eighteen polynomial families, B-splines, Fourier, wavelets, and others. The analysis covers NTK conditioning, spectral bias, and the impact of grid design on convergence. Empirical validation spans regression, PDE solving, and operator learning tasks, with comparisons to MLPs. A practical decision framework guides practitioners in selecting basis functions and architectural parameters.

## Key Results
- Shallow KANs are mathematically equivalent to kernel methods, while deep KANs diverge by constructing multivariate interactions through compositional layers rather than explicit tensor-product bases.
- Basis selection governs expressivity, conditioning, and convergence more than depth/width alone; eighteen polynomial families, B-splines, Fourier, wavelets, and others are surveyed.
- KANs achieve faster convergence and lower error on regression, PDE solving, and operator learning tasks compared to MLPs, especially when equipped with problem-specific bases (e.g., Chebyshev for smooth PDEs, Sinc for discontinuities).

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Basis selection governs expressivity, conditioning, and convergence more than depth/width alone.
- Mechanism: Learnable univariate functions on network edges replace fixed node-wise activations, letting the basis family (splines, polynomials, RBFs, wavelets) encode prior knowledge about smoothness, locality, and spectral content directly into the architecture.
- Core assumption: The target function’s structure aligns with the inductive bias of the chosen basis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "introduces basis functions as a central design axis...demonstrates how each impacts accuracy, conditioning, and convergence"
  - [section 5] Full survey of 18+ polynomial families plus splines, Fourier, wavelets, Table 5 summarizes tradeoffs
  - [corpus] Neighbors show parameter-efficiency gains from basis sharing (GS-KAN, PRKAN), confirming basis design as a primary lever
- Break condition: Problem has no discernible structure (pure noise); basis choice becomes arbitrary and gains vanish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Depth in KANs creates multivariate interactions through composition, not explicit tensor products, mitigating curse-of-dimensionality while inducing nonlinear coefficient coupling.
- Mechanism: Each KAN layer performs activate--then--sum (univariate transforms followed by aggregation). Stacking layers composes these maps, approximating complex cross-dimensional interactions without enumerating tensor-product bases.
- Core assumption: Compositional representation can approximate the required multivariate structure with tractable depth.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3, Case 2] "KANs adopt a different architectural principle...No tensor-product basis functions...are constructed at the level of a single layer"
  - [section 3, Case 3] Shows degree growth (deg(g) = P^L) and nonlinear coefficient coupling in deep Chebyshev KANs
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence on composition limits; neighbors focus on parameter efficiency, not depth dynamics
- Break condition: Very high-dimensional interactions requiring explicit high-order correlations; depth may become prohibitive.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: NTK conditioning and spectral bias are controllable via basis resolution and grid design, enabling faster convergence for high-frequency or physics-constrained targets.
- Mechanism: Spline grids and spectral bases (Chebyshev, Fourier) shape the NTK eigenvalue spectrum. Finer grids broaden spectral reach (reducing bias toward low frequencies) but can worsen conditioning if over-refined.
- Core assumption: The optimization landscape remains tractable; spectral expansion does not induce instability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 9.2] "KANs...possess a well-conditioned landscape...Grid extension further widens the representable frequency band"
  - [section 9.3] Gradient-flow convergence tied to NTK Gram matrix; λ_min depends on basis and operator stiffness
  - [corpus] No direct NTK studies in neighbors; indirect support from physics-informed applications
- Break condition: Aggressive grid refinement or stiff PDEs cause ill-conditioning; Adam→L-BFGS schedules may fail to recover.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kernel / basis-expansion methods (RKHS, splines, RBFs)
  - Why needed here: Shallow 1D KANs are mathematically equivalent to kernel regression; understanding this clarifies when depth adds value.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a linear combination of fixed basis functions differs from learning the basis coefficients via gradient descent?

- Concept: Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST)
  - Why needed here: KANs are inspired by--but not direct realizations of--KST; knowing the gap prevents overclaiming universality guarantees.
  - Quick check question: What breaks if you try to use smooth, differentiable inner functions in an exact KST construction?

- Concept: Spectral bias and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
  - Why needed here: KANs' convergence advantages are partially explained by NTK conditioning; basis choice directly affects this.
  - Quick check question: Why do low eigenvalues in the NTK slow learning of certain frequencies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - KAN Layer: Matrix of univariate edge functions φ_{ℓ,j,i}(x) followed by sum aggregation
  - Basis Module: Implements chosen family (B-spline, Chebyshev, RBF, etc.) with optional grid/parameters
  - Grid Controller: Manages knot spacing, extension, and adaptive refinement
  - Physics/Regularization Wrapper: Adds PDE residuals, BC terms, sparsity penalties

- Critical path:
  1. Start with cubic B-spline KAN (stable default) on uniform grid with extension enabled
  2. Match basis to problem structure (Chebyshev for smooth/oscillatory, Fourier for periodic, Sinc for discontinuities, wavelets for multiscale)
  3. Apply tanh normalization for spectral bases; use extended grids for boundary-sensitive tasks
  4. Warm up with Adam, refine with L-BFGS; add residual-based adaptive sampling if PDE residuals localize

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Spectral bases (Chebyshev, Fourier) → fast convergence for smooth/periodic targets, but may need stabilization (tanh, linear heads)
  - Local bases (B-spline, RBF, ReLU-KAN) → better for discontinuities and locality, but grid resolution sensitive
  - Depth vs. width: Depth enables composition and coefficient coupling; width increases expressivity but may not improve spectral reach as efficiently

- Failure signatures:
  - Exploding activations in deep Chebyshev stacks → add inter-layer tanh or use linear output head
  - Slow convergence on stiff PDEs → check NTK conditioning; try Adam→L-BFGS, temporal decomposition, or entropy viscosity
  - Boundary artifacts → enable grid extension; verify PoU blending in domain-decomposed FBKANs
  - Overfitting with fine grids → apply L1/entropy regularization or reduce grid resolution

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Regression sanity check: Compare shallow B-spline KAN vs. kernel ridge regression on 1D data; verify equivalence up to training procedure.
  2. Spectral bias test: Fit a high-frequency 1D signal with MLP vs. KAN (Chebyshev and B-spline); plot convergence of high-frequency components.
  3. PDE baseline: Solve a 1D diffusion equation with PINN vs. PIKAN (cubic spline + physics loss); measure epochs to 1e-4 relative L2 error and monitor NTK eigenvalue decay.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical understanding of deep KANs is still emerging; the role of depth and convergence guarantees are heuristic rather than rigorously proven.
- Empirical survey relies heavily on synthetic and moderate-scale problems; scalability to very high-dimensional scientific computing tasks is untested.
- Performance gains from specialized bases assume the target function aligns with the basis's inductive bias; for truly unstructured data, advantages may diminish.

## Confidence
- **High**: Equivalence of shallow KANs to kernel methods; basis selection as a primary design lever; NTK conditioning being controllable via grid resolution.
- **Medium**: Depth enabling multivariate interactions without tensor-product explosion; practical guidelines for basis choice per problem type.
- **Low**: Theoretical convergence rates for deep KANs; generalization bounds; robustness under noisy or adversarial data.

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability Experiment**: Scale a PDE solving task to 10+ dimensions using KANs with adaptive grids; measure training time, memory, and error vs. MLP baselines.
2. **Adversarial Robustness**: Test KANs on adversarially perturbed inputs in classification; compare to MLP and assess sensitivity to basis perturbations.
3. **Deep NTK Analysis**: Derive and empirically verify the NTK spectrum for deep KANs; relate eigenvalue decay to convergence on high-frequency regression tasks.
