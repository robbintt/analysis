# Argument Quality Annotation and Gender Bias Detection in Financial Communication through Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08262

- Primary result: LLM-generated annotations achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human annotators, but exhibit varying degrees of gender bias under adversarial prompts.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the reliability of large language models (LLMs) for annotating financial argument quality and detecting gender bias. The study uses the FinArgQuality dataset and evaluates three models—GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2—across multiple temperature settings. Results show that LLM-generated annotations achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human annotators, with Gemma 2 and GPT-4o performing best. However, all models exhibit varying degrees of gender bias under adversarial prompts, with GPT-4o showing the highest susceptibility. The findings suggest that while LLMs offer consistent, cost-effective annotations, bias remains a concern requiring careful mitigation in real-world deployment.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three large language models (GPT-4o, Llama 3.1-70B, and Gemma 2-27B) on financial argument quality annotation across four dimensions: strength, specificity, persuasiveness, and objectivity. Using the FinArgQuality dataset of 2,184 arguments from earnings calls (2015-2019), each model generates annotations at three temperature settings (default, 0.3, and 0.7) with three independent runs per setting. For gender bias detection, adversarial prompts prepend gender identifiers and prejudice sentences to the original prompts. Performance is measured using Fleiss' Kappa for inter-annotator agreement, Cohen's Kappa for subset agreement, and Mean Absolute Error to quantify bias impact.

## Key Results
- LLM-generated annotations achieve higher inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' Kappa: 0.69-0.76) than human annotators (0.53-0.65) across all models and temperature settings.
- Gemma 2 and GPT-4o perform best in accuracy versus human labels, with Gemma 2 showing the highest precision (0.85-0.88) and recall (0.91-0.95).
- All models exhibit gender bias under adversarial prompts, with GPT-4o showing the highest susceptibility and greatest deviation in persuasiveness scores for female versus male company representatives.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLMs demonstrate superior annotation consistency due to their ability to apply predefined quality criteria uniformly across all inputs, unlike humans who may interpret guidelines differently. The adversarial bias experiments reveal that LLMs amplify existing gender stereotypes present in their training data when prompted with gender identifiers and prejudicial statements. Temperature settings affect both consistency and bias susceptibility, with lower temperatures generally producing more stable but potentially more biased outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Inter-annotator agreement metrics**: Fleiss' Kappa measures agreement among multiple annotators, while Cohen's Kappa measures agreement between two annotators. Needed to quantify annotation consistency; quick check: verify that Kappa values fall within expected ranges (0-1).
- **Adversarial prompt injection**: Technique of prepending prejudicial content to test model bias. Needed to systematically evaluate bias responses; quick check: ensure prompt modifications are consistent across test conditions.
- **Temperature settings in LLMs**: Controls randomness in token generation (lower = more deterministic). Needed to assess impact on consistency and bias; quick check: validate temperature values are correctly applied in API calls.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures average magnitude of errors between baseline and adversarial annotations. Needed to quantify bias impact; quick check: confirm MAE calculations use absolute differences, not squared.
- **Dataset structure**: FinArgQuality contains claims and premises with human annotations on four quality dimensions. Needed to understand input format; quick check: verify all 2,184 arguments have complete annotation data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: FinArgQuality dataset -> LLM inference pipeline -> Annotation aggregation -> Agreement metrics -> Bias evaluation

**Critical path**: Data loading → Prompt template application → Model inference (3 runs × 3 temps) → Score extraction → Agreement calculation → Bias measurement

**Design tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes consistency measurement over absolute accuracy, accepting that LLM-consensus may differ from human-consensus. Temperature variation provides robustness testing but increases computational cost.

**Failure signatures**: Inconsistent score parsing across runs, session memory contamination between independent runs, or incorrect aggregation of multiple temperature settings will invalidate agreement metrics.

**First experiments**:
1. Run single-argument test with all three models at temp=0.3 to verify prompt parsing and score extraction works correctly
2. Execute one complete 3-run set at default temperature for a small subset (10-20 arguments) to validate agreement calculation implementation
3. Test bias detection with one gender identifier and one prejudice sentence variant on a single argument to verify MAE computation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How can hybrid annotation frameworks effectively balance the high internal consistency of LLMs with the domain-specific conceptual understanding of human experts? The study demonstrates LLMs outperform humans in agreement (consistency) but deviates in accuracy; the optimal method to merge these strengths remains untested.

**Open Question 2**: Does the superior consistency of LLM annotations validate them as a more reliable "ground truth" than human labels for subjective tasks like argument quality assessment? High Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) does not equate to correctness; the paper confirms LLMs often disagree with human "ground truth," leaving the definition of validity ambiguous.

**Open Question 3**: Why do highly aligned, larger models like GPT-4o exhibit higher susceptibility to gender bias adversarial attacks compared to smaller models like Gemma 2? The paper identifies the counter-intuitive phenomenon (larger models being less robust) but lacks ablation studies on training data or architecture to explain it.

## Limitations
- Missing exact prompt templates and prejudice sentence variants prevent full reproduction of bias detection results
- Only three large models evaluated, limiting generalizability to other model families and sizes
- Temperature default values unspecified, creating potential variation across implementations
- Single dataset domain (financial earnings calls) may not extend to other domains

## Confidence
- Annotation reliability findings: **High** - supported by large sample size and multiple independent runs
- Bias detection results: **Medium** - compelling patterns but missing experimental details for full verification
- Cost-effectiveness claims: **Medium** - plausible but not quantitatively validated in paper

## Next Checks
1. Obtain and test the exact prompt templates from Figures 1-2, including the prejudice sentence variants used in bias experiments, to reproduce the observed gender bias patterns
2. Run additional bias detection experiments with different stereotypical statements and control conditions to verify that observed biases are consistent across prompt variations
3. Validate the reproducibility of Fleiss' Kappa scores by implementing the exact sampling procedure for the 20% Cohen's Kappa subset and comparing agreement metrics across different random seeds
