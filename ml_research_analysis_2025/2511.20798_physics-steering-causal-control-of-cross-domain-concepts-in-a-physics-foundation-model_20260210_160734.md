# Physics Steering: Causal Control of Cross-Domain Concepts in a Physics Foundation Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20798
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20798
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Foundation models trained on physics data learn interpretable, manipulable internal representations of physical phenomena that transfer across domains.

## Executive Summary
This work demonstrates that foundation models trained on physics data learn interpretable internal representations of physical phenomena that can be causally manipulated. Using Walrus, a transformer-based physics foundation model trained on The Well (a large collection of PDE simulations), the authors identify single directions in activation space corresponding to specific physical concepts like vorticity, diffusion, and temporal progression. They extract "delta" concept directions by computing differences between activations from contrasting physical regimes, then inject these directions during inference to steer model predictions. The method successfully induces or suppresses physical features, transforms laminar flow into vortical structures, and controls diffusion rates and simulation speed. Remarkably, concept directions derived from shear flow simulations transfer to other physical systems including Rayleigh-Bénard convection, Euler quadrant flows, and even the unrelated Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion system, suggesting the model learns domain-general representations of physical principles rather than superficial correlations.

## Method Summary
The methodology extracts concept directions from activation space by computing delta tensors between contrasting physical regimes, then injects these directions during inference to steer model predictions. Activations are taken from the final processor block (blocks.39) before the decoder, normalized, and averaged across contrasting simulation files. The steering function adds a scaled, normalized delta direction to activations while preserving the original norm. For cross-domain transfer, spatial averaging preserves channel-wise concept information while removing system-specific spatial patterns. The approach tests whether single linear directions can capture complex physical phenomena and whether these directions transfer across unrelated physical systems.

## Key Results
- Successfully induced vortices in laminar shear flow and suppressed existing vortices using single-direction steering
- Controlled diffusion rates and temporal progression of simulations through activation injection
- Concept directions transferred across domains: vortex direction from shear flow induced vortices in Rayleigh-Bénard convection, rotational features in Euler quadrant flows, and transformed Gray-Scott gliders into spirals
- Spatially-averaged concept directions yielded more physically plausible cross-domain results than full-spatial versions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Delta Concept Direction Extraction
Physical concepts can be isolated as single linear directions in activation space by contrasting physical regimes. The method normalizes activations, computes mean activations for two contrasting regimes (exhibiting feature f vs. ¬f), then takes their difference: Δf,i = μf,i - νf,i. This yields a "delta tensor" encoding the target concept. The core assumption is that the Linear Representation Hypothesis holds for physics foundation models—concepts exist as separable directions rather than distributed nonlinear patterns. Evidence shows single directions correspond to vorticity, diffusion, and temporal progression. If concepts require multi-dimensional or nonlinear encoding, single-direction extraction will yield mixed/entangled representations with unreliable steering.

### Mechanism 2: Activation Steering via Vector Injection
Intervening along concept directions causally alters predicted physics. During inference, the method injects Δf into activations using steering function s(a, Δf, α) = a + α||a||₂Δf / ||Δf||₂, then renormalizes. Positive α induces the feature; negative suppresses it. The core assumption is that the extracted direction encodes a causally meaningful feature, not just correlation—adding it shifts the model's internal state toward generating the target phenomenon. Evidence shows negative steering progressively laminarizes vortex flow while positive steering induces vortices in laminar regimes with effect scaling by α. If the model relies on superficial correlations rather than learned physics principles, steering may produce cosmetic output changes without physical self-consistency.

### Mechanism 3: Cross-Domain Concept Transfer
Concept directions are domain-general and transfer across unrelated physical systems. Spatial averaging (Δf = mean over spatial dimensions) preserves channel-wise concept information, enabling transfer when spatial dimensions differ between systems. The core assumption is that physical concepts are encoded primarily in channel dimensions rather than system-specific spatial patterns; Walrus learns abstract physical principles (e.g., "rotation") not tied to specific phenomena. Evidence shows vortex direction from Shear Flow transfers to Rayleigh-Bénard (increased convection), Euler (rotational features at shock interfaces), and Gray-Scott (gliders transform to spirals despite no fluid vortex definition). If concepts are dataset-specific or tied to spatial structure, transfer will fail or produce unphysical artifacts.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Linear Representation Hypothesis**
  - Why needed here: The entire steering methodology assumes concepts exist as linear directions in activation space. Without this, delta extraction and injection would not produce interpretable control.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why single-direction steering would fail if physical concepts required multi-dimensional representation?

- **Concept: Polysemanticity and Superposition**
  - Why needed here: The paper notes polysemanticity complicates interpretation—multiple features per neuron. Understanding this explains why the authors extract directions rather than reading single neurons.
  - Quick check question: How does superposition affect the interpretability of individual neurons, and why does the delta method help address this?

- **Concept: Autoregressive Surrogate Modeling**
  - Why needed here: Walrus predicts the next state from prior states autoregressively. This frames steering as intervening on incremental predictions, not full states—relevant to interpreting induction vs. suppression results.
  - Quick check question: Why does autoregressive prediction complicate verifying whether feature induction creates physically valid initial perturbations vs. cosmetic output shifts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Walrus (ViT-based) -> blocks.39 (final processor block) -> forward hook -> activation injection -> decoder

- **Critical path:**
  1. Select contrasting simulation files (e.g., vortex vs. laminar regimes)
  2. Extract activations via forward pass; normalize and average per regime
  3. Compute Δf = μf - νf
  4. For cross-domain: spatially average to get channel-only Δf ∈ R^C
  5. Inject during inference with steering coefficient α; monitor output fields

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Full spatial Δf vs. spatially-averaged: Full spatial enables stronger/more extreme steering but risks unphysical artifacts in secondary fields; spatially-averaged yields more plausible results but weaker effect
  - Layer selection: Late layers (blocks.39) assumed to contain abstract representations; earlier layers may contain different features (unexplored)
  - α magnitude: Higher α produces stronger effects but risks field distortion; initial conditions near target regime require lower α

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Steering produces inverted/mirrored field changes in both positive and negative directions (non-linear response)
  - Secondary fields (pressure, velocity) become unphysical or distorted
  - Cross-domain transfer produces effects at physically implausible locations

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline verification:** Replicate vortex suppression/induction on Shear Flow; vary α systematically (0.1–1.0) and quantify field changes across tracer, pressure, and velocity
  2. **Layer ablation:** Extract and inject Δf from multiple layers (early, middle, late) to test where abstract concepts are most steerable
  3. **Transfer robustness test:** Apply Shear Flow-derived Δvortex and Δspeed to Rayleigh-Bénard with both full-spatial and spatially-averaged versions; compare physical plausibility via field consistency metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do steered simulations remain self-consistent with governing physical laws, or do they violate conservation principles?
- Basis in paper: The authors identify the "physicality of the steered results" as a "key open problem and a limitation of this work."
- Why unresolved: The study relies primarily on visual inspection of fields rather than quantitative validation of physical consistency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative analysis of conservation laws (mass, momentum, energy) in steered outputs compared to unmodified baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does feature induction occur via a physically valid perturbation mechanism or a cosmetic shift in the output?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly ask: "By what mechanism does Walrus transform a nominally laminar flow to produce a vortex?... Or is it cosmetically shifting the output?"
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the model simulates a modified initial condition naturally evolving or simply forcing the visual appearance of the feature.
- What evidence would resolve it: Causal tracing of the activation trajectory or ablating specific attention heads to determine if the intervention triggers a cascading physical simulation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the efficacy of concept steering depend on the specific transformer layer targeted for injection?
- Basis in paper: The methodology notes that while the final processor block was used, "exploring this layer-dependence would be an interesting direction for future work."
- Why unresolved: The study isolates a single layer (blocks.39) hypothesized to contain abstract representations, leaving the behavior of intermediate layers unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments injecting the same concept direction at various depths (early, middle, late) to compare steering strength and semantic fidelity.

## Limitations

- The core findings hinge on the linear representation hypothesis, which remains theoretically contested and might require multi-dimensional or nonlinear encoding
- Cross-domain transfer success is striking but unexplained mechanistically, lacking validation that manipulations create physically self-consistent initial conditions versus superficial pattern matching
- The methodology relies heavily on visual inspection and qualitative assessment, lacking quantitative metrics for "physical plausibility" or systematic ablation studies of concept direction dimensionality

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The activation steering mechanism works as described for inducing and suppressing physical features within the same simulation type (Shear Flow vortex control). The mathematical framework and implementation details are clearly specified, and the effect magnitudes scale predictably with α.

**Medium Confidence:** Cross-domain transfer claims are supported by empirical demonstrations but lack theoretical grounding. The transfer works surprisingly well across diverse systems, but the paper doesn't explain why spatial averaging preserves concept information or whether the effects represent true physical induction versus superficial pattern matching.

**Low Confidence:** The broader claim that Walrus learns "domain-general representations of physical principles" remains speculative. While steering effects transfer across domains, there's no validation that these manipulations create physically consistent initial conditions for the next simulation step, nor exploration of whether the model is exploiting dataset correlations rather than genuine physical understanding.

## Next Checks

1. **Physical Consistency Validation:** For cross-domain transfers (e.g., Gray-Scott to Euler), run the steered simulation forward multiple steps and measure whether the induced features persist in physically consistent ways or decay into artifacts. Compare against ground-truth simulations of the same initial conditions.

2. **Multi-Dimensional Concept Analysis:** Systematically test whether single-direction extraction is sufficient by: (a) attempting to extract concepts using two orthogonal directions and measuring if combined steering produces cleaner effects; (b) applying Principal Component Analysis to contrasting activation regimes to identify if concepts require higher-dimensional subspaces.

3. **Ablation on Layer Selection:** Extract and inject concept directions from multiple processor blocks (not just blocks.39) across all experiments. Compare steering effectiveness and physical plausibility across layers to test the hypothesis that abstract representations concentrate in late blocks versus being distributed throughout the architecture.
