# Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.18309
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ETGPSSM reduces computational complexity and improves modeling flexibility for high-dimensional non-stationary dynamical systems through shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) that addresses computational and modeling limitations of existing GPSSMs in high-dimensional settings. The method integrates a single shared Gaussian process with input-dependent normalizing flows to create a non-stationary implicit process prior, avoiding the quadratic parameter scaling and cubic computational cost of traditional multi-GP approaches. The proposed framework enables efficient state estimation and forecasting in complex dynamical systems while maintaining strong predictive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
The ETGPSSM approach combines a shared Gaussian process with input-dependent normalizing flows to model non-stationary high-dimensional dynamical systems efficiently. Instead of using multiple independent GPs for each output dimension (which scales poorly), the method employs a single shared GP with normalizing flows that adapt the transformation based on input conditions. This architecture creates a non-stationary implicit process prior that captures complex relationships while maintaining computational tractability. The inference framework uses variational methods to approximate the posterior over GP and normalizing flow parameters, combined with an ensemble Kalman filter for efficient state estimation. This design significantly reduces both parameter count and computational complexity while improving modeling flexibility for non-stationary dynamics.

## Key Results
- ETGPSSM achieves superior performance in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting compared to existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs
- The method demonstrates significantly improved computational efficiency with reduced parameter scaling from quadratic to linear in output dimension
- Empirical evaluations show strong performance on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, successfully handling non-stationary dynamics and high-dimensional state spaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The efficiency gains stem from replacing multiple independent GPs with a single shared GP architecture combined with input-dependent normalizing flows. This reduces parameter count from O(D^2) to O(D) where D is the output dimension, while the normalizing flows provide the flexibility needed to model complex, non-stationary relationships. The variational inference framework enables tractable posterior approximation, and the ensemble Kalman filter provides efficient state estimation. The implicit process prior created by the normalizing flows allows the model to adapt to local variations in the data distribution without requiring explicit non-stationarity assumptions.

## Foundational Learning
**Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs)**
- *Why needed:* Traditional state-space models assume linear dynamics; GPSSMs provide non-parametric Bayesian approach for complex nonlinear systems
- *Quick check:* GPSSMs use GPs to model transition functions, enabling flexible modeling of system dynamics

**Normalizing Flows**
- *Why needed:* Transform simple distributions into complex ones while maintaining tractable probability density calculations
- *Quick check:* Flow-based transformations enable modeling of non-stationary and multimodal distributions

**Variational Inference**
- *Why needed:* Approximate intractable posterior distributions in Bayesian models with scalable optimization
- *Quick check:* Variational methods trade exact inference for computational tractability in complex models

**Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)**
- *Why needed:* Efficient sequential state estimation for high-dimensional systems with nonlinear dynamics
- *Quick check:* EnKF uses ensemble of state estimates to approximate posterior distribution, avoiding covariance matrix operations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Shared GP -> Input-dependent Normalizing Flows -> State Transition Model -> EnKF State Estimation -> Variational Inference

**Critical Path**
Observation data -> Shared GP feature extraction -> Normalizing flow transformation -> State prediction -> EnKF update -> Parameter optimization via variational inference

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Shared GP vs multiple independent GPs: reduced parameters and computation at cost of some modeling flexibility
- Normalizing flows vs explicit non-stationary kernels: more general transformations but increased optimization complexity
- Variational inference vs exact inference: computational efficiency vs potential approximation bias

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor convergence in variational inference suggests inadequate flow capacity or learning rate issues
- EnKF divergence indicates poor state prediction quality from GP-flow combination
- Computational bottlenecks may arise from flow architecture choices rather than GP structure

**3 First Experiments**
1. Compare shared GP + flows vs multiple independent GPs on synthetic linear system with known dynamics
2. Test flow capacity requirements by varying depth/number of flow layers on non-stationary benchmark
3. Evaluate EnKF performance with exact vs approximate posterior updates on small-scale problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions, but several areas warrant further investigation: the scalability limits of the normalizing flow architecture for extremely high-dimensional systems, the robustness of the variational inference algorithm to hyperparameter choices, and the generalization performance across diverse application domains beyond the tested datasets.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity claims rely on theoretical analysis that requires empirical verification across different problem scales
- Performance improvements demonstrated primarily on specific synthetic and real-world datasets, with generalizability to other domains untested
- Variational inference algorithm's convergence properties and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices are not thoroughly explored

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The core mathematical framework and theoretical complexity improvements are sound
**Medium confidence:** Empirical performance claims based on current experimental results
**Medium confidence:** The integration of normalizing flows with GP priors for non-stationary modeling

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the normalizing flows and shared GP architecture to overall performance
2. Test the method on diverse real-world high-dimensional systems beyond the current dataset selection to assess generalizability
3. Perform runtime benchmarking across varying state dimensions and dataset sizes to verify the claimed computational efficiency improvements empirically
