# Adaptive PII Mitigation Framework for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.12465
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12465
- **Reference count**: 11
- **Primary result**: Adaptive PII mitigation framework achieves 0.95 F1 score for passport numbers vs 0.33 (Presidio) and 0.54 (Amazon Comprehend), with 4.6/5 user trust score

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an adaptive PII mitigation framework for large language models (LLMs) to address compliance challenges posed by global data protection regulations. The core method involves a policy engine that dynamically converts regulatory requirements into actionable rules, combined with contextual PII detection and adaptive masking/anonymization techniques. The framework was evaluated against existing tools, demonstrating superior performance with an F1 score of 0.95 for passport numbers (vs 0.33 for Microsoft Presidio and 0.54 for Amazon Comprehend). Human evaluation showed an average user trust score of 4.6/5, with the system successfully navigating GDPR's stricter anonymization requirements versus CCPA's pseudonymization and opt-out mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) an adaptive policy engine that translates regulatory requirements into machine-readable rules through periodic document review and domain expert validation, (2) a contextual PII detection system that uses named entity recognition combined with semantic proximity analysis to assign sensitivity levels (1-3) to entities, and (3) adaptive remediation techniques that apply type-specific masking/anonymization based on both entity classification and jurisdictional requirements. The system maintains audit logs for regulatory transparency and integrates as guardrails for LLM inputs/outputs.

## Key Results
- Achieved 0.95 F1 score for passport number detection compared to 0.33 (Microsoft Presidio) and 0.54 (Amazon Comprehend)
- Demonstrated 4.6/5 average user trust score in human evaluation
- Successfully navigated GDPR's strict anonymization requirements versus CCPA's pseudonymization and opt-out mechanisms
- Showed superior performance on date detection (0.94 F1) compared to existing tools (0.62-0.76)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Contextual Sensitivity Scoring
Context-aware PII detection reduces false positives/negatives by evaluating entities within defined token ranges to identify contextual relationships. The system distinguishes between "Smith" in "John Smith is attending a meeting" (PII) versus "Smith's Bakery offers discounts" (non-PII) through semantic context analysis and proximity scoring.

### Mechanism 2: Adaptive Policy Engine for Jurisdictional Translation
The policy engine dynamically converts regulatory requirements into actionable rules through periodic document review and domain expert intervention. It reconciles conflicts between regulations - for example, applying GDPR's stricter anonymization versus CCPA's pseudonymization and opt-out mechanisms based on jurisdiction.

### Mechanism 3: Type-Specific Adaptive Remediation
Detected PII triggers tailored remediation: names replaced with pseudonyms, identifiers hashed, dates obfuscated to year ranges. This approach preserves data utility while achieving compliance, with audit logs maintained for regulatory transparency.

## Foundational Learning

- **PII vs. SPI classification and sensitivity levels**: The framework differentiates between standard PII (names, dates) and SPI (passport numbers, SSNs), with three sensitivity levels determining remediation stringency. *Quick check*: Given "Mark Smith's SSN is 123-45-6789," which entities qualify as Level 1, 2, and 3 sensitivity respectively?

- **Jurisdictional regulatory divergence (GDPR vs. CCPA)**: The system must navigate GDPR's explicit consent requirements and strict anonymization versus CCPA's opt-out mechanisms and pseudonymization allowances. *Quick check*: Under which regulation would retaining "User John donated $500" with masking only the donation amount be compliant, and why?

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER) and context-aware NLP**: The detection component relies on ML-based entity recognition plus semantic context analysis to reduce false positives. *Quick check*: How would a context-aware NER system handle "Black Friday" versus "Friday, March 15, 1990" differently?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Policy Database → Adaptive Policy Engine → Dynamic Contextual PII Detection → Adaptive Masking/Anonymization → Audit Logs → OneShield Guardrails Integration
- **Critical path**: Regulatory document ingestion → domain expert rule encoding → PII detection with context scoring → rule-triggered remediation → audit log generation. The detection-to-remediation path operates in real-time for LLM interactions.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Automation vs. expert oversight (policy engine automates but requires expert validation), data utility vs. compliance strictness (GDPR demands full anonymization reducing utility), latency vs. context depth (deeper analysis increases processing time).
- **Failure signatures**: False negatives on nested PII (e.g., email addresses within hyperlinks), false positives on context-insensitive detection (e.g., flagging "Black Friday" as PII), compliance gaps on public figure exemptions.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison on benchmark datasets to replicate F1 scores, 2) Jurisdictional stress test verifying GDPR vs. CCPA mode outputs, 3) Edge case disambiguation testing proximity analysis thresholds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Regulatory conflict resolution**: How can overlapping regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR's strict anonymization vs. CCPA's pseudonymization) be algorithmically reconciled in a unified compliance workflow? The current framework switches modes but automatic conflict resolution remains future work.

- **Automated regulation integration**: Can new regulations be integrated without manual domain expert intervention? The paper notes plans to automate this, but currently relies on expert validation for rule encoding.

- **Downstream task impact**: To what extent does adaptive masking preserve LLM downstream performance compared to static redaction? The paper claims context preservation avoids degradation but didn't quantify this trade-off.

## Limitations

- Real-world effectiveness depends on quality and timeliness of domain expert input for regulatory updates, creating potential bottlenecks
- No public validation exists for the policy engine's conflict resolution with novel regulatory frameworks without precedents
- Adaptive remediation assumes downstream tasks can tolerate information loss, which may not hold for all use cases

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Contextual sensitivity scoring mechanism is technically sound and supported by related work
- **Medium confidence**: Policy engine design is reasonable but lacks direct empirical validation for complex conflict resolution
- **Medium confidence**: Type-specific remediation methods are well-established though specific implementation remains proprietary

## Next Checks

1. Conduct temporal validation study by simulating rapid regulatory changes and measuring policy engine update cycle effectiveness
2. Perform utility retention analysis comparing task performance on raw vs. remediated data across different PII types
3. Test framework's handling of nested PII and culturally diverse contexts not covered in original benchmark datasets
