# LANTERN: Scalable Distillation of Large Language Models for Job-Person Fit and Explanation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.05490
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05490
- **Reference count:** 37
- **One-line primary result:** +0.24% apply rate, +0.28% qualified applications in online A/B test.

## Executive Summary
LANTERN introduces a scalable knowledge distillation framework for LinkedIn's job-person fit and explanation tasks. It addresses the challenge of deploying large language models (LLMs) in production by distilling a black-box teacher LLM into two lightweight student models: an encoder for classification and a decoder for explanation generation. The framework employs multi-level knowledge distillation, synthetic data generation, and prompt engineering to achieve high-quality outputs with improved ROUGE scores and F1 metrics compared to baselines. Online deployment demonstrates measurable gains in key product metrics, validating its effectiveness for real-time applications.

## Method Summary
LANTERN uses a two-stage approach: (1) finetune a Qwen2.5-7B-instruct teacher on human-filtered seed data, then (2) distill to specialized students—a 0.4B ModernBERT encoder for classification and a 1.5B Qwen2.5 decoder for explanations. The classification model is queried 30× more frequently than the explanation, motivating the architectural split for latency optimization. Multi-stage distillation (7B→1.5B→0.5B) is used to smooth knowledge transfer when the capacity gap is large. The framework employs TVD loss for explanation generation and synthetic data for classification, with prompt decomposition to reduce hallucination.

## Key Results
- Multi-stage distillation improves ROUGE-1 from 0.7136 to 0.7726 compared to single-stage.
- LANTERN achieves +0.24% apply rate and +0.28% qualified applications in online A/B test.
- 0.4B encoder provides 4× throughput with negligible degradation for classification task.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Multi-stage distillation preserves performance better than direct compression when the capacity gap between teacher and student is large.
- **Mechanism:** The paper suggests that a large capacity gap (e.g., 7B → 0.5B) causes "representational mismatch." By introducing an intermediate teacher (e.g., 7B → 1.5B → 0.5B), the knowledge transfer is smoothed, allowing the smallest student to learn effectively.
- **Core assumption:** The performance gain is due to the graduated transfer of "dark knowledge" (logits) rather than merely increased training steps or data augmentation.
- **Evidence anchors:** Table 2 and Section 5.2 show ROUGE-1 score jump from 0.7136 (single-stage) to 0.7726 (two-stage). Abstract mentions "multi-level knowledge distillation" as a core component.
- **Break condition:** This mechanism may fail if the intermediate teacher model is itself under-trained or if the data distribution shifts significantly between distillation stages.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Decomposing complex prompts into subtasks (Extraction → Evaluation) reduces hallucination and improves the quality of synthetic training data.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of asking a Teacher LLM to output a final rating immediately, the system forces intermediate reasoning steps. This "Chain-of-Thought" approach creates a cleaner, more verifiable signal for the student models to mimic.
- **Core assumption:** The Teacher LLM's intermediate reasoning steps are logically consistent and directly correlate with higher quality final outputs.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.3.1 notes that complex prompts lead to "inconsistent or incomplete outputs" and describes the decomposition into extraction and evaluation subtasks. Abstract highlights the importance of "prompt engineering" for domain adaptation.
- **Break condition:** This mechanism assumes the cost of multiple inference calls for the Teacher (during training) is acceptable; it breaks if the subtasks are poorly defined, leading to error propagation.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Decoupling classification and generation into separate specialized models allows for architecture-specific latency optimization.
- **Mechanism:** The "fit" classification is a high-frequency, low-latency task suited for a lightweight encoder (ModernBERT, 0.4B), while "explanation" is a low-frequency, high-quality task suited for a larger decoder (Qwen, 1.5B). This prevents the latency penalty of generative models on the critical classification path.
- **Core assumption:** The classification label provides sufficient signal for the downstream product experience without requiring the explanation to be generated simultaneously.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 3.1 states the classification score is queried "30× more often" than the explanation. Section 6.1 notes the classification model was downscaled to 0.4B with "negligible degradation" to achieve 4× throughput.
- **Break condition:** If users (or downstream systems) consistently require explanations for every prediction, the separate decoder invocation would become a latency bottleneck.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Knowledge Distillation (KD) Objectives
  - **Why needed here:** LANTERN relies on transferring "logit-level" insights. Understanding metrics like Forward KL (FKL), Jensen-Shannon (JS), and Total Variation Distance (TVD) is required to interpret Table 1 and select the right loss function.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might minimizing Total Variation Distance (TVD) yield higher ROUGE scores than minimizing Forward KL divergence (FKL), as seen in the results?

- **Concept:** Encoder-only vs. Decoder-only Architectures
  - **Why needed here:** The framework splits the task into two distinct model types. You must understand why an Encoder (like ModernBERT/BERT) is preferred for classification (speed, bidirectional context) over a Decoder (like Qwen/GPT).
  - **Quick check question:** Why is a 0.4B Encoder model sufficient for the high-traffic classification task while the explanation task requires a 1.5B Decoder?

- **Concept:** Synthetic Data Generation (SDG)
  - **Why needed here:** The entire training pipeline depends on $D_{seed}$ and $D_{synthetic}$ generated by a Teacher. You need to grasp how "Human-in-the-Loop" filtering creates the seed set from raw model outputs.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the specific role of the "Human-in-the-Loop" evaluation step described in Section 4.1.3, and what specific failure mode (hallucinations) does it prevent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Profiles/Jobs → Prompt Templates → Black-box Teacher (GPT-4o) → Human Filtering ($D_{seed}$) → Finetuned In-house Teacher (Qwen2.5-7B) → Student Distillation → Encoder Student (ModernBERT-0.4B) + Decoder Student (Qwen2.5-1.5B)

- **Critical path:** The Prompt Engineering & Data Filtering stage (Section 3.3.1 & 4.1.3). If the synthetic labels from the teacher are noisy or hallucinated, the distilled students will inherit these flaws ("Garbage In, Garbage Out").

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Latency vs. Accuracy:** The paper trades a potential ~1.5% accuracy boost (by using larger models) for a 4× throughput gain (Section 6.1).
  - **Mode-Covering vs. Mode-Seeking:** Section 5.1.2 implies a tradeoff between standard loss metrics and ROUGE scores; TVD was chosen over FKL despite different loss profiles to maximize generation quality.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Inconsistent Explanations:** The explanation contradicts the classification label (e.g., "High Fit" label but explanation lists missing skills). This suggests a breakdown in the shared input representation or the classification threshold.
  - **Hallucinated Skills:** The student model generates requirements not present in the job description. This suggests overfitting or insufficient filtering in the $D_{seed}$ dataset.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Objective Function Sweep:** Replicate the Table 1 experiment using TVD, FKL, and JS divergence on a small slice of data to observe the tradeoff between loss and ROUGE scores.
  2. **Multi-Stage Ablation:** Train a 0.5B student directly from the 7B teacher vs. a 7B → 1.5B → 0.5B path to verify the "representational mismatch" hypothesis on your specific data.
  3. **Latency Budget Test:** Deploy the 0.4B Encoder vs. 1.5B Encoder in a staging environment to measure the P95 latency difference and verify it meets the <0.3s constraint mentioned in Section 6.2.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The exact prompt templates and human-in-the-loop filtering criteria are omitted for confidentiality, making faithful reproduction challenging.
- Dataset sizes for $D_{seed}$ and $D_{cls}$ are unspecified, though the authors claim the approach scales to LinkedIn's production environment.
- The offline-to-online metric translation is indirect—while ROUGE and F1 scores show relative improvements, the 0.24% and 0.28% online gains are presented without confidence intervals or statistical significance testing.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The multi-stage distillation mechanism and architecture split (encoder for classification, decoder for explanation) are well-supported by empirical results in Tables 1 and 2, with clear latency and quality tradeoffs documented in Section 6.1.
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that prompt decomposition reduces hallucination is plausible but lacks direct corpus validation. The effectiveness of TVD over FKL is demonstrated, but the theoretical justification for this choice remains implicit.
- **Low confidence:** The scalability claims (LinkedIn-scale deployment) are asserted but not independently verified. The exact conditions under which the classification-explanation inconsistency failure mode manifests are not quantified.

## Next Checks
1. **Objective Function Sweep:** Replicate Table 1's experiment comparing TVD, FKL, and JS divergences on a small validation set to observe the tradeoff between loss minimization and ROUGE score maximization.
2. **Multi-Stage Distillation Ablation:** Train a 0.5B student directly from the 7B teacher versus a 7B→1.5B→0.5B path to empirically verify the "representational mismatch" hypothesis and measure performance degradation.
3. **Latency Budget Test:** Deploy the 0.4B encoder and 1.5B decoder in a staging environment to measure P95 latency and verify the <0.3s constraint while maintaining the reported 4× throughput improvement.
