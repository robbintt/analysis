core_contribution: This study addresses the challenge of co-creation in Sign Language
  Processing and Machine Translation (SLMT) by developing a participation typology
  and applying it to assess existing research. The authors analyze 111 SLMT-related
  articles, categorizing them based on the involvement of sign language users and
  communities.

# Co-creation for Sign Language Processing and Machine Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.01553
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01553
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 75% of SLMT papers lack meaningful sign language community involvement

## Executive Summary
This study systematically reviews 111 SLMT papers to assess the level of sign language community (SLC) involvement using a novel six-level co-creation typology. The findings reveal that most research falls at the lowest levels of engagement, with 75% showing no SL user involvement whatsoever. The paper proposes a framework for improving co-creation in SLMT projects, emphasizing the need for early engagement, continuous dialogue, and formal guidelines for ethical collaboration. The work highlights the fundamental shift needed from viewing sign languages as data to recognizing them as living languages requiring meaningful community partnership.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic literature review of 193 candidate papers from two parent reviews, filtering to 111 SLMT-focused papers that explicitly mentioned user involvement. They manually categorized each paper using an adapted participation typology based on depth (power distribution), breadth (diversity), and scope (project stages) of SLC involvement. Classification relied on analysis of "Deaf involvement" and "Evaluation" sections, with papers assigned to levels ranging from -1 (Denigration) to 4 (Learning as One). The typology was then aligned with 9 participatory design principles from NLP research.

## Key Results
- 83 of 111 papers (75%) showed no sign language user involvement (Level -1)
- Only 2 papers reached Level 2 (Learning From), none reached Level 3 or 4
- When SLCs were involved, it was typically for data collection or evaluation, not ideation or decision-making
- National Association of the Deaf partnerships were rare and often lacked documented decision-making input

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: SL Community Involvement → Research Validity and Ethical Outcomes
- Claim: Meaningful involvement of sign language communities in decision-making processes improves both research validity and ethical alignment, compared to hearing-led projects without SLC input.
- Mechanism: SL users provide domain expertise about language complexity and community needs that non-signing researchers lack. Their involvement in ideation, design, and evaluation catches methodological errors and ensures outputs address actual use cases.
- Core assumption: SL users possess irreplaceable linguistic and cultural knowledge that cannot be approximated by technical expertise alone.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "findings reveal that the majority of studies lack meaningful engagement with sign language communities"; [section 5.2] Example of [46] where 11 hearing participants learned ASL via a 3-hour tutorial—data deemed not representative of natural SL, raising validity and ethical concerns (categorized as Level -1a)

### Mechanism 2: Power Distribution (Depth, Breadth, Scope) → Co-creation Level Achieved
- Claim: The degree of decision-making power shared across depth (control), breadth (diversity), and scope (project stages) determines the co-creation level attained.
- Mechanism: When hearing researchers retain final decision authority, SL user input becomes advisory rather than constitutive. Higher co-creation levels require proportional power redistribution and involvement across all project phases.
- Core assumption: Current SLMT research is predominantly hearing-led, creating systematic exclusion of SL perspectives.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.2] Adapted typology explicitly maps power distribution across six levels from Denigration to Working as One; [section 5.2] 83/111 papers (75%) at Level -1—no SL user involvement; only 2 papers reached Level 2; none reached Level 3 or 4

### Mechanism 3: Early Engagement + Continuous Dialogue → Sustainable Relationships
- Claim: Initiating co-creation at project ideation (not just evaluation) and maintaining continuous dialogue throughout the lifecycle produces sustainable, mutually beneficial collaborations.
- Mechanism: Early engagement establishes shared goals and trust before technical decisions are locked in. Continuous dialogue enables adaptation as community needs evolve and prevents misalignment.
- Core assumption: Projects can allocate resources (interpreters, time, budget) for sustained engagement; community has capacity to participate.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3] Identifies "shared goal" and "formal and sustainable relationship" as two common threads across co-creation definitions; [section 6.2] Proposal 3: "start the conversation with the SL-users and SLC early in the project, e.g. in the ideation phase"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sign Language as Multi-modal, Non-linear Communication**
  - Why needed here: SLMT is fundamentally different from text-to-text MT; sign languages operate simultaneously across hands, face, and torso. Approaching SL as "video data" rather than a linguistic system leads to invalid research designs.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why recording hearing interpreters translating from written text produces fundamentally different data than recording natural SL production?

- **Concept: Participatory Design Principles (Caselli et al.)**
  - Why needed here: The paper aligns its typology with 9 participatory design principles for NLP. Understanding these (e.g., "language as people, not data," "design is continuous") is prerequisite to interpreting the typology and applying guidelines.
  - Quick check question: How does principle 4 ("Data and communities are not separate things") challenge standard NLP data collection practices?

- **Concept: Power Dynamics in Minority Community Research**
  - Why needed here: The typology explicitly addresses power imbalance between hearing researchers and SLCs. Without understanding positionality and privilege, well-intentioned inclusion can replicate exclusion.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes Level 2 (Learning From) from Level 3 (Learning Together) in terms of decision-making authority?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Typology (6 levels) <-[Depth, Breadth, Scope]-> Advanced Typology (Levels 4a/4b/4c) <-[Caselli Guidelines]-> 10 Co-creation Guidelines

- **Critical path:**
  1. Self-assessment: Classify current project at typology level using depth/breadth/scope analysis
  2. Define stakeholders: Identify SL users, deaf/HoH researchers, and community organizations (NADs)
  3. Establish common goals: Negotiate shared objectives before technical decisions
  4. Set communication protocols: Budget for interpreters, establish dissemination in participants' preferred language
  5. Continuous evaluation: Regular typology re-assessment as project evolves

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Depth vs. feasibility: Full power redistribution (Level 4) requires more time and may slow initial technical progress
  - Breadth vs. capacity: Representing full community diversity increases coordination complexity and can exacerbate research fatigue
  - Scope vs. resources: Involving SL users in all stages requires sustained funding beyond typical grant cycles

- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Inclusion for the sake of inclusion": SL users present but not influencing decisions (Level 0)
  - Single-signer data collection: One native signer recorded → no variation captured
  - Late-stage engagement: SL users consulted only for evaluation after system is built (Level 1)
  - Token NAD involvement: National association listed as partner without documented decision-making input

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline assessment**: Apply the typology to 3-5 recent SLMT projects. Document depth (who decides?), breadth (who is represented?), and scope (when are they involved?). Identify gaps.
  2. **Communication protocol pilot**: For an upcoming data collection phase, draft a communication plan specifying: language of interaction, interpreter provisions, feedback mechanisms, and timeline communication. Review with at least one SL community representative before implementation.
  3. **Stakeholder mapping expansion**: Identify a National Association of the Deaf (NAD) or deaf studies program relevant to your target SL. Document potential collaboration roles beyond "data provider." Assess feasibility of Level 2+ engagement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the temporal evolution of stakeholder relationships be formally integrated into the participation typology?
- Basis: The authors acknowledge the "dynamic nature of co-creation" and state, "We did not explore this temporal aspect in detail and have left it for future work."
- Why unresolved: The proposed typology provides a static assessment of participation levels but does not account for how these relationships and requirements change over the lifecycle of a project.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal case study tracking a project's movement across typology levels from inception to completion.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the "depth" dimension be operationalized to quantify the distribution of power between hearing and deaf researchers?
- Basis: The paper notes that the "typology does not clearly quantify the amount of power distributed between hearing, and HoH or deaf researchers."
- Why unresolved: While the typology identifies the presence or absence of diverse stakeholders, it currently lacks a metric to measure the specific degree of decision-making control held by each group.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a quantitative rubric that scores decision-making instances based on who initiates, negotiates, and finalizes key research choices.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do the proposed formal guidelines enable projects to reach Level 4 ("Working as One")?
- Basis: The authors derive guidelines based on a literature review of past failures but do not present a validation of these guidelines through the successful execution of a new, high-level co-creation project.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the proposed structural changes (e.g., communication protocols, funding allocation) are sufficient to overcome the systemic barriers identified in the 111 reviewed articles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of the guidelines in a new SLMT initiative that successfully achieves a Level 4 classification.

## Limitations

- Classification relies on subjective interpretation of limited metadata from published papers
- Absence of Level 3-4 papers may reflect field limitations or classification conservatism
- Typology does not account for temporal evolution of stakeholder relationships
- Power distribution metrics are not quantified, making depth assessment subjective

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Systematic methodology for literature review; basic finding that 75% of SLMT papers lack SL user involvement
- **Medium confidence**: Proposed six-level typology and its mapping to participatory design principles
- **Medium confidence**: Analysis of barriers to co-creation, as these align with known challenges in minority community research

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate classification**: Independently apply the typology to 10 randomly selected papers from Appendix B to assess inter-rater reliability and classification consistency

2. **Stakeholder validation**: Present the typology and preliminary findings to SL community representatives and NADs for feedback on accuracy and practical applicability

3. **Longitudinal tracking**: Monitor the co-creation levels of new SLMT publications over the next 2-3 years to assess whether the proposed guidelines influence field practices
