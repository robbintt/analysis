core_contribution: The Axiom-Based Atlas maps mathematical theorems to vectors indexed
  by foundational axioms (Hilbert geometry, Peano arithmetic, ZFC), enabling structural
  comparison across domains. By representing logical dependencies as proof vectors,
  the framework allows for similarity metrics like cosine distance and clustering
  of theorems by shared logical structure.

# The Axiom-Based Atlas: A Structural Mapping of Theorems via Foundational Proof Vectors

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.00063
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00063
- **Reference count**: 6
- **Primary result**: Maps theorems to vectors via foundational axioms, enabling similarity metrics and AI integration

## Executive Summary
The Axiom-Based Atlas proposes a novel framework for organizing mathematical theorems by representing their logical dependencies as vectors indexed by foundational axioms (Hilbert geometry, Peano arithmetic, ZFC). This approach enables structural comparison across domains and supports similarity metrics like cosine distance, clustering, and integration with AI tools. A prototype assistant, Atlas-GPT, interprets natural language theorems and suggests axiom vectors, offering a scalable and interpretable model for analyzing mathematical knowledge.

## Method Summary
The framework encodes theorems as proof vectors, where each dimension corresponds to a foundational axiom. Logical dependencies are mapped to vector components, allowing for structural comparison using similarity metrics such as cosine distance. The system is designed to be scalable and interpretable, with potential applications in automated reasoning, education, and proof assistant integration. Atlas-GPT demonstrates a proof-of-concept for natural language theorem interpretation.

## Key Results
- The framework enables structural mapping of theorems via axiom-indexed vectors
- Similarity metrics (e.g., cosine distance) allow clustering of theorems by shared logical structure
- Atlas-GPT prototype interprets natural language theorems and suggests axiom vectors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages the logical structure of proofs by indexing theorems according to their foundational axioms. This creates a vector space where mathematical objects can be compared and clustered based on shared dependencies, enabling both interpretability and scalability in organizing mathematical knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- **Axiom indexing**: Mapping theorems to vectors based on foundational axioms (why needed: to enable structural comparison; quick check: verify vector components match axiom dependencies)
- **Cosine similarity**: Measuring theorem similarity in vector space (why needed: to quantify structural relatedness; quick check: test on known similar theorems)
- **Proof vectors**: Encoding logical dependencies as vector dimensions (why needed: to preserve proof structure; quick check: validate against proof assistant outputs)

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Natural language input → Theorem parsing → Axiom vector mapping → Similarity computation → Atlas-GPT interpretation
- **Critical path**: Input theorem → Parse logical structure → Map to axiom vector → Compute similarity → Output structural insights
- **Design tradeoffs**: Fixed axiom systems simplify computation but may limit generalizability; vector representations sacrifice nuance for scalability
- **Failure signatures**: Over-reliance on specific axioms may obscure alternative proofs; vector similarity may miss deep structural equivalences
- **First experiments**: 1) Test vector generation on a small theorem set; 2) Compare cosine similarity with expert judgment; 3) Evaluate Atlas-GPT accuracy on synthetic inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability to large, complex theorem libraries is unproven
- Risk of oversimplification when representing nuanced logical dependencies as fixed vectors
- Integration with proof assistants and AI tools remains largely theoretical

## Confidence
- **High**: The mathematical framework for representing theorems as axiom-indexed vectors is internally consistent and grounded in established proof theory
- **Medium**: The proposed similarity metrics (e.g., cosine distance) and clustering methods are valid but may oversimplify the richness of mathematical logic
- **Low**: The practical impact and usability of Atlas-GPT and the broader framework in real-world mathematical reasoning, education, or proof assistant integration are not yet demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability test**: Apply the Axiom-Based Atlas framework to a large, diverse theorem corpus (e.g., the Mizar Mathematical Library) and evaluate the computational feasibility and accuracy of vector representations
2. **Cross-system generalization**: Extend the framework to multiple foundational systems (e.g., constructive type theory) and assess whether the vector representations remain meaningful and comparable
3. **Usability study**: Conduct a pilot study with mathematicians and educators using Atlas-GPT to interpret and suggest axiom vectors for novel theorems, measuring accuracy, interpretability, and practical utility
