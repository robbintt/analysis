# Reinforcement Learning for Machine Learning Model Deployment: Evaluating Multi-Armed Bandits in ML Ops Environments

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.22595
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22595
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** RL-based deployment strategies, particularly Epsilon-Greedy and UCB, match or exceed traditional methods in model selection performance across real-world datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates whether reinforcement learning-based approaches, specifically multi-armed bandit algorithms, can improve model deployment decisions in ML Ops environments compared to traditional methods. The authors test six deployment strategies—including naive deployment, validation-based selection, A/B testing, and three RL approaches (Epsilon-Greedy, UCB, and Thompson Sampling)—across two real-world datasets: a Census dataset for income classification and a highly imbalanced Bank Account Fraud dataset. Results show that RL-based methods, particularly Epsilon-Greedy and UCB, match or exceed traditional approaches in both datasets, with Epsilon-Greedy achieving the highest overall performance on the Fraud dataset (PR-AUC of 0.0690) and A/B testing performing best on the Census dataset (balanced accuracy of 0.6571). The study demonstrates that RL methods provide adaptive model selection that reduces reliance on manual intervention and mitigates risks associated with model drift and overfitting, especially in environments where validation performance does not reliably predict production performance.

## Method Summary
The paper implements a sequential deployment framework using two real-world datasets (Census income classification and Bank Account Fraud) split into 8 sequential chunks. At each chunk boundary t, new models are trained on cumulative historical data using XGBoost with SMOTE for imbalance handling. Within chunks, data arrives in batches where deployment strategies select from available models (M_0 through M_t). The evaluation compares six strategies: naive replacement, validation-based selection, A/B testing, and three RL approaches (Epsilon-Greedy, UCB, Thompson Sampling). Rewards are binary, assigned when current batch performance exceeds previous batch performance. The paper uses Balanced Accuracy for Census and PR-AUC for Fraud datasets.

## Key Results
- Epsilon-Greedy achieved highest PR-AUC of 0.0690 on the Fraud dataset
- A/B testing performed best on Census dataset with balanced accuracy of 0.6571
- RL methods reduced manual intervention while maintaining or exceeding traditional approach performance
- Validation-based selection failed to predict production performance on the highly imbalanced fraud dataset
- Thompson Sampling maintained exploration throughout deployment but underperformed Epsilon-Greedy and UCB

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off via Epsilon-Greedy Selection
- **Claim:** If exploration rate ε is appropriately tuned, epsilon-greedy MAB can maintain stable model selection while allowing controlled exploration of newly trained models.
- **Mechanism:** At each batch decision point, the algorithm selects the highest Q-value model with probability (1-ε) and a random model with probability ε. Q-values are updated via incremental averaging based on binary rewards.
- **Core assumption:** Historical batch-level performance improvements predict future model reliability and performance degradation is detectable within batch intervals.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states RL approaches match or exceed traditional methods; section 2.4.2 defines Q-value updates; corpus lacks specific validation for ML deployment scenarios.
- **Break condition:** Fails when ε is too high (excessive switching) or too low (fails to adapt to concept drift); paper shows ε=0.7 degraded performance on Census dataset.

### Mechanism 2: Real-Time Performance Feedback Loop
- **Claim:** Continuous batch-level evaluation may enable faster detection of model degradation than fixed-sample A/B testing.
- **Mechanism:** Dual time-scale architecture—chunk-level for retraining, batch-level for dynamic model selection. Each batch triggers model selection and immediate reward calculation.
- **Core assumption:** Ground-truth labels arrive quickly enough for meaningful reward calculation and batch-level metric fluctuations signal genuine performance shifts.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions continuous evaluation and real-time rollback; section 4.2.1 describes dual time-scale decision making.
- **Break condition:** Fails when label latency exceeds batch interval or class imbalance makes batch metrics unreliable.

### Mechanism 3: Thompson Sampling for Posterior-Guided Exploration
- **Claim:** If prior distributions are reasonably specified, Thompson Sampling may allocate exploration proportional to each model's probability of being optimal.
- **Mechanism:** Maintains posterior distributions for each model's performance, sampling from these to guide selection decisions using Gaussian-Gamma conjugate model.
- **Core assumption:** Posterior distributions concentrate rapidly enough for practical decision-making and exploration cost is acceptable.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 2.6.4 demonstrates Gaussian-Gamma approach performs well despite theoretical limitations; section 5.3.2 shows transition matrices maintain exploration.
- **Break condition:** Underperforms when early priors are poor or exploration cost is high; paper shows Thompson achieved only 0.0548 PR-AUC vs. 0.0690 for ε-greedy on fraud dataset.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-Armed Bandit Formulation**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how deployment strategies map to MAB arms is prerequisite for interpreting the paper's core comparison framework.
  - **Quick check question:** Given k candidate models, can you explain why selecting a model is analogous to pulling an arm with unknown reward distribution?

- **Concept: Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's central thesis hinges on whether RL methods balance this trade-off better than static heuristics.
  - **Quick check question:** If ε=0.1 and you have 5 models, what is the probability of selecting the current best model vs. a random model?

- **Concept: Reward Function Design for Non-Stationary Environments**
  - **Why needed here:** The binary reward based on performance improvement reflects adaptation goals in drifting environments.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a reward of r=1 if f(M_τ, D_τ) > f(M_{τ-1}, D_{τ-1}) be preferable to using f(M_τ, D_τ) directly as reward?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Historical Data Store → Chunk-Level Retraining Pipeline → Model Registry (M_0...M_t) → Batch-Level Selector (ε-greedy/UCB/TS) → Deployed Model → Reward Calculator → Q-Value/Posterior Updater → Selector

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize model set with validation scores from first chunk
  2. For each incoming batch: select model, compute metric, calculate reward, update Q-values
  3. At chunk boundaries: train new model on cumulative data, add to model set
  4. Monitor for performance degradation requiring hyperparameter adjustment

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **ε selection:** Lower values (0.1-0.3) favor stability; higher values (0.5-0.7) increase adaptation but risk instability. Paper shows optimal ε differs by dataset characteristics.
  - **Batch size vs. responsiveness:** Smaller batches enable faster detection but increase metric variance.
  - **Model pool depth:** Keeping all historical models vs. pruning. Paper kept all M_0 through M_t.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Excessive switching:** Dominant model changes every few batches; check if ε too high or Q-values unstable
  - **Stuck on suboptimal model:** Same model selected despite declining metrics; check if ε too low or reward function not reflecting degradation
  - **Validation-production gap:** Static heuristics deploy overfitted models; observable when validation scores high but production metrics decline

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Implement ε-greedy with ε∈{0.1, 0.3, 0.5} on a held-out sequential dataset; log Q-value convergence and model selection patterns to validate exploration behavior.
  2. **Reward function ablation:** Compare binary improvement reward vs. absolute metric reward vs. rolling average reward on a synthetic drift scenario to assess sensitivity to reward design.
  3. **Label latency stress test:** Introduce delayed ground-truth labels (1-batch, 3-batch, 5-batch delays) to quantify when batch-level feedback breaks down; measure performance degradation vs. A/B testing baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How do MAB-based deployment strategies scale to larger model ecosystems containing dozens or hundreds of candidate models? The experiments were limited to a small pool of models (up to 8) generated sequentially.

- **Open Question 2:** Can reinforcement learning deployment methods be effectively adapted for regression-based ML Ops tasks? The study focused exclusively on binary classification tasks.

- **Open Question 3:** How do RL-based deployment strategies perform in multi-objective optimization scenarios involving business metrics? The current evaluation optimized for single technical performance metrics.

- **Open Question 4:** How do these deployment approaches handle heterogeneous model architectures? The experimental setup utilized a homogeneous set of models (all XGBoost).

## Limitations
- Unknown exact batch sizes and number of batches per chunk, despite being crucial for replication
- Missing XGBoost hyperparameters, validation split ratios, and specific feature engineering steps
- A/B testing parameters (significance level, statistical power, minimum detectable effect) not provided
- Reward function assumes immediate ground-truth availability, which may not reflect real-world deployment scenarios

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core claim that Epsilon-Greedy and UCB RL methods match or exceed traditional deployment strategies is well-supported by the experimental results with clear performance metrics.
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism by which batch-level performance feedback enables faster adaptation than A/B testing is theoretically sound but relies on assumptions about label availability not empirically validated.
- **Low Confidence:** The claim that Thompson Sampling maintains exploration throughout deployment is based on transition matrix analysis, but practical implications on final performance remain unclear given its inferior results.

## Next Checks

1. **Batch Size Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary batch sizes (100, 300, 700, 1000) within each chunk to quantify how metric variance affects RL method performance and determine optimal batch sizing.

2. **Label Latency Stress Test:** Introduce controlled delays (1-batch, 3-batch, 5-batch) between prediction and ground-truth availability to measure when the batch-level feedback loop breaks down and compare degradation patterns against A/B testing.

3. **Reward Function Ablation:** Compare the binary improvement reward against absolute metric reward and rolling average reward across synthetic concept drift scenarios to isolate the impact of reward design on exploration-exploitation balance and final performance.
