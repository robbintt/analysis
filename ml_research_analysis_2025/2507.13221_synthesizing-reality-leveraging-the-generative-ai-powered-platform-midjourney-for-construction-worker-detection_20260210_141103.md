# Synthesizing Reality: Leveraging the Generative AI-Powered Platform Midjourney for Construction Worker Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.13221
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13221
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: YOLOv7 trained on synthetic images achieved AP@0.5 of 0.937 on real construction worker detection

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to generating synthetic training data for construction worker detection using the generative AI platform Midjourney. The method employs a parameterizable prompt template to generate diverse construction scenarios, which are then used to train a YOLOv7 object detection model. The results demonstrate that synthetic data can achieve high performance on real-world detection tasks, with average precision of 0.937 at IoU=0.5, though some gap remains compared to real-data-only training. The approach offers a promising solution to the challenge of data scarcity in the construction industry.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a parameterizable prompt template with four variable slots (location, weather/lighting, camera type, aspect ratio) to generate diverse construction scenarios. A total of 3,000 prompt combinations were submitted to Midjourney via a Discord bot, generating 12,000 images (4 per prompt). Each image was manually labeled using MakeSense, resulting in 36,444 annotated instances. The YOLOv7 model was trained for 800 epochs on a synthetic dataset of 9,592 images (excluding flawed ones), then evaluated on both synthetic and real test sets. The evaluation revealed promising performance on real data (AP@0.5=0.937) despite being trained exclusively on synthetic images.

## Key Results
- YOLOv7 trained on synthetic images achieved AP@0.5 of 0.937 on real construction worker detection test set
- Synthetic-only training reached AP@0.5 of 0.994 on synthetic test set, indicating some reality gap
- Performance degraded for distant workers and heavily occluded instances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Diffusion-based text-to-image generation can produce sufficiently realistic training data for domain-specific object detection.
- **Mechanism:** Midjourney's diffusion model iteratively denoises random patterns into structured images conditioned on text prompts, producing photorealistic construction scenes that capture visual features learnable by DNNs.
- **Core assumption:** The visual features learned from synthetic images transfer to real-world inference despite potential distributional differences.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Evaluation on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642"
  - [section 3] "Each of the 3000 prompt combinations is sent to Midjourney (MJ) to generate four images, resulting in a total of 12,000 images"
  - [corpus] Medical imaging paper (arXiv:2501.06356) similarly uses generative AI for domain-specific synthesis, supporting cross-domain validity of the approach
- **Break condition:** If target domain has visual features (specific equipment, safety gear variants) not captured by diffusion model's training data, transfer degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Parameterized prompt engineering controls scene diversity along axes relevant to detection robustness.
- **Mechanism:** By systematically varying location, weather/lighting, camera type, and aspect ratio in prompts, the pipeline generates coverage across environmental conditions that would otherwise require extensive real-world collection.
- **Core assumption:** Prompt parameters meaningfully translate into visual diversity that DNNs learn as invariances.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3] "A range of parameters and the arrangement of words in the prompt were manually tested, aiming to produce realistic-looking images that varied in distance to workers, number of workers, lighting conditions, and scene contexts"
  - [section 4] "The synthetic images were crafted to depict a variety of construction scenarios, featuring different backgrounds, lighting conditions, camera types, and aspect ratios"
  - [corpus] Related work on synthetic captions (arXiv:2503.17871) supports prompt-engineering-as-diversity-control but remains indirect evidence
- **Break condition:** If prompt variations produce superficial rather than structural diversity (e.g., same poses, limited occlusion patterns), overfitting persists.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Synthetic-only training exhibits a reality gap that synthetic data does not fully eliminate.
- **Mechanism:** DNNs trained exclusively on synthetic data achieve near-perfect performance on synthetic test sets (AP@0.5=0.994) but degraded performance on real data (AP@0.5=0.937), indicating distributional shift between generated and actual imagery.
- **Core assumption:** The performance differential stems from visual distribution gap, not model capacity or training procedure.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 6] "The model achieved impressive results when evaluated on the 1200 synthetic dataset...AP of 0.5 reaching 0.994" vs. "AP@0.5 of 0.937" on real data
  - [section 6] Failure cases include "workers situated at a considerable distance from the camera or where significant portions of their bodies are obscured"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus evidence on synthetic-to-real gap quantification in construction domain; primarily inferred from paper's own data
- **Break condition:** If real-world test set distribution diverges significantly from synthetic training distribution (different camera equipment, geographic variations in worker attire), gap widens.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Average Precision (AP)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's entire evaluation framework rests on AP@IoU metrics; understanding what 0.5 vs. 0.5-0.95 thresholds measure is essential for interpreting results.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model predicts bounding boxes that consistently overlap ground truth by 40%, what would its AP@IoU=0.5 score be?

- **Concept: Diffusion Models (Text-to-Image)**
  - **Why needed here:** The core innovation uses Midjourney's diffusion architecture; understanding denoising process clarifies why generated images appear realistic but may lack domain-specific details.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a diffusion model trained on general internet images struggle with construction-specific equipment or safety gear?

- **Concept: Domain Shift / Sim-to-Real Transfer**
  - **Why needed here:** The performance gap between synthetic and real test sets is central to the paper's conclusions about limitations.
  - **Quick check question:** What visual features present in real construction photos might synthetic images systematically omit?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Prompt Generator -> Midjourney Bot -> Discord Bot -> MakeSense (labeling) -> YOLOv7 -> GPUs
- **Critical path:** Prompt template design -> automated generation pipeline -> manual labeling (bottleneck) -> model training -> dual-dataset evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Manual labeling ensures accuracy but negates automation benefits (8 images discarded for flaws, 36,444 instances labeled by hand)
  - Midjourney's photorealism vs. 3D rendering approaches (Blender, Unity) that offer automatic annotation but lower realism
  - Single-class detection (workers only) vs. multi-class complexity
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Distant workers: model fails when workers occupy small image regions
  - Heavy occlusion: obscured body parts cause detection failures
  - Generation artifacts: 8/12,000 images contained no workers despite "construction workers" prompt
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Train YOLOv7 on 9,592 synthetic images, evaluate on paper's real test set; confirm AP@0.5≈0.94 and AP@0.5-0.95≈0.64
  2. **Synthetic-real hybrid:** Add 10-20% real images to synthetic training set to measure gap closure (paper reports previous real-only training achieved AP@0.5-0.95=0.75 on same test set)
  3. **Prompt ablation:** Generate subset with fixed lighting/camera to isolate which parameters drive diversity vs. overfitting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Manual labeling remains a bottleneck, negating some automation benefits
- Performance degrades for distant workers and heavily occluded instances
- Reality gap persists, with synthetic-only training not fully matching real-data performance

## Confidence
- Synthetic data quality for DNN training: High
- YOLOv7 architecture effectiveness: High
- Reality gap quantification: Medium
- Prompt diversity impact: Low

## Next Checks
1. Verify that manual labeling accuracy doesn't degrade when scaling to larger synthetic datasets
2. Test whether adding real images to synthetic training improves AP@0.5-0.95 more than AP@0.5
3. Evaluate model performance on construction sites with different equipment or safety gear than those in generated images
