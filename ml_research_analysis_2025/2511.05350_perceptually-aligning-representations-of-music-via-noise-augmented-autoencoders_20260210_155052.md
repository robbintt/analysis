# Perceptually Aligning Representations of Music via Noise-Augmented Autoencoders

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.05350
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05350
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Noise-augmented autoencoders improve perceptual alignment in music representations, enhancing surprisal estimation and EEG prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning perceptual features with latent structures in audio autoencoders through noise-augmented training. The authors propose a method where varying amounts of noise are added during training, forcing the model to encode more perceptually important information in coarser latent structures while progressively finer structures encode less perceptually relevant information. The hierarchical alignment is demonstrated through improved reconstruction quality and better performance on perceptual tasks including musical surprisal estimation and EEG brain response prediction. The results show that intermediate noise levels in aligned latent spaces yield the best performance, suggesting optimal capture of perceptual information at these levels.

## Method Summary
The method employs noise-augmented autoencoders where different amounts of noise are systematically added to latent representations during training. This noise injection strategy forces the autoencoder to prioritize encoding perceptually salient information in coarser latent structures while allowing finer structures to capture less perceptually critical details. The training process creates a hierarchical alignment between perceptual features and latent representations, with the noise levels acting as a mechanism to control the granularity of information preservation. The approach is evaluated through reconstruction quality comparisons and its effectiveness in downstream tasks like musical surprisal estimation and EEG prediction, with the key finding that intermediate noise levels produce optimal results for capturing important perceptual information.

## Key Results
- Noise-augmented autoencoders create hierarchical latent structures that better preserve perceptual information in aligned latent spaces
- Intermediate noise levels in aligned latent spaces yield the best results for musical surprisal estimation and EEG prediction tasks
- Aligned latent representations show higher correlations with perceptually validated symbolic pitch expectancy models compared to unaligned representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on the principle that noise injection during training forces the autoencoder to compress information hierarchically. When noise is added to latent representations, the model must learn to encode the most perceptually critical information in the most robust (coarse) latent structures that can withstand the noise corruption. This creates a natural hierarchy where coarser latents capture essential perceptual features while finer latents encode progressively less critical details. The noise augmentation acts as a regularizer that aligns the learned latent space with human perceptual organization, making the representations more suitable for tasks that require perceptual similarity matching or expectancy modeling.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Audio Input -> Encoder -> Latent Space (multi-level with noise) -> Decoder -> Reconstructed Audio

### Critical Path
Encoder processes audio into hierarchical latents -> Noise is added at different levels -> Decoder reconstructs from noisy latents -> Training minimizes reconstruction loss

### Design Tradeoffs
- Noise level vs. information preservation: Higher noise forces more compression but may lose important details
- Latent hierarchy depth vs. computational efficiency: Deeper hierarchies provide better alignment but increase complexity
- Reconstruction quality vs. perceptual alignment: Perfect reconstruction may not align with perceptual features

### Failure Signatures
- If noise levels are too high, the autoencoder cannot learn meaningful representations
- If latent hierarchy is too shallow, perceptual alignment cannot be achieved
- If training is insufficient, the hierarchical structure may not properly form

### First Experiments
1. Train autoencoder with varying noise levels and visualize latent space organization
2. Compare reconstruction quality between aligned and unaligned latent spaces
3. Evaluate surprisal estimation performance across different noise levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused primarily on music-specific tasks, limiting generalizability to other audio domains
- Lack of quantitative metrics for measuring alignment between perceptual features and latent structures
- Noise augmentation introduces task-specific hyperparameters that may require extensive tuning

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Noise-augmented autoencoder methodology and hierarchical structure formation
- **Medium confidence**: Music-specific empirical results for surprisal estimation and EEG prediction
- **Medium confidence**: Interpretation that intermediate noise levels capture optimal perceptual information

## Next Checks
1. Test noise-augmented autoencoder approach on non-musical audio domains (speech, environmental sounds) to evaluate cross-domain generalization
2. Develop quantitative metrics to measure alignment between perceptual features and latent structures beyond qualitative reconstruction comparisons
3. Conduct ablation studies varying noise across different latent levels to determine optimal noise schedules for different perceptual tasks
