# MMCTOP: A Multimodal Textualization and Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.21897
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21897
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: AUC improvements of 5–8 percentage points on benchmark datasets, largest gains in Phase III trials

## Executive Summary
MMCTOP addresses the challenge of integrating multimodal biomedical data for clinical trial outcome prediction by employing schema-guided textualization to standardize heterogeneous inputs, followed by modality-specific encoding and fusion via a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) mechanism. The framework uses LLM-based textualization to produce structured, auditable artifacts, which are then encoded with domain-specific models (ClinicalBERT for text, ChemBERTa for molecular structures). An SMoE layer with drug-disease-conditioned gating enables scalable, context-dependent specialization. MMCTOP consistently outperforms unimodal and traditional multimodal baselines, achieving AUC improvements of 5–8 percentage points on benchmark datasets, with the largest gains in Phase III trials. Ablations confirm that both textualization and selective expert routing are critical for performance and stability.

## Method Summary
MMCTOP integrates multimodal biomedical data through schema-guided textualization and a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) fusion mechanism. Heterogeneous inputs (clinical notes, molecular structures, trial metadata) are first converted into structured textual representations using LLM-based templates, producing auditable artifacts. These are encoded via modality-specific models (ClinicalBERT for text, ChemBERTa for molecules). An SMoE layer with drug-disease-conditioned gating dynamically routes information to specialized experts, enabling scalable and context-aware fusion. The approach is validated on benchmark clinical trial datasets, where it consistently outperforms unimodal and traditional multimodal baselines, with the largest gains observed in Phase III trials.

## Key Results
- AUC improvements of 5–8 percentage points over unimodal and traditional multimodal baselines
- Largest performance gains observed in Phase III clinical trial predictions
- Ablation studies confirm critical role of both textualization and selective expert routing for performance and stability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MMCTOP leverages schema-guided textualization to standardize heterogeneous biomedical data into structured, LLM-friendly formats, ensuring consistency and auditability. Modality-specific encoders (ClinicalBERT, ChemBERTa) capture domain-relevant features, while the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer with drug-disease-conditioned gating enables context-dependent specialization and scalable fusion. This design allows the model to dynamically adapt to complex multimodal inputs, outperforming traditional fusion methods that lack such fine-grained routing and specialization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Schema-guided textualization**: Needed to standardize heterogeneous biomedical data into structured, LLM-friendly formats; quick check: verify output consistency across modalities.
- **Modality-specific encoders (ClinicalBERT, ChemBERTa)**: Required to capture domain-relevant features in clinical text and molecular structures; quick check: confirm encoder performance on respective unimodal tasks.
- **Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE)**: Enables scalable, context-dependent specialization and fusion; quick check: assess routing sparsity and expert activation patterns.
- **Drug-disease-conditioned gating**: Dynamically routes information based on trial context; quick check: evaluate gating decisions across diverse trial scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Raw multimodal data -> Schema-guided textualization -> Modality-specific encoding (ClinicalBERT, ChemBERTa) -> SMoE fusion with drug-disease gating -> Clinical trial outcome prediction
- **Critical path**: Textualization → Encoding → SMoE fusion → Prediction; all stages are essential for optimal performance
- **Design tradeoffs**: Textualization adds preprocessing overhead but ensures standardization and auditability; SMoE improves scalability but increases model complexity
- **Failure signatures**: Poor textualization quality leads to information loss; SMoE routing errors cause unstable predictions; modality mismatch degrades fusion performance
- **First experiments**: 1) Ablate textualization to measure impact on multimodal integration; 2) Replace SMoE with simple concatenation to assess fusion gains; 3) Test performance under increasing class imbalance to evaluate robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability of schema-guided textualization beyond curated datasets remains uncertain
- Scalability of SMoE layers with increasing modality counts is not fully validated
- Performance robustness under highly imbalanced clinical trial labels is untested

## Confidence
- **High**: Outperformance of unimodal and traditional multimodal baselines on benchmark datasets; critical role of both textualization and selective expert routing confirmed via ablation
- **Medium**: Scalability claims under variable modality counts; stability of gains in Phase III trials
- **Low**: Generalizability to novel biomedical domains and real-world clinical trial data with higher noise levels

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MMCTOP on external, heterogeneous clinical trial datasets not used in training to test domain transfer
2. Perform stress tests with varying class imbalance ratios to assess robustness of outcome predictions
3. Compare performance and computational overhead of MMCTOP's SMoE layer against alternative fusion strategies (e.g., attention-based or transformer-based multimodal encoders) under increasing modality counts
