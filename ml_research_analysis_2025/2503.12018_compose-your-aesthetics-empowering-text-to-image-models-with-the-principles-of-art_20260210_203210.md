# Compose Your Aesthetics: Empowering Text-to-Image Models with the Principles of Art

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.12018
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12018
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces PoA framework and ArtDapter adapter for aesthetic personalization in T2I generation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning text-to-image generation with user-specific aesthetic preferences. The authors propose using the Principles of Art (PoA) as a structured framework to encode compositional aesthetics, enabling users to specify aesthetic controls beyond textual prompts. They introduce ArtDapter, a lightweight adapter trained on a large-scale annotated dataset (CompArt), which can be integrated with existing diffusion models to generate images that respect specified PoA conditions. The approach demonstrates improved aesthetic alignment while maintaining transferrability across different base models.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce the Principles of Art (PoA) framework to encode compositional aesthetics in a structured way, enabling users to specify aesthetic controls beyond textual prompts. They construct CompArt, a large-scale dataset annotated with PoA principles, and train ArtDapter, a lightweight adapter that learns to condition text-to-image diffusion models on these principles. The adapter is designed to be model-agnostic and can be integrated with existing diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and Kandinsky. During inference, users can specify PoA conditions alongside text prompts, and ArtDapter modifies the diffusion process to generate images that align with the specified aesthetics while preserving the semantic content of the text prompt.

## Key Results
- ArtDapter significantly outperforms baselines in both principle-level and image-level PoA alignment
- The approach maintains transferrability across different base T2I models (Stable Diffusion and Kandinsky)
- Human preference studies show strong user preference for ArtDapter-generated images when specific PoA principles are requested

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by introducing a structured framework (PoA) that captures compositional aesthetics in a way that can be learned by neural networks. The ArtDapter adapter learns to modulate the diffusion process based on these principles, effectively adding an aesthetic conditioning layer to existing T2I models. By training on a large annotated dataset, the adapter learns to map PoA conditions to specific visual patterns and compositional choices. The latent diffusion approach allows for efficient conditioning without requiring full retraining of the base model, enabling transferrability across different architectures.

## Foundational Learning

**Principles of Art (PoA)**: A codified set of compositional guidelines for visual aesthetics (e.g., balance, contrast, emphasis). *Why needed*: Provides a structured vocabulary for expressing aesthetic preferences that can be learned by neural networks. *Quick check*: Verify that the 12 principles cover the essential compositional elements across different artistic styles.

**Latent Diffusion**: Diffusion models operating in compressed latent space rather than pixel space. *Why needed*: Enables more efficient processing and easier conditioning without sacrificing image quality. *Quick check*: Compare latent vs. pixel-space diffusion quality and computational requirements.

**Adapter-based Fine-tuning**: Lightweight modules added to pre-trained models for specialized tasks. *Why needed*: Allows aesthetic conditioning without full model retraining, enabling transferrability. *Quick check*: Measure adapter parameter count relative to base model size.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text Prompt -> PoA Encoder -> ArtDapter Adapter -> Base Diffusion Model -> Generated Image

**Critical Path**: The key computational path is: user provides text + PoA conditions → PoA encoder converts conditions to latent representation → ArtDapter modifies diffusion denoising steps → base model generates conditioned image. The adapter's conditioning must happen at each denoising step for proper aesthetic alignment.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The authors chose latent diffusion over pixel-space to reduce computational cost and enable easier conditioning, but this may introduce some quality trade-offs. They opted for a lightweight adapter approach rather than full fine-tuning to ensure transferrability, but this limits the depth of aesthetic learning possible. The 12 PoA principles represent a balance between coverage and learnability, though some nuanced aesthetic concepts may be oversimplified.

**Failure Signatures**: When the adapter fails, common issues include: (1) the generated image satisfies the text prompt but ignores PoA conditions, (2) the image shows artifacts from improper latent conditioning, (3) the aesthetic modifications are too subtle to be perceptible, or (4) the text-to-image alignment degrades when PoA conditions are applied.

**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Test adapter conditioning with single PoA principles to verify basic functionality. 2) Evaluate transferrability by testing the same adapter across different base T2I models. 3) Conduct human preference studies comparing ArtDapter outputs with baseline diffusion outputs when specific PoA conditions are requested.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- The PoA framework introduces only 12 compositional principles, which may not capture the full breadth of aesthetic considerations
- The dataset (CompArt) is constructed from limited sources, potentially introducing bias toward specific aesthetic styles
- Evaluation relies heavily on human preference studies, which are subjective and may not generalize across different user populations

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Technical implementation of the ArtDapter adapter and its ability to condition on PoA principles during inference.

**Medium confidence**: Generalizability of PoA principles across different artistic styles and cultural contexts, and quantitative evaluation results given reliance on human preference studies.

**Low confidence**: Long-term stability and transferability of the approach across diverse T2I model architectures.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ArtDapter's performance on a more diverse and culturally representative dataset to assess generalizability of PoA principles.
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing the proposed latent diffusion approach with pixel-space diffusion to quantify any quality trade-offs.
3. Test the adapter's transferability on additional T2I models beyond Stable Diffusion and Kandinsky, including models with different architectural foundations.
