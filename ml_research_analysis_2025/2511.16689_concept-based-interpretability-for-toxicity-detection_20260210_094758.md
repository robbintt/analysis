# Concept-Based Interpretability for Toxicity Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16689
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16689

- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: Achieves 97.68% accuracy and F1-score on toxicity detection with concept-based interpretability using Concept Gradients

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of explaining model misclassifications in toxicity detection by proposing a concept-based interpretability method using Concept Gradients (CG). The approach identifies how changes in predefined toxic concepts directly affect model predictions, helping to diagnose why models misclassify toxic content. By introducing targeted lexicon sets and Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, the method quantifies over-attribution to toxic concepts and provides insights into broader toxic language patterns.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a concept-based interpretability framework for toxicity detection that uses Concept Gradients to measure how predefined toxic concepts (obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, sexual explicit) influence model predictions. The method creates targeted lexicon sets to capture toxic words contributing to misclassifications and introduces Word-Concept Alignment scores to quantify over-attribution. A lexicon-free augmentation strategy tests whether over-attribution persists when explicit toxic lexicons are removed. The framework is evaluated on Civil Comments and HateXplain datasets, demonstrating both high accuracy and improved interpretability for detecting toxic language patterns.

## Key Results
- Achieves 97.68% accuracy and 97.68% F1-score on Civil Comments and HateXplain datasets
- Concept Gradients analysis reveals higher concept attribution in misclassified samples
- Targeted lexicon sets and WCA scores effectively identify words leading to misclassifications due to over-attribution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by quantifying the relationship between toxic concepts and model predictions through gradient-based attribution. By measuring how perturbations in toxic concept representations affect output probabilities, the method can identify which concepts the model relies on most heavily. This allows for detection of over-reliance on certain toxic features that may lead to misclassifications, particularly when models incorrectly attribute toxicity to non-toxic content that shares surface-level similarities with toxic examples.

## Foundational Learning
- Concept Gradients: Gradients computed with respect to concept representations that measure how concept changes affect model predictions. Needed to quantify concept influence on predictions. Quick check: Verify gradient values align with intuitive concept importance.
- Word-Concept Alignment: Scoring mechanism that quantifies the degree to which words are over-attributed to toxic concepts. Needed to identify specific words causing misclassifications. Quick check: Test alignment scores against human-annotated toxic/non-toxic labels.
- Lexicon-based toxicity detection: Using predefined word lists to identify toxic content. Needed as baseline comparison and to understand model behavior with explicit toxic features. Quick check: Compare performance with and without lexicon constraints.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input text -> Tokenizer -> Toxic Concept Encoder -> Model Classifier -> Prediction + Concept Gradients -> Interpretability Analysis -> Lexicon sets + WCA scores

Critical path: Input text → Toxic Concept Encoder → Model Classifier → Prediction. The concept encoder and classifier must work in tandem to ensure concept attributions align with final predictions.

Design tradeoffs: Using predefined lexicons provides interpretability but may miss context-dependent toxicity. Lexicon-free augmentation increases robustness but may reduce precision. Gradient-based methods are computationally efficient but can be noisy for deep models.

Failure signatures: High WCA scores on non-toxic content indicate over-attribution. Concept Gradients pointing to irrelevant concepts suggest poor concept-model alignment. Performance drops on lexicon-free augmented data reveal reliance on surface-level features.

First experiments:
1. Compare Concept Gradients values between correctly classified and misclassified toxic samples
2. Test model performance on lexicon-free augmented versions of test sets
3. Validate WCA scores by correlating them with human judgments of toxic word attribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Accuracy and F1-score of 97.68% lack comparison to baseline models, making performance assessment difficult
- Predefined toxic concept lexicons may not capture evolving or context-dependent toxic language patterns
- Word-Concept Alignment scores lack rigorous validation of their correlation with actual model behavior

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Concept Gradients effectively identify concept influence on predictions | High |
| 97.68% accuracy/F1-score represents state-of-the-art performance | Medium |
| WCA scores and lexicon-free augmentation effectively reduce over-attribution | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct baseline comparisons with established toxicity detection models to validate the reported 97.68% accuracy and F1-score
2. Design a study to assess the correlation between WCA scores and actual model misclassifications
3. Test the effectiveness of the lexicon-free augmentation strategy by comparing model performance before and after augmentation on diverse datasets
