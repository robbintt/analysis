# Sequence-to-Image Transformation for Sequence Classification Using Rips Complex Construction and Chaos Game Representation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.10141
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10141
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Primary result**: 86.8% accuracy on breast cancer peptide dataset, 94.5% on lung cancer peptide dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel topological approach that transforms molecular sequences into images by combining Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with Rips complex construction from algebraic topology. The method maps sequence elements to 2D coordinates via CGR, computes pairwise distances, and constructs Rips complexes to capture both local structural and global topological features. The authors provide formal guarantees on representation uniqueness, topological stability, and information preservation. Extensive experiments on anticancer peptide datasets demonstrate superior performance over vector-based, sequence language models, and existing image-based methods, achieving 86.8% and 94.5% accuracy on breast and lung cancer datasets, respectively.

## Method Summary
The proposed method transforms molecular sequences into images through a two-step process: first, Chaos Game Representation maps amino acid sequences to 2D coordinates using iterative geometric transformations; second, Rips complex construction captures topological relationships between sequence elements by creating simplicial complexes based on pairwise distances. The resulting vertex-edge images preserve both local sequence patterns and global topological structures while being compatible with standard CNN architectures. The approach provides theoretical guarantees for unique representation, topological stability under small perturbations, and preservation of critical sequence information through formal mathematical proofs.

## Key Results
- Achieved 86.8% accuracy on breast cancer peptide dataset (949 sequences)
- Achieved 94.5% accuracy on lung cancer peptide dataset (901 sequences)
- Outperformed vector-based methods, sequence language models, and existing image-based approaches across multiple evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
- Demonstrated effectiveness of simple 3-layer CNN architecture, though pre-trained models like ResNet-50 also showed strong performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages topological data analysis to capture intrinsic structural patterns in molecular sequences that traditional vector representations miss. By constructing Rips complexes from CGR coordinates, the approach encodes both local sequential dependencies and global topological relationships as geometric features in images. This representation is particularly effective for biological sequences where functional properties often depend on complex spatial arrangements rather than simple linear patterns. The vertex-edge images created from 1-skeleton Rips complexes preserve critical structural information while maintaining compatibility with convolutional neural networks, enabling effective transfer of computer vision techniques to sequence classification tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Chaos Game Representation (CGR)**: A geometric method that maps sequences to 2D space through iterative coordinate transformations; needed to convert discrete sequence elements into continuous spatial representations that preserve local ordering and spacing patterns.
- **Rips Complex Construction**: A topological method that creates simplicial complexes from pairwise distances; needed to capture higher-order structural relationships between sequence elements beyond simple adjacency.
- **Simplicial Complexes**: Combinatorial structures consisting of vertices, edges, triangles, and higher-dimensional simplices; needed to represent the hierarchical topological relationships encoded in molecular sequences.
- **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**: Mathematical framework for extracting shape-based features from data; needed to provide theoretical guarantees about representation uniqueness and stability.
- **1-Skeleton vs Full Rips Complex**: The 1-skeleton contains only vertices and edges, while full complexes include higher-dimensional simplices; needed to balance computational efficiency with topological expressiveness.
- **Image-based Sequence Classification**: Converting sequences to images enables use of powerful CNN architectures; needed to leverage advances in computer vision for biological sequence analysis.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: CGR Mapping -> Distance Matrix Computation -> Rips Complex Construction -> Image Rendering -> CNN Classification

**Critical Path**: The core transformation pipeline involves mapping sequences to CGR coordinates, computing pairwise distances, constructing Rips complexes with threshold ε=0.3, and rendering the resulting graphs as fixed-size images. The CNN classifier then learns to distinguish between activity classes based on the topological features encoded in these images.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity for topological expressiveness by using only the 1-skeleton (vertices and edges) rather than full Rips complexes with higher-dimensional simplices. This simplification reduces computation time and improves visualization while potentially missing some higher-order topological features. The fixed ε threshold balances local and global feature capture but may not be optimal across all sequence lengths.

**Failure Signatures**: DenseNet/EfficientNet models performing poorly (~10-30% accuracy) indicates overfitting due to the small dataset size relative to model complexity. Generated images appearing blank or fully connected suggests incorrect distance scaling or threshold selection. Performance degradation with increasing sequence length may indicate that the fixed ε threshold is not length-invariant.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Implement CGR mapping for amino acid sequences with exact coordinate assignments and visualize resulting points to verify correct geometric transformation.
2. Construct Rips complexes from CGR coordinates using ε=0.3 and render vertex-edge images to confirm topological features are properly captured.
3. Train simple 3-layer CNN on rendered images and evaluate classification accuracy to establish baseline performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Does including higher-order simplices (triangles, tetrahedra) in the Rips complex image improve classification performance compared to the current vertex-edge representation? The paper focused on simplified 1-skeleton construction without testing whether capturing voids and cavities provides additional discriminative power.

**Open Question 2**: How effectively does the method generalize to non-peptide biological sequences like nucleotide sequences or SMILES strings? Current evaluation is limited to anticancer peptides, leaving generalization to other molecular representations untested.

**Open Question 3**: Is classification performance sensitive to the Rips complex threshold ε across varying sequence lengths? The fixed ε=0.3 was chosen based on validation but lacks sensitivity analysis to determine if threshold selection depends on sequence scale or length distribution.

## Limitations

- Exact CGR coordinate mapping and scaling parameter α remain unspecified, making precise reproduction difficult
- Fixed ε=0.3 threshold for Rips complex construction lacks sensitivity analysis across different sequence lengths
- Small dataset size (n≈900) raises concerns about model generalization, particularly for high-capacity pre-trained CNNs
- Baseline methods' architectures, hyperparameters, and preprocessing details are not described, limiting fair comparison assessment

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the mathematical formulation of CGR-to-Rips-complex transformation and theoretical framework
- **Medium confidence** in reported experimental results given lack of baseline implementation details and small dataset size
- **Low confidence** in claimed superiority over other methods without complete experimental protocols and reproducibility verification

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the CGR mapping and Rips complex construction with exact amino acid coordinate assignments and α parameter, then visualize resulting images to verify topological features match descriptions.

2. Train and evaluate the same CNN architectures (including ResNet-50, VGG19, EfficientNet) on the same datasets using proposed image representations, comparing results to reported 86.8% and 94.5% accuracy to validate reproducibility.

3. Implement at least one baseline method from literature with published code using identical train/test splits to verify claimed performance improvements are robust and not due to implementation differences.
