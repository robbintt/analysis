# OEMA: Ontology-Enhanced Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Zero-Shot Clinical Named Entity Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.15211
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15211
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: OEMA improves zero-shot clinical named entity recognition by addressing the mismatch between example selection and task granularity through ontology-enhanced token-level filtering and integrating entity-type descriptions with self-annotated examples in a multi-agent framework.

## Executive Summary
OEMA introduces a novel multi-agent framework for zero-shot clinical named entity recognition that addresses the granularity mismatch in traditional example selection. By combining ontology-guided token-level filtering with self-consistency-based annotation and dual prompting strategies, OEMA achieves state-of-the-art exact-match F1 scores on MTSamples and VAERS datasets, outperforming baseline methods by 6.2%-10.1% while matching supervised BioClinicalBERT performance under relaxed criteria.

## Method Summary
OEMA employs a three-agent framework where a self-annotator generates pseudo-labeled examples from unlabeled clinical text using zero-shot LLM prompting with self-consistency voting, a discriminator retrieves and filters relevant examples using SNOMED CT ontology-based token-level scoring, and a predictor combines entity-type descriptions with filtered examples for final NER predictions. The system operates entirely through in-context learning without model fine-tuning, using fixed LLM configurations (gpt-3.5-turbo for discriminator, gemini-2.5-flash or gpt-3.5 for predictor) and a retrieval pipeline that balances example diversity with noise reduction through K=12 candidate retrieval and k=3 example selection.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art exact-match F1 scores, outperforming baseline methods by 6.2%-10.1% on MTSamples and VAERS datasets
- Under relaxed-match criteria, matches performance of supervised BioClinicalBERT while significantly surpassing traditional CRF models
- Ablation studies show entity-type descriptions contribute 0.4-6.5 F1 points and self-annotated examples contribute 4.1-8.6 F1 points depending on dataset and metric

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Ontology-Guided Token-Level Example Filtering
The discriminator extracts SNOMED CT top-level concepts from both target sentences and candidate examples via ICL prompt, scoring each example's helpfulness based on token-level concept overlap rather than surface-level similarity. This tackles the granularity mismatch by retrieving fine-grained, semantically relevant examples for NER tasks.

### Mechanism 2: Self-Annotation with Two-Stage Majority Voting
The self-annotator samples multiple LLM outputs (temperature=0.7, 5 samples) and applies a two-stage majority voting strategy: Stage 1 retains mentions appearing in >50% of responses; Stage 2 assigns entity types via majority vote among retained mentions. This produces reliable pseudo-labels for in-context learning.

### Mechanism 3: Dual Prompting with Type Priors and Structured Examples
The predictor's prompt combines explicit entity-type descriptions (providing semantic constraints) with k selected self-annotated examples (providing pattern guidance). This dual approach compensates for self-annotation noise while anchoring predictions to domain-specific patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **In-Context Learning (ICL)**: Understanding how exemplars influence LLM predictions is essential since OEMA relies entirely on prompt-based learning without weight updates. Quick check: Can you explain why k=3 examples outperform k=5 in the hyperparameter experiments?
- **Self-Consistency Voting**: The self-annotator's reliability hinges on aggregating multiple sampled outputs. Quick check: What happens to annotation quality if temperature is set to 0.0 instead of 0.7?
- **SNOMED CT Hierarchy**: The discriminator maps text spans to 18 top-level SNOMED CT categories for scoring. Quick check: If a clinical term has no SNOMED CT mapping, how does OEMA handle it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Self-annotator -> Discriminator -> Predictor
- **Critical path**: 1) Build self-annotated corpus (offline, one-time cost); 2) At inference: retrieve K candidates via cosine similarity → ontology extraction → scoring → top-k selection → final prediction; 3) Discriminator uses fixed gpt-3.5-turbo regardless of backbone to control cost
- **Design tradeoffs**: K vs. k: K=12, k=3 balances retrieval diversity against noise. Larger K increases compute; larger k introduces annotation noise. Backbone choice: gemini-2.5-flash outperforms gpt-3.5 for baselines, but OEMA's relative gain is larger on gpt-3.5 (weaker backbone benefits more from framework). Discriminator fixed to gpt-3.5: Reduces cost but may limit performance ceiling
- **Failure signatures**: Ontology mismatch: Rare entity types lacking SNOMED coverage → discriminator assigns low scores → empty or irrelevant examples selected. Self-annotation drift: If unlabeled corpus has domain shift from test data, pseudo-labels mislead predictor. Hyperparameter sensitivity: k=1 or K=6 show notable F1 drops (see Figure 3)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate ablation: Run OEMA with entity-type descriptions only vs. examples only on MTSamples validation set to confirm contribution split. 2) Hyperparameter sweep: Test K∈{8,10,12,15} and k∈{2,3,4} on VAERS to verify bell-shaped curve generalization. 3) Ontology coverage audit: Measure % of entities in test sets with SNOMED CT mappings; correlate with per-entity F1 scores to assess break condition

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can OEMA be evolved from a static framework into a dynamic ecosystem that utilizes continual learning to iteratively refine agent reasoning? The Discussion states, "One significant avenue involves integrating continual learning mechanisms... to transform OEMA from a static, zero-shot framework into a dynamic, self-improving ecosystem." This is unresolved because the current framework operates in a static, single-pass mode without updating knowledge or reasoning capabilities over time.

### Open Question 2
Can the framework be adapted for open-domain clinical NER to handle diverse terminologies without over-relying on specific ontologies like SNOMED CT? The Discussion notes, "Future research should also focus on broadening OEMA’s applicability to open-domain clinical NER tasks... mitigating overreliance on predefined ontologies." This is unresolved because the current Discriminator agent is explicitly hard-coded to leverage SNOMED CT top-level concepts, creating a dependency that limits applicability in specialized domains.

### Open Question 3
Does OEMA maintain its near-supervised performance and efficiency when evaluated on larger, more diverse clinical corpora? The authors acknowledge in the Discussion: "The current evaluation is based on two relatively small datasets... Further validation on larger, more heterogeneous corpora is necessary." This is unresolved because the reported state-of-the-art results are derived from MTSamples and VAERS, which are relatively small, and it's unverified if the multi-agent architecture scales without significant latency issues or performance degradation.

## Limitations

- The quality of self-annotated pseudo-labels relies on unverified assumptions about self-consistency correlating with correctness in clinical NER contexts
- Ontology-enhanced filtering depends on SNOMED CT coverage, which may be incomplete for emerging clinical concepts or rare adverse events
- Computational costs of multiple LLM calls (5 self-consistency samples × 3-agent framework) raise practical deployment concerns for resource-constrained clinical settings

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The exact-match F1 improvements over baseline methods (6.2%-10.1%) are well-supported by experimental results across both MTSamples and VAERS datasets
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism of ontology-guided token-level filtering is theoretically justified but lacks direct validation of whether SNOMED CT concept overlap actually correlates with NER prediction quality
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that OEMA achieves "state-of-the-art" performance is difficult to verify without comparison to the most recent supervised clinical NER models

## Next Checks

1. **Ontology Coverage Validation**: Quantify the percentage of test set entities with SNOMED CT mappings and measure the correlation between ontology coverage and per-entity F1 scores to reveal whether ontology filtering fails on entities lacking formal concept mappings

2. **Self-Annotation Quality Assessment**: Manually annotate a subset of self-annotated examples to measure precision and recall compared to ground truth, validating whether two-stage majority voting produces sufficiently reliable pseudo-labels for zero-shot learning

3. **Backbone Sensitivity Analysis**: Test OEMA with additional LLM backbones (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to determine whether reported improvements are consistent across different model families or specific to chosen LLMs
