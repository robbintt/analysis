# FreeAction: Training-Free Techniques for Enhanced Fidelity of Trajectory-to-Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24241
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24241
- Reference count: 30
- The paper introduces two training-free inference techniques for improving action trajectory-to-video generation in diffusion models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents two training-free techniques to enhance trajectory-to-video generation fidelity in diffusion models. The authors introduce action-scaled classifier-free guidance that dynamically adjusts guidance strength based on action magnitude and applies it only in early sampling steps, and action-scaled noise truncation that modifies initial noise sampling based on action magnitude. Evaluated on RT-1, Bridge, and Language-Table datasets, the combined approach consistently improves PSNR, SSIM, and Latent L2 metrics over the baseline IRASim model across both short- and long-trajectory settings, yielding more coherent and visually accurate robot videos.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two training-free modifications to the IRASim trajectory-to-video generation model. First, action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates the guidance weight in proportion to action magnitude, applying it only in early sampling steps to steer generation toward desired trajectories while preserving texture fidelity. Second, action-scaled noise truncation constrains initial noise sampling by scaling truncation thresholds according to action magnitude, enforcing determinism for small motions and preserving diversity for large ones. These techniques are implemented through modified inference loops that compute action magnitude from trajectories, determine truncation thresholds using dataset statistics, and apply guidance with negated action conditions in early diffusion steps.

## Key Results
- Action-scaled CFG and noise truncation consistently improve PSNR, SSIM, and Latent L2 metrics over baseline IRASim
- The combined approach shows improvements across RT-1 (7 DoF), Bridge (7 DoF), and Language-Table (2 DoF) datasets
- Both short-trajectory (1 frame + 15 actions → 15 frames) and long-trajectory (autoregressive) settings show consistent improvements
- Latent L2 and PSNR best align with human preferences according to the authors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Action-scaled Classifier-Free Guidance via Negative Trajectory Repulsion
The method steers generation away from negated action trajectories while toward desired trajectories. By computing guided noise prediction as ε̂ = ε(x_t, a) + ω[ε(x_t, a) - ε(x_t, -a)] with ω = λ||a||₂1{t>T/2}, it assumes action space is semantically meaningful under negation. Evidence shows dynamic guidance scaling improves controllability, though negative-trajectory formulation lacks direct corpus validation. Break condition: If action space is not semantically invertible, -a may not provide meaningful repulsion.

### Mechanism 2: Action-scaled Noise Truncation for Determinism-Fidelity Tradeoff
Constraining initial noise sampling based on action magnitude yields higher fidelity for small motions while preserving diversity for large motions. Using τ(a) = τ_min + (τ_max - τ_min)σ(||a||₂ - μ_act), small actions yield strong truncation (near-deterministic) while large actions preserve diversity. Core assumption: trajectory-to-video generation should favor determinism over diversity, correlating with action magnitude. Break condition: If downstream task requires multi-modal outcomes for same action, aggressive truncation may suppress legitimate variation.

### Mechanism 3: Early-Step-Only Guidance Preserves Texture Fidelity
Restricting CFG to early sampling steps improves motion coherence without degrading high-frequency texture details. The indicator 1{t>T/2} disables guidance after step T/2, assuming early steps determine low-frequency structure while later steps refine textures. Core assumption: diffusion sampling exhibits coarse-to-fine behavior where action-conditioned guidance is only needed for the coarse phase. Break condition: If base model doesn't follow standard coarse-to-fine sampling, timing heuristic may not transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)
  - Why needed here: CFG is the backbone technique being modified; understanding how ω amplifies conditioning vs. unconditional prediction is prerequisite
  - Quick check question: Given CFG formula ε̂ = ε(x_t, ∅) + ω[ε(x_t, c) - ε(x_t, ∅)], what happens when ω=1 vs. ω>1?

- **Concept**: Diffusion Sampling Hierarchy (Coarse-to-Fine)
  - Why needed here: Mechanism 3 relies on early steps controlling structure and later steps refining textures
  - Quick check question: In a 1000-step DDPM sampler, which steps (0-200, 400-600, or 800-1000) primarily determine global pose vs. texture?

- **Concept**: Truncated Normal Sampling
  - Why needed here: Noise truncation requires drawing from Gaussian with hard limits on sample magnitude
  - Quick check question: If sampling from N(0,1) with truncation |z| ≤ τ, how does reducing τ from 2.0 to 0.5 affect output variance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input frame + action trajectory → Initial noise (truncated by τ(a)) → DiT denoising with AdaLN → CFG with negated action (early steps only) → Generated frames

- **Critical path**:
  1. Compute action magnitude ||a||₂ from trajectory
  2. Determine truncation threshold τ(a) using dataset mean μ_act
  3. Sample initial latent with per-element truncation
  4. For each early sampling step, compute both ε(x_t, a) and ε(x_t, -a) then blend with scaled CFG
  5. Disable CFG after step T/2

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - λ (guidance scale): Higher values increase action adherence but risk oversaturation; paper uses λ=1
  - τ_min / τ_max: Tighter bounds increase determinism but may cause mode collapse; paper uses τ_min=0.5, τ_max=1.5
  - Guidance cutoff (T/2): Earlier cutoff preserves more texture but may under-correct motion

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Objects disappearing or ghosting: CFG weight too high for small actions or truncation too aggressive
  - Motion lagging behind action: Guidance cutoff too early; consider extending to t < 2T/3
  - Texture blurring/smoothing: Guidance applied too late; verify cutoff timing
  - Action magnitude miscomputed: Ensure ||a||₂ computed over correct trajectory window and normalized consistently

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablate guidance timing: Compare cutoffs at T/4, T/2, 3T/4 on held-out validation split; report PSNR/SSIM/Latent-L2
  2. Ablate truncation bounds: Test (τ_min, τ_max) ∈ {(0.3, 1.0), (0.5, 1.5), (0.8, 2.0)} to characterize determinism-diversity frontier
  3. Transfer test: Apply techniques to different DiT-based trajectory-to-video model (if available) to assess generalization beyond IRASim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can action-scaled guidance and noise truncation be adapted for generative models that condition on natural language instructions or depth modalities rather than explicit action trajectories?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly state they "will investigate effective techniques in expanded conditioning regimes - e.g., models that accept natural language instructions or additional modalities such as depth."
- Why unresolved: Current techniques rely on computing ℓ₂-norm and mathematical negation of continuous action vectors, operations not directly applicable to discrete language tokens or depth maps
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful adaptation of method that improves fidelity in text-conditioned or depth-conditioned video generation baseline without requiring architectural retraining

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can noise truncation be modified to improve visual fidelity in policy learning without degrading action prediction accuracy?
- Basis in paper: Appendix notes that while truncating image noise improves success rates, truncating the "action modality harms performance" because "actions are not reliably autocorrelated"
- Why unresolved: Current uniform truncation strategy enforces determinism that benefits visual consistency but appears to over-constrain variance required for accurate next-action prediction
- What evidence would resolve it: Latency-specific truncation scheme that preserves action diversity while enforcing visual determinism, resulting in higher task success rates than baseline

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does reliance on negative action vectors (-a) for classifier-free guidance generalize to action spaces where vector negation lacks semantic meaning?
- Basis in paper: Method steers generation by contrasting action a against -a, assuming negation represents meaningful "negative trajectory"
- Why unresolved: In non-robotic domains or constrained environments, negation of action vector may be physically invalid or semantically indistinguishable from null action
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of guidance mechanism on asymmetric action spaces or human-video datasets where -a doesn't constitute logical opposite trajectory

## Limitations
- Semantic validity of negated action representations (-a) is assumed but not experimentally verified; if actions aren't semantically invertible, guidance mechanism may fail
- Coarse-to-fine diffusion sampling assumption underlying early-step guidance cutoff isn't empirically validated for specific IRASim architecture
- Action magnitude scaling parameters (τ_min, τ_max, λ) appear tuned for specific datasets and may not generalize to other action spaces or magnitudes

## Confidence
- Action-scaled CFG improving PSNR/SSIM/Latent L2: High (consistent improvements across three datasets and two trajectory lengths)
- Early-step-only guidance preserving texture fidelity: Low (no ablation of cutoff timing provided)
- Action-scaled truncation yielding determinism-fidelity tradeoff: Medium (mechanism described but no analysis of output diversity)

## Next Checks
1. Perform ablation study on guidance cutoff timing (T/4, T/2, 3T/4) to empirically validate coarse-to-fine sampling assumption
2. Test action negation validity by visualizing ε(x_t, a) vs ε(x_t, -a) embeddings for various action types
3. Evaluate model on held-out dataset with substantially different action magnitudes to test robustness of τ(a) scaling function
