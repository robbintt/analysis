# Online Convex Optimization with Memory and Limited Predictions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.23574
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23574
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves dynamic regret that decays exponentially with prediction window length

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses online convex optimization with memory and limited predictions, where cost functions depend on past decisions and the decision maker can only query a limited number of points for future cost predictions. The authors propose a novel algorithm that combines two subroutines: one for bandit feedback optimization with memory and another zeroth-order method with linear convergence rates. The algorithm achieves dynamic regret that decays exponentially with the prediction window size, matching full information setting performance.

## Method Summary
The proposed algorithm uses a two-component approach: a bandit feedback subroutine for online convex optimization with memory that achieves √T VT-dynamic regret, and a zeroth-order method with linear convergence rates for general convex optimization. A key innovation is the use of truncated Gaussian smoothing when querying decision points to obtain predictions, which enables improved convergence rates. The algorithm strategically balances exploration and exploitation while leveraging limited future information to make optimal decisions.

## Key Results
- Achieves dynamic regret that decays exponentially with prediction window length
- √T VT-dynamic regret for bandit feedback (matching full information algorithms up to logarithmic factors)
- Linear convergence rates for general convex optimization via zeroth-order method

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm's success stems from its dual approach: the bandit feedback subroutine handles the sequential decision-making with memory constraints, while the zeroth-order method efficiently optimizes the decision space using limited queries. The truncated Gaussian smoothing technique is crucial as it provides a smooth approximation of the cost function, enabling gradient estimation from function evaluations. This allows the algorithm to effectively utilize the limited prediction window while maintaining robustness to noise in the prediction queries.

## Foundational Learning
- Online Convex Optimization with Memory: Understanding how past decisions affect current costs is crucial for developing algorithms that can handle temporal dependencies in sequential decision-making problems.
- Zeroth-Order Optimization: Essential for scenarios where gradient information is unavailable, requiring algorithms to rely solely on function evaluations.
- Dynamic Regret: A key performance metric that measures how well an online algorithm performs compared to the best fixed decision in hindsight, adapted to changing environments.
- Truncated Gaussian Smoothing: A technique for smoothing non-differentiable functions, enabling gradient estimation from function evaluations and improving convergence rates in zeroth-order optimization.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Zeroth-order Oracle -> Gaussian Smoothing -> Bandit Feedback Subroutine -> Decision Maker -> Cost Function with Memory

**Critical Path:** The algorithm queries the zeroth-order oracle with truncated Gaussian smoothing to estimate gradients, feeds this information to the bandit feedback subroutine, which then makes decisions that are evaluated by the cost function with memory dependencies.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The algorithm trades computational complexity for improved regret bounds by using truncated Gaussian smoothing. This allows for better gradient estimation but increases the number of function evaluations needed per iteration.

**Failure Signatures:** The algorithm may struggle in highly dynamic environments where the exponential decay of regret with prediction window size is not observed, or when the truncated Gaussian smoothing introduces significant bias in gradient estimation.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test the algorithm on a simple quadratic programming problem with varying prediction window sizes to observe the exponential decay of regret.
2. Compare the convergence rate of the zeroth-order subroutine with existing methods on a non-smooth convex optimization problem.
3. Evaluate the algorithm's performance in a bandit feedback setting with memory constraints on a synthetic online learning problem.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance heavily depends on the quality of predictions obtained through truncated Gaussian smoothing
- Assumption of access to zeroth-order oracle queries may not hold in all practical applications
- Performance in non-convex settings or with non-smooth cost functions is not addressed

## Confidence
- High Confidence: √T VT-dynamic regret for bandit feedback matching existing full information algorithms
- Medium Confidence: Linear convergence rates for zeroth-order subroutine requiring further empirical validation
- Low Confidence: Exponential decay of regret with prediction window size in practical, noisy environments

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate performance under varying levels of prediction noise and compare with robust optimization baselines
2. Implement the algorithm on large-scale optimization problems with non-convex cost functions to assess practical limitations
3. Apply the algorithm to a real-world resource allocation problem in a dynamic environment to validate effectiveness in practical scenarios with partial information
