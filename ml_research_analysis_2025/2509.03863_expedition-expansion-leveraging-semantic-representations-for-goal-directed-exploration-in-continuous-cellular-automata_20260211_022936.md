# Expedition & Expansion: Leveraging Semantic Representations for Goal-Directed Exploration in Continuous Cellular Automata

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.03863
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03863
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: E&E discovers 42.2% ± 13.7% of final archive from expedition solutions vs 4.64% random baseline

## Executive Summary
Expedition & Expansion (E&E) addresses the challenge of discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata by alternating between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The method combines Novelty Search in semantic representation spaces with goal-directed autotelic search to overcome local novelty plateaus. In experiments on Flow Lenia, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than baselines (Random Parameter Search, Random Genetic Algorithm, and Novelty Search), achieving diversity gains that transfer across independent embedding spaces. Genealogical analysis shows expedition-discovered solutions disproportionately influence long-term exploration, serving as stepping stones that unlock new behavioral niches and drive sustained diversity.

## Method Summary
E&E alternates between two phases: expansion (Novelty Search with semantic embeddings) and expedition (VLM-guided goal-directed optimization). The method operates on Flow Lenia's 235 parameters, using CLIP to embed both behavior images and linguistic goals into a shared semantic space. Expansion samples solutions proportional to novelty^α, mutates them with Gaussian noise, and adds to an archive. Every K iterations, a VLM generates linguistic goals from novel behaviors, and sep-CMA-ES optimizes parameters to minimize distance to the goal embedding. The process repeats for 10,000 iterations, with diversity measured as average pairwise cosine distance in both CLIP and DINO embedding spaces.

## Key Results
- E&E achieves diversity gains that transfer robustly to independent embedding spaces (DINO), indicating semantic representations capture meaningful behavioral differences
- Expedition-discovered solutions constitute 42.2% ± 13.7% of the final archive versus 4.64% random expectation
- Genealogical analysis reveals expeditions disproportionately influence long-term exploration by unlocking behavioral niches inaccessible to undirected methods
- α=4 novelty bias and K=50 expedition frequency provide optimal balance between exploration drive and stability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Alternating between local novelty search and goal-directed expeditions overcomes local novelty plateaus.
- Mechanism: Expansion phases exhaust local neighborhoods via mutation; expedition phases jump to distant semantic regions by minimizing distance to hypothetical goal embeddings. The cyclical process allows discoveries from expeditions to seed new expansion frontiers.
- Core assumption: The behavioral space contains disconnected regions that cannot be reached through gradual mutation alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "alternating between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions using Vision-Language Models"
  - [results] "E&E's semantic expeditions allow it to continuously extend the search frontier. As supported by the genealogical study... periodic introduction of goal-directed exploration injects diversity into regions that purely undirected methods fail to reach."
  - [corpus] Related work on exploration strategies (Adventurer, CORE) supports hybrid exploration but does not directly test E&E's specific alternation mechanism.
- Break condition: If the behavioral space is locally connected without isolated regions, expeditions would provide no marginal benefit over expansion alone.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Semantic representation spaces (CLIP) enable both meaningful novelty computation and interpretable goal generation.
- Mechanism: CLIP projects images and text into a shared latent space where cosine distance reflects conceptual similarity. Novelty is computed as average distance to k-nearest neighbors; goals are embedded from linguistic descriptions and optimized via sep-CMA-ES.
- Core assumption: CLIP's semantic structure captures perceptually meaningful differences relevant to Flow Lenia behaviors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "operating in semantic spaces that align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in conceptually meaningful ways"
  - [methods] "CLIP maps both images and text into a shared latent space that captures high-level semantic features, allowing conceptually similar behaviors to cluster together"
  - [results] Diversity gains "transfer robustly to independent embedding spaces [DINO], indicating that it does not merely overfit to CLIP's latent structure"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support; no direct evaluation of semantic representation alignment in related papers.
- Break condition: If CLIP embeddings fail to capture behaviorally relevant features, novelty scores become noise and goal optimization directionless.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Expedition-discovered solutions serve as stepping stones that disproportionately influence long-term exploration.
- Mechanism: Expeditions unlock behavioral niches that expansion phases subsequently explore densely. Genealogical analysis traces descendant counts to quantify influence.
- Core assumption: The archive's selection mechanism (novelty-biased sampling) amplifies influential solutions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Genealogical analysis shows expedition-discovered solutions disproportionately influence long-term exploration, serving as stepping stones that unlock new behavioral niches"
  - [results] "expedition-discovered solutions constitute 42.2% ± 13.7% of the final archive — an order of magnitude greater than the random expectation (4.64%)"
  - [results] Figure 4 shows UMAP projections where expeditions populate regions unexplored by NS alone
  - [corpus] No corpus papers evaluate stepping-stone mechanisms in exploration.
- Break condition: If expeditions produce solutions that are dead ends (no viable mutations), they would not influence long-term diversity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Novelty Search**
  - Why needed here: Expansion phase relies on novelty-biased sampling and mutation. Without understanding how novelty is computed and used, the local exploration mechanism is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given an archive of embeddings, how would you compute the novelty score for a new candidate?

- Concept: **CLIP Embeddings**
  - Why needed here: The entire architecture depends on projecting behaviors and goals into a shared semantic space. Misunderstanding CLIP's capabilities and limitations leads to incorrect expectations about novelty and goal alignment.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean that CLIP is trained on "image-text pairs," and why does this enable linguistic goal optimization?

- Concept: **CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy)**
  - Why needed here: Expedition phases use sep-CMA-ES for goal-directed optimization. Understanding its role as a gradient-free optimizer in high-dimensional parameter spaces is essential for debugging expedition failures.
  - Quick check question: Why might CMA-ES be preferred over gradient descent for optimizing Flow Lenia parameters toward a goal embedding?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Archive -> Expansion loop -> Simulation -> Embedding -> Archive update
  - Archive -> VLM goal generator -> Goal optimizer (sep-CMA-ES) -> Archive update
  - Expedition trigger (every K iterations) connects expansion and expedition phases

- Critical path:
  1. Archive initialization (1,000 random simulations)
  2. Expansion iterations (novelty sampling → mutation → simulation → embedding → archive update)
  3. Every K iterations: VLM generates goal → find nearest neighbor → CMA-ES optimization → add result to archive
  4. Repeat for N total iterations (10,000 in experiments)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Expedition frequency (K)**: Lower K (50) increases diversity but computational cost (~3 min/expedition vs ~1 sec/expansion). K=200-300 showed no benefit over pure NS.
  - **Novelty bias (α)**: α=4 balances exploration drive and stability; α>4 causes CLIP overfitting (inflated CLIP diversity, collapsed DINO diversity).
  - **Goal generation context**: VLM receives 25 novel behaviors; more context may improve relevance but increases API cost.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Novelty hacking**: Optimization inflates CLIP novelty without meaningful behavioral change (mitigate by checking DINO diversity).
  - **Goal stagnation**: VLM generates similar goals across iterations (paper notes "goals remain largely static").
  - **Expedition dead ends**: Optimization achieves partial goal alignment but produces no viable mutations for subsequent expansion.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Replicate Figure 2 (left)**: Run NS with α ∈ {0, 1, 4, 7, 9} on Flow Lenia; plot CLIP and DINO diversity vs iterations. Confirm α=4 is optimal before proceeding.
  2. **Ablate expedition frequency**: Run E&E with K ∈ {50, 100, 200, 300}; verify that K=50 achieves highest DINO diversity. This validates the expedition mechanism.
  3. **Genealogical trace**: Instrument the code to track parent-child relationships. After a full E&E run, compute the percentage of final archive descending from expedition solutions. Confirm ~40% vs ~5% random baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can video-based or spatiotemporal embeddings enable E&E to discover temporally extended phenomena and phase transitions, overcoming the limitations of single-frame representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Future Work that current embeddings (CLIP, DINO) are limited to single frames, missing critical temporal information like long-term stability.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture relies on static image embeddings, which cannot capture the dynamics of behaviors evolving over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing E&E with video-encoders (e.g., VideoMAE) and demonstrating the discovery of patterns defined by their temporal dynamics rather than static geometry.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can feedback loops be integrated into the VLM goal generation process to create a curriculum that adapts based on the success rates or learning progress of past goals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section notes that the VLM lacks temporal adaptation and behaves like a fixed generator, suggesting the need for feedback loops to maximize learning progress.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation does not feed goal achievement outcomes back into the prompt, preventing the system from self-correcting its search strategy.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment showing that an adaptive VLM outperforms the static VLM by progressively shifting goal distributions toward reachable yet novel niches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does ensembling multiple independent representation spaces (e.g., combining CLIP and DINO) effectively mitigate the "novelty hacking" phenomenon?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify susceptibility to "novelty hacking," where optimization inflates novelty scores without meaningful differences, and suggest ensembling representation spaces as a mitigation strategy.
- Why unresolved: The current method relies primarily on single-space optimization which can exploit specific latent features.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis showing that a multi-objective novelty metric based on ensembled embeddings reduces artifacts and improves transferability to unseen embedding spaces.

## Limitations

- **Semantic Alignment Risk**: While the paper claims CLIP embeddings capture behaviorally relevant features, the actual alignment between semantic distance and perceived behavioral novelty in Flow Lenia is not rigorously validated.
- **VLM Dependency**: Expedition success critically depends on the VLM's ability to generate useful linguistic goals, but the paper notes that goals "remain largely static" across iterations, suggesting potential mode collapse.
- **Mutation Operator Assumptions**: The expansion phase relies on Gaussian mutation to explore local neighborhoods, but the mutation scale and operator specifics are underspecified, which could cause the entire expansion mechanism to fail.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The alternating mechanism between expansion and expedition phases demonstrably increases diversity metrics in controlled experiments.
- **Medium Confidence**: Semantic representations meaningfully capture behavioral differences, supported by cross-embedding robustness but lacking direct perceptual validation.
- **Low Confidence**: Expedition-discovered solutions serve as stepping stones - while genealogical analysis shows high descendant counts, causal mechanisms for why expeditions unlock new niches remain speculative.

## Next Checks

1. **Semantic Alignment Test**: Manually evaluate whether CLIP distance correlates with human-perceived behavioral differences in Flow Lenia across 50 randomly selected pairs from the archive.
2. **Mutation Operator Sensitivity**: Systematically vary mutation standard deviation in expansion phase and measure impact on both diversity achievement and computational efficiency.
3. **Goal Generation Diversity Analysis**: Track VLM-generated goal semantic diversity over time using embedding-based diversity metrics to confirm goals aren't collapsing into similar descriptions.
