# A Technique for Isolating Lexically-Independent Phonetic Dependencies in Generative CNNs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.09218
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09218
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Generative CNNs can capture phonotactic-like patterns independently of lexical configurations when fully-connected bottleneck is reduced

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a technique for isolating lexically-independent phonetic generalizations in generative convolutional neural networks by bypassing the fully-connected layer and inputting random feature maps into the convolutional block. Using a ciwGAN architecture trained on raw audio waveforms, the method successfully generated linguistically interpretable outputs when the FC bottleneck was reduced from 1024 to 8 channels. These outputs demonstrated phonotactic-like generalization patterns consistent with training data, revealing that convolutional layers can capture local phonetic dependencies independently of lexical configurations. This provides a new tool for probing sublexical learning in neural models of speech.

## Method Summary
The technique involves bypassing the fully-connected layer in generative CNNs by inputting random feature maps directly into the convolutional block. A ciwGAN architecture was trained on raw audio waveforms with an initial fully-connected bottleneck of 1024 channels. To isolate lexically-independent phonetic dependencies, researchers progressively reduced the FC bottleneck dimension. When reduced to 8 channels, the model began generating linguistically interpretable outputs that demonstrated phonotactic-like patterns, indicating that convolutional layers could capture phonetic dependencies without relying on lexical configurations encoded in the fully-connected layer.

## Key Results
- Reducing FC bottleneck from 1024 to 8 channels enabled generation of linguistically interpretable outputs
- Generated outputs showed evidence of phonotactic-like generalization patterns consistent with training data
- Demonstrated that convolutional layers can capture local phonetic dependencies independently of lexical configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on reducing the fully-connected layer's bottleneck dimension to limit its capacity to encode lexical configurations. By compressing the latent space to 8 channels, the fully-connected layer loses its ability to preserve detailed lexical information, forcing the convolutional layers to operate more independently. When random feature maps are input directly into the convolutional block under these conditions, the network must rely on the convolutional layers' ability to capture local phonetic dependencies. This isolation reveals how much phonetic information the convolutional architecture can extract without lexical constraints, effectively probing sublexical learning capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** - Why needed: Understand the basic framework of generator-discriminator interaction. Quick check: Can you explain how the generator learns to fool the discriminator?

**Fully-Connected (FC) Layers** - Why needed: Grasp how FC layers encode high-level, global representations versus local patterns. Quick check: What's the difference between FC layer processing and convolutional layer processing?

**Convolutional Neural Networks** - Why needed: Recognize how CNNs extract local patterns and features from input data. Quick check: How do convolutional filters detect patterns differently than FC layers?

**Phonotactic Patterns** - Why needed: Understand the linguistic concept of sound sequencing rules in language. Quick check: Can you give an example of an English phonotactic constraint?

**Latent Space Bottlenecks** - Why needed: Comprehend how bottleneck dimensions affect information preservation and representation. Quick check: What happens when you reduce bottleneck dimensions in neural networks?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Raw audio -> Convolutional feature extraction -> Fully-Connected bottleneck -> Convolutional generation -> Audio output

Critical path: The reduction of the FC bottleneck from 1024 to 8 channels represents the critical path that enables isolation of phonetic dependencies. This bottleneck reduction directly impacts the model's ability to preserve lexical information.

Design tradeoffs: The technique trades representational capacity for interpretability. Larger bottlenecks preserve more lexical information but obscure phonetic dependencies, while smaller bottlenecks reveal phonetic patterns but may limit overall generation quality.

Failure signatures: When the FC bottleneck is too large (1024 channels), the model generates outputs heavily influenced by lexical configurations rather than phonetic dependencies. When too small, the model may fail to generate coherent speech altogether.

Three first experiments:
1. Test bottleneck reduction from 1024 → 512 → 256 → 128 → 64 → 32 → 16 → 8 channels to find the threshold where phonetic patterns emerge
2. Compare generated outputs' phonotactic patterns against ground truth statistics from training data
3. Visualize convolutional filter activations to verify they're capturing phonetic rather than lexical features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Uncertain whether observed patterns reflect genuine phonetic dependencies or architectural artifacts
- Limited exploration of different bottleneck configurations beyond the 8-channel result
- Results may not generalize across different speech datasets or model architectures

## Confidence
- High confidence that bypassing FC layer reveals lexically-independent phonetic generalizations (clear experimental evidence)
- Medium confidence that convolutional layers can capture phonetic dependencies without lexical influence (promising but limited architectural exploration)
- Low confidence in generalizability across different speech datasets and model architectures (single architecture, single dataset)

## Next Checks
1. Test the technique across multiple bottleneck sizes to determine if the 8-channel configuration is optimal or if similar patterns emerge at other dimensions
2. Apply the method to diverse speech datasets with varying phonotactic properties to assess generalizability
3. Compare the isolated phonetic dependencies with traditional phonotactic measures to validate that the observed patterns align with established linguistic theories
