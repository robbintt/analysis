- Unified model family for comparing VLA planning paradigms with interchangeable planning heads

## Executive Summary
VLA-OS introduces a systematic framework for comparing different task planning paradigms in Vision-Language-Action models. The framework supports three paradigms—ActionOnly-VLA, Integrated-VLA, and Hierarchical-VLA—with interchangeable planning heads for language, visual, and image foresight representations. Through controlled experiments across diverse benchmarks, the work demonstrates that visually grounded planning representations consistently outperform language-based ones in task performance, generalization, and training efficiency.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a unified VLA model family that can implement three distinct planning paradigms by swapping planning heads while keeping the core architecture constant. ActionOnly-VLA plans using only action representations, Integrated-VLA combines task and action planning in a single step, and Hierarchical-VLA separates task planning from action planning in a two-stage process. The framework supports three types of planning representations: language-based, visually grounded, and image foresight. By keeping the model architecture consistent across paradigms, the experiments isolate the effects of representation choice and planning structure on performance.

## Key Results
- Visually grounded planning representations outperform language-based ones across all benchmarks
- Hierarchical-VLA achieves superior or comparable results to other paradigms, especially in generalization
- Policy learning is consistently more challenging than task planning
- Training efficiency favors visually grounded representations over language-based ones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superiority of visually grounded representations stems from their ability to directly encode spatial and visual information relevant to task execution, avoiding the intermediate translation step required by language-based representations. Hierarchical planning benefits from separating high-level task reasoning from low-level action execution, allowing each stage to focus on its specific domain. The unified model family design enables fair comparison by controlling for architectural differences while varying only the planning representation and structure.

## Foundational Learning

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**: Integrated systems combining visual perception, language understanding, and action execution for embodied tasks. Why needed: Enables robots to understand and act in environments using multimodal inputs. Quick check: Can the model process RGB images, text instructions, and output motor commands?

**Planning Representations**: Different ways of encoding task and action information (language tokens, visual features, image predictions). Why needed: Choice of representation directly impacts how effectively the model can reason about and execute tasks. Quick check: Does the representation capture the essential information needed for planning?

**Hierarchical Planning**: Two-stage process separating high-level task planning from low-level action execution. Why needed: Allows specialized reasoning at different abstraction levels, potentially improving performance on complex tasks. Quick check: Can the model generate coherent task plans that translate to effective action sequences?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: VLA Backbone -> Planning Head (Language/Visual/Image) -> Task Planner -> Action Planner -> Action Execution

**Critical Path**: Visual input → VLA Backbone → Planning Representation → Task Planning → Action Planning → Environment

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Language representations offer interpretability but require translation to actions
- Visual representations provide direct spatial information but may lack explicit task structure
- Hierarchical planning improves performance but increases computational cost
- Unified architecture enables fair comparison but may not be optimal for any single paradigm

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Language-based models struggle with spatial reasoning tasks
- Single-step integrated planning may produce incoherent action sequences
- Hierarchical models may fail if task and action planners are misaligned

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare single-step vs two-step planning on simple manipulation tasks
2. Test different planning representation types on navigation benchmarks
3. Evaluate training efficiency across paradigms on a common task suite

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Does not address computational overhead of Hierarchical-VLA in real-time deployment scenarios
- Limited exploration of scalability to long-horizon, multi-step manipulation tasks
- Evaluation metrics for "planning quality" are not fully specified

## Confidence

- **High**: Visually grounded representations outperform language-based ones
- **Medium**: Hierarchical-VLA achieves superior generalization
- **Low**: Policy learning is consistently more challenging than task planning

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the scalability of each paradigm to long-horizon, multi-step manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world settings.
2. Conduct ablation studies on the impact of different action space granularities and reward structures on planning performance.
3. Perform a cost-benefit analysis comparing training and inference efficiency against task performance across paradigms in real-time deployment scenarios.
