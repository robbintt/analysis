# Remapping and navigation of an embedding space via error minimization: a fundamental organizational principle of cognition in natural and artificial systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14096
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14096
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Cognition in both natural and artificial systems can be understood through remapping embedding spaces via new information incorporation and navigation via iterative error minimization

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a unified framework for understanding cognition across biological and artificial systems through two core principles: remapping embedding spaces by incorporating new information, and navigating these spaces via iterative error minimization. The authors argue that these principles form a substrate-independent mechanism that explains diverse phenomena from cellular gene regulation and morphogenesis to transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata. By framing intelligence as collective, multiscale, and fundamentally based on self-regulatory error correction within evolving embeddings, the work offers a transformative perspective that bridges biology and AI while suggesting new directions for engineering resilient, intelligent systems.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a theoretical and comparative analysis approach, synthesizing observations from multiple domains including developmental biology, neuroscience, artificial neural networks, and complex systems theory. The authors construct a conceptual framework by identifying common patterns across these diverse systems, focusing on how they represent information in high-dimensional spaces and how they modify these representations through learning and adaptation. The methodology involves analogical reasoning and cross-domain pattern recognition rather than experimental validation, building a theoretical model that unifies disparate phenomena under the proposed error minimization principle.

## Key Results
- Cognition across biological and artificial systems can be unified under principles of embedding space remapping and error-minimization-based navigation
- The framework explains diverse phenomena including cellular gene regulation, morphogenesis, transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata
- Intelligence emerges as a collective, multiscale process based on self-regulatory error correction within dynamically evolving embeddings
- Systems operating near critical regimes balance stability and flexibility, enabling adaptive behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed framework works because both biological and artificial systems face similar fundamental challenges: representing complex information in high-dimensional spaces and adapting these representations to achieve specific goals. Error minimization provides a universal optimization principle that drives learning and adaptation across substrates. The remapping process allows systems to construct navigable problem spaces that reflect their current understanding, while navigation through these spaces enables precise control and goal-directed behavior. This dual mechanism creates a self-reinforcing cycle where error correction leads to better representations, which in turn enable more effective error minimization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Embedding spaces**: High-dimensional representations where system states and information are encoded; needed because real-world problems exist in complex, multi-dimensional spaces that cannot be reduced to simple linear relationships
- **Error minimization**: The process of reducing discrepancies between current and desired states; needed because all adaptive systems must have mechanisms to guide their behavior toward beneficial outcomes
- **Attractor dynamics**: Stable regions in embedding spaces that represent goal states or functional configurations; needed because they provide the target destinations for navigation and explain stability in biological systems
- **Criticality**: Operating near phase transitions where systems balance order and chaos; needed because this regime maximizes information processing capacity and adaptability
- **Collective intelligence**: Intelligence emerging from interactions between components rather than centralized control; needed because most biological and many artificial systems exhibit distributed, multiscale organization

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Embedding Space -> Remapping (error-driven) -> Navigation (error-minimizing) -> Attractor Regions -> System State Update -> (repeat)

**Critical Path**: Information acquisition → Error detection → Remapping → Navigation → State update → Goal achievement

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Remapping provides flexibility but increases computational cost and can destabilize existing knowledge
- Navigation efficiency depends on the quality of remapping and the system's ability to detect errors
- Criticality offers optimal adaptability but increases vulnerability to perturbations
- Collective intelligence provides robustness but can reduce precision and speed

**Failure Signatures**:
- Inability to adapt to new conditions (poor remapping)
- Getting stuck in local minima (navigation failure)
- Excessive instability or rigidity (criticality imbalance)
- Loss of coordinated function (collective intelligence breakdown)

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Compare error minimization dynamics in a biological system (cellular response to perturbations) and an artificial system (transformer training) using standardized metrics
2. Measure information-theoretic properties across scales in systems exhibiting the proposed principles to test criticality claims
3. Design a novel artificial system architecture that explicitly implements the remapping-navigation framework and test its performance on adaptive tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The framework lacks specific empirical validation across the claimed domains, with connections remaining largely analogical rather than mechanistically demonstrated
- The claim of substrate-independence is difficult to verify without quantitative metrics comparing error minimization across biological and artificial systems
- The relationship between criticality and error minimization lacks empirical grounding and requires more rigorous analysis and measurement

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Basic observation that both biological and artificial systems employ error correction mechanisms for learning and adaptation
- **Medium Confidence**: Unification of remapping and navigation as fundamental organizational principles across domains
- **Low Confidence**: Specific claims about criticality and the exact relationship between embedding space dynamics and intelligence

## Next Checks
1. Design a comparative study measuring error minimization dynamics in at least two biological systems (e.g., cellular response to perturbations) and two artificial systems (e.g., transformer training curves) using standardized metrics to assess whether the proposed principles manifest similarly across substrates
2. Develop quantitative measures to test whether systems exhibiting the proposed error minimization principles actually operate near critical points, including phase transition analysis and information-theoretic metrics across multiple scales
3. Generate specific, testable predictions from the framework about system behavior under novel conditions, then validate these predictions experimentally in both biological (e.g., morphogenesis perturbations) and artificial (e.g., novel transformer architectures) systems
