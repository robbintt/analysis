# Analyzing Cancer Patients' Experiences with Embedding-based Topic Modeling and LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.12154
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12154
- Reference count: 11
- Study investigates neural topic modeling for analyzing cancer patient storytelling data to improve patient-oriented healthcare

## Executive Summary
This study explores the application of neural topic modeling techniques to analyze cancer patient narratives, with the goal of improving patient-centered healthcare delivery. The research focuses on BERTopic and Top2Vec models applied to 13 Dutch-translated cancer interviews, totaling 132,722 words. The study evaluates clinically oriented embeddings and identifies dominant themes that emerge from patient storytelling, demonstrating how automated topic modeling can provide actionable feedback to healthcare providers.

The research demonstrates that neural topic modeling can effectively capture meaningful themes from patient narratives, supporting more efficient document navigation and strengthening patient voices in healthcare workflows. The study particularly highlights the importance of using clinically relevant embeddings, with BioClinicalBERT outperforming other embedding approaches in terms of coherence and interpretability.

## Method Summary
The study employs neural topic modeling techniques on a corpus of 13 Dutch-translated cancer patient interviews. BERTopic and Top2Vec models are applied using various embedding approaches, including BioClinicalBERT, which is specifically designed for clinical text. The models are evaluated using coherence metrics and manual validation of interpretability. Global analysis identifies dominant themes across the patient narratives, with particular attention to healthcare coordination, communication patterns, and decision-making processes in cancer treatment.

## Key Results
- BERTopic outperformed Top2Vec in coherence and interpretability, especially when using BioClinicalBERT embeddings
- Two dominant themes identified: "Coordination and Communication in Cancer Care Management" and "Patient Decision-Making in Cancer Treatment Journey"
- Neural topic modeling demonstrated capability to provide actionable feedback to clinicians from patient narratives
- Clinical embeddings (BioClinicalBERT) significantly improved topic modeling performance compared to general-purpose embeddings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None provided in source material.

## Foundational Learning
- **Clinical embeddings vs general embeddings**: Clinical embeddings like BioClinicalBERT are trained on medical text and capture domain-specific terminology and relationships, making them essential for accurate topic modeling in healthcare contexts. Quick check: Compare coherence scores using clinical vs general embeddings on medical text corpora.
- **Patient narrative analysis**: Patient stories contain rich contextual information about healthcare experiences that structured data often misses, providing insights into care coordination and decision-making processes. Quick check: Extract key themes from patient narratives and compare with structured satisfaction surveys.
- **Topic modeling validation**: Manual validation of automatically generated topics is necessary to assess interpretability and clinical relevance, though it introduces potential researcher bias. Quick check: Have multiple clinicians independently validate generated topics for clinical relevance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Patient Interviews -> Clinical Embeddings (BioClinicalBERT) -> BERTopic/Top2Vec Models -> Topic Coherence Metrics -> Manual Validation -> Actionable Themes

**Critical Path**: Data preprocessing and embedding generation is the most computationally intensive step, as high-quality embeddings directly impact topic model performance. The manual validation step is critical for ensuring clinical relevance but introduces potential bottlenecks in the analysis workflow.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study chose BERTopic over Top2Vec despite both being viable neural topic modeling approaches, prioritizing interpretability and coherence scores. The use of clinical embeddings over general-purpose embeddings represents a tradeoff between domain specificity and computational complexity.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor topic coherence scores indicate either inadequate embedding quality or insufficient corpus diversity. Manual validation revealing disconnected or irrelevant topics suggests the embedding model may not capture the domain-specific language effectively.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Compare BioClinicalBERT embeddings with general BERT embeddings on the same patient interview corpus
2. Vary the number of topics generated to find the optimal balance between granularity and coherence
3. Apply the same modeling approach to a different domain (e.g., chronic disease narratives) to test generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in source material.

## Limitations
- Small corpus size (13 interviews) may not capture full diversity of cancer patient experiences across demographics and cancer types
- Use of Dutch-translated interviews may introduce linguistic nuances that affect embedding quality and topic interpretation
- Manual validation of topics introduces potential researcher bias in determining "meaningful" topics

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Comparative performance of BERTopic versus Top2Vec on the same dataset with BioClinicalBERT embeddings
- Medium Confidence: Generalizability of findings to larger, more diverse patient populations and different healthcare contexts
- Medium Confidence: Clinical actionability of identified themes requiring further validation with healthcare practitioners

## Next Checks
1. Validate findings on a larger, multilingual dataset of cancer patient interviews to assess generalizability across different patient populations and linguistic contexts
2. Conduct blind validation with oncologists and healthcare practitioners to evaluate the clinical relevance and actionability of the identified themes
3. Perform temporal analysis to determine if topic distributions change over time within patient journeys, informing dynamic patient care approaches
