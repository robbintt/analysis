# Controlling Gender Bias in Retrieval via a Backpack Architecture

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.00875
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00875
- **Reference count**: 33
- **Primary result**: A method leveraging Backpack Language Models to control gender bias in retrieval systems, reducing bias while maintaining ranking performance with only a 2–3% drop in effectiveness metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses gender bias in ranking and retrieval systems using large language models (LLMs), which can propagate societal biases embedded in training data, leading to unfair outcomes. The proposed method leverages Backpack Language Models, which represent tokens as weighted combinations of non-contextual sense vectors, to control bias directly during inference. The framework identifies gender-sensitive sense vectors through cosine similarity with gendered word pairs and applies a reweighting mechanism to suppress their influence. Experimental results on the MS MARCO dataset show that the method effectively reduces gender bias (measured by Rank Bias and Average Rank Bias) while maintaining strong ranking performance, with only a 2–3% drop in effectiveness metrics like MRR@10 and NDCG@10. This approach offers a practical solution for achieving fairness in information retrieval without retraining models.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a novel approach to controlling gender bias in retrieval systems by leveraging Backpack Language Models. These models represent tokens as weighted combinations of non-contextual sense vectors, allowing for fine-grained control over token representations during inference. The framework identifies gender-sensitive sense vectors by computing cosine similarity with predefined gendered word pairs and applies a reweighting mechanism to suppress their influence in the ranking process. This approach operates directly on the model's internal representations, enabling bias mitigation without the need for retraining. The method was evaluated on the MS MARCO dataset, demonstrating significant reductions in gender bias metrics while maintaining strong retrieval performance.

## Key Results
- The method effectively reduces gender bias in retrieval systems, as measured by Rank Bias and Average Rank Bias.
- Ranking performance is maintained with only a 2–3% drop in effectiveness metrics like MRR@10 and NDCG@10.
- The approach operates directly on model representations during inference, eliminating the need for retraining.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the unique structure of Backpack Language Models, which decompose token representations into weighted combinations of non-contextual sense vectors. This decomposition allows for targeted manipulation of specific semantic components associated with gender bias. By identifying and reweighting gender-sensitive sense vectors, the model can suppress biased associations while preserving the overall semantic content necessary for accurate retrieval. The approach operates at inference time, making it computationally efficient and applicable to existing models without requiring additional training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Backpack Language Models**: Token representations are decomposed into weighted combinations of non-contextual sense vectors. Why needed: Enables fine-grained control over semantic components for bias mitigation. Quick check: Verify that token representations can be accurately decomposed and reconstructed.
- **Cosine Similarity for Vector Analysis**: Used to identify gender-sensitive sense vectors by comparing their similarity to gendered word pairs. Why needed: Provides a quantitative measure for detecting biased semantic associations. Quick check: Confirm that cosine similarity effectively captures semantic relationships in the vector space.
- **Rank Bias Metrics**: Measures the degree of bias in ranking outputs. Why needed: Provides quantitative evaluation of bias reduction effectiveness. Quick check: Validate that Rank Bias accurately reflects gender disparities in retrieval results.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Backpack Model -> Sense Vector Decomposition -> Gender-Sensitive Vector Identification -> Reweighting Mechanism -> Retrieval Output

**Critical Path**
1. Token input enters Backpack Model
2. Sense vectors are extracted and decomposed
3. Gender-sensitive vectors are identified via cosine similarity
4. Reweighting mechanism adjusts vector contributions
5. Modified representations generate final retrieval output

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Inference-time bias control vs. potential computational overhead
- Reweighting strength vs. retrieval effectiveness
- Binary gender focus vs. broader gender identity representation

**Failure Signatures**
- Over-suppression of gender-sensitive vectors leading to loss of relevant information
- Incomplete identification of gender-sensitive vectors resulting in persistent bias
- Computational overhead significantly impacting retrieval speed

**First Experiments**
1. Test sense vector decomposition and reconstruction accuracy on sample tokens
2. Validate gender-sensitive vector identification using controlled test cases
3. Measure computational overhead introduced by the reweighting mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach appears constrained to gender bias in English language retrieval tasks and may not generalize to other bias types or languages.
- The method relies on binary gender concepts through selected word pairs, potentially missing broader gender identity spectrum.
- Limited evaluation scope with narrow focus on specific bias and effectiveness metrics, lacking real-world production testing.

## Confidence
- **Bias reduction effectiveness**: Medium
- **Ranking performance maintenance**: Medium
- **Generalizability to other bias types**: Low
- **Real-world applicability**: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method across diverse bias types (racial, cultural, age-related) and multiple languages to assess generalizability beyond gender bias in English.
2. Conduct extensive ablation studies to determine the optimal threshold for sense vector reweighting and assess sensitivity to different configurations of gendered word pairs.
3. Implement and test the approach in real-world retrieval systems with live user queries to validate performance and fairness improvements in production environments.
