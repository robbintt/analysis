# Nex-N1: Agentic Models Trained via a Unified Ecosystem for Large-Scale Environment Construction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04987
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04987
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Agentic model achieving state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench, τ2, GAIA 2, and BFCL benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Nex-N1, an agentic model trained through a unified ecosystem designed for large-scale environment construction. The key innovation is a three-component system addressing the challenge of scaling interactive environments: NexAU provides a modular agent runtime enabling complex agent hierarchies via simple configurations; NexA4A automatically generates diverse agent architectures from natural language; and NexGAP bridges the simulation-reality gap by integrating real-world tools for grounded trajectory synthesis. Trained on this infrastructure, Nex-N1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks including SWE-bench, τ2, GAIA 2, and BFCL, outperforming other open-source models and matching frontier proprietary models on complex agentic tasks. The system generates over 200 diverse agent frameworks and environments, providing robust generalization across different agent architectures. The authors open-source the Nex ecosystem and model weights to accelerate research in agentic scaling.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a unified ecosystem for training agentic models at scale, consisting of three integrated components. NexAU serves as a modular agent runtime that enables complex agent hierarchies through simple configuration files, allowing researchers to construct sophisticated multi-agent systems without extensive coding. NexA4A automatically generates diverse agent architectures from natural language descriptions, dramatically reducing the barrier to creating varied agent configurations for training. NexGAP bridges the simulation-reality gap by integrating real-world tools and APIs into the training environment, enabling the synthesis of grounded trajectories that reflect real-world constraints and behaviors. These components work together to create a comprehensive training environment where agents can be constructed, deployed, and evaluated across diverse scenarios, leading to the development of Nex-N1, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple agentic benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench, τ2, GAIA 2, and BFCL benchmarks
- Outperformed other open-source models while matching frontier proprietary models on complex agentic tasks
- Generated over 200 diverse agent frameworks and environments, demonstrating robust generalization across different agent architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The unified ecosystem approach works by addressing three critical bottlenecks in agentic model training: environment construction complexity, architecture diversity, and simulation-reality alignment. NexAU's modular runtime reduces the engineering overhead of creating complex agent hierarchies, enabling rapid prototyping and experimentation. NexA4A's natural language interface democratizes the creation of diverse agent architectures, ensuring the training process encounters a wide variety of agent configurations rather than being limited to manually designed ones. NexGAP's integration of real-world tools ensures that the training trajectories are grounded in practical constraints and behaviors, preventing the simulation-reality gap that often degrades real-world performance. Together, these components create a scalable pipeline where environment complexity, architectural diversity, and real-world grounding are systematically addressed, enabling the training of more capable and generalizable agentic models.

## Foundational Learning
- **Modular agent runtime design**: Understanding how modular systems enable complex agent hierarchies without extensive custom coding. Why needed: Reduces engineering complexity for environment construction. Quick check: Can new agent types be added without modifying core runtime code?
- **Natural language architecture generation**: Learning how to translate natural language descriptions into executable agent architectures. Why needed: Democratizes agent creation and increases architectural diversity. Quick check: Does generated architecture match the semantic intent of the natural language description?
- **Simulation-reality gap bridging**: Understanding techniques for integrating real-world tools and APIs into simulated training environments. Why needed: Ensures trained agents perform well in real-world deployment. Quick check: Do agents trained with real-world tool integration show better transfer to actual environments?
- **Multi-agent training ecosystems**: Learning how to coordinate multiple specialized components (runtime, architecture generator, reality bridge) into a unified training system. Why needed: Enables systematic scaling of agentic capabilities. Quick check: Can the ecosystem handle diverse agent types and environments without manual intervention?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: NexA4A -> NexAU -> NexGAP

Critical path: Natural language specification → Architecture generation (NexA4A) → Agent deployment (NexAU) → Real-world tool integration (NexGAP) → Training data collection → Model training

Design tradeoffs: The system prioritizes diversity and scalability over optimization for specific agent types. By using natural language generation for architectures and modular runtimes, the approach sacrifices some efficiency in favor of creating a broad training distribution. The reality bridge adds overhead but is essential for real-world performance.

Failure signatures: 
- Architecture generation failures manifest as agents that cannot be deployed or behave unpredictably
- Runtime failures appear as configuration incompatibilities or resource exhaustion
- Reality bridge failures result in agents that cannot access required tools or receive outdated information

First experiments:
1. Test NexA4A with simple natural language descriptions to verify architecture generation works as expected
2. Deploy a generated agent using NexAU to confirm the runtime can handle the architecture
3. Verify NexGAP can successfully integrate a real-world API into the agent's capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology lacks detailed metrics and comparison protocols for benchmark results
- Claims of matching "frontier proprietary models" require clarification on specific models and testing conditions
- The benefit of generating "over 200 diverse agent frameworks" is asserted but not empirically validated

## Confidence
High confidence in the core infrastructure components (modular runtime, natural language generation, reality integration) being well-defined and functional. Medium confidence in the combined effectiveness claims, as the individual contributions are not independently verified. Low confidence in the benchmarking claims against proprietary models due to lack of detailed experimental conditions and fairness of comparison.

## Next Checks
1. Request detailed evaluation protocols and comparison conditions for the benchmark results, including exact metrics and proprietary model versions tested
2. Conduct ablation studies removing each Nex ecosystem component to quantify their individual contributions to performance
3. Perform a controlled study validating whether the claimed "200 diverse agent frameworks" provides measurable generalization benefits across the tested benchmarks
