# Robust Gymnasium: A Unified Modular Benchmark for Robust Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.19652
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19652
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** A modular benchmark for evaluating RL agent resilience under observation, action, and environment disruptions, including LLM-based adversarial attacks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Robust-Gymnasium, a unified benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) agent resilience against various disruptions across the agent-environment interaction process. The benchmark includes over 60 diverse tasks spanning robotics, safe RL, and multi-agent RL, with disruptions affecting agent observations, actions, rewards, and environment dynamics. The authors evaluate standard RL baselines (PPO, SAC) and robust RL methods (OMPO, RSC, ATLA, DBC), revealing significant performance degradation under disturbances, especially when algorithms are unaware of potential variability during training. The benchmark also features LLM-based adversarial attacks, demonstrating that such attacks can cause more substantial performance drops compared to traditional noise-based disruptions. The results highlight current algorithm deficiencies and underscore the need for more robust RL approaches.

## Method Summary
Robust-Gymnasium is a modular benchmark designed to evaluate RL agent resilience under disruptions. It standardizes and modularizes disruptions across the agent-environment loop, defining three disruptors—observation, action, and environment—that operate as pluggable modules. These modules apply perturbations at configurable frequencies and modes (random, adversarial, LLM-based), systematically exposing policy weaknesses. The benchmark supports two evaluation settings: in-training (disruptions active during both training and testing) and post-training (disruptions active only during testing). This structure isolates the impact of each disruption type and reveals distinct failure modes and training deficiencies.

## Key Results
- Standard RL algorithms (PPO, SAC) show significant performance degradation under disruptions, particularly in post-training settings.
- LLM-based adversarial attacks cause more substantial performance drops than traditional noise-based disruptions.
- Safe RL algorithms (CRPO, PCRPO) demonstrate improved resilience to action noise, with PCRPO sometimes outperforming nominal settings under disturbance.
- Robust RL algorithms (RSC) achieve greater robustness than non-robust baselines but require improved training efficiency.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Modular Disruption Injection
Standardizing and modularizing disruptions across the agent-environment loop enables consistent robustness evaluation. The benchmark defines three disruptors—observation, action, and environment—that operate as pluggable modules, systematically exposing policy weaknesses. This structure isolates the impact of each disruption type.

### Mechanism 2: In-Training vs. Post-Training Evaluation
Evaluating robustness under two conditions—when the agent is trained with disturbances (in-training) and when it is not (post-training)—reveals distinct failure modes and training deficiencies. The "In-training" setting exposes the agent to perturbations during learning, while the "Post-training" setting tests a naively trained policy's brittleness to unseen perturbations.

### Mechanism 3: LLM-Based Adversarial Attacks as a Stress Test
Large Language Models (LLMs) can function as sophisticated adversarial policies, generating more effective and semantically meaningful disturbances than traditional random noise. An LLM is prompted with the current state/reward and tasked with outputting a perturbed state, allowing it to craft "semantic" attacks that exploit high-level task structures.

## Foundational Learning

- **Markov Decision Process (MDP):** Why needed here: Robustness is defined as the ability to maximize cumulative reward in a *disrupted* MDP. Understanding the standard MDP tuple is a prerequisite for grasping how disruptors modify this structure.
  - Quick check question: Can you name the four core components of a standard MDP tuple?

- **Adversarial Training / Robust Optimization:** Why needed here: The benchmark's "adversarial disturbance" mode is framed as a two-player zero-sum game. Familiarity with the concept of training against an adversary to find a worst-case robust policy is key to interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: What is the core objective in a two-player zero-sum game formulation of robust RL?

- **Generalization Gap (Train vs. Test Performance):** Why needed here: A central finding is the dramatic performance drop in "post-training" evaluations. This concept is fundamental to understanding why robust RL is a distinct and necessary field of study.
  - Quick check question: If an agent achieves high reward in its training environment but fails in a slightly different test environment, what problem does this indicate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** The system has three primary components:
  1. **Task Bases:** Eleven sets of standard environments (e.g., MuJoCo, Robosuite, MAMuJoCo) providing the nominal MDP.
  2. **Disruptors:** Pluggable modules for Observation (state/reward), Action, and Environment (internal dynamics/external workspace). Each has configurable modes (random, adversarial, LLM) and frequency.
  3. **Evaluation Wrapper:** A unified interface that orchestrates the interaction, applying disruptions according to the specified protocol (in-training vs. post-training).

- **Critical path:** The core interaction loop is modified as follows:
  1. Environment outputs state `s_t` and reward `r_t`.
  2. **Observation Disruptor** perturbs to `s̃_t`, `r̃_t`.
  3. Agent selects action `a_t` from `s̃_t`.
  4. **Action Disruptor** perturbs `a_t` to `ã_t`.
  5. **Environment Disruptor** updates environment parameters.
  6. Environment executes `ã_t` and transitions to `s_{t+1}`.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Modularity vs. Complexity:** The highly modular design allows for fine-grained experiments but increases the configuration space.
  - **LLM Adversary vs. Computational Cost:** Using LLMs for attacks creates powerful, semantic disturbances but introduces significant latency compared to simple noise functions.
  - **Task Coverage vs. Depth:** The benchmark prioritizes breadth (60+ tasks, 3 RL paradigms) over deep evaluation on a single task.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Catastrophic performance collapse:** A sharp drop in reward under even minor perturbations indicates a policy overfitted to the nominal environment.
  - **High variance under random seeds:** The paper notes RL is sensitive to seeds; high variance makes results difficult to interpret.
  - **Constraint violation in Safe RL:** A sudden increase in average episode cost under action/cost signal perturbations indicates a failure of the safety mechanism.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Establish a baseline:** Train a standard PPO agent on a simple task (e.g., HalfCheetah-v4) without perturbations. Evaluate it under increasing levels of *random* observation noise (Post-training setting) to quantify baseline brittleness.
  2. **Compare training paradigms:** Train two agents: one with no perturbations, one with a configured observation disruptor (In-training setting). Compare their performance when evaluated on a held-out set of *adversarial* observation attacks.
  3. **Test LLM Adversary:** On a more complex manipulation task (e.g., DoorCausal-v1), evaluate a trained policy under two attack types: uniform random noise and the LLM-based adversarial attack. Compare the average episode reward to confirm the LLM attack's potency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can reinforcement learning agents be effectively defended against context-aware adversarial disturbances generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)?
  - **Basis in paper:** The authors note that "LLM-based attacks lead to a more significant performance drop for PPO compared to that using uniform distribution," and include this feature to "illustrate the potential of LLMs in robust RL research."
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates that LLMs can generate sophisticated attacks that degrade performance more than traditional noise, but it does not propose or test specific algorithmic defenses against this new class of semantic perturbations.

- **Open Question 2:** What are the theoretical mechanisms allowing specific safe RL algorithms like PCRPO to achieve higher performance under disturbance than in nominal settings?
  - **Basis in paper:** In Section 4.3, the authors observe that "PCRPO’s performance under disturbance surpasses its performance without disturbance, suggesting that introducing appropriate disturbances during training may enhance overall performance."
  - **Why unresolved:** This phenomenon is presented as an empirical finding, but the underlying reasons why adding noise improves optimization or constraint satisfaction for PCRPO (and not CRPO) remain unexplained.

- **Open Question 3:** How can the sample efficiency of robust algorithms (e.g., RSC) be improved without compromising their resilience to external semantic disturbances?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 4.2 notes that while RSC demonstrates greater robustness than ATLA and DBC, "RSC’s training efficiency may need further improvement, as it generates augmentation data during policy learning."
  - **Why unresolved:** There is a trade-off between the robustness achieved via data augmentation/alteration and the computational overhead required to generate these augmentations during training.

## Limitations
- The modular disruptor framework may not capture all real-world failure modes, particularly those involving complex temporal logic or multi-step dependencies.
- The computational cost of LLM-based attacks limits scalability for extensive benchmarking.
- The lack of external validation for the LLM-based adversarial attack mechanism means its reliability and generalizability are uncertain.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The benchmark's modular design and the comparative performance degradation between in-training and post-training settings are well-supported by the experimental results and align with established concepts in robust RL.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that LLM-based attacks are more effective than traditional noise is supported by the presented results but lacks external validation and could be sensitive to the specific LLM implementation details.
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that the benchmark captures "all key RL components" for robustness evaluation is difficult to verify without testing against a much broader range of real-world failure scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. **Independent LLM Attack Verification:** Replicate the LLM-based adversarial attack on a different RL environment (e.g., CartPole) using a different LLM API to confirm the attack's consistency and effectiveness.
2. **Real-World Failure Mode Mapping:** Conduct a systematic review of documented RL failures in robotics and autonomous systems to identify disruption types not covered by the three-module disruptor framework (observation, action, environment).
3. **Computational Cost Analysis:** Measure the latency introduced by the LLM-based attack module and compare it to the execution time of standard RL algorithms to quantify the practical feasibility of using such attacks in large-scale benchmarking.
