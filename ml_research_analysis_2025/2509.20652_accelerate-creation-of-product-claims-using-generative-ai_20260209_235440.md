# Accelerate Creation of Product Claims Using Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20652
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20652
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: AI-assisted claim creation increased proportion of highly appealing claims from 20% to 100% in MaxDiff studies

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Claim Advisor, a web application leveraging large language models (LLMs) to accelerate the creation of product claims in consumer packaged goods. The system uses in-context learning and fine-tuned models to semantically search existing claims, generate and optimize new claims based on product descriptions and consumer profiles, and rank claims using synthetic consumer simulations. A lightweight Phi-3 model fine-tuned with LoRA outperforms larger commercial models in claim ranking tasks. Across three rounds of MaxDiff research, the proportion of highly appealing claims increased from 20% (human-designed) to 100% (AI-assisted). The application significantly improves efficiency and creativity in product claim development, demonstrating the strong potential of LLMs to assist human creativity and decision-making tasks when properly designed and informed by domain knowledge.

## Method Summary
The system combines semantic search, generation, and ranking components to create product claims. It uses OpenAI's TEXT-EMBEDDING-ADA-002 and CLIP for multimodal retrieval from proprietary Claim Log and MaxDiff databases. Generation uses ChatGPT-4o with in-context learning (300 examples) combining performance-based and semantic-based selection methods. Ranking employs a Phi-3 model (7B or 14B) fine-tuned with LoRA on 100,316 examples from past MaxDiff studies, using a best/worst selection methodology from random 5-claim subsets. The LangChain backend and Streamlit frontend are containerized via Docker, processing inputs of product descriptions and consumer profiles to output ranked claim candidates for human review and formal MaxDiff validation.

## Key Results
- The proportion of highly appealing claims increased from 20% (human-designed) to 100% (AI-assisted) across three MaxDiff research rounds
- Phi-3 model with 14B parameters consistently outperformed all other models in ranking tasks, achieving best results with only a single in-context example
- By mimicking MaxDiff methodology through best/worst selection from small sets, the system achieved statistically meaningful results closely matching real-world consumer preferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: In-context learning with curated examples from past MaxDiff studies enables LLMs to generate increasingly consumer-resonant claims over iterative rounds.
- Mechanism: The system constructs in-context learning examples using two complementary methods: (1) performance-based selection of the 2nd–6th highest-scoring claims from prior MaxDiff studies, and (2) semantic similarity selection of claims nearest to the top performer. The LLM infers patterns about what makes claims successful and synthesizes novel claims combining those attributes.
- Core assumption: Consumer preferences captured in historical MaxDiff data contain learnable patterns that transfer to new claim generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Across three rounds of MaxDiff research, the proportion of highly appealing claims increased from 20% (human-designed) to 100% (AI-assisted)."
  - [section 3.2] "By the third round, all claims achieve highly appealing performance... the model, even relying only on in-context learning and prompt engineering, can effectively learn consumer preferences within a relatively small number of iterations."
- Break condition: If consumer preferences shift rapidly or if past MaxDiff studies span incompatible product categories, the inferred patterns may not transfer, causing generated claims to miss emerging themes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mimicking the MaxDiff selection process (choosing best/worst from small sets) produces more reliable claim rankings than single-pass full ranking.
- Mechanism: Rather than asking the LLM to rank all claims at once (which showed poor statistical alignment with actual MaxDiff outcomes), the system repeatedly presents random 5-claim subsets and asks for best/worst selections. Scores are computed as the ratio of times selected as best versus worst across many trials, then aggregated into rankings.
- Core assumption: LLMs better approximate human preference distributions when tasks are decomposed into smaller, pairwise-style comparisons resembling the original MaxDiff methodology.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A lightweight Phi-3 model fine-tuned with LoRA outperforms larger commercial models in claim ranking tasks."
  - [section 4] "By mimicking the MaxDiff methodology, namely asking the model to select the best and worst claims from small sets, we achieved results that were statistically meaningful and closely matched real-world consumer preferences."
- Break condition: If the model exhibits systematic bias toward certain claim structures (e.g., longer claims, superlative language), the aggregated scores will reflect this artifact rather than true consumer preference alignment.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning a smaller open-source model (Phi-3 14B) with LoRA achieves superior claim ranking performance compared to larger commercial models, while requiring fewer in-context examples.
- Mechanism: The model is fine-tuned on 100,316 examples from past MaxDiff studies using LoRA, which introduces trainable low-rank matrices into select layers. During inference, only 1–10 in-context examples are needed, compared to 100 examples provided to commercial models. Task-specific adaptation enables the smaller model to outperform general-purpose larger models.
- Core assumption: Claim ranking is a specialized task where domain-specific fine-tuning provides more value than raw model scale.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A lightweight Phi-3 model fine-tuned with LoRA outperforms larger commercial models in claim ranking tasks."
  - [section 3.3, Figure 4] "The Phi-3 model with 14B parameters consistently outperforms all others... the best result was achieved by the Phi-3 medium model using only a single example."
- Break condition: If the training data contains distributional biases (e.g., over-representation of certain product categories), the fine-tuned model may overfit to those patterns and fail on out-of-distribution claim types.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **MaxDiff (Maximum Difference Scaling)**
  - Why needed here: MaxDiff is the core evaluation methodology the system aims to simulate. Understanding that respondents choose "best" and "worst" from subsets—not rank all items—explains why the ranking mechanism decomposes tasks similarly.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why picking best/worst from 5-item sets provides more reliable preference signals than rating items on a 1–10 scale?

- Concept: **In-Context Learning vs. Fine-Tuning**
  - Why needed here: The system uses both approaches for different functions—in-context learning for generation (using 300 examples in prompts) and fine-tuning for ranking (training on 100,316 examples). Understanding when each is appropriate is critical for system design.
  - Quick check question: If you had only 50 labeled examples for a new claim-related task, which approach would you try first and why?

- Concept: **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly uses LoRA to fine-tune Phi-3 efficiently. Understanding that LoRA freezes base model weights and trains only low-rank adapter matrices explains how fine-tuning remains computationally feasible.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary advantage of LoRA over full fine-tuning when deploying on limited GPU memory (e.g., 11GB as mentioned)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Claim Log database + MaxDiff historical data -> Search Module (TEXT-EMBEDDING-ADA-002 + CLIP) -> Generation Module (ChatGPT-4o with in-context learning) -> Ranking Module (Phi-3 with LoRA) -> LangChain backend + Streamlit frontend

- Critical path:
  1. User inputs product description, consumer profile, and optional topics/visuals
  2. System retrieves semantically similar claims/images from Claim Log and MaxDiff databases
  3. Generation module produces 10–100 candidate claims using in-context learning
  4. Ranking module runs 50+ simulation rounds (best/worst selections on random 5-claim subsets)
  5. Claims are ranked by best/worst selection ratio; top candidates proceed to human review and formal MaxDiff validation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Open-source vs. Commercial Models**: Phi-3 offers cost control, reproducibility, and fine-tuning capability but requires infrastructure; GPT-4o offers convenience but suffers from API instability and higher inference costs
  - **In-Context Example Count**: More examples don't always improve performance (Phi-3 medium showed slight degradation from 1 to 10 examples)—suggests optimization requires empirical tuning, not maximization
  - **Latency vs. Simulation Rounds**: Ranking requires thousands of inferences; reducing simulation rounds speeds up results but may reduce ranking stability

- Failure signatures:
  - **Repetitive/low-diversity outputs**: Excessive prompt instructions constrain generation diversity (mentioned in Discussion)
  - **Rankings misaligned with actual MaxDiff**: Likely caused by using single-pass ranking instead of best/worst decomposition
  - **Category mismatch**: Training data dominated by specific product types causes poor generalization to new categories
  - **Latency bottlenecks**: Ranking module becomes unusable if thousands of serial inferences are required in real-time workflows

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline ranking comparison**: Run the same 30-claim set through (a) Phi-3 fine-tuned with 1 example, (b) Phi-3 with 10 examples, (c) GPT-4o with 100 examples; measure Kendall's tau against holdout MaxDiff results to validate the paper's ranking claims in your domain.
  2. **In-context example construction A/B test**: Compare performance-based vs. semantic-based example selection for claim generation on a held-out product category; measure proportion of "highly appealing" claims in subsequent MaxDiff study.
  3. **Diversity degradation test**: Systematically vary prompt instruction density (minimal, moderate, extensive) and measure output diversity via embedding-space variance; identify the threshold where diversity drops sharply.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the robustness of claim generation and optimization vary based on the number of input claims, cut-off percentages, and the quantity of in-context learning examples?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section states, "Further experiments need to be conducted to investigate the robustness of claim generation and optimization based on the number of input claims, the cut off percentages and the number of in-context learning examples."
- Why unresolved: The current study reports successful results (Round 3) but does not perform a sensitivity analysis on these specific hyperparameters to determine if the results hold under different configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying the number of in-context examples and input claims to measure the stability of the "High Appealing" classification rate.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can diverse in-context learning examples drawn from multiple product categories effectively mitigate the lack of output diversity caused by excessive prompt instruction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that excessive instruction can reduce diversity and hypothesize that "Diverse in-context learning examples from multiple product categories may help to mitigate the issue of lack of diversity."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the trade-off between guidance and diversity but only proposes a mitigation strategy without experimentally validating it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring the semantic variance of generated claims when using single-category versus cross-category in-context examples.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What computational optimizations are required to reduce latency for real-time claim ranking given the current bottleneck of requiring thousands of inferences?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Discussion section identifies latency as a challenge, specifically noting that "claim ranking... requires thousands of inferences within a short period of time," implying a need for efficiency improvements.
- Why unresolved: While the paper validates the accuracy of the ranking, it does not propose or test methods to optimize the inference speed necessary for a seamless user experience.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks comparing inference times and accuracy trade-offs using model quantization, distillation, or hardware acceleration for the ranking pipeline.

## Limitations
- Reliance on proprietary CPG datasets prevents direct replication of the 100,316 MaxDiff training examples and Claim Log database
- Generalizability to other claim types (healthcare, technology, automotive) remains untested
- The synthetic consumer simulation cannot fully capture the complexity of actual human decision-making, particularly for emotionally-driven or culturally-sensitive claims

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The ranking methodology using Phi-3 with LoRA (based on Kendall's tau and Top-N coverage metrics) and the superiority of best/worst selection over single-pass ranking
- **Medium confidence**: The in-context learning approach for claim generation, as effectiveness depends heavily on the quality and diversity of curated examples
- **Medium confidence**: The overall system architecture and performance improvements (from 20% to 100% highly appealing claims), though domain-specific validation would be needed

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain ranking validation**: Test the Phi-3 LoRA model on claim ranking tasks from non-CPG domains (e.g., technology product claims or service descriptions) to assess generalizability of the ranking approach
2. **Human-AI comparison study**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing human experts using Claim Advisor versus traditional methods on identical claim development tasks, measuring both quality (MaxDiff validation) and efficiency (time-to-completion)
3. **Longitudinal preference stability test**: Track claim performance across multiple MaxDiff studies over 6-12 months to determine if the in-context learning approach maintains effectiveness as consumer preferences evolve or if periodic retraining becomes necessary
