# Prototype-Guided and Lightweight Adapters for Inherent Interpretation and Generalisation in Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.05852
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05852
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: Achieves 86.82% accuracy on diabetic retinopathy classification while providing inherent interpretability

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a federated learning approach that addresses communication overhead and statistical heterogeneity by communicating only lightweight adapter modules and prototypes instead of full model parameters. The method combines prototype-based learning for inherent interpretability with adapter modules that act as compressed surrogates to guide generalization across non-IID client distributions. Each client aligns class embeddings toward prototype representations while adjusting lightweight adapters, maintaining frozen backbone weights. The approach is evaluated on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset for diabetic retinopathy classification, showing competitive performance with interpretability benefits.

## Method Summary
The proposed method integrates prototype-based learning with adapter modules in a federated learning framework. Each client maintains frozen backbone weights and adjusts lightweight adapters while aligning class embeddings toward prototype representations. The communication overhead is reduced by transmitting only adapter parameters and prototypes rather than full model weights. The framework leverages knowledge distillation principles where adapter modules serve as compressed surrogates for the original model, enabling efficient knowledge transfer across heterogeneous client distributions while maintaining inherent interpretability through prototype visualization.

## Key Results
- Achieved 86.82% average accuracy on diabetic retinopathy classification, closely matching FedAdapter baseline (87.58%)
- Successfully highlighted disease-relevant retinal regions through prototype-based interpretability
- Demonstrated strong generalization on external data with accuracy above 93% across clients
- Reduced communication overhead by transmitting only lightweight adapter modules and prototypes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by combining prototype-based learning with lightweight adapter modules to address federated learning challenges. Prototype-based learning provides inherent interpretability by creating class-representative embeddings that can be visualized and understood. The adapter modules act as compressed surrogates that efficiently transfer knowledge across non-IID client distributions while maintaining frozen backbone weights. This dual approach enables both interpretability and generalization while significantly reducing communication costs in federated settings.

## Foundational Learning
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed machine learning where multiple clients train models without sharing raw data, needed for privacy-preserving collaborative learning; quick check: data remains on client devices
- **Prototype-Based Learning**: Classification based on similarity to learned class prototypes, needed for inherent interpretability; quick check: prototypes represent class centroids in embedding space
- **Adapter Modules**: Small neural network components that adapt pre-trained models to new tasks, needed for parameter-efficient fine-tuning; quick check: adapter parameters << backbone parameters
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring knowledge from large models to smaller ones, needed for efficient knowledge transfer; quick check: student model mimics teacher model behavior
- **Non-IID Data**: Data distributions that vary across clients, needed to address real-world federated learning challenges; quick check: class distributions differ across clients
- **Communication Efficiency**: Reducing bandwidth requirements in distributed systems, needed for practical federated learning deployment; quick check: transmitted parameters << total parameters

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Backbone (frozen) -> Adapter Modules (trainable) -> Prototypes (shared) -> Client Embeddings

**Critical Path**: Input image → Backbone feature extraction → Adapter module transformation → Prototype alignment → Classification output

**Design Tradeoffs**: Frozen backbone vs. trainable parameters (communication vs. adaptability), prototype sharing vs. client-specific prototypes (interpretability vs. flexibility), adapter complexity vs. compression efficiency (performance vs. overhead)

**Failure Signatures**: Degraded accuracy when prototypes poorly represent client data distributions, communication bottlenecks if adapter modules remain too large, loss of interpretability if prototype alignment fails, convergence issues with extreme non-IID scenarios

**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Ablation study comparing with/without prototype guidance, 2) Communication cost analysis measuring transmitted parameters, 3) External data generalization testing on held-out datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on single medical imaging dataset (diabetic retinopathy classification) with only 20 clients
- Performance comparison shows close results (86.82% vs 87.58%) but absolute difference may not be statistically significant
- Claims about external data generalization performance above 93% accuracy lack detailed validation protocol and statistical testing

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Prototype-based learning framework implementation and basic accuracy comparisons with baseline FedAdapter
- **Medium Confidence**: Communication efficiency claims and lightweight adapter benefits (based on provided comparisons)
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about external data generalization performance and interpretability robustness

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing on accuracy differences between proposed method and FedAdapter using multiple random seeds and confidence intervals
2. Validate performance on additional federated learning benchmarks with varying client counts (e.g., LEAF datasets) and different data heterogeneity levels
3. Perform ablation studies isolating the contribution of prototype guidance versus adapter modules, and test with different backbone architectures to assess method robustness
