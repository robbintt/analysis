- Primary result: Novel causal inference method detects clinician implicit bias in observational medical data using proxy variables for latent health states

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a proximal causal inference approach to detect implicit clinician bias in medical diagnoses using observational data. The method addresses the challenge of unmeasured health mediators by leveraging proxy variables - survey data that doesn't directly affect diagnoses and lab results not directly influenced by demographics. By disentangling pathway-specific effects of patient sociodemographic attributes, the approach estimates controlled direct effects as a measure of implicit bias. Tested on UK Biobank data, the method successfully identifies known biases and discovers new areas of potential inequity, providing statistical tests for validating assumptions and an algorithm for optimal proxy selection.

## Method Summary
The method uses proximal mediation to isolate the controlled direct effect of demographic attributes on diagnoses while accounting for unmeasured health states. It employs two types of proxy variables: treatment proxies (surveys not affecting diagnoses) and outcome proxies (lab results not directly affected by demographics). The approach constructs orthogonal moment conditions that remain robust even when bridge functions mapping proxies to outcomes are imperfectly estimated. A key innovation is the algorithmic selection of valid proxy subsets through primal and dual violation tests, ensuring the necessary causal assumptions are met before bias estimation.

## Key Results
- Successfully detects known racial and gender biases in UK Biobank data, including higher CHD diagnosis rates for white patients and lower hypertension diagnosis rates for women
- Identifies new bias patterns such as income-based diagnostic disparities that persist after adjusting for biological factors
- Demonstrates robust estimation with narrow confidence intervals when data assumptions are met, validating the method's practical utility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent State Proxy Decomposition
The method identifies controlled direct effects (implicit bias) even when the true health mediator is unobserved by leveraging proxy variables. Treatment proxies (Z) are affected by demographics but don't directly influence diagnoses, while outcome proxies (X) influence diagnoses but aren't directly affected by demographics. This creates a decomposition that isolates variation in demographics not mediated by health states. The core assumption requires that Z has no direct causal path to Y, and X has no direct causal path from D. This fails if a survey directly changes diagnosis decisions or if demographics directly affect lab results through unmeasured pathways.

### Mechanism 2: Orthogonal Moment Construction
The estimation remains robust to errors in nuisance parameters through Neyman orthogonal moment construction. A debiased instrument D - γ*Z removes variation in demographics predictable by treatment proxies, ensuring the primary parameter θ is insensitive to small perturbations in bridge functions. The core assumption requires the dual equation admits a solution and the instrument has non-zero correlation with demographics. The method fails when the instrument is too weak, causing variance to explode.

### Mechanism 3: Proxy Selection and Validation Tests
The method algorithmically detects and removes invalid proxies through iterative testing. The Proxy Variable Selection Algorithm uses primal and dual violation tests to check if residuals of moment equations are statistically zero, pruning any proxy violating exclusion restrictions. The core assumption requires that some subset of observed variables satisfies validity conditions. The method returns no valid pairs if all proxies violate assumptions, such as when all survey data influences diagnosis or all lab data shows racial correlation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Controlled Direct Effect (CDE)**
  - Why needed here: The paper defines implicit bias as the CDE - the effect of demographic attributes on diagnosis after holding health state constant
  - Quick check question: If health mediator M is held constant, and attribute D still changes outcome Y, what does that imply about fairness?

- **Concept: Proximal Causal Inference (Negative Controls)**
  - Why needed here: This is the theoretical engine allowing analysis with unmeasured confounders via proxies
  - Quick check question: Why must treatment proxy Z (e.g., sleep questionnaire) not affect diagnosis Y directly?

- **Concept: Neyman Orthogonality**
  - Why needed here: Ensures errors in estimating complex bridge functions don't contaminate final bias estimate
  - Quick check question: Why is moment orthogonality to nuisance parameters critical when dealing with high-dimensional proxies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Ingest (UK Biobank) -> Preprocessor (residualization) -> Validation Layer (Primal/Dual Tests) -> Selection Engine (Proxy Algorithm) -> Estimation Core (IV solver) -> Output (bias estimate)

- **Critical path:** The Validation Layer is essential. Initial runs failed primal/dual tests, meaning raw data violated assumptions and the system cannot function without successful proxy selection.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Linearity vs. Complexity: Partially linear structural equations simplify estimation but may not capture complex biological interactions
  - Proxy Validity vs. Availability: Requires perfect proxies but real EHR data rarely provides clean separation, requiring aggressive pruning that reduces statistical power

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Influence Scores: Bias estimate driven by few outliers rather than systemic effect
  - Weak Instrument Statistic: F < 23.1 indicates instrument too weak for reliable identification
  - Dual/Primal Violation: Test statistics exceed critical values, invalidating causal graph assumptions

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Semi-Synthetic Validation: Generate data with known bias effect θ=0.5, run pipeline to verify retrieval accuracy against OLS baselines
  2. Global Proxy Run: Run full UK Biobank dataset with all X and Z, expect primal/dual test failures to demonstrate necessity of selection algorithm
  3. Subset Analysis: Run Proxy Selection Algorithm to find valid pairs, then re-run estimation to observe recovered bias estimates and check robustness via bootstrapping

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper notes that the method's performance when no valid proxy subsets exist remains untested, and the impact of intersectional factors beyond income on bias detection accuracy requires further investigation.

## Limitations
- Core causal assumptions about proxy validity are difficult to verify empirically and may not generalize across clinical contexts
- Linearity assumption for structural equations may not capture complex biological pathways, potentially biasing estimates
- Proxy selection algorithm may discard valuable information when aggressively pruning invalid proxies, reducing statistical power

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Proximal causal inference framework and identification strategy are theoretically sound; moment construction ensures robustness; method successfully detects known biases in UK Biobank

**Medium Confidence**: Practical implementation details work as described including validation tests and proxy selection; results are reproducible under stated assumptions; UK Biobank application demonstrates feasibility

**Low Confidence**: Generalization to datasets with different proxy quality; algorithm performance when no valid subsets exist; intersectional factor impacts beyond income

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Apply method to independent clinical dataset with known bias patterns to verify UK Biobank results generalize beyond single data source

2. **Stress Test with Simulated Violations**: Systematically introduce direct paths from Z to Y or from D to X in synthetic data to quantify method's sensitivity to exclusion restriction violations

3. **Intersectional Analysis Extension**: Test whether method maintains identification accuracy when simultaneously analyzing multiple demographic attributes (race, gender, income) and their interactions
