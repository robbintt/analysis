# OpComm: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Adaptive Buffer Control in Warehouse Volume Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19738
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19738
- Reference count: 1
- Reduced WAPE by 21.65% (from 4.95% to 3.85%) across 400+ stations

## Executive Summary
OpComm integrates supervised learning (LightGBM) and reinforcement learning (PPO) to improve warehouse volume forecasting and buffer control. LightGBM provides station-level demand forecasts, while a PPO agent selects buffer levels from discrete actions, penalizing under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering to reflect real-world trade-offs. Station outcomes are incorporated through Monte Carlo updates for continual policy adaptation. A generative AI layer enhances interpretability with SHAP-based feature attributions, producing executive-level summaries. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced WAPE by 21.65% (from 4.95% to 3.85%), improved station-level accuracy in 93.7% of cases, and lowered under-buffering incidents, demonstrating effective integration of predictive modeling and adaptive control in logistics.

## Method Summary
OpComm combines supervised and reinforcement learning for warehouse buffer control. LightGBM predicts station-level demand, which feeds into a PPO agent that selects buffer levels from discrete actions. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering to reflect real-world operational priorities. Station outcomes are incorporated through Monte Carlo updates for continual policy adaptation. A generative AI layer provides interpretability through SHAP-based feature attributions and executive summaries. The system was evaluated across 400+ warehouse stations, demonstrating improved forecasting accuracy and reduced under-buffering incidents.

## Key Results
- Reduced WAPE by 21.65% (from 4.95% to 3.85%) across 400+ stations
- Improved station-level accuracy in 93.7% of cases
- Lowered under-buffering incidents while maintaining operational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OpComm works by combining complementary approaches: LightGBM provides accurate short-term demand predictions at the station level, while the PPO agent dynamically adjusts buffer levels based on these predictions and real-time feedback. The asymmetric reward structure ensures that the system prioritizes avoiding stockouts (under-buffering) over minimizing excess inventory (over-buffering), which aligns with operational realities. Monte Carlo updates allow the policy to continuously adapt to changing conditions, while the interpretability layer bridges the gap between complex model decisions and actionable business insights.

  - Why needed: Provides interpretable explanations for model decisions
  - Quick check: Validate SHAP values align with business logic
- **Reward asymmetry**: Higher penalty for under-buffering vs over-buffering
  - Why needed: Reflects operational priority of avoiding stockouts
  - Quick check: Analyze buffer level distributions post-deployment

  - Why needed: Translates technical insights into actionable business intelligence
  - Quick check: Validate summary accuracy against raw model outputs

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Station Demand -> LightGBM -> PPO Agent -> Buffer Action -> Station Outcome -> Monte Carlo Update

Critical path: Demand forecast → Buffer selection → Outcome measurement → Policy update

Design tradeoffs: Asymmetric rewards favor avoiding under-buffering but may lead to higher inventory costs; Monte Carlo updates provide adaptation but require sufficient sampling for stability

Failure signatures: 
- Persistent under-buffering despite high penalties indicates reward structure misalignment
- Slow policy adaptation suggests insufficient exploration or poor Monte Carlo sampling
- Interpretability gaps may indicate complex feature interactions beyond SHAP's explanatory power

First experiments:
1. Compare WAPE reduction between LightGBM and baseline forecasting methods
2. Test buffer control performance under varying reward structures
3. Validate interpretability layer accuracy by comparing SHAP explanations to known feature importance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize across different warehouse contexts
- Performance sensitive to asymmetric reward structure, which may not reflect all operational priorities
- Long-term stability of PPO agent under non-stationary demand conditions uncertain

## Confidence
- Forecasting accuracy improvements: High
- Buffer control mechanism: Medium
- Interpretability enhancements: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the OpComm framework in multiple warehouse environments with varying demand patterns and operational constraints to assess generalizability
2. Conduct an ablation study to quantify the relative contributions of the LightGBM forecasts, PPO-based buffer control, and interpretability layer to overall performance
3. Evaluate the long-term stability and adaptability of the PPO agent under non-stationary demand conditions and evolving operational priorities
