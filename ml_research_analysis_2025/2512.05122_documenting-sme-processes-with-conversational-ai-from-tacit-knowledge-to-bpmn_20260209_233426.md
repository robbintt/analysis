# Documenting SME Processes with Conversational AI: From Tacit Knowledge to BPMN

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05122
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05122
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: LLM-driven chatbot converts tacit SME know-how into BPMN 2.0 process models through conversational dialogue

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach for capturing tacit, experience-based knowledge from shop-floor staff and converting it into formal BPMN 2.0 process models using conversational AI. The system employs Gemini 2.5 Pro to engage in dialogue with SMEs, generate BPMN diagrams in real-time, and provide process analysis including bottleneck identification and improvement recommendations. In a proof-of-concept equipment maintenance scenario, the prototype successfully produced both "AS-IS" and "TO-BE" process models within 12 minutes while maintaining costs within SME budgets. The approach addresses the critical challenge of knowledge loss when experienced employees leave and provides a scalable method for process documentation without requiring specialized process modeling expertise.

## Method Summary
The method employs a conversational AI system built around Gemini 2.5 Pro that engages shop-floor staff in natural dialogue to elicit process knowledge. The system uses prompt engineering to guide the conversation, generate BPMN 2.0 XML compliant with process modeling standards, and visualize results using bpmn-js in a client-side application. The chatbot iteratively refines process models through follow-up questions, eventually producing annotated diagrams that include bottleneck analysis and recommendations for process improvements. The system captures both explicit steps and implicit knowledge that experienced workers possess but may not formally document, converting conversational descriptions into structured, machine-readable process representations.

## Key Results
- Successfully generated accurate "AS-IS" BPMN models from conversational inputs in equipment maintenance scenario
- Produced annotated process analysis identifying bottlenecks and creating "TO-BE" improvement variants
- Completed entire process documentation workflow within 12 minutes while maintaining SME-friendly API costs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding to bridge the gap between tacit knowledge and formal process modeling. Gemini 2.5 Pro's conversational capabilities enable it to ask clarifying questions, identify implicit steps, and structure unstructured knowledge into BPMN-compliant formats. The system's iterative refinement process allows for progressive elaboration of complex processes, while prompt engineering ensures consistent output quality and XML compliance. Client-side bpmn-js visualization provides immediate feedback, enabling users to verify and correct models in real-time. The combination of conversational engagement with automated model generation reduces the cognitive load on SMEs while maintaining modeling accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **BPMN 2.0 XML structure** - Needed for understanding the formal output format; quick check: validate generated XML against BPMN schema
- **Prompt engineering techniques** - Required for consistent model generation; quick check: test prompts across different process scenarios
- **bpmn-js visualization** - Essential for client-side diagram rendering; quick check: verify interactive diagram manipulation works correctly
- **LLM conversation flow design** - Critical for effective knowledge elicitation; quick check: ensure conversation covers all process steps without redundancy
- **API cost optimization** - Important for SME viability; quick check: monitor token usage and response times across sessions
- **Process bottleneck identification** - Needed for meaningful process analysis; quick check: validate bottleneck detection against known process inefficiencies

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Interface -> Gemini 2.5 Pro API -> BPMN XML Generator -> bpmn-js Visualizer
**Critical Path**: Conversation initiation → Knowledge elicitation → BPMN generation → Visualization → Analysis
**Design Tradeoffs**: Cloud API dependency vs. on-premise deployment; conversation depth vs. latency; model detail vs. cost efficiency
**Failure Signatures**: Incomplete process coverage, XML validation errors, visualization rendering failures, analysis inaccuracies
**First Experiments**: 1) Test conversation flow with simple linear processes, 2) Validate BPMN XML output against schema, 3) Measure API response times with varying process complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single equipment-maintenance scenario, restricting generalizability
- Timeline excludes manual preparation and verification efforts required in practice
- Bottleneck analysis and improvement recommendations rely on LLM-generated insights without expert validation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core functionality of converting conversational inputs to BPMN-compliant models
- **Medium Confidence**: Cost-effectiveness claims for SMEs based on prototype usage
- **Low Confidence**: Quality and appropriateness of LLM-generated process improvements

## Next Checks
1. Multi-domain pilot testing with 10+ distinct SME process types to evaluate consistency across varied contexts
2. Controlled cost benchmarking comparing conversational approach against traditional documentation methods
3. Expert review study evaluating BPMN outputs by certified process modeling professionals for correctness and usability
