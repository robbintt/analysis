# Multimodal AI on Wound Images and Clinical Notes for Home Patient Referral

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.13247
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13247
- **Reference count:** 33
- **Key outcome:** DM-WAT achieved 77% accuracy and 70% F1 score, outperforming prior approaches on wound referral classification.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses inconsistent wound care referrals for chronic wounds affecting 8.5 million Americans. The Deep Multimodal Wound Assessment Tool (DM-WAT) combines wound images and clinical notes using DeiT-Base-Distilled for images and DeBERTa-base for text, achieving 77% accuracy and 70% F1 score. The model uses intermediate fusion and conservative expert label aggregation to prioritize patient safety. The framework outperforms prior single-modality approaches and demonstrates the value of multimodal AI in clinical decision support.

## Method Summary
DM-WAT processes wound images through DeiT-Base-Distilled and clinical notes through DeBERTa-base, extracting 768-dimensional embeddings from each modality. These embeddings are concatenated into 1,536-dimensional features and classified using an SVM into three referral categories: Continue Treatment, Change Non-Urgently, or Change Urgently. The model uses image augmentation (rotation, flips, color jitter) and GPT-4-generated text augmentation to address class imbalance. Expert disagreement is resolved by selecting the more urgent recommendation to prioritize patient safety.

## Key Results
- DM-WAT achieved 77% accuracy and 70% F1 score on wound referral classification
- Multimodal approach outperformed single-modality baselines (74% text-only, 70% image-only)
- Image augmentation provided +34% F1 improvement; text augmentation showed only +2% F1 gain

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Intermediate fusion of image and text features yields higher referral classification accuracy than single-modality approaches.
- **Mechanism:** DeiT-Base-Distilled extracts 768-dim visual embeddings capturing wound appearance; DeBERTa-base extracts 768-dim textual embeddings capturing clinical context. Concatenation produces a 1,536-dim joint representation that an SVM classifies into three referral categories. The fusion preserves modality-specific features while enabling cross-modal reasoning.
- **Core assumption:** Visual and textual cues provide complementary diagnostic signal; neither modality alone captures the full decision boundary.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "DM-WAT achieved 77% accuracy and 70% F1 score, outperforming prior approaches."
  - [Table IV] Multimodal DM-WAT: 77% acc, 70% F1 vs. image-only best 70%/67% vs. text-only best 74%/65%
  - [corpus] Nguyen et al. (2020) prior multimodal baseline achieved 71% acc, 61% F1—DM-WAT exceeds this by 6% accuracy.
- **Break condition:** If image and text features are highly redundant (e.g., notes merely describe visible wound state without adding history/comorbidity context), fusion gains diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Knowledge distillation in vision transformers enables effective feature extraction from small medical image datasets.
- **Mechanism:** DeiT-Base-Distilled uses both class tokens and distillation tokens, learning from true labels and a teacher model's soft predictions. The combined loss L_total = αL_CE + (1-α)L_KD provides regularization that prevents overfitting on 205 images.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-trained teacher (on general images) transfers useful inductive bias to wound images despite domain shift.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III-D] "Distillation-based training facilitates representation learning...so that DeiT-Base-Distilled performs well on our small wound image dataset of 205 wound images."
  - [Table II] DeiT-Base-Distilled with augmentation: 70% acc, 67% F1 vs. ResNet50: 67%/27%—ViT outperforms CNNs substantially.
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence on distillation specifically for wounds; related wound AI papers focus on CNNs or standard ViTs without distillation comparison.
- **Break condition:** If the dataset grows significantly (>10K samples), distillation benefits may plateau relative to training from scratch or fine-tuning without distillation.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Conservative aggregation of contradictory expert labels prioritizes patient safety at potential cost to accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** When two experts disagree on referral urgency, the final label dec_final = max(dec_exp1, dec_exp2) selects the more urgent recommendation. This ensures the model errs toward over-referral rather than under-referral.
- **Core assumption:** Missing an urgent referral is clinically worse than an unnecessary non-urgent referral.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III-B] "To prioritize patient safety, a conservative final decision...was adopted by selecting the higher (more urgent) of the two expert recommendations."
  - [Figure 2B] Shows expert disagreement matrix—off-diagonal values indicate label noise this strategy addresses.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers directly validate conservative aggregation strategies for wound referral.
- **Break condition:** If the deployment context values specificity (reducing specialist burden), this strategy may cause too many false positives; alternative would be weighted voting or explicit uncertainty modeling.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Vision Transformer (ViT) patch embedding and self-attention**
  - **Why needed here:** DeiT processes images as sequences of patches, not convolutions. Understanding patch tokens, positional embeddings, and attention is required to interpret Score-CAM outputs and debug feature extraction.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a ViT might capture global wound context better than a CNN with local receptive fields?

- **Concept: Disentangled attention (content vs. position embeddings)**
  - **Why needed here:** DeBERTa separates content and position representations, which affects how clinical note tokens attend to each other. Critical for understanding Captum attributions on medical text.
  - **Quick check question:** How does DeBERTa's attention computation QC + QP, KC + KP differ from standard BERT attention?

- **Concept: Class imbalance handling via augmentation vs. resampling**
  - **Why needed here:** The dataset has 26/40/139 samples across classes. The paper uses upsampling via augmentation. Understanding alternatives (SMOTE, class-weighted loss) is needed to evaluate tradeoffs.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might synthetic image augmentation (rotation, flips) be safer than synthetic text generation (GPT-4) for medical data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Wound Image → Image Augmentation → DeiT-Base-Distilled → 768-dim embedding → Concatenate → 1536-dim → SVM → 3-class referral ← DeBERTa-base ← Text Augmentation ← Clinical Note

- **Critical path:** Feature extraction quality from pre-trained models → fusion representation quality → SVM decision boundary. The pre-trained embedders are frozen or lightly fine-tuned; the classifier learns on fused features.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Intermediate fusion (concatenation before classifier) vs. late fusion (separate predictions then ensemble): Paper shows intermediate fusion outperforms prior late-fusion baselines.
  - SVM vs. MLP classifier: SVM achieved 77% acc vs. MLP 76%—SVM preferred for small data with clear margins.
  - GPT-4 text augmentation yielded only 2% F1 improvement—cost/benefit may not justify complexity.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - If image-only and multimodal performance converge, text features are likely redundant or poorly extracted.
  - If Score-CAM highlights background/skin rather than wound bed, visual feature learning has failed to localize.
  - If Captum attributes high importance to generic words ("patient", "wound") rather than clinical indicators, text embeddings lack domain specificity.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on fusion strategy:** Compare intermediate concatenation vs. late fusion (ensemble of separate image/text classifiers) on held-out test set. Expect intermediate fusion to win if cross-modal interactions matter.
  2. **Augmentation impact analysis:** Train with image-only augmentation, text-only augmentation, both, and neither. Quantify each contribution to F1. Paper reports image augmentation gave +34% F1 (33%→67%); replicate and verify text augmentation marginal gains.
  3. **Expert agreement thresholding:** Instead of max() for disagreement, test weighted averaging based on expert confidence or historical accuracy. Evaluate whether calibrated aggregation improves F1 without compromising safety metrics (e.g., recall on urgent class).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as few-shot or chain-of-thought prompting, significantly improve the quality and utility of synthetic clinical notes compared to the current GPT-4 augmentation approach?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that text augmentation had limited impact and suggest exploring advanced prompt engineering to improve the diversity and quality of generated text in future work.
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation resulted in only marginal performance gains, suggesting the synthetic text lacked sufficient depth or clinical precision to aid the model effectively.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies comparing model performance when trained on datasets augmented with standard versus advanced prompt engineering strategies.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does DM-WAT perform across diverse wound types, demographics, and clinical settings outside the specific UMass Memorial Medical Center dataset?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper identifies the reliance on a single dataset with unknown demographics and unspecified wound types as a key limitation that restricts generalizability.
- **Why unresolved:** The model was trained and validated exclusively on 205 images from one institution, potentially capturing site-specific biases rather than universal wound characteristics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** External validation studies using multi-center datasets that include varied geographical locations, skin tones, and wound etiologies.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Would attention-based fusion mechanisms outperform the current intermediate fusion approach in combining visual and textual features?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors propose exploring "advanced fusion strategies, including attention-based fusion," to better combine modalities and improve robustness.
- **Why unresolved:** The current method relies on concatenating feature vectors (intermediate fusion), which may not capture complex cross-modal dependencies as effectively as attention mechanisms.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments benchmarking the existing concatenation-based SVM classifier against attention-based fusion architectures on the same referral classification task.

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (205 total samples) limits generalizability and increases overfitting risk despite augmentation
- GPT-4 text augmentation showed only marginal improvement (2% F1), suggesting limited utility or need for better prompt engineering
- Conservative label aggregation prioritizes safety over specificity, potentially leading to unnecessary specialist referrals

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Multimodal fusion improves accuracy over single-modality approaches (77% vs. 74% text-only, 70% image-only)
- **Medium confidence:** Vision transformer with distillation effectively extracts features from small medical image datasets, though limited direct evidence exists for this specific application
- **Low confidence:** Text augmentation with GPT-4 provides meaningful contribution, given minimal performance gains

## Next Checks

1. Replicate ablation study comparing intermediate vs. late fusion strategies on held-out test data to confirm cross-modal interactions improve performance
2. Systematically quantify augmentation impact by training with image-only, text-only, both, and no augmentation, verifying reported 34% F1 improvement from image augmentation
3. Test alternative expert label reconciliation strategies (weighted averaging based on confidence) to evaluate tradeoffs between safety and specificity
