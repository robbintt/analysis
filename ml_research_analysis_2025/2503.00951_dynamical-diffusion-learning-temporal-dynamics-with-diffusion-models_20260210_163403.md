# Dynamical Diffusion: Learning Temporal Dynamics with Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.00951
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00951
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** DyDiff improves diffusion model predictions by 12% on weather forecasting and shows consistent gains across video and time series tasks by modeling temporal dependencies explicitly

## Executive Summary
Dynamical Diffusion (DyDiff) is a novel method that enhances diffusion models for predicting future events in sequential data like videos or weather patterns. Traditional diffusion models add noise to data to learn reconstruction, but they don't fully utilize temporal order. DyDiff addresses this by making each diffusion step depend on the previous one, allowing the model to better capture how things change over time. The approach works for tasks ranging from weather forecasting to robot movement prediction, consistently outperforming standard diffusion models with minimal added computational cost.

## Method Summary
DyDiff modifies the standard diffusion process by incorporating temporal dependencies at each diffusion step. Instead of treating each time step independently, it constructs latent variables as combinations of current noisy states and temporally preceding latents. This creates explicit temporal transitions throughout the diffusion process. The method uses a non-independent noise correlation across prediction steps and a timestep-aware gamma schedule that controls how much historical context influences each denoising step. During training, the model learns to denoise these correlated perturbations, producing jointly coherent outputs. The approach maintains the standard diffusion training objective while fundamentally changing how temporal information flows through the model.

## Key Results
- Weather forecasting (Turbulence dataset): Up to 12% improvement in CRPS metric compared to baseline diffusion models
- Video prediction (BAIR, RoboNet): Consistently better performance across FVD, PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics
- Time series forecasting (6 datasets): Best performance on 5 out of 6 datasets with up to 0.0377 improvement in summed CRPS
- Efficiency: Only adds 1.5× computation to the forward process while maintaining high performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Temporal-Aware Forward Process
- Incorporates temporal dependencies at each diffusion step to capture state evolution
- Each latent combines current noisy state AND preceding latent: $x_t^s = \sqrt{\bar{\gamma}_t} \cdot (\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0^s + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon_t^s) + \sqrt{1-\bar{\gamma}_t} \cdot x_t^{s-1}$
- Assumes temporal coherence requires explicit modeling of transitions between adjacent states
- Ablation studies show this mechanism is essential; removing it degrades performance below baseline

### Mechanism 2: Non-Independent Noise Correlation Across Time Steps
- Creates correlated noise across prediction steps for coherent multi-step predictions
- Uses $\tilde{\epsilon}_t^s = \sqrt{\bar{\gamma}_t}\epsilon_t^s + \sqrt{1-\bar{\gamma}_t}\tilde{\epsilon}_t^{s-1}$ to establish dependencies
- Assumes multi-step predictions share joint structure benefiting from correlated perturbations
- Ablation shows i.i.d. noise significantly degrades performance; correlated noise is strictly better

### Mechanism 3: Timestep-Aware Gamma Schedule
- Different diffusion timesteps weight historical context differently
- $\bar{\gamma}_t = \eta\bar{\alpha}_t + (1-\eta)$ with non-increasing $\bar{\gamma}_t$ schedule
- Assumes coarse structure in early denoising benefits from temporal context
- Ablation shows U-shaped performance curve; $\eta=1.0$ (no history mixing) causes performance collapse

## Foundational Learning

- **Standard DDPM Forward/Reverse Process**: DyDiff modifies the standard diffusion equations; understanding $x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon$ is essential to see what changes. Quick check: Can you explain why the forward process gradually corrupts data and how the SNR changes with $\bar{\alpha}_t$?

- **Reparameterization Trick**: DyDiff uses reparameterization to convert the variational lower bound into a simple MSE denoising objective. Quick check: How does reparameterization make the training objective differentiable w.r.t. network parameters?

- **DDIM vs DDPM Sampling**: DyDiff provides both DDIM-like and DDPM-like samplers with different speed/quality tradeoffs. Quick check: What makes DDIM non-Markovian, and why does it enable deterministic sampling with fewer steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: VAE encoder/decoder -> 3D UNet or DiT backbone -> Dynamics function -> Inverse Dynamics
- **Critical path**: Training: Sample batch → VAE encode → Dynamics mixing on clean latents → Dynamics mixing on noise → Add noise → Denoiser predicts noise → MSE loss. Inference: Initialize $x_T^{1:S} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$ → For each $t$: denoise → apply InverseDynamics → compute Dynamics for next step → VAE decode
- **Design tradeoffs**: $\eta$ parameter (default 0.5): Lower = more history dependence; $\eta=1$ disables the mechanism entirely. Independent vs correlated noise: Correlated is strictly better but requires full Dynamics/InverseDynamics pipeline. Backbone: SVD and DiT both show improvements, suggesting architecture-agnostic benefits
- **Failure signatures**: $\eta=1.0$ disables temporal mixing entirely; can underperform even the standard DPM baseline. Using i.i.d. noise actively harms performance. $\bar{\gamma}_T \approx 0$ causes reverse process to start from distant history rather than useful recent context. Missing InverseDynamics in inference produces incoherent outputs across time steps
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce single-step prediction ($S=1$) on BAIR to verify training loop and reparameterization work correctly. 2) Ablate noise correlation: Compare i.i.d. noise vs correlated noise on 5-step prediction; expect correlated noise to win. 3) Sweep $\eta \in \{0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0\}$ on Turbulence dataset; verify U-shaped curve where extremes underperform

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the temporal mixing schedule $\bar{\gamma}_t$ be learned or adapted dynamically rather than using the fixed formula $\bar{\gamma}_t = \eta\bar{\alpha}_t + (1-\eta)$?
- Basis: Performance varies significantly with $\eta$ values, and $\eta = 1.0$ causes performance collapse
- Why unresolved: Only five discrete $\eta$ values tested with simple linear combination
- Resolution: Experiments with learned $\bar{\gamma}_t$ schedules demonstrating consistent improvements

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does Dynamical Diffusion scale to significantly longer prediction horizons (e.g., hundreds of time steps)?
- Basis: Experiments use relatively short horizons (11-15 frames for video, 24-30 steps for time series)
- Why unresolved: No experiments extend beyond tested horizon lengths
- Resolution: Systematic evaluation on extended prediction horizons with analysis of error accumulation patterns

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can Dynamical Diffusion be combined with other recent diffusion enhancements such as flow matching, consistency models, or advanced samplers?
- Basis: Method modifies forward/reverse processes but serves as complement to existing approaches without exploring synergies
- Why unresolved: Evaluated in isolation using DDPM/DDIM samplers
- Resolution: Integration experiments with accelerated samplers measuring both speed and prediction quality

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the theoretical convergence guarantees for Dynamical Diffusion, particularly regarding the non-identity covariance structure in multi-step prediction?
- Basis: Theorem 3 derives non-identity covariance matrix $J_t$ but provides no analysis of how correlated noise structure affects optimization or sample quality
- Why unresolved: Theoretical implications noted but not rigorously analyzed
- Resolution: Convergence analysis or empirical studies comparing theoretical vs actual sample distributions

## Limitations
- Performance degrades significantly when temporal mixing or noise correlation mechanisms are removed, suggesting potential brittleness to hyperparameter choices
- VAE architecture details are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Claims of simplicity and efficiency are questionable given the need for careful hyperparameter tuning and additional computational components

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core mechanism of temporal mixing in forward process is well-defined and validated through ablation studies
- **Medium confidence**: Substantial improvements over baseline diffusion models across multiple domains, though some comparisons use different sampling strategies
- **Low confidence**: Claim that method is "simple and efficient" given complexity of dynamics mixing and hyperparameter sensitivity

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Isolation**: Run controlled experiments isolating the three mechanisms (temporal mixing, noise correlation, prediction strategy) on a single dataset to quantify individual contributions
2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Sweep $\eta$ across its full range on turbulence prediction to verify claimed non-monotonic behavior and identify optimal operating points
3. **Architecture Generalization**: Test DyDiff with different backbone architectures (e.g., plain 3D ConvNet vs DiT) on the same task to verify claimed architecture-agnostic benefits
