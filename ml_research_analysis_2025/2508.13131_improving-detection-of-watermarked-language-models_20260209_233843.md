# Improving Detection of Watermarked Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.13131
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13131
- Authors: Dara Bahri; John Wieting
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Hybrid detection combining watermarking and non-watermark methods improves accuracy by up to 20 percentage points, especially in low-entropy conditions

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of detecting AI-generated text by combining watermarking and non-watermark detection methods. Watermarking alone struggles when response entropy is low, such as in post-trained models or short responses. By cascading or learning to combine watermark scores with likelihood or classifier-based scores, detection accuracy improves significantly. Logistic regression on normalized scores performs best, achieving near-perfect accuracy even in low-entropy conditions while also improving computational efficiency and robustness to attacks like paraphrasing.

## Method Summary
The approach combines watermark detection (Aaronson, Bahri, Kirchenbauer, Kuditipudi schemes) with non-watermark detectors (LLh, LLR, Binoculars, RADAR, RoBERTa classifier) using hybrid fusion methods. These include one-sided and two-sided cascades, as well as learned combinations via logistic regression, MLPs, and decision trees. The method operates in the first-party detection setting where the model owner has white-box access. Responses are generated with temperature 1, force min 250/max 300 tokens, and evaluation uses accuracy and partial ROC-AUC metrics. Calibration datasets are held out from test data to avoid overfitting.

## Key Results
- Hybrid detection improves accuracy by up to 20 percentage points over either watermarking or non-watermark methods alone
- Logistic regression on normalized scores achieves near-perfect accuracy (96.7%) even in low-entropy conditions
- Cascade hit rates of 20-40% provide computational savings by avoiding expensive non-watermark scoring in most cases
- Hybrid methods maintain robustness under paraphrasing attacks where watermark signals are destroyed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Entropy-Dependent Detection Complementarity
Watermark and non-watermark detectors exhibit complementary strengths across different entropy regimes. Watermark detection effectiveness scales with response entropy because higher entropy provides more opportunities to embed statistical signals, while non-watermark detectors maintain relatively stable performance across entropy levels. When watermark signals are weak due to low entropy, non-watermark detectors compensate.

### Mechanism 2: Learned Score Fusion via Logistic Regression
A logistic regression model trained on normalized watermark and non-watermark scores achieves optimal performance by learning relative reliability weights across different input regions. This outperforms fixed cascades by making nuanced tradeoffs between evidence sources rather than hard decisions based on single thresholds.

### Mechanism 3: Computational Efficiency Through Cascade Hit Rates
Cascading watermark detection before non-watermark detection provides computational savings while maintaining quality. Watermark scoring requires only hash computations and simple statistics, while non-watermark methods require full language model inference. By checking watermark scores first and only running expensive detectors when ambiguous, expected computational cost is reduced proportionally to cascade hit rates.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Next-token entropy and its relationship to watermark detectability**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central finding is that watermark detection fails in low-entropy regimes. Understanding how to estimate response entropy and why it limits watermark strength is essential for predicting when hybrid detection will provide the most value.
  - Quick check question: Given a prompt "What is 2+2?" versus "Write a creative story about a robot," which would yield higher watermark detectability and why?

- **Concept: First-party vs. third-party detection settings**
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on first-party detection (model owner has white-box access), but incorporates third-party detectors in hybrid schemes. Understanding access requirements determines which detection methods are deployable in practice.
  - Quick check question: If you're an academic institution wanting to detect if students used GPT-4, can you use watermark-based detection? What about a log-likelihood detector?

- **Concept: ROC-AUC vs. accuracy with threshold tuning**
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses methodological issues with partial AUC when comparing methods with different numbers of tunable thresholds, and switches to accuracy as a more robust metric. Understanding these tradeoffs is critical for fair evaluation.
  - Quick check question: If method A has a tuneable threshold and method B does not, which might appear artificially better under a naive ROC-AUC comparison?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Text → [Watermark Detector] → s_w → Fusion Layer → Output Classification
                                 → [Non-WM Detector] → s_d

- **Critical path**: The calibration dataset selection is critical—it must be held-out from test data and representative of deployment conditions. Overfitting to calibration data (especially with high-capacity models) causes performance drops.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  1. Cascade vs. LR: Cascades are interpretable and guarantee no worse than either detector alone; LR achieves better performance but risks overfitting.
  2. Which non-WM detector: RoBERTa provides the most complementary signal (biggest hybrid gains) but is the weakest standalone; Binoculars is strongest standalone but provides less marginal gain in combination.
  3. Watermark strength: Stronger watermarks (higher δ in Kirchenbauer) improve detection but degrade text quality and hurt non-WM detector performance slightly.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Near-random watermark accuracy (e.g., Kuditipudi at 61%): Cascade hit rates drop to ~0%, hybrid relies entirely on non-WM detector.
  - Paraphrasing attacks: Watermark signal destroyed; hybrid degrades to non-WM performance (~70-80%).
  - Calibration-test distribution shift: LR and Tree methods overfit; can observe negative improvements.
  - Token corruption: Likelihood-based detectors fail completely; LR learns to invert the signal if trained on corrupted data.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Establish baselines: Run each watermark detector and each non-WM detector in isolation on your target dataset. Identify the best standalone WM and non-WM detectors.
  2. Test hybrid combinations: Implement 1S cascade, 2S cascade, and LR fusion with each non-WM detector. Use held-out calibration data. Report accuracy gains over the better standalone detector.
  3. Probe entropy sensitivity: Estimate response entropy for each prompt using n=4 samples. Bucket prompts by entropy (20% percentiles) and plot detection accuracy for WM-only, best non-WM, and LR hybrid.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How robust are trainable hybrid models, such as Logistic Regression or MLPs, to distribution shifts between the calibration dataset and the deployment environment? While the paper identifies overfitting artifacts when calibration differs from test domains, it does not propose methods to make the hybrid combination robust to domain mismatches.

### Open Question 2
Can hybrid detection schemes be engineered to maintain significant performance gains under heavy paraphrasing attacks? The paper shows paraphrasing effectively removes watermark signals, reducing hybrid approaches to near-non-WM performance, leaving the development of paraphrase-robust hybrids as an open challenge.

### Open Question 3
To what extent do hybrid detection gains generalize to the third-party (3P) detection setting where white-box access to the model is unavailable? The entire methodology relies on 1P watermark scores, and the utility of proposed hybrid schemes is unverified for external auditors or third-party regulators.

## Limitations
- Watermark detection performance depends critically on response entropy, failing in low-entropy scenarios common with post-trained models or short responses
- Hybrid method calibration sensitivity can cause overfitting, with MLPs and decision trees showing degraded performance when calibration-test distributions differ
- Attack surface assumptions are limited, with only paraphrasing attacks evaluated despite other potential adversarial scenarios like partial text replacement or multi-model collaboration attacks

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core finding that hybrid detection outperforms either watermarking or non-watermark methods alone is well-supported by consistent results across multiple datasets, models, and detection approaches.
- **Medium Confidence**: The computational efficiency claims for cascade methods assume watermark scoring is negligible compared to LM inference, but this depends on implementation details and the specific watermark scheme used.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of learned fusion weights to out-of-distribution scenarios (different prompt types, attack patterns, or model families) is not thoroughly validated, despite observed overfitting issues with some MLPs and decision trees.

## Next Checks
1. **Entropy Distribution Sensitivity Test**: Repeat the entropy-bucketed analysis using 10 samples per prompt instead of 4 to obtain more stable entropy estimates. Compare whether the low-entropy performance patterns remain consistent.

2. **Distribution Shift Robustness**: Hold out prompts from a completely different domain (e.g., legal documents if training on general web text) and evaluate whether LR fusion weights degrade compared to cascades when applied to this out-of-distribution test set.

3. **Multi-Attack Scenario Evaluation**: Test the hybrid detection against combined attacks: first apply paraphrasing to destroy watermark signals, then apply token corruption to test likelihood detector robustness. Measure whether hybrid methods degrade gracefully compared to individual detectors.
