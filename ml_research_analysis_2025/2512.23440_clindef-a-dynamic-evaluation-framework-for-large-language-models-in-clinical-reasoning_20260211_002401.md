# ClinDEF: A Dynamic Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models in Clinical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23440
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23440
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Dynamic evaluation framework that assesses LLM clinical reasoning through multi-turn dialogues, revealing substantial gaps in real-world clinical reasoning even in top models.

## Executive Summary
ClinDEF is a dynamic evaluation framework that assesses large language models' clinical reasoning through simulated multi-turn diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, it dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates interactions between an LLM-based doctor agent and automated patient/examiner agents. The framework goes beyond diagnostic accuracy to assess efficiency and quality across seven clinically validated dimensions. Experiments with 15 models show diagnostic accuracy ranging from 48.27% to 72.87%, with top models achieving balanced performance across efficiency and reasoning quality. Even high-performing models exhibit critical deficiencies in information gathering, diagnostic process, and uncertainty management, revealing substantial gaps in real-world clinical reasoning.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a structured disease knowledge graph and unstructured medical encyclopedia to dynamically generate unique patient cases at inference time, preventing data contamination. An LLM-based doctor agent interacts with automated patient and examiner agents through discrete actions (Ask, Test, Diag) within a constrained environment. The evaluation goes beyond binary accuracy, using an "LLM-as-a-Judge" paradigm to score interactions on seven clinically validated dimensions including diagnostic uncertainty, information gathering, and differential diagnosis quality.

## Key Results
- Diagnostic accuracy across 15 models ranged from 48.27% to 72.87%, with top models showing balanced performance across efficiency and reasoning quality
- High-performing models scored low on "Diagnostic Uncertainty" (DU), often issuing definitive diagnoses despite incomplete evidence
- Framework achieved 99.0% information leakage prevention and 93.5% clinical fidelity in case generation validation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Dynamic case synthesis mitigates data contamination risks inherent in static medical benchmarks.
- **Mechanism:** By mapping a structured disease knowledge graph ($K_G$) and unstructured encyclopedia text ($K_E$) to a generative LLM ($\Theta$), the framework creates unique patient profiles ($C$) at inference time. This prevents the model from relying on memorized answers from pre-training corpora.
- **Core assumption:** The generative model produces cases that are medically coherent and sufficiently distinct from the training data distribution of the model being evaluated.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.1]: Defines the generation mapping $G: (K_G, K_E, \Theta) \rightarrow C$ to ensure cases are "previously unseen."
  - [Section 3.1]: Explicitly lists "Contamination resistance" as a primary advantage over static vignettes.
  - [Corpus]: MedKGI supports the shift toward iterative, knowledge-grounded diagnosis rather than static QA.
- **Break condition:** If the knowledge graph topology is too sparse or the generative LLM hallucinates inconsistent symptoms, the case profile ($C$) ceases to be clinically faithful, rendering the evaluation invalid.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Constrained multi-agent interaction forces the "Doctor" LLM to reveal process-based reasoning gaps.
- **Mechanism:** The environment decouples the Doctor Agent from direct ground-truth access. By forcing the Doctor to interact with a deterministic Patient Agent (subjective symptoms) and Examiner Agent (objective tests) via discrete actions (Ask, Test, Diag), the system captures the trajectory of information gathering, not just the final answer.
- **Core assumption:** The Patient and Examiner agents perfectly adhere to the generated case profile $C$ without leaking diagnostic cues.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.2]: Defines the environment response where $u_t$ is strictly constrained by case profile $C$, ensuring errors are attributable to the Doctor Agent.
  - [Section 4.6]: Validation shows 99.0% of cases had no information leakage and 93.5% clinical fidelity.
- **Break condition:** If the Patient Agent (simulated by an LLM) introduces symptoms not in $C$ (hallucination) or parrots the diagnosis, the causal link between the Doctor's reasoning and the evaluation result is broken.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multi-dimensional rubric-based evaluation (DQS) exposes "hidden" safety risks that accuracy metrics miss.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of binary accuracy, the framework uses an "LLM-as-a-Judge" paradigm to score interactions on 7 dimensions (e.g., Diagnostic Uncertainty). This quantifies behaviors like overconfidence, which high accuracy scores might mask.
- **Core assumption:** The "Judge" LLMs correlate sufficiently well with human clinical experts to serve as a proxy.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.4]: Reports that despite high accuracy, top models scored low on "Diagnostic Uncertainty" (DU), often issuing definitive diagnoses despite incomplete evidence.
  - [Appendix A3]: Human validation confirms Pearson correlations of 0.80–0.87 between Judge LLMs and human experts.
- **Break condition:** If the "Judge" LLM exhibits a systematic bias (e.g., favoring verbose answers), the DQS becomes a measure of style rather than clinical quality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE)**
  - **Why needed here:** ClinDEF's evaluation protocol is explicitly grounded in OSCE principles used in medical education.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a checklist (rubric) is used in medical exams rather than just grading the final prescription?

- **Concept: Knowledge Graph Topology**
  - **Why needed here:** The case generation relies on sampling disease nodes and their structural relationships (symptoms) to ensure logical consistency.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a graph structure prevent the generation of a patient case where symptoms belong to unrelated biological systems?

- **Concept: "LLM-as-a-Judge" Validation**
  - **Why needed here:** The framework relies on automated grading; understanding the limitations (bias, self-preference) of this technique is critical for interpreting results.
  - **Quick check question:** Why did the authors use a "Trimmed Mean" of 5 distinct LLMs rather than a single strong model for evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Case Generator ($K_G$, $K_E$) -> Case Profile $C$ -> Agent Environment -> Doctor Agent actions -> Evaluation Module (Accuracy, Efficiency, DQS)

- **Critical path:** The definition of the "Case Profile" ($C$). This structured data object binds the Patient and Examiner agents. If $C$ is malformed, the entire simulation diverges from clinical reality.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Synthetic vs. Real Data:** The paper trades the noise and privacy issues of real EHR data for the "controlled clarity" of synthetic cases (Section 3.1).
  - **Text vs. Multi-modal:** The current architecture is text-only (radiology is described in text, not images), which abstracts away visual diagnostic reasoning (Appendix A1).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Premature Closure:** The Doctor Agent diagnoses early with low "Positive Findings" (e.g., Llama-4-Scout case study).
  - **Passive Reasoning:** High turn count but low "Positive Hit Rate," indicating the model is "fishing" for answers without a hypothesis.
  - **Judge Overfitting:** If one Judge LLM consistently rates its own "family" of models higher (mitigated here by using 5 distinct judges).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on Simulator Agents:** Run the same Doctor Agent against different Patient/Examiner backbones (e.g., GPT-5 vs. Gemini) to verify ranking stability (Section 4.5).
  2. **Information Leakage Test:** Run a "cheating" Doctor Agent that tries to force the Patient to name the disease to verify the environment's constraints.
  3. **Uncertainty Calibration:** Compare high-accuracy models specifically on the "Diagnostic Uncertainty" (DU) dimension to identify safety risks in high-stakes scenarios.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the integration of raw multi-modal data (e.g., medical imaging) into the ClinDEF environment significantly alter the diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality scores of LLMs compared to the current text-based simulation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix A1 states that the evaluation is conducted in a purely text-based environment which "abstracts away the critical multi-modal aspects of diagnosis," and suggests future work should explore integrating multi-modal data.
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies solely on textual descriptions of symptoms and test results, leaving the model's ability to process visual or raw signal clinical data untested within this dynamic interaction loop.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study where Doctor Agents are fed raw image files (e.g., X-rays) by the Examiner Agent rather than text summaries, comparing the resulting Diagnostic Quality Scores (DQS) and accuracy against the text-only baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can specific training interventions or architectural modifications improve LLMs' performance on the Diagnostic Uncertainty (DU) dimension, which currently shows a universal ceiling effect (scores < 4/10) even in state-of-the-art models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4 highlights a "striking insufficiency" in acknowledging Diagnostic Uncertainty across all models, noting that reliable clinical models must be designed to reason explicitly about what is unknown.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a critical safety deficiency but does not propose or test methods (e.g., specific reinforcement learning schemes or calibration layers) to fix the overconfidence and lack of ambiguity management.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment fine-tuning a model on a dataset explicitly rich in "watchful waiting" or provisional diagnosis labels, then re-evaluating it on ClinDEF to see if DU scores increase without compromising Diagnostic Correctness (DC).

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the complexity of the generated patient case profile (e.g., number of comorbidities or symptom ambiguity) impact the observed trade-off between diagnostic efficiency (turn count) and diagnostic quality?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Appendix A1 notes that synthetic cases "cannot fully replicate the complexity and unpredictability of real-world clinical scenarios," and Section 4.3 analyzes the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, suggesting this dynamic may shift under more complex conditions not fully tested.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments use standardized case generation, but the specific correlation between case difficulty/ambiguity and the efficiency/quality trade-off remains unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled ablation study generating cases with varying levels of induced complexity (e.g., conflicting symptoms vs. classic presentations) and plotting the resulting changes in Total Dialogue Turns versus Diagnostic Quality Scores.

## Limitations
- The framework relies on proprietary models (GPT-5 for agents, GPT-5.1/Grok-4.1 for judging) that are not publicly accessible, creating significant reproducibility barriers.
- Knowledge graph and encyclopedia sources are not explicitly named, making exact replication of disease distribution impossible.
- The framework abstracts away visual diagnostic reasoning by using text-only radiology descriptions rather than actual medical images.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core architectural claims about dynamic case generation preventing data contamination and multi-dimensional rubric exposing reasoning gaps are well-supported by validation results.
- **Medium Confidence:** Diagnostic accuracy comparisons between models are reliable within framework constraints but may not generalize to real-world clinical settings.
- **Low Confidence:** "LLM-as-a-Judge" validation scores may be influenced by systematic biases in judge models that weren't fully explored.

## Next Checks
1. **Judge Model Robustness Test:** Run the same evaluation with alternative judge models (Claude-3.5, Gemini-1.5-Pro) to verify that dimension scores remain stable and aren't artifacts of specific judge model preferences.

2. **Hallucination Vulnerability Assessment:** Intentionally corrupt the Patient/Examiner agents with controlled hallucination prompts to quantify how much information leakage would be required to break the evaluation's causal validity.

3. **Real-World Transfer Validation:** Test the top-performing models on a small set of real clinical cases (anonymized EHR data) to assess whether framework-identified gaps in information gathering and uncertainty management persist outside the synthetic environment.
