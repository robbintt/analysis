# EvoMU: Evolutionary Machine Unlearning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2602.02139
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02139
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: EvoMU achieves state-of-the-art forgetting-utility trade-offs on TOFU-5%, TOFU-10%, MUSE, and WMDP benchmarks using a small 4B parameter LLM to automatically discover task-specific unlearning loss functions.

## Executive Summary
EvoMU introduces an evolutionary search framework that automatically discovers effective unlearning loss functions for large language models. The method uses a small 4B-parameter LLM (Qwen3-4B-Thinking) as a co-scientist to propose and iteratively refine executable loss functions through an evolutionary loop. Each candidate loss is evaluated using standardized forgetting and utility metrics with LoRA fine-tuning. Across multiple benchmarks, EvoMU synthesizes novel losses that outperform established human-designed baselines by adapting loss geometry to the specific structure of forget/retain data.

## Method Summary
EvoMU employs an evolutionary search over loss function space, where a small LLM proposes candidate losses as executable PyTorch code. Each candidate is trained via LoRA fine-tuning on forget/retain data splits, then evaluated using standardized metrics. The evolutionary loop selects top-performing losses based on a weighted combination of forgetting and utility scores, mutates these candidates, and iterates. The approach adapts loss design to specific benchmark characteristics rather than relying on universal losses, with the 4B LLM proposer generating increasingly sophisticated losses through feedback-driven refinement.

## Key Results
- EvoMU achieves state-of-the-art Model Utility (MU) scores across TOFU-5%, TOFU-10%, MUSE News, MUSE Books, and WMDP benchmarks
- Discovered losses are specifically adapted to each benchmark's forget/retain data structure, with TOFU-5% losses transferring poorly to MUSE datasets
- The approach demonstrates that small 4B models can effectively discover novel, high-performing unlearning losses, challenging the assumption that only large models can drive scientific discovery
- EvoMU-discovered losses show superior resistance to relearning compared to baseline approaches like SimNPO and NPO

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Evolutionary Search Over Well-Specified Loss Space
The evolutionary search can discover effective unlearning losses because the problem has a large but structured search space with automatic, reproducible evaluation. An LLM proposer generates candidate loss functions as executable PyTorch code; each candidate is trained via LoRA, evaluated on standardized forgetting/utility metrics, and top-K candidates are mutated based on feedback (loss code, training curves, evaluation scores). Selection score s(L) = 0.5·Utility + 0.5·Forget guides survival.

### Mechanism 2: Task-Specific Loss Geometry Adaptation
Optimal unlearning losses vary with forget/retain data structure; discovered losses adapt to benchmark-specific failure modes. The evolutionary loop receives full evaluation metrics per candidate, allowing the LLM mutator to adjust forget pressure vs. retain protection. Different benchmarks yield qualitatively different losses: TOFU-5% uses reference-anchored asymmetric deltas; TOFU-10% uses exponentiated deltas for adaptive reweighting; MUSE News uses capped relative ranking; MUSE Books adds a hinge barrier for retain protection.

### Mechanism 3: Small LLM as Effective Co-Scientist
A 4B-parameter open model can synthesize novel, effective unlearning losses when paired with evolutionary search. Qwen3-4B-Thinking uses a thinking scratchpad (higher temperature) for exploration and structured output (lower temperature) for code generation. The paper repairs common errors and filters non-executable candidates.

## Foundational Learning

- **Machine unlearning as fine-tuning with specialized losses**: Understanding the basic formulation (forget loss + retain regularization) is prerequisite to interpreting discovered losses. Quick check: Given a forget set D_f and retain set D_r, what does a gradient-ascent unlearning loss optimize for?

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning**: Each candidate loss is trained via LoRA (rank=8, α=16), keeping base model frozen; this enables efficient evaluation of many candidates. Quick check: Why might LoRA be preferred over full fine-tuning when evaluating dozens of candidate losses?

- **Preference optimization losses (DPO/NPO/SimNPO)**: These are the primary baselines EvoMU outperforms; understanding their structure (contrastive log-probability comparisons, reference model dependence) clarifies what the discovered losses do differently. Quick check: In NPO, what role does the reference model play, and how does SimNPO simplify this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LLM Proposer/Mutator (Qwen3-4B-Thinking) -> Training Loop (LoRA fine-tuning) -> Evaluator (Open-Unlearning metrics) -> Selector (s(L) computation)

- **Critical path**: Define forget/retain splits and precompute reference log-probabilities -> Configure LLM proposer prompt with correct signature -> Run evolutionary loop (10→5→25→3→30 candidates) -> Select best loss by selection score, train final model

- **Design tradeoffs**: Population size vs. compute (65 candidates × ~10-20 hours each); Thinking tokens (512 often sufficient vs. 2048-4096 for modest gains); Epoch proposal (LLM-set epochs act as early stopping vs. fixed 10 epochs over-unlearning)

- **Failure signatures**: Non-sensical losses (filtered by selection but waste compute); Benchmark overfitting (TOFU-5% loss transfers poorly to MUSE); Relearning vulnerability (SimNPO/NPO lose forgetting rapidly under re-fine-tuning)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce TOFU-5% results with N=10 initial candidates, 2 evolutionary rounds, fixed seed; 2) Ablate evolutionary search: sample N=50 random losses without mutation; 3) Test cross-benchmark transfer: apply TOFU-5% discovered loss to MUSE News without modification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
**Can the evolutionary search be modified to discover a single "universal" unlearning loss that generalizes across diverse data structures, rather than synthesizing dataset-specific objectives?** The paper states "There might not even exist a universally optimal loss function" and shows poor cross-benchmark transfer. Running evolution on a multi-task fitness function could reveal if a robust single loss emerges.

### Open Question 2
**Does the success of evolutionary loss discovery scale to domains with less verifiable or noisier evaluation metrics, such as RLHF?** While unlearning provides clear automated metrics, it's unclear if the 4B proposer can navigate subjective alignment tasks where "utility" is harder to verify automatically. Applying EvoMU to toxicity reduction could test this.

### Open Question 3
**To what extent are the EvoMU-discovered losses optimizing for the specific quirks of the evaluation benchmarks rather than robust data removal?** The Impact Statement warns benchmark-driven optimization can give misleading confidence if metrics don't capture real deployment threat models. Testing against held-out adversarial attacks could reveal Goodhart's Law effects.

## Limitations
- Benchmark metrics may not correlate with real-world unlearning effectiveness, potentially leading to overfitting to evaluation artifacts
- Limited evidence that small 4B models can reliably generate complex loss functions beyond the constrained log-probability space
- Cross-benchmark transfer failures suggest limited generalizability of discovered losses

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Task-specific loss geometry adaptation within benchmarks, Pareto frontier improvements over baselines, evolutionary search as effective search algorithm
- **Medium confidence**: Evolutionary search discovering genuinely novel losses (vs. hyperparameter optimization), small LLM as effective co-scientist, metric correlation with real-world unlearning
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability beyond benchmark contexts, scalability to more complex loss functions, robustness to different base model architectures

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world forgetting validation**: Test discovered losses on actual privacy-sensitive data removal scenarios (e.g., personally identifiable information) rather than benchmark proxies, measuring both forgetting completeness and utility retention.

2. **Transfer robustness testing**: Evaluate whether TOFU-5% discovered losses maintain superiority when applied to TOFU-10% and MUSE benchmarks from different initial seeds and model checkpoints, quantifying variance in performance.

3. **Complexity scalability**: Attempt to evolve losses requiring gradient information or hidden-state access, measuring the 4B LLM proposer's success rate and quality of generated candidates compared to the restricted log-probability space.
