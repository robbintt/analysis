# Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.03699
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699
- **Reference count**: 39
- **Primary result**: Novel method for automating virtual instruction generation in VR using LLMs for assembly tasks, demonstrated with pneumatic cylinder assembly

## Executive Summary
Text2VR presents a novel approach for automating virtual instruction generation in VR using large language models (LLMs) for assembly tasks. The system addresses the significant challenge of developing VR training applications, which traditionally require extensive time and expertise. By leveraging LLMs to extract task-relevant information from textual assembly instructions and an intelligent module to generate visual instructions through object highlighting and animations in Unity, Text2VR streamlines VR content creation. The method enhances training effectiveness by providing intuitive, real-time guidance, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to industrial needs.

## Method Summary
The Text2VR system employs a two-module architecture: an LLM module and an Intelligent Module. The LLM module processes textual assembly instructions to extract relevant information, while the Intelligent Module generates visual instructions through object highlighting and animations in a Unity-based VR environment. The system was evaluated using a pneumatic cylinder assembly task, demonstrating effective generation of visual instructions that guide users through each assembly step. The approach streamlines VR content creation by automating the traditionally manual process of developing training applications, making it more scalable for industrial applications.

## Key Results
- Successfully automated generation of VR assembly instructions using LLM-extracted information
- Effective visual instruction generation through object highlighting and animations in Unity
- Demonstrated feasibility for single assembly task (pneumatic cylinder) with intuitive real-time guidance
- Streamlined VR content creation process, reducing traditional development time and expertise requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding capabilities to parse assembly instructions and extract component relationships and assembly sequences. This extracted information is then processed by an intelligent module that maps components to existing CAD models and generates appropriate visual cues. The approach automates what would traditionally be a manual process of creating VR training content, significantly reducing development time while maintaining instruction quality through systematic processing of source materials.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM Instruction Parsing**: Extracting assembly sequences and component relationships from text - needed to automate information extraction from written manuals; quick check: verify parsed sequences match human interpretation of assembly steps
- **Component Mapping**: Matching extracted component names to CAD models in Unity database - critical for visual instruction generation; quick check: test with known assembly components and verify successful mapping
- **Animation Generation**: Creating object highlighting and movement animations to represent assembly steps - provides intuitive visual guidance; quick check: validate animations correctly represent assembly sequences
- **VR Instruction Design**: Translating assembly information into effective visual cues for training - essential for pedagogical effectiveness; quick check: ensure instructions are clear and follow logical assembly progression

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Text2VR Architecture: [Textual Assembly Instructions] -> [LLM Module] -> [Intelligent Module] -> [Unity VR Environment] -> [Visual Instructions]

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows from textual instructions through LLM extraction to intelligent processing and finally to VR visualization. The LLM module must accurately parse component relationships, which the Intelligent Module then translates into actionable visual instructions. The Unity environment serves as the rendering platform where these instructions are presented to users.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The system trades computational overhead of real-time LLM processing against manual instruction creation. While LLMs provide flexibility in handling various instruction formats, they introduce potential errors in component identification and assembly sequence interpretation. The Unity-based implementation provides robust visualization but requires pre-existing CAD models for components.

**Failure Signatures:**
System failures manifest as incorrect component highlighting, missing assembly steps, or inaccurate animations. LLM hallucinations or poor instruction quality can lead to impossible assembly sequences. Database mismatches between extracted components and available CAD models result in instruction generation failures.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Test LLM module with varied instruction quality to assess robustness to ambiguous or poorly written assembly manuals
2. Validate component mapping accuracy by comparing extracted components against Unity database for multiple assembly tasks
3. Evaluate animation generation by comparing generated movements against actual assembly requirements for complex multi-axis operations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Text2VR system impact training efficacy, specifically in terms of task completion time and error rates, compared to traditional expert-led or manual-based training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly states, "In the future, we plan to evaluate the proposed method through a user study to analyze the effectiveness of the generated instructions."
- Why unresolved: The current study validated the technical feasibility of generating instructions via LLMs, but it did not assess the pedagogical value or learning outcomes for human users.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative results from a controlled user study measuring user performance and cognitive load when using the generated VR instructions versus baseline methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust is the instruction generation pipeline when the LLM extracts components that do not exist in the pre-defined Unity database?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The method relies on the Intelligent Module finding exact name matches in the database (Algorithm 1: `if Ai == a`), but lacks a described fallback mechanism for handling LLM hallucinations or novel components.
- Why unresolved: The system assumes a closed world where the LLM output perfectly maps to existing CAD models, which is a significant assumption in LLM integration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of system behavior using out-of-domain assembly manuals to test failure modes and error handling capabilities.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the current animation logic accurately represent complex assembly constraints, such as rotational torque or specific insertion angles, beyond simple linear translations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes animation generation simplistically as "moving the successor component relative to the precedence component," which may not capture complex kinematic relationships.
- Why unresolved: Industrial assembly tasks often require complex tool movements (e.g., screwing) that simple translation animations might fail to convey accurately.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the visual fidelity and accuracy of generated animations for complex, multi-axis assembly operations.

## Limitations
- Single assembly task evaluation (pneumatic cylinder) limits generalizability across diverse industrial applications
- Lack of quantitative performance metrics for instruction quality and user comprehension
- System dependency on textual instruction quality, potentially propagating ambiguities from source materials
- Underspecified LLM configuration and Unity implementation details hindering reproducibility

## Confidence
- **Medium**: Core methodology for LLM-based instruction extraction and VR visualization pipeline
- **Medium**: Demonstration of functional system for single assembly task
- **Low**: Claims about scalability and adaptability to industrial needs without broader validation
- **Low**: Effectiveness assertions lacking comparative or quantitative performance data

## Next Checks
1. **Multi-task Generalization**: Evaluate Text2VR across 10+ diverse assembly tasks with varying complexity, component types, and instruction styles to assess robustness and identify failure modes.
2. **Comparative Performance Testing**: Conduct controlled user studies comparing Text2VR-generated instructions against traditional VR training methods, measuring task completion time, error rates, and knowledge retention across multiple participant groups.
3. **Instruction Quality Metrics**: Develop and apply standardized evaluation frameworks for assessing instruction clarity, completeness, and usability, including automated validation against assembly blueprints and expert review panels.
