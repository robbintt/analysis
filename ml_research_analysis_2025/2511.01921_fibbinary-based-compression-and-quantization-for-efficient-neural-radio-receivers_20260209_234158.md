# Fibbinary-Based Compression and Quantization for Efficient Neural Radio Receivers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.01921
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01921
- **Reference count:** 8
- **Key outcome:** Achieves 45% power savings, 44% area reduction, and 63.4% memory footprint reduction in neural receivers for 6G systems while maintaining superior performance over conventional receivers.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational and memory challenges of deploying neural radio receivers in 6G wireless systems on resource-constrained hardware. The authors propose an aggressive Fibonacci Codeword Quantization (FCQ) scheme combined with Incremental Network Quantization (INQ) to compress and quantize network weights while maintaining performance. They also introduce two lossless compression algorithms—word-length compression based on Zeckendorf's theorem and word-count compression—that exploit the redundancy in FCQ-encoded weights. The approach yields significant hardware efficiency gains while outperforming traditional receivers in accuracy and robustness.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines Fibonacci Codeword Quantization with incremental network quantization to aggressively compress neural receiver weights. The FCQ encoding uses Zeckendorf's theorem to represent weights as sums of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers, enabling compact binary representations. The INQ strategy progressively quantizes network tensors in groups, retraining after each step to recover accuracy. Two lossless compression stages are applied sequentially: first compressing word lengths using Zeckendorf representation patterns, then compressing word counts by exploiting redundancy in FCQ-encoded weights. This multi-stage compression pipeline is designed to minimize memory footprint while preserving the neural receiver's performance advantages over conventional approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves 45% power savings and 44% area reduction in multipliers
- Reduces memory footprint by 63.4% through combined compression techniques
- Maintains superior performance compared to conventional radio receivers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by exploiting the mathematical properties of Fibonacci sequences and the redundancy patterns in neural network weights. Fibonacci Codeword Quantization maps weights to sums of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers, creating compact binary representations with inherent redundancy. The incremental quantization strategy allows the network to adapt gradually, preventing catastrophic accuracy loss. Word-length compression leverages the fixed patterns in Zeckendorf representations, while word-count compression exploits the statistical redundancy in FCQ-encoded weights. This multi-stage approach targets different aspects of compression—numerical representation, quantization granularity, and statistical redundancy—achieving synergistic improvements in hardware efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- **Fibonacci Codeword Quantization (FCQ)**: Maps network weights to sums of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers; needed for creating compact, redundant-free binary representations of weights.
- **Zeckendorf's Theorem**: States every positive integer can be uniquely represented as sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers; forms the mathematical basis for FCQ encoding.
- **Incremental Network Quantization (INQ)**: Progressive quantization strategy that groups and quantizes network tensors while retraining; needed to prevent accuracy collapse during aggressive compression.
- **Lossless compression stages**: Word-length compression exploits fixed Zeckendorf patterns; word-count compression targets statistical redundancy; both needed to maximize memory reduction without information loss.
- **Neural radio receivers**: Deep learning models that directly process wireless signals; needed as the target application for compression and quantization.
- **6G wireless systems**: Next-generation communication networks requiring efficient neural processing; needed as the deployment context with strict hardware constraints.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Signal -> Neural Receiver -> FCQ Encoding -> INQ Quantization -> Word-Length Compression -> Word-Count Compression -> Hardware Implementation

**Critical Path:** Signal processing through neural network layers is the computational bottleneck; FCQ and INQ modifications add minimal overhead while compression occurs post-training.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Aggressive quantization reduces precision but enables hardware efficiency; multi-stage compression maximizes memory savings but adds complexity; incremental approach preserves accuracy but extends training time.

**Failure Signatures:** Accuracy degradation indicates quantization thresholds are too aggressive; compression inefficiency suggests weight distributions don't match assumptions; hardware savings fall short when theoretical models don't match implementation constraints.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Apply FCQ to a small neural receiver and measure accuracy impact versus conventional quantization
2. Test word-length compression on static weight patterns to verify Zeckendorf-based savings
3. Implement INQ with varying group sizes to find optimal tradeoff between accuracy and compression

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Compression efficiency may degrade under dynamic channel conditions or dataset shifts
- Hardware savings are theoretical and unverified through actual silicon implementation
- Performance comparison limited to specific 6G channel models without broader wireless standard validation

## Confidence
| Claim | Confidence |

| 63.4% memory reduction | Medium |
| Superior performance vs conventional receivers | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test the full compression pipeline under channel variations and adversarial conditions to assess robustness
2. Implement the optimized network on FPGA or ASIC and measure actual power, area, and latency versus predictions
3. Compare against other state-of-the-art model compression techniques on identical hardware and channel settings to isolate the benefit of the FCQ/INQ combination
