# Greener Deep Reinforcement Learning: Analysis of Energy and Carbon Efficiency Across Atari Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.05273
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05273
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ARS algorithm achieved 24% lower energy consumption and 68% lower CO₂ emissions compared to DQN and RecurrentPPO respectively

## Executive Summary
This study systematically benchmarks seven deep reinforcement learning algorithms across ten Atari 2600 games, measuring energy consumption, carbon emissions, and electricity costs during one million training steps per game. The research demonstrates substantial variation in efficiency between algorithms, with ARS consuming up to 24% less energy than DQN and emitting nearly 68% less CO₂ than RecurrentPPO. The Normalized Performance per Kilowatt Hour (NPpkWh) metric reveals ARS as the most efficient algorithm at 0.08142, nearly 4.5× more efficient than the least efficient algorithm. These findings highlight the critical importance of algorithm selection for reducing energy consumption and environmental impact in RL training, particularly for large-scale deployments.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated seven deep reinforcement learning algorithms (ARS, PPO, A2C, A3C, DQN, Double DQN, RecurrentPPO) across ten Atari games using a fixed hardware configuration (Tesla P100 GPU). Each algorithm-game combination was trained for one million steps, with energy consumption measured using nvidia-smi and carbon emissions calculated based on average grid emission factors. The Normalized Performance per Kilowatt Hour (NPpkWh) metric was introduced to normalize efficiency across games of varying difficulty. The experiments maintained consistent hyperparameters and training durations to enable fair comparisons between algorithms.

## Key Results
- ARS achieved the highest NPpkWh efficiency at 0.08142, representing a 4.5× improvement over the least efficient algorithm
- ARS consumed 24% less energy than DQN and 18% less than PPO across all tested games
- ARS emitted 68% less CO₂ than RecurrentPPO and 54% less than Double DQN
- Electricity cost savings of up to 68% were observed when using ARS versus RecurrentPPO

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **Energy measurement in GPU systems**: Required to quantify the environmental impact of training; quick check: verify nvidia-smi power readings against system-level measurements
- **Carbon accounting methodologies**: Needed to translate energy consumption into environmental impact; quick check: compare regional grid emission factors across different geographic locations
- **Reinforcement learning algorithm architectures**: Essential for understanding why certain algorithms are more efficient; quick check: map the computational complexity of each algorithm's update rule
- **Normalization metrics for cross-game comparison**: Critical for fair efficiency comparisons; quick check: validate NPpkWh scaling against baseline human performance scores

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** GPU hardware -> Training environment -> RL algorithm -> Performance metrics -> Energy monitoring -> Carbon calculations
- **Critical path:** Algorithm execution → GPU power draw → Energy accumulation → Performance evaluation → Efficiency calculation
- **Design tradeoffs:** Fixed training steps vs. convergence quality; single GPU vs. distributed training; average vs. real-time carbon factors
- **Failure signatures:** Inconsistent energy readings (check monitoring setup), algorithm instability (verify hyperparameters), normalization errors (validate scaling factors)
- **First experiments:** 1) Replicate energy measurements on same hardware, 2) Test algorithm efficiency on different GPU architectures, 3) Calculate regional carbon variations using location-specific emission factors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single hardware configuration (Tesla P100 GPU) limits generalizability across different architectures
- Fixed one million step training duration may not capture full convergence behavior for all algorithms
- Average grid emission factors may not accurately represent actual energy mix used during training
- Embodied carbon in hardware manufacturing not accounted for in environmental impact calculations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Relative ranking of algorithms (ARS > PPO > DQN > others) within tested configuration
- **Medium Confidence:** Absolute energy consumption values and cost estimates across different hardware
- **Medium Confidence:** NPpkWh metric effectiveness for cross-game efficiency comparison

## Next Checks
1. **Hardware Diversity Test:** Replicate experiments on RTX 3090, A100 GPUs, and CPU-only implementations to assess hardware dependency
2. **Dynamic Training Analysis:** Track energy efficiency across full training curves rather than fixed step counts to identify efficiency peaks
3. **Regional Carbon Accounting:** Calculate emissions using location-specific grid factors for major data center regions (US West, EU, Asia)
