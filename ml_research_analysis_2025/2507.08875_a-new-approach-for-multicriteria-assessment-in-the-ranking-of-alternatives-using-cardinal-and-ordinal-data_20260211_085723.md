# A New Approach for Multicriteria Assessment in the Ranking of Alternatives Using Cardinal and Ordinal Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.08875
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08875
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Novel two-stage Virtual Gap Analysis method for ranking DMUs using mixed cardinal and ordinal data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-criteria assessment when decision-making units (DMUs) are evaluated using both cardinal (quantitative) and ordinal (qualitative Likert scale) data. Existing methods like DEA, SFA, and MCDM face limitations due to assumptions, subjective judgments, and difficulties handling ordinal data. The authors propose a novel MCA approach that integrates two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models—one for identifying top-tier DMUs and another for selecting the best DMU among them. The method uses linear programming-based models without additional assumptions and verifies duality properties through strong complementary slackness conditions. It effectively handles heterogeneity among DMUs and incorporates both quantitative and qualitative criteria. The approach was validated using two numerical examples, demonstrating accurate and transparent evaluations.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a two-stage Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) approach for multi-criteria assessment. Stage I (obPT) identifies top-tier DMUs by minimizing total virtual gap using a linear programming model that handles both cardinal and ordinal data through adjustment ratios and intensity variables. Stage II (osPT) selects the best DMU from the top-tier group by minimizing super-virtual gap. The method incorporates strong complementary slackness conditions to verify duality properties and ensure reliable solutions. A unified goal price ensures comparability across metrics, and the approach handles heterogeneity among DMUs while maintaining transparency through 2D visualization.

## Key Results
- Novel two-stage VGA approach successfully ranks DMUs using mixed cardinal and ordinal data
- Method achieves accurate and transparent evaluations without additional assumptions
- Verified duality properties through strong complementary slackness conditions
- Demonstrated reliability through 2D visualization and two numerical examples
- Unified goal price ensures metric comparability across different evaluation criteria

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by decomposing the complex MCA problem into two manageable LP stages. Stage I identifies units with zero virtual gap (top-tier), while Stage II ranks these units through super-virtual gap minimization. The strong complementary slackness verification ensures solution reliability, and the unified goal price normalizes disparate metrics for meaningful comparison.

## Foundational Learning
- **Virtual Gap Analysis**: Measures the distance between observed performance and optimal reference set performance - needed to quantify inefficiency in MCA
- **Strong Complementary Slackness**: Verifies primal-dual optimality conditions - needed to ensure LP solutions are reliable and meaningful
- **Likert Scale Integration**: Maps qualitative ordinal data to LP constraints - needed to handle mixed cardinal-ordinal assessment systematically
- **Two-Stage Decomposition**: Separates identification from ranking tasks - needed to reduce computational complexity and improve interpretability
- **Goal Price Unification**: Normalizes different metrics to comparable scales - needed to enable fair cross-metric evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Matrix -> obPT LP (Stage I) -> Top-Tier Set -> osPT LP (Stage II) -> Best DMU

**Critical Path**: The dual LP formulations (Eq. 1-6 for obPT, Eq. 32-37 for osPT) represent the computational core, with strong complementary slackness verification as the reliability checkpoint.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method sacrifices computational efficiency for interpretability and reliability, using two LP stages instead of a single monolithic model. This enables transparent verification but increases solution time.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Infeasibility indicates ordinal constraints conflict with slack variables
- Non-comparable gaps suggest missing goal price normalization
- All units appearing top-tier signals overly loose constraints

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test obPT LP on small dataset with known ordinal extremes
2. Verify SCSC conditions hold for returned LP solutions
3. Compare normalized vs raw gap values across multiple DMUs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- SCSC verification challenging with standard LP solvers that don't guarantee strict complementarity
- Two-step normalization procedure inadequately specified - unclear if requires LP re-solving
- Potential infeasibility when ordinal values sit at Likert scale boundaries

## Confidence
| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Mathematical rigor of LP formulations | High |
| Effectiveness of two-stage approach | Medium |
| SCSC verification reliability | Low |
| Normalization procedure clarity | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Implement obPT LP with interior-point solver and verify SCSC conditions hold for returned solutions
2. Test normalization step by comparing raw vs normalized gaps across multiple DMU datasets
3. Validate ordinal constraint logic using edge cases where ordinal values sit at Likert scale boundaries
