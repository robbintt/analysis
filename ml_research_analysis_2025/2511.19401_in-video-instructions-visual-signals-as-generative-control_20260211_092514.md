core_contribution: This paper proposes In-Video Instruction, a paradigm that embeds
  visual signals (such as text, arrows, or trajectories) directly into video frames
  to control image-to-video generation. Unlike conventional text prompts, which provide
  coarse global descriptions, In-Video Instruction offers explicit, spatially grounded,
  and unambiguous guidance by assigning distinct instructions to specific objects

# In-Video Instructions: Visual Signals as Generative Control

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.19401
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19401
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Embeds visual signals (text, arrows, trajectories) in video frames to control image-to-video generation with explicit spatial grounding.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces In-Video Instruction, a novel paradigm for fine-grained video generation control by embedding visual signals directly into video frames. Unlike conventional text prompts, this method provides explicit, spatially grounded, and unambiguous guidance by assigning distinct instructions to specific objects or regions. Validated on three state-of-the-art models—Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2—the approach demonstrates reliable interpretation and execution of visual instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios. The method offers a flexible, interpretable, and training-free interface for fine-grained video generation control.

## Method Summary
In-Video Instruction embeds visual signals—such as text, arrows, or trajectories—directly into video frames to guide image-to-video generation. Unlike text prompts, which provide coarse global descriptions, these visual signals offer explicit, spatially grounded, and unambiguous guidance by assigning distinct instructions to specific objects or regions. The method is validated on three state-of-the-art video generative models (Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, Wan 2.2) and excels at tasks requiring spatial localization, object-specific motion control, and sequential or parallel multi-object behaviors. The approach is training-free and leverages the model's ability to interpret embedded visual instructions without additional fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Visual instructions embedded in frames are reliably interpreted by state-of-the-art video models, especially for multi-object and spatially complex tasks.
- The method achieves higher success rates in complex multi-object, multi-instruction settings compared to text-only prompts.
- In-Video Instruction enables fine-grained control over object motion, appearance, and behavior via spatially localized guidance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
In-Video Instruction provides a more precise, spatially grounded, and unambiguous form of control than text prompts. By embedding visual signals directly into video frames, the model can directly associate instructions with specific objects or regions, avoiding the ambiguity inherent in global text descriptions. This allows for explicit localization, multi-step instruction execution, and fine-grained manipulation of object motion and appearance. The method leverages the model's ability to interpret visual cues, offering a training-free, interpretable interface for controlling video generation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spatial grounding**: Why needed—ensures instructions are unambiguously associated with specific objects or regions; Quick check—visual inspection of instruction-object alignment in generated frames.
- **Multi-object control**: Why needed—enables simultaneous manipulation of multiple objects; Quick check—success rate in multi-object instruction scenarios.
- **Visual cue interpretation**: Why needed—allows models to process embedded text/arrows as actionable commands; Quick check—quantitative success rate of instruction execution.
- **Training-free control**: Why needed—avoids costly fine-tuning; Quick check—compatibility with multiple off-the-shelf models.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input image/video frame → Embedded visual instructions (text/arrows/trajectories) → Video generation model (Veo 3.1/Kling 2.5/Wan 2.2) → Generated video with instruction-following behaviors
- **Critical path**: The embedding of visual instructions directly into frames is the core innovation; the model's interpretation of these cues is the critical mechanism.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Training-free and interpretable, but relies on manual overlay of instructions and may leave artifacts; flexible but not tested for generalization beyond curated examples.
- **Failure signatures**: Instructions not followed, object mislocalization, persistent visual artifacts, or model confusion in complex scenes.
- **First experiments**: (1) Single-object instruction following (e.g., make a car move left); (2) Multi-object parallel instructions (e.g., move two objects in opposite directions); (3) Sequential instructions (e.g., move object A, then object B).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can video models interpret inherent visual signals (e.g., traffic lights or signboards) in real-world videos as generative instructions, rather than relying on manually overlaid annotations?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The limitations section states, "understanding whether models can interpret and react to these natural signals remains an interesting direction for future research."
- **Why unresolved**: The study exclusively validates manually constructed instructions and does not test the model's ability to parse pre-existing visual semantics as actionable commands.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluations on uncurated datasets where the model must generate future frames based on the logical consequences of existing scene text or symbols.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can the evaluation of In-Video Instructions be systematized to provide rigorous quantitative metrics beyond qualitative visual inspection?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that their "analysis remains largely qualitative, underscoring the need for more systematic assessment in future work."
- **Why unresolved**: Current results rely heavily on human assessment and visual demos, lacking a standardized benchmark for measuring instruction adherence.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: The development and application of a comprehensive benchmark suite that automatically quantifies spatial alignment and instruction execution accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can extending the accompanying text prompt explicitly instruct the model to suppress or remove visible instruction artifacts (overlaid text/arrows) during generation?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 5 notes that visual markers persist and suggests that "Extending the text prompt to explicitly remove visible annotations may therefore further improve the results."
- **Why unresolved**: The current method leaves artifacts in frames or relies on post-processing; the utility of prompt-based in-situ removal is hypothesized but untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Ablation studies comparing standard prompts against prompts containing negative constraints (e.g., "remove text") to measure artifact reduction.

## Limitations
- Evidence is largely qualitative, with limited statistical validation and no systematic benchmark for instruction adherence.
- The method is only validated on three commercial models, with unclear generalizability to other or open-source models.
- Visual artifacts from embedded instructions may persist, and their removal via prompts is hypothesized but untested.

## Confidence
- **Central claim** (visual instructions provide more precise control than text prompts): **Medium**—compelling qualitative results but limited quantitative rigor and statistical validation.
- **Generalizability** (method works across diverse models and scenarios): **Low**—only three models tested, no robustness studies.
- **Training-free nature** (no model fine-tuning required): **High**—method is explicitly described and demonstrated as training-free.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale, statistically powered user study comparing In-Video Instruction to optimized text prompts across diverse object types, scenes, and instruction complexities, including significance testing.
2. Test the method on a broader set of video generation models (including open-source and academic models) to assess generalizability and robustness.
3. Perform ablation studies and controlled experiments to isolate the contribution of embedded visual instructions from other factors (e.g., prompt phrasing, model bias, scene context).
