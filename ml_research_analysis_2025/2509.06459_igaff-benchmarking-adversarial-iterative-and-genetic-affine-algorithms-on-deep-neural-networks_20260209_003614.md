# IGAff: Benchmarking Adversarial Iterative and Genetic Affine Algorithms on Deep Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.06459
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06459
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ATA and AGA achieve up to 8.82% accuracy improvement over existing techniques, with AGA showing 40-64% attack success rate

## Executive Summary
This paper benchmarks two novel black-box adversarial algorithms - Affine Transformation Attack (ATA) and Affine Genetic Attack (AGA) - based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms across multiple vision architectures and datasets. The methods demonstrate strong attack performance in both global and targeted scenarios, with AGA consistently outperforming ATA. Vision Transformers show higher vulnerability to undefended attacks but benefit greatly from adversarial training, while AGA's effectiveness is tied to iteration count, mutation rate, and noise intensity.

## Method Summary
The paper benchmarks ATA (iterative algorithm maximizing attack score using random affine transformations) and AGA (genetic algorithm optimizing perturbations through mutation, crossover, and selection) on image classification tasks. Both operate in black-box settings without gradient access. ATA applies bounded affine transformations (rotation ±3°, translation ±0.05, scale 0.95-1.05, shear ±1°) and selects based on attack score. AGA maintains a population, applies mutation (affine + noise with probability p_m) and crossover (row swapping with probability p_c), then selects highest-scoring individuals. Models include ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and ViT, trained for 12 epochs with Adam optimizer.

## Key Results
- AGA achieves 40-64% attack success rate across datasets, outperforming ATA's 12-18%
- Vision Transformers are more vulnerable to undefended attacks but benefit greatly from adversarial training
- Targeted attacks improve model performance on specific classes, especially for DenseNet and Swin Transformer architectures
- Mutation probability shows peak effectiveness at 100%, while crossover probability shows minimum sensitivity with high variance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Affine Transformations
Affine transformations with bounded parameters generate adversarial examples by exploring local geometric variations that remain within input distribution but cross decision boundaries. Random sampling of rotation (±3°), translation (±0.05), scaling (0.95-1.05), and shearing (±1°) creates perturbations while the attack score function f_attack maps cross-entropy loss to a selection criterion.

### Mechanism 2: Genetic Algorithm Operators
Genetic algorithm operators (mutation, crossover, selection) improve adversarial search efficiency by combining successful perturbation patterns across generations. AGA initializes a population of candidate images, applies mutation and crossover, then selects the highest-scoring individual to repopulate, with iterations compounding noise accumulation and geometric distortion.

### Mechanism 3: Vision Transformer Vulnerability
Vision Transformers exhibit higher vulnerability to undefended adversarial attacks but gain disproportionate robustness from adversarial training compared to CNNs. ViTs rely less on high-frequency features and more on patch-level attention, making them susceptible to global perturbations that can be regularized through exposure during adversarial training.

## Foundational Learning

- **Black-box adversarial attacks**: Both ATA and AGA operate without access to model gradients or weights, relying only on query outputs (loss/accuracy). Why needed: The entire attack methodology assumes black-box access.
- **Genetic algorithm fundamentals**: AGA's performance hinges on understanding how evolutionary operators balance exploration vs exploitation. Quick check: What happens to population diversity if mutation probability is too low across many generations?
- **Affine transformations in image space**: The paper's attack vocabulary consists entirely of rotation, translation, scaling, and shearing. Quick check: Why does the paper bound rotation to ±3° rather than allowing larger angles?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Batch → [ATA: Single-pass affine sampling + selection] → Adversarial Output
             → [AGA: Population init → Mutation → Crossover → Selection loop] → Adversarial Output
  Both feed into: Model forward pass → Loss computation → f_attack scoring

- **Critical path**: The attack score function (Eq. 2) converts model loss to a bounded selection criterion. For targeted attacks, L_c replaces L to minimize loss against a specific class.

- **Design tradeoffs**: ATA offers lower attack success (12-18% SR) but more stability, suitable for data augmentation where perturbation quality matters. AGA provides higher attack success (40-64% SR) but requires more compute and memory for population storage.

- **Failure signatures**: Low SR despite high iteration count suggests checking mutation rate and noise intensity; visible artifacts indicate excessive parameters; defense failures suggest training augmentation may not match attack distribution.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run ATA on Tiny-ImageNet-200 with ViT using default parameters to verify SR matches reported ~4.94% for undefended attack
  2. Fix model and dataset; vary p_m and ε to reproduce Figure 5 trends showing SR vs parameters
  3. Train Swin Transformer V2 on Caltech-256 with AGA-augmented data and test against AGA attack to compare SR drop

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential mismatch between training and attack distributions in defense experiments - adversarial training used AGA-generated examples but was tested against the same algorithm
- Noise implementation detail (Δ ~ U(0, ε)) could lead to unintended pixel saturation with strictly positive noise
- Population-based AGA requires substantial memory (3x batch size), not thoroughly explored across hardware constraints
- Stability test lacks specified random seeds, making exact statistical reproduction challenging

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- ATA and AGA algorithms successfully implement black-box adversarial attacks
- AGA consistently outperforms ATA in attack success rates across multiple architectures and datasets
- Vision Transformers show higher vulnerability to undefended attacks but benefit more from adversarial training

**Medium Confidence:**
- Hyperparameter relationships (mutation rate, noise intensity, crossover probability effects) are correctly characterized
- Targeted attacks improve model performance on specific classes as claimed
- Bounded affine parameter ranges prevent visible distortion while maintaining attack effectiveness

**Low Confidence:**
- Defense results would generalize to attacks using different algorithms than those used during training
- Noise implementation detail (strictly positive noise) was intended and optimal
- Crossover operator provides meaningful contribution beyond what mutation alone achieves

## Next Checks

1. **Noise implementation verification**: Run AGA with both strictly positive noise (Δ ~ U(0, ε)) and signed noise (Δ ~ U(-ε, ε)) on the same model/dataset. Compare attack success rates and final image quality to determine if the implementation matches intent.

2. **Cross-algorithm defense testing**: Train a model using AGA-augmented data, then evaluate its robustness against both AGA and ATA attacks. This validates whether the defense generalizes beyond the specific attack algorithm used during training.

3. **Ablation study on AGA components**: Implement AGA variants with mutation only (p_c=0), crossover only (p_m=0), and full AGA. Run each across multiple random seeds to determine the actual contribution of crossover versus mutation, particularly at the reported "minimum sensitivity" crossover probability.
