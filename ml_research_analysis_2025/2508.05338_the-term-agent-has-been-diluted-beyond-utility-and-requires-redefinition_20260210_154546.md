# The Term 'Agent' Has Been Diluted Beyond Utility and Requires Redefinition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.05338
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05338
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Proposes a framework defining minimum requirements and five-dimensional spectrum for agenticness assessment

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that the term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has become so ambiguous that it hinders research communication, evaluation, and policy development. To address this, the author proposes a framework defining minimum requirements for agenticness (environmental impact, goal-directed behavior, and state awareness) and characterizes systems along five dimensions: environmental interaction sophistication, goal-directed behavior complexity, temporal coherence, learning and adaptation, and autonomy. The framework is illustrated through qualitative assessments of example systems like Smallville generative agents and autonomous vacuum robots. The approach aims to provide precise vocabulary while preserving the term's multifaceted nature, ultimately improving research clarity and supporting more effective policy development.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a two-stage assessment process: first, systems must pass three minimum requirements (environmental impact, goal-directed behavior, state awareness) to qualify as agents. Systems meeting these thresholds are then characterized across five dimensions—environmental interaction sophistication, goal-directed behavior complexity, temporal coherence, learning and adaptation, and autonomy—each rated on threshold, intermediate, or advanced levels. The methodology is qualitative and subjective, using conceptual criteria rather than quantitative metrics. No standardized scoring rubrics or inter-rater reliability measures are provided in the current framework.

## Key Results
- Three minimum requirements (environmental impact, goal-directed behavior, state awareness) serve as binary gates for agent classification
- Five-dimensional spectrum (environmental interaction, goal complexity, temporal coherence, learning/adaptation, autonomy) enables nuanced assessment
- Framework preserves multifaceted nature of agenticness while providing clearer vocabulary for research and policy
- Qualitative assessments demonstrate framework applicability to diverse systems (Smallville agents, vacuum robots, LLMs)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Minimum Requirements as Classification Gate
- Claim: Three necessary conditions filter systems that should not be classified as agents, reducing definitional sprawl.
- Mechanism: A system must demonstrate (1) active and measurable environmental impact, (2) goal-directed behavior beyond optimization, and (3) state awareness persisting between interactions. Systems failing any requirement—simple chatbots, basic classifiers, static expert systems—are excluded before dimensional assessment.
- Core assumption: These three properties represent the irreducible consensus from historical agent literature (Russell & Norvig, Wooldridge & Jennings, Sutton & Batro).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "propose a framework that defines clear minimum requirements for a system to be considered an agent"
  - [section] "To be considered an agent, the system must have an active and measurable environmental impact... goal-directed behavior... state awareness. Stateless systems (e.g., a model that processes each input independently without maintaining context or memory) do not qualify as agents."
  - [corpus] Weak/no direct corpus validation of this specific three-requirement formulation; related frameworks emphasize overlapping but not identical criteria.
- Break condition: If a system lacks persistent state, produces only input-output mappings without environmental alteration, or pursues fixed optimization targets without adaptive multi-step planning.

### Mechanism 2: Multidimensional Spectrum Preserves Nuance While Enabling Comparison
- Claim: Characterizing systems along five graded dimensions allows meaningful differentiation without forcing binary classification.
- Mechanism: Once minimum requirements are met, systems are assessed across environmental interaction sophistication, goal-directed behavior complexity, temporal coherence, learning and adaptation, and autonomy—each rated at threshold, intermediate, or advanced levels.
- Core assumption: Agenticness is fundamentally continuous and multi-faceted; no single property fully captures agent-like behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "characterizing systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction, learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence"
  - [section] "Recent frameworks have converged on defining AI agenticness as a multidimensional spectrum rather than a binary property... characterized by the degree to which systems can adaptably achieve complex goals in complex environments with minimal supervision"
  - [corpus] Shavit et al. (2023) and Chan et al. (2023) propose similar multidimensional frameworks with overlapping dimensions (goal complexity, environmental complexity, independent execution).
- Break condition: If systems exhibit agent-like properties not captured by these five dimensions, or if dimensions prove highly redundant in practice.

### Mechanism 3: Dimensional Interdependencies Constrain and Enable Capabilities
- Claim: The five dimensions interact systematically; capability in one dimension enables or limits others.
- Mechanism: Temporal coherence enables complex environmental modeling; learning sophistication influences goal hierarchy formation; autonomy requires environmental understanding. These interdependencies mean isolated dimension optimization may fail.
- Core assumption: These interactions are meaningful for system design and evaluation, not merely correlational.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Not explicitly mentioned.
  - [section] "The five core dimensions of agenticness exist not as isolated characteristics but as interconnected aspects... a system's ability to maintain state awareness directly impacts its environmental interaction capabilities. Higher temporal coherence enables more complex environmental modeling and prediction."
  - [corpus] Weak/no corpus validation; interdependency claims appear novel to this framework.
- Break condition: If dimensions can be independently optimized without interaction effects, or if interdependencies are domain-specific rather than general.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Agenticness vs. Agency
  - Why needed here: The paper deliberately introduces "agenticness" to avoid philosophical/sociological baggage of "agency" (moral capacity, intentional action in social frameworks).
  - Quick check question: Can a vacuum robot have high agenticness but zero agency in the philosophical sense? Explain the distinction.

- Concept: Threshold vs. Spectrum Classification
  - Why needed here: The framework requires passing minimum requirements (binary gate) before dimensional assessment (continuous spectrum). Confusing these leads to misclassification.
  - Quick check question: If System A passes minimum requirements but scores "threshold" on all five dimensions, and System B fails one minimum requirement, which is classified as an agent?

- Concept: State Awareness (Requirement) vs. Temporal Coherence (Dimension)
  - Why needed here: State awareness is a boolean minimum; temporal coherence is a graded dimension. A system can meet the minimum but rate poorly on temporal coherence.
  - Quick check question: What level of temporal coherence would a system demonstrate if it maintains state across conversations but cannot integrate information across different time scales?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Minimum Requirements Gate (3 boolean checks) -> Five Assessment Dimensions (5 ratings) -> Interdependency Analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Verify system passes all three minimum requirements (sequential gate)
  2. Assess each dimension independently using level criteria
  3. Analyze interdependencies—does low temporal coherence constrain environmental interaction? Does limited learning cap goal complexity?

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Precision vs. adoption: Stricter gate may exclude systems researchers currently call "agents," risking non-adoption
  - Qualitative vs. quantitative: Paper explicitly calls for future quantitative metrics; current framework is qualitative
  - Extensibility vs. completeness: Five dimensions may miss emergent properties; framework designed to add dimensions

- Failure signatures:
  - Edge case—LLMs with tools: May qualify as agents only if tool use creates genuine environmental impact AND system maintains state AND exhibits goal-directed planning. Implementation-dependent.
  - Recommendation systems: May qualify if persistent user state + goal-directed optimization + measurable impact; many fail goal-directed behavior requirement.
  - Pattern recognition masquerading as agenticness: Impressive domain performance without meeting minimum requirements.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Gate validation: List all systems your team currently calls "agents." Apply minimum requirements gate. What percentage fails? Which requirement fails most often?
  2. Single-dimension rubric: Operationalize one dimension (suggest: Environmental Interaction Sophistication) with concrete behavioral criteria distinguishing threshold/intermediate/advanced. Test inter-rater reliability.
  3. Interdependency probe: Identify two systems with different dimensional profiles. Test whether low temporal coherence actually constrains environmental interaction sophistication in practice.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the proposed five-dimensional framework be operationalized into robust quantitative metrics to ensure consistent evaluation across diverse AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The "Future Research Directions" section states that while the framework provides qualitative criteria, "developing measurable standards is needed to classify and compare AI systems effectively."
- Why unresolved: The current proposal relies on qualitative assessment (e.g., "threshold," "intermediate," "advanced"), which lacks the precision required for rigorous scientific comparison.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and validation of standardized benchmarks that assign numerical scores or indices to the five dimensions (Environmental Interaction, Goal-Directed Behavior, Temporal Coherence, Learning, and Autonomy).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does "emergent agenticness" manifest in systems operating at the boundaries of the framework, such as LLMs with tool access?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author notes that "The phenomenon of emergent agenticness demands particular attention" and suggests that "Studying these boundary cases could reveal fundamental insights about how agenticness manifests."
- Why unresolved: Current definitions struggle to classify edge cases where systems demonstrate agent-like properties (like tool use) without meeting all traditional criteria (like persistent state awareness).
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies analyzing "edge case" systems to determine if they genuinely cross the minimum thresholds or if the framework requires modification to account for new behavioral patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the specific interaction effects and trade-offs between the five dimensions, and does strength in one area compensate for weakness in another?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The "Dimensional Interdependencies" section acknowledges that dimensions "exist not as isolated characteristics" and have "interaction effects," but the paper does not define how these interactions alter the overall classification of a system.
- Why unresolved: The framework treats dimensions as spectrums but lacks a mechanism for weighing them against one another (e.g., is a system with high Autonomy but low Learning still "highly agentic"?).
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlational analysis or experimental results showing how performance in one dimension (e.g., Temporal Coherence) statistically influences or necessitates capabilities in another (e.g., Goal-Directed Behavior).

## Limitations
- Framework relies on qualitative, subjective assessments without quantitative validation or standardized scoring rubrics
- No empirical evidence demonstrates the proposed dimensional interdependencies meaningfully constrain system capabilities
- Practical utility for real-world policy development depends on adoption and standardization, which the paper doesn't address

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The minimum requirements (environmental impact, goal-directed behavior, state awareness) are well-grounded in established agent literature and provide clear, testable criteria for classification
- Medium Confidence: The five-dimensional framework captures important aspects of agenticness and aligns with recent research trends, but qualitative rating scales and interdependency claims lack empirical validation
- Low Confidence: Framework's practical utility for research communication and policy development depends on adoption and standardization, which remains unproven

## Next Checks
1. **Inter-rater Reliability Test**: Have three independent researchers apply the framework to five diverse AI systems (including edge cases like LLMs with tools and recommendation systems). Measure agreement rates on minimum requirement pass/fail and dimensional ratings.

2. **Empirical Interdependency Validation**: Select two systems with different dimensional profiles. Design controlled experiments to test whether low temporal coherence actually constrains environmental interaction sophistication, or whether limited learning capacity caps goal complexity in practice.

3. **Framework Evolution Tracking**: Monitor agent-related publications over 12 months. Track whether the proposed minimum requirements and dimensional framework gain traction in the research community, and whether definitional confusion decreases as predicted.
