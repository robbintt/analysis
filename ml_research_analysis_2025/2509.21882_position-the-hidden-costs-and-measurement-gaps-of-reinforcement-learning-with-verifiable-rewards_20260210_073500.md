# Position: The Hidden Costs and Measurement Gaps of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21882
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21882
- Reference count: 24
- Key outcome: Several RLVR accuracy gains shrink or disappear under matched-budget, contamination-controlled evaluation, revealing overstatement from budget mismatch, calibration drift, and data contamination.

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies three major sources of overstatement in reported reasoning gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR): hidden costs like overconfidence and safety/privacy exposure, evaluation pitfalls from mismatched budgets and fragile judge pipelines, and data contamination that inflates gains on legacy benchmarks. Using partial-prompt audits and matched-budget reproductions, it shows that several headline accuracy gaps shrink or disappear under clean, parity-controlled evaluation. It then proposes a tax-aware training and evaluation protocol that decomposes reward into correctness, grounding, and calibrated refusal; controls variance and matches difficulty; mixes offline/online optimization with calibration-based stopping; and standardizes evaluation via budget parity, judge robustness, and contamination audits.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates RLVR models under parity-controlled conditions using standardized prompts, verifiers, and k=32 sampling budgets. It runs partial-prompt contamination audits by revealing 40-80% of problem prefixes and measuring suffix reconstruction accuracy. Models include Qwen2.5/3 variants, DeepSeek-R1 variants, and Llama-3 across math and general knowledge benchmarks. Evaluation tracks pass@k, ECE, abstention rates, and contamination indicators. Training uses correctness-only rewards offline, then adds grounding and calibration gates during mixed optimization.

## Key Results
- Under matched sampling budgets, many RLVR vs. base model accuracy gaps shrink or disappear, suggesting gains reflect distribution sharpening rather than capability expansion
- Partial-prompt audits reveal high suffix reconstruction on legacy math sets (58-60% ACC@80) but near-zero on fresh AIME-2025 problems, indicating memorization contamination
- Calibration degradation (rising ECE, collapsing abstention) often accompanies accuracy gains, creating an "overconfidence tax" that persists post-training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Budget Parity Reveals Search vs. Capability
RLVR models internalize search strategies that would otherwise require multi-sample inference-time search. When base models are given pass@k evaluation with matched k, they approximate RLVR's single-sample performance by covering more of the base distribution. Gaps compress because RLVR primarily reweights existing solution modes rather than discovering new ones.

### Mechanism 2: Partial-Prompt Audit Detects Memorization
Contaminated models memorize problem-answer pairs and reconstruct hidden suffixes verbatim when given partial prompts from memorized problems. On uncontaminated problems requiring actual reasoning, completion accuracy drops sharply. The legacy-vs-fresh gap indicates contamination severity.

### Mechanism 3: Calibration-Gated Stopping Prevents Overconfidence Tax
Halting RLVR when Expected Calibration Error (ECE) degrades or refusal rates collapse—even while reward improves—preserves reliability alongside accuracy gains. RLVR pushes models toward determinism on verifiable tasks, increasing confidence on both correct and incorrect answers.

## Foundational Learning

- **pass@k vs. avg@k vs. maj@k metrics**: Different metrics can flip conclusions about RLVR effectiveness. Understanding what each measures is essential for fair comparison.
  - Quick check: Model A scores 40% pass@1; Model B scores 50% avg@16. Which comparison would be valid?

- **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**: ECE is the core diagnostic for the overconfidence tax. You must compute and interpret it correctly.
  - Quick check: A model achieves 80% accuracy with 85% average confidence. Is it well-calibrated, overconfident, or underconfident?

- **KL divergence to base policy**: The protocol monitors KL and cools down on spikes. Understanding what KL measures helps diagnose distribution drift.
  - Quick check: KL to base increases continuously while reward plateaus—what does this suggest about optimization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Reward Decomposer -> Difficulty Router -> Calibration Gate -> Contamination Auditor -> Parity Evaluator
- **Critical path**:
  1. Run contamination audit; exclude flagged benchmarks
  2. Train with correctness-only reward; offline rollouts
  3. Add grounding mid-training; switch to mixed offline/online
  4. Monitor ECE; halt when ECE exceeds baseline + margin
  5. Evaluate under budget parity; report saturation curves
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Longer CoT improves accuracy but expands attack/privacy surface
  - High entropy exploration helps escape optima but destabilizes calibration
  - Multi-component rewards prevent overconfidence but increase tuning complexity
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Abstention collapse with flat accuracy → overconfidence tax; increase γ or gate earlier
  - Judge swings >5% from prompt changes → fragile judge; prefer programmatic verifiers
  - Base model catches up at k≥32 → search artifacts; investigate capability-expanding mechanisms
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Parity baseline**: Evaluate base vs. RLVR at k=1,8,16,32,64 with same verifier. Plot saturation curves.
  2. **Contamination probe**: Run 80/60/40% prefix completion on eval set. Flag ACC@80 > 40%.
  3. **Calibration sweep**: Checkpoint every N steps; evaluate ECE/refusal/accuracy. Find where accuracy plateaus but ECE climbs—that's your stopping point.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does RLVR genuinely expand reasoning capability, or does it primarily sharpen selection among behaviors already present in the base model's distribution?
- Basis in paper: The introduction frames this as "a question that frames the current debate," reviewing evidence for both perspectives without taking a side.
- Why unresolved: Parity-controlled studies show base models can narrow gaps with matched budgets, yet some regimes (ProRL, unlikeliness rewards, pass@k training) report gains hard to recover by sampling alone—no consensus mechanism exists.
- What evidence would resolve it: Trajectory analysis showing RLVR models reach states with zero probability under the base policy, or conversely, proof that all RLVR improvements can be recovered via optimal search over base samples.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal calibration-based stopping criteria (ECE thresholds, entropy floors, refusal rate bounds) that maximize accuracy while preventing overconfidence inflation?
- Basis in paper: The protocol proposes calibration gates that "halt or anneal when ECE exceeds the baseline by a fixed margin or refusal falls below a floor," but no specific threshold values or validation methodology are provided.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that calibration degrades alongside accuracy gains but does not empirically determine the optimal trade-off point or validate proposed stopping rules across model scales.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation across ECE margin values and refusal floors on held-out distributions, measuring the Pareto frontier between accuracy and calibration.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the contamination audit findings (partial-prompt reconstruction on legacy math sets) generalize to code, multi-domain benchmarks, and multimodal reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: The scope section notes that "agentic/multimodal settings introduce additional privacy/safety channels and may need tailored verifiers and audits," explicitly leaving this for future work.
- Why unresolved: The contamination analysis focuses narrowly on mathematical reasoning with text-based partial-prompt probes; it remains unknown whether similar memorization artifacts exist in code benchmarks or whether probe methodologies transfer.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of partial-prompt reconstruction audits on LiveCodeBench and multimodal benchmarks, comparing reconstruction rates against newly released uncontaminated test sets.

## Limitations
- The protocol's reliance on proprietary models and closed datasets creates significant reproducibility barriers.
- Calibration-gating mechanism, while theoretically sound, lacks comprehensive validation across diverse model families and scales.
- The complete tax-aware training protocol is proposed but not fully implemented or evaluated.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The budget parity mechanism and its implications for search vs. capability gains are well-supported by controlled experiments and theoretical reasoning. The contamination audit methodology is straightforward and empirically validated.

**Medium Confidence**: The calibration-gating stopping criterion shows promise but lacks comprehensive validation. The partial-prompt audit effectively detects memorization, but its sensitivity to reasoning quality vs. superficial pattern matching remains unclear.

**Low Confidence**: The complete tax-aware training protocol (with all three reward components, difficulty routing, and calibration gates) is proposed but not fully implemented or evaluated. Component interactions and optimal hyperparameters remain largely untested.

## Next Checks
1. **Independent Parity Validation**: Replicate the budget parity analysis on at least two additional model families not covered in the original study, using public checkpoints and open-source verifiers.
2. **Calibration Threshold Calibration**: Systematically test different ECE/refusal thresholds across model scales to determine robust stopping criteria that balance accuracy preservation with overconfidence prevention.
3. **Contamination Generalization**: Apply the partial-prompt audit to non-math domains (e.g., code generation, general knowledge) to verify its effectiveness across task types and assess whether contamination patterns vary by domain.
