# The Sound of Risk: A Multimodal Physics-Informed Acoustic Model for Forecasting Market Volatility and Enhancing Market Interpretability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.18653
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18653
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Acoustic and textual emotional features from earnings calls explain up to 43.8% of 30-day volatility variance

## Executive Summary
This study develops a multimodal framework that integrates vocal emotional analysis with textual sentiment to forecast market volatility. The researchers address the limitation of text-only approaches by incorporating paralinguistic cues from executive vocal dynamics during earnings calls. Using a Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), the system extracts robust emotional signatures from noisy teleconference audio, which are then combined with textual analysis in an interpretable three-dimensional Affective State Label space. Tested on 1,795 earnings calls, the multimodal approach demonstrates significant explanatory power for volatility while maintaining interpretability for market participants.

## Method Summary
The methodology combines a Physics-Informed Acoustic Model with textual sentiment analysis to create a comprehensive emotional assessment framework. PIAM processes audio from earnings calls to extract vocal emotional signatures, handling the challenges of noisy teleconference environments. These acoustic features are mapped alongside textual sentiment analysis onto a three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space, creating an interpretable representation of emotional states. The framework engineers features capturing emotional shifts between scripted and spontaneous speech segments. The model is trained on 1,795 earnings calls and evaluated for its ability to explain variance in 30-day realized volatility, with ablation studies confirming the added value of multimodal integration over financial data alone.

## Key Results
- Multimodal features explain up to 43.8% of out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility
- Acoustic and textual emotional features fail to predict directional stock returns but show strong volatility forecasting ability
- Ablation studies confirm multimodal approach significantly outperforms financials-only baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the complementary nature of vocal and textual emotional cues to capture hidden corporate risk signals. Paralinguistic vocal dynamics reveal emotional states that may not be explicitly expressed in text, particularly during unscripted moments of earnings calls. The Physics-Informed Acoustic Model's robustness to teleconference noise ensures reliable feature extraction even in challenging real-world conditions. By mapping both modalities onto an interpretable three-dimensional space, the system maintains transparency while capturing complex emotional dynamics that correlate with market uncertainty.

## Foundational Learning
- Physics-Informed Acoustic Models: Integrate physical acoustic principles with deep learning for robust feature extraction from noisy audio; needed to handle teleconference quality limitations and ensure reliable emotional signal detection
- Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: Combine multiple data streams (text, audio, visual) for comprehensive emotional understanding; needed because single modalities miss important contextual information
- Affective State Label Spaces: Three-dimensional representations of emotional states that balance complexity with interpretability; needed to create actionable insights for market participants

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Audio Input -> PIAM -> Acoustic Features -> ASL Space <- Textual Analysis <- Text Input -> Volatility Prediction Model

**Critical Path:** PIAM extraction -> ASL mapping -> Volatility prediction, as acoustic features provide the most novel signal and drive performance improvements

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- Simplicity vs. accuracy: Three-dimensional ASL space chosen over more complex representations for interpretability
- Robustness vs. sensitivity: PIAM prioritizes noise resilience over capturing subtle vocal nuances
- Multimodal integration vs. computational efficiency: Combined approach adds complexity but provides superior explanatory power

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Poor performance in predicting directional returns indicates limitation to risk assessment rather than trading signals
- Reduced effectiveness with non-U.S. corporate communication styles suggests cultural bias
- Limited performance during market anomalies may indicate missing macroeconomic indicators

**First Experiments:**
1. Ablation study removing acoustic features to quantify multimodal contribution
2. Out-of-sample volatility prediction on held-back earnings calls
3. Comparison with financials-only baseline using identical target variable

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset limited to 1,795 U.S. earnings calls, potentially missing diverse market conditions and communication styles
- Model explains volatility variance rather than predicting directional returns, limiting practical trading applications
- Three-dimensional ASL space may oversimplify complex emotional dynamics across different corporate cultures

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Multimodal framework's superior performance over financials-only baseline in explaining volatility variance
- **Medium Confidence**: Robustness of acoustic feature extraction in noisy teleconference environments
- **Medium Confidence**: Interpretability of three-dimensional ASL space for market participants
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability across different market conditions and corporate communication styles

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance across multiple economic cycles and market regimes using extended time-series data
2. Validate acoustic feature extraction robustness with diverse speaker populations and recording qualities
3. Conduct cross-cultural validation using non-English earnings calls and different corporate communication norms
