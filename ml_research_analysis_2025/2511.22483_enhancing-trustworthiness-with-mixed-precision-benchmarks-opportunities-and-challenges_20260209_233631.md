# Enhancing Trustworthiness with Mixed Precision: Benchmarks, Opportunities, and Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22483
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22483
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Mixed-precision ensemble voting improves LLM trustworthiness by up to 5.8% while maintaining accuracy

## Executive Summary
This work evaluates how low-precision quantization affects large language model (LLM) trustworthiness, identifying performance instability on metrics like adversarial robustness and fairness. The authors introduce a precision-ensemble voting approach that aggregates predictions from multiple bit-width variants of the same model, reducing refusal rates and improving robustness. The method consistently improves trustworthiness performance over dense baselines while maintaining multi-domain accuracy. Results emphasize the need to evaluate trustworthiness under model compression and highlight opportunities for joint compression and trust-aware optimization, especially in multi-modal and safety-critical contexts.

## Method Summary
The precision-ensemble voting approach operates by maintaining multiple quantized versions of the same base model at different bit-widths. During inference, each precision variant processes the input independently, generating predictions that are then aggregated through majority voting. The ensemble typically includes variants ranging from low-bit (e.g., 3-bit) to higher-bit (e.g., 8-bit) representations, capturing different trade-offs between computational efficiency and representation fidelity. This voting mechanism reduces the impact of quantization-induced errors on individual trustworthiness metrics while preserving overall model accuracy across diverse domains.

## Key Results
- Precision-ensemble voting improves trustworthiness metrics by up to 5.8% over dense baselines
- The approach reduces refusal rates while maintaining multi-domain accuracy
- Quantization significantly impacts adversarial robustness and fairness metrics, highlighting evaluation needs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ensemble voting mechanism works by leveraging the complementary strengths of different precision variants. Low-bit models may capture coarse-grained patterns more robustly but miss fine details, while higher-bit models preserve precision but may be more sensitive to adversarial perturbations. By aggregating their predictions, the ensemble smooths out precision-specific weaknesses and amplifies consensus on trustworthy outputs. This diversity in representation space helps mitigate quantization-induced instability in trustworthiness metrics.

## Foundational Learning

**Quantization-Aware Training**: Why needed - To understand how different bit-width representations affect model behavior and trustworthiness. Quick check - Verify that quantized models maintain baseline performance before ensemble application.

**Trustworthiness Metrics**: Why needed - To systematically evaluate fairness, robustness, and safety dimensions affected by compression. Quick check - Ensure metric consistency across different model versions and precision levels.

**Ensemble Methods**: Why needed - To understand how aggregation strategies affect prediction stability and trustworthiness. Quick check - Compare voting mechanisms (majority, weighted) on validation sets.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Multiple Quantized Models (3-bit to 8-bit) -> Independent Inference -> Voting Aggregation -> Output

**Critical Path**: Input processing through all precision variants simultaneously, followed by synchronous voting aggregation. Latency scales linearly with the number of precision variants.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Computational overhead increases with ensemble size versus trustworthiness improvement. Higher precision variants improve accuracy but reduce efficiency gains. Voting aggregation adds latency but improves robustness.

**Failure Signatures**: Individual precision variants may fail catastrophically on specific inputs. Low-bit variants may miss nuanced patterns. High-bit variants may overfit to training distribution. Ensemble may amplify minority predictions incorrectly.

**First Experiments**: 1) Baseline evaluation of individual quantized models on trustworthiness metrics. 2) Ablation study varying ensemble size and precision range. 3) Stress testing under adversarial examples and distribution shift.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does precision-ensemble voting perform on open-ended generation tasks versus classification?
- What are the optimal precision ranges and ensemble sizes for different model families?
- Can the approach be extended to multi-modal models where trustworthiness metrics may differ across modalities?
- How does the method scale to extremely large models where maintaining multiple precision variants becomes computationally prohibitive?

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on classification tasks, potentially missing broader trust implications in open-ended generation
- Results rely on specific model families and quantization schemes, raising questions about transferability to other architectures
- Ensemble voting introduces computational overhead that scales with the number of precision variants
- The approach requires maintaining multiple model checkpoints, increasing storage requirements

## Confidence
- Core claims about precision-ensemble benefits: High for tested scenarios and models
- Generalization to other LLM families: Medium
- Practical deployment feasibility: Medium
- Findings about quantization's impact on trustworthiness: High within studied scope

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Test the precision-ensemble approach on diverse LLM families (e.g., decoder-only, encoder-decoder, multimodal) to verify generalizability beyond the studied models.

2. **Real-world deployment assessment**: Evaluate computational overhead, memory requirements, and inference latency in production environments to determine practical feasibility beyond controlled benchmarks.

3. **Adversarial robustness under distribution shift**: Assess how well the ensemble approach maintains trustworthiness when exposed to adversarial examples, domain-shifted data, and novel threat scenarios not present in training data.
