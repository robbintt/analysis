- First culturally grounded dataset for evaluating stereotypes in African contexts

## Executive Summary
AfriStereo introduces the first culturally grounded dataset for assessing stereotypical bias in Large Language Models within African contexts. Through community-engaged surveys across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, researchers collected 1,163 stereotypes spanning gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and profession. These were systematically expanded to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs through LLM-assisted augmentation with human validation. Evaluation of eleven language models (2019-2024) revealed statistically significant bias across nine models, with Bias Preference Ratios ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p ≤ 0.05), particularly pronounced for age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models showed weaker bias, suggesting task-specific training may help mitigate stereotypical associations.

## Method Summary
The study collected stereotypes through community-engaged surveys administered via the LOOKA platform across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, recruiting 107 participants. Survey responses were processed through regex extraction, semantic clustering using sentence embeddings with polarity filtering, and human verification to create stereotype-antistereotype pairs. The dataset was then augmented with 3,917 synthetic pairs using LLM generation with human filtering. Eleven language models were evaluated using a template-based probability scoring approach where "[Identity] are [Attribute]" sentences were compared against "[Identity] are [Opposite Attribute]" sentences. Bias Preference Ratios were computed and statistical significance was assessed using paired t-tests.

## Key Results
- 1,163 human-collected stereotypes across 5 identity dimensions from community surveys
- Bias Preference Ratios ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p ≤ 0.05) across 9 of 11 evaluated models
- Domain-specific models (BioGPT, FinBERT) showed weaker or non-significant bias
- Significant bias detected particularly for age, profession, and gender dimensions
- All-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings with τ=0.55 clustering threshold optimized for attribute grouping

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Community-Engaged Stereotype Elicitation
- Claim: Open-ended surveys with culturally situated participants capture naturally occurring stereotypes absent from Western benchmarks
- Mechanism: Participants from target communities report stereotypes they've encountered in lived contexts, generating identity-attribute pairs that reflect actual social dynamics rather than researcher assumptions
- Core assumption: Communities internal to a cultural context can articulate encountered stereotypes more authentically than external researchers or LLMs can hypothesize
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through community engaged efforts across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, we collected 1,163 stereotypes spanning gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and profession"
  - [section 3.1] "The survey was administered through LOOKA, a pan-African research platform, in both English and French to account for linguistic diversity between participants"
  - [corpus] IndiCASA (arxiv 2510.02742) and FairI Tales (arxiv 2506.23111) employ similar community-grounded approaches for Indian contexts, supporting cross-cultural validity of participatory elicitation
- Break condition: When participant demographics narrow (urban, digitally connected only), rural perspectives and less salient contextual stereotypes are missed

### Mechanism 2: Stereotype-Antistereotype Probability Differential
- Claim: Comparing model log-probabilities for stereotypical versus antistereotypical sentences reveals systematic bias preferences
- Mechanism: Construct S = "[Identity] are [Attribute]" and AS = "[Identity] are [Opposite Attribute]". Compute Bias Score = log P(S) - log P(AS). Aggregate into BPR (proportion of samples with positive scores)
- Core assumption: Models assigning higher probability to stereotypical sentences than antistereotypes have internalized the association
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p ≤ 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes"
  - [section 5.4] "BPR = 0.5 indicates no systematic preference (unbiased). BPR significantly greater than 0.5 indicates systematic stereotype preference"
  - [corpus] StereoDetect (arxiv 2504.03352) critiques detection methodologies broadly but does not specifically validate the S-AS probability paradigm; direct corpus validation is limited
- Break condition: When antistereotype constructions become linguistically unnatural (e.g., "not business-oriented"), the paradigm may test fluency rather than bias

### Mechanism 3: Domain-Specific Pre-training as Bias Attenuator
- Claim: Models pre-trained on specialized corpora show weaker stereotypical associations than general-purpose models
- Mechanism: Domain-specific training data contains fewer social stereotype associations, reducing opportunity for models to learn identity-attribute patterns
- Core assumption: Stereotype encoding arises primarily from training data patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations"
  - [section 6.1.5] "BioGPT and FinBERT exhibited weaker or non-significant bias (FinBERT: BPR=0.50, p=0.4507; BioGPT: BPR=0.55, p=0.0585)"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation found; related papers focus on evaluation rather than training data effects
- Break condition: Finding based on only 2 domain-specific models; attenuation may not transfer when deployed outside training domain

## Foundational Learning

- **Stereotype-Antistereotype Paradigm**:
  - Why needed here: Core evaluation framework; understanding BPR computation requires grasping this paradigm
  - Quick check question: Given S = "Old people are wise" (P=0.02) and AS = "Old people are unintelligent" (P=0.01), is there a stereotype preference?

- **Semantic Clustering with Polarity Constraints**:
  - Why needed here: Dataset construction groups similar attributes while preventing antonym merging
  - Quick check question: Why would "smart" and "stupid" cluster under pure semantic similarity, and how does polarity filtering prevent this?

- **Bias Preference Ratio Interpretation**:
  - Why needed here: All results expressed in BPR; interpreting BPR=0.78 requires understanding the scale
  - Quick check question: What does BPR=0.50 indicate, and what does BPR=0.78 mean in practical terms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LOOKA platform -> 107 participants -> raw statements -> regex extraction -> sentence embeddings -> VADER polarity -> clustering (τ=0.55) -> human verification -> S-AS pairs -> LLM augmentation -> human filtering -> 3,917 synthetic pairs -> template construction -> probability extraction -> BPR aggregation -> statistical testing

- **Critical path**: Raw survey -> Identity/attribute extraction (5% need manual intervention) -> Clustering with polarity filter -> Human validation -> Template construction -> Probability extraction -> BPR aggregation -> Statistical testing

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - English-only evaluation sacrifices multilingual nuance for model compatibility
  - τ=0.55 threshold empirical; higher over-merges, lower over-fragments
  - Synthetic augmentation trades authenticity for coverage
  - Open-source focus excludes API models (probability access required)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Geographic skew (68% Nigerian) -> over-represents Nigerian stereotypes
  - Urban participants only -> rural perspectives missing
  - Template artifacts -> models may exploit surface patterns
  - French->English without back-translation -> semantic shifts

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate BPR calculation on 1,163 human-collected pairs for GPT-2 Medium to verify pipeline
  2. Ablate polarity filtering in clustering to quantify impact on attribute group quality
  3. Test BPR correlation with model size within a family (e.g., Qwen scales) to investigate scaling effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How do state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude, Gemini) perform on African stereotype benchmarks when evaluated using Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based methods compared to the probability-based Stereotype-Antistereotype paradigm?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 and Section 9 state that the evaluation focused on open-source models because the S-AS paradigm requires direct probability access unavailable in API models, explicitly identifying NLI-based methods as a future direction for evaluating closed models
  - Why unresolved: The current study was restricted to open-source models (2019-2024) due to methodological constraints regarding probability distribution access
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study applying NLI-based bias metrics to closed-source API models using the AfriStereo dataset

- **Question**: To what extent can the reduced bias observed in domain-specific models (BioGPT, FinBERT) be replicated in general-purpose LLMs through targeted fine-tuning on culturally grounded, bias-reduced African corpora?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] While Section 6.1.5 notes that domain-specific models showed weaker bias, the paper infers in Section 7 that "targeted fine-tuning on curated bias-reduced corpora" is a promising mitigation strategy, though it is not yet tested on general architectures
  - Why unresolved: The paper measured existing bias levels but did not implement or test specific mitigation training protocols
  - What evidence would resolve it: Pre- and post-fine-tuning bias evaluations of general models (e.g., Llama, Mistral) trained on African-centric, non-stereotypical corpora

- **Question**: Does evaluation in native African languages (e.g., Kiswahili, Yoruba) yield different bias profiles compared to evaluation conducted via French-to-English translation?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 9 lists "Language Constraints" as a key limitation, noting that French-to-English translation may introduce semantic shifts and explicitly calls for developing multilingual evaluation frameworks
  - Why unresolved: The current dataset and evaluation pipeline unified data into English, potentially masking language-specific nuances or biases
  - What evidence would resolve it: A cross-lingual evaluation comparing model performance on the dataset in English versus its performance on natively collected or translated African language versions

## Limitations
- Geographic imbalance with 68% Nigerian participants may over-represent Nigerian stereotypes
- Urban, digitally connected participants only, missing rural perspectives
- English-only evaluation sacrifices multilingual nuance and may miss code-switching patterns
- Synthetic augmentation trades authenticity for coverage, introducing potential LLM-generated artifacts

## Confidence
- Community-grounded stereotype collection: High
- S-AS probability differential methodology: Medium
- Domain-specific training as bias attenuator: Low (based on only two domain-specific models)
- Statistical significance of bias findings: Medium (p-values reported, confidence intervals missing)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the evaluation using only the original 1,163 human-collected pairs to assess whether synthetic augmentation materially affects bias measurements
2. Conduct geographic stratification analysis to determine if Nigerian over-representation systematically biases certain stereotype categories
3. Compare BPR results across multiple quantization configurations to quantify the impact of model compression on bias detection
