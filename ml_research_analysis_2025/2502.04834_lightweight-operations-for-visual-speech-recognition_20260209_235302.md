# Lightweight Operations for Visual Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.04834
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04834
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Ghost module-based models achieve up to 74.3% FLOP reduction and 44.8% parameter reduction while maintaining competitive word recognition accuracy on LRW dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of deploying visual speech recognition (VSR) systems on resource-constrained devices by introducing lightweight architectures that significantly reduce computational overhead without compromising accuracy. The authors propose Ghost modules that replace standard convolutions with more efficient operations, and a Partial Temporal Block that splits input feature maps to reduce computation. Experimental results on the LRW dataset demonstrate that their models achieve competitive accuracy while significantly lowering FLOPs and parameter counts compared to existing methods. Specifically, the Ghost module-based models show up to 74.3% reduction in FLOPs and 44.8% reduction in parameters, while maintaining high word recognition accuracy. The proposed methods enable practical deployment of VSR systems on devices with limited computational resources.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces two key lightweight operations for VSR: Ghost modules and Partial Temporal Blocks. Ghost modules replace standard convolutions with a two-step process - a 1×1 convolution producing half the target channels followed by a 3×3 depthwise convolution that generates "ghost" features from these intermediate maps. The Partial Temporal Block splits input channels by a fixed ratio, with one branch undergoing temporal convolutions and the other passing through unchanged, then concatenating outputs with a residual connection. The authors evaluate these components in a ResNet-18 feature extractor combined with TCN sequence models on the LRW dataset, achieving significant FLOP and parameter reductions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

## Key Results
- Ghost module-based models achieve up to 74.3% reduction in FLOPs and 44.8% reduction in parameters on LRW dataset
- GhostV2 module (with DFC attention) provides minor accuracy improvements only when both frontend and sequence model are Ghost-augmented
- Partial Temporal Block with FasterNet block at ratio 0.75 achieves best efficiency-accuracy tradeoff
- Ghost-augmented ResNet-18 + Partial TCN achieves 86.3% accuracy with 6.26 GFLOPs (vs 10.31 GFLOPs for baseline)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ghost modules reduce computational overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy by exploiting redundancy in feature maps.
- Mechanism: A standard convolution is replaced with two cheaper operations: (1) a 1×1 convolution produces half the target channels, then (2) a 3×3 depthwise convolution generates additional "ghost" features from these intermediate maps. The two outputs are concatenated to restore the original channel dimension.
- Core assumption: Feature maps from standard convolutions contain significant redundancy that can be approximated through cheap linear transformations rather than full convolution operations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Leveraging efficient operation design paradigms, we create compact yet powerful models with reduced resource requirements and minimal accuracy loss."
  - [section III-B] "Compared to the standard convolution operation, this formulation reduces the total amount of computation required since the initial 1 × 1 convolution generates feature map with fewer channels, and the depth-wise operation which is much cheaper computationally, is also applied on this volume."
  - [corpus] Related work "Designing Practical Models for Isolated Word Visual Speech Recognition" (FMR=0.60) addresses similar efficiency concerns but does not specifically employ Ghost modules—suggesting this mechanism is novel to this paper.
- Break condition: If input feature maps have low inherent redundancy (high information density per channel), the cheap operations may fail to capture critical spatial relationships, leading to significant accuracy degradation beyond what parameter savings would predict.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DFC attention partially compensates for Ghost module's reduced representation capacity by aggregating long-range spatial information.
- Mechanism: The DFC attention module applies sequential 1×5 and 5×1 convolutions on pooled input features to capture vertical and horizontal dependencies, then produces a sigmoid-activated attention map that modulates the Ghost module's intermediate features.
- Core assumption: Spatial relationships across rows and columns can compensate for information lost when the Ghost module's depthwise convolution operates on only half the input channels.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-B] "To alleviate this weakness, the authors of [24] propose an enhancement called DFC attention which aims to exploit long-range spatial information, augmenting the Ghost module's intermediate features with richer representations that were lost by the original design."
  - [section IV-C] "Interestingly, the GhostV2 module that includes the DFC attention provides a minor accuracy improvement only in cases where both components utilize Ghost modules, indicating that the DFC attention is better utilized in a more resource-constrained network."
  - [corpus] No corpus papers directly validate DFC attention for VSR specifically; the mechanism originates from GhostNetV2 [24] applied to image classification.
- Break condition: On already-downsampled feature maps (e.g., after 3D convolution pooling in VSR front-ends), the additional pooling in DFC may remove too much spatial information. The paper notes: "The additional down-sampling performed by the DFC attention module of the (already low-dimension) feature map removes much of the information contained."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Partial Temporal Block enables ultra-lightweight sequence modeling by computing only on a subset of channels and skipping computation on the remainder.
- Mechanism: Input channels are split by a fixed ratio. One branch undergoes temporal convolutions; the other passes through unchanged. Outputs are concatenated with a residual connection. Three block designs are evaluated: standard temporal convolution, ShuffleNet-style (depthwise + pointwise), and FasterNet-style (conv + MLP).
- Core assumption: Temporal dependencies in VSR can be adequately captured from a subset of feature channels, with the identity branch preserving information flow without computation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-C] "As a baseline, we employ the standard Temporal Convolution layer as the core of our block in one branch. This layer uses a sequence of 1D causal convolutions... The other branch uses no operations, this way the computational overhead of the block is greatly reduced."
  - [section IV-E, Table IV] Ablation shows that increasing the ratio from 0.25 to 0.75 improves accuracy by 1.82–4.18% with only 0.05 GFLOPs and 1.6M additional parameters, validating the tradeoff control.
  - [corpus] No corpus neighbors directly address partial/split computation for temporal modeling in VSR; this appears to be a novel application of ShuffleNet/FasterNet principles to the temporal domain.
- Break condition: If critical temporal cues are distributed across many channels rather than concentrated, low split ratios (e.g., 0.25) may fail to capture essential dynamics, resulting in accuracy collapse.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Depthwise Separable Convolution**
  - Why needed here: Ghost modules use depthwise convolution as their "cheap operation." Understanding that depthwise convolution applies a single filter per input channel (vs. full convolution's per-output-channel filters) explains why FLOPs drop ~74% (Table VI).
  - Quick check question: Given an input of 64 channels and kernel 3×3, how many multiplications does a depthwise convolution require versus a standard convolution producing 64 output channels?

- Concept: **Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN) with Dilation**
  - Why needed here: The Partial Temporal Block builds on TCN architectures with exponentially increasing dilation rates. Dilation expands receptive field without proportional parameter growth. The ablation on kernel size (Table V) shows that larger kernels help up to a point, but interact poorly with high dilation in deeper layers.
  - Quick check question: Why might a kernel size of 9 combined with high dilation in deep TCN layers cause the network to "miss information from their input," as the authors hypothesize?

- Concept: **Residual Connections in Sequence Models**
  - Why needed here: The Partial Temporal Block adds a skip connection (`Xout = Xc + X`). This is critical for training stability when one branch performs no computation—the identity path ensures gradient flow. Without it, ultra-lightweight variants would likely fail to converge.
  - Quick check question: In the Partial Temporal Block, if the ratio is 0.25 and the computation branch fails to learn useful features, what role does the skip connection play in preserving baseline performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Face detection -> Landmark alignment -> 96×96 mouth crop -> Grayscale normalization (29 frames) -> ResNet-18/ResNet-18-Ghost -> TCN (MS-TCN/DC-TCN/Partial TCN) -> FC layer + softmax

- Critical path:
  1. Video frames → mouth ROI extraction (failure here cascades; landmark quality is critical)
  2. Visual frontend → per-frame feature vectors (Ghost modules here yield 74.3% FLOP reduction per Table VI)
  3. TCN sequence modeling → temporal context aggregation (Partial TCN with FasterNet block at ratio 0.75 achieves best efficiency-accuracy tradeoff)
  4. Classifier → word prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Ghost vs. GhostV2**: GhostV2 (with DFC) increases parameters but improves accuracy only when *both* frontend and sequence model are Ghost-augmented. Use GhostV2 for accuracy-critical, memory-tolerant deployments; plain Ghost for FLOP-constrained scenarios.
  - **Partial TCN block choice**: FasterNet block (conv + MLP) offers best accuracy at lowest FLOPs; ShuffleNet block is most parameter-efficient but underperforms. Temporal block is intermediate.
  - **Kernel size**: Larger kernels (7→9) show diminishing returns or accuracy drops in some configurations (Table V). Start with k=5 as default.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Accuracy drop >3% with Ghost modules**: Check if frontend spatial resolution is already heavily downsampled before Ghost modules; DFC attention may worsen this.
  - **Partial TCN ratio <0.5 with poor convergence**: Increase ratio; the identity branch may dominate and prevent meaningful temporal learning.
  - **ShuffleNet block underperforming with Ghost frontend**: Total parameter count may be too low for LRW's 500-word vocabulary; switch to FasterNet block.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Train ResNet-18 + MS-TCN on LRW with preprocessing pipeline as described (Section IV-A). Verify ~85.3% accuracy and 10.31 GFLOPs to establish hardware baseline.
  2. **Ghost module ablation**: Replace ResNet-18 convolutions with Ghost modules only. Measure FLOP reduction (target: ~74%) and accuracy delta. Confirm parameter reduction aligns with Table VI (2.83M vs. 11.16M).
  3. **Partial TCN sweep**: Fix Ghost-augmented ResNet frontend. Train Partial TCN with FasterNet block at ratios [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]. Plot accuracy vs. FLOPs. Identify the elbow point for your target hardware budget.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would removing the pooling operations from the DFC attention module improve overall VSR performance when applied to low-dimension feature maps?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section IV.G: "We believe that removing the pooling operations could possibly improve the overall performance, slightly increasing the computational complexity, and plan on investigating this in the future."
- Why unresolved: The DFC module's pooling operation removes information from already low-dimension feature maps (after 3D convolution and pooling), but this hypothesis has not been empirically tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation experiments comparing DFC attention with and without pooling operations on the ResNet feature extractor, measuring both accuracy and FLOPs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can automated techniques (e.g., neural architecture search) identify optimal operation selections for the Partial Temporal Block across different hardware constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In Section V, the authors state: "We also intend to expand our proposed partial block's capabilities by exploring automated techniques for optimal operation selection."
- Why unresolved: The current Partial Temporal Block design relies on manual selection of operations (Temporal, ShuffleNet, FasterNet blocks) and channel split ratios without systematic optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing manually designed Partial Temporal Blocks against NAS-optimized variants on LRW, evaluating accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on target hardware.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why do larger kernel sizes (k=7,9) in the Partial Temporal Block yield diminishing or negative accuracy returns despite larger receptive fields?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table V shows performance degrades for ShuffleNet block at k=7,9 and for Temporal block at k=9. The authors suggest dilation in deeper layers may cause larger kernels to "miss information from their input," but this is not verified.
- Why unresolved: The interaction between kernel size, dilation rates, and temporal information capture in the TCN architecture remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis of effective receptive fields at each TCN stage with varying kernel sizes and dilation rates, combined with attention visualization on input frames.

## Limitations

- The paper only evaluates on LRW dataset with 500-word vocabulary and controlled video conditions, limiting generalizability to continuous speech or other languages.
- DFC attention shows inconsistent benefits across different network configurations, with potential harm when feature maps are already low-dimensional.
- The Partial Temporal Block's skip connection preserves accuracy when the computation branch fails, potentially masking true efficiency gains rather than demonstrating them.
- No ablation studies examine the impact of Ghost module ratio variations on the final accuracy-FLOPs tradeoff.

## Confidence

- **High**: Ghost module FLOP reduction (~74.3%) and parameter savings (44.8%) are well-supported by ablation (Table VI) and align with GhostNet literature.
- **Medium**: Accuracy improvements from GhostV2 (DFC attention) are supported but show conditional benefits; the mechanism's effectiveness varies with network depth and input dimensionality.
- **Medium**: Partial Temporal Block efficiency claims are validated through controlled sweeps (Table IV), but the identity branch's role in accuracy preservation suggests potential overestimation of computational savings.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Evaluate Ghost-augmented models on LRW-1000 (larger vocabulary, varied conditions) to assess whether 74.3% FLOP reduction holds under more challenging visual speech recognition scenarios.

2. **Input Resolution Sensitivity**: Systematically vary input resolution (48×48 to 224×224) and sequence length (15-60 frames) to map how FLOP reduction scales with input complexity and identify breaking points.

3. **DFC Attention Ablation**: Perform controlled ablation of DFC attention across different Ghost module placements (early vs. late layers) and input resolutions to quantify its conditional benefits and identify optimal deployment scenarios.
