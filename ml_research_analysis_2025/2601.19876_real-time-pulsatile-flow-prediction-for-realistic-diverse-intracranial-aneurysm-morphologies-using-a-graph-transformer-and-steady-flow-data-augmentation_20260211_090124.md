# Real-Time Pulsatile Flow Prediction for Realistic, Diverse Intracranial Aneurysm Morphologies using a Graph Transformer and Steady-Flow Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.19876
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19876
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Achieves SSIM up to 0.981 and relative L2 error of 2.8% for WSS prediction in intracranial aneurysms

## Executive Summary
This study presents a Graph Transformer-based deep learning framework for real-time prediction of transient wall shear stress (WSS) fields across the cardiac cycle in intracranial aneurysms from surface mesh inputs. The method employs Graph Harmonic Deformation (GHD) encoding for geometry representation and incorporates temporal waveform features to capture pulsatile flow dynamics. To address the high computational cost of pulsatile CFD data, the approach augments training with large-scale steady-flow data, significantly improving performance when pulsatile samples are limited. The framework enables rapid, patient-specific hemodynamic assessment, bridging the gap between computationally expensive CFD and clinical decision-making.

## Method Summary
The method uses a Graph Transformer architecture that takes surface mesh inputs of intracranial aneurysms and predicts transient WSS fields across the cardiac cycle. The framework incorporates Graph Harmonic Deformation (GHD) encoding to represent aneurysm geometry and integrates temporal waveform features to capture pulsatile flow dynamics. To overcome the computational expense of pulsatile CFD simulations, the model is trained using a combination of pulsatile and steady-flow data, with steady-flow augmentation significantly improving performance when pulsatile training data is limited. The approach enables rapid, patient-specific hemodynamic assessment without requiring computationally expensive CFD simulations.

## Key Results
- Achieves SSIM up to 0.981 and maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8% for WSS prediction
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including Graph U-Nets and geometric transformers
- Accurately predicts derived hemodynamic metrics (TAWSS, OSI, RRT) demonstrating clinical relevance
- Enables real-time prediction, bridging the gap between CFD and clinical decision-making

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Graph Transformer architecture effectively captures spatial relationships in aneurysm surface meshes through message passing between nodes, while the temporal waveform features encode the pulsatile nature of blood flow. The GHD encoding provides a geometry-aware representation that preserves important morphological features. The steady-flow data augmentation strategy addresses the limited availability of pulsatile CFD data by leveraging abundant steady-state simulations, allowing the model to learn general flow patterns that transfer to pulsatile conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- Graph Neural Networks: Needed to process irregular surface mesh data of aneurysms; quick check: can handle variable mesh resolutions and complex geometries
- Graph Transformers: Required for capturing long-range spatial dependencies in aneurysm morphologies; quick check: outperforms standard GNNs on graph-structured data
- Steady-flow augmentation: Essential to overcome limited pulsatile CFD data availability; quick check: improves model performance when pulsatile samples are scarce
- Graph Harmonic Deformation encoding: Provides geometry-aware representation preserving morphological features; quick check: captures shape variations relevant to flow patterns
- Temporal waveform features: Critical for encoding pulsatile flow dynamics across cardiac cycle; quick check: enables prediction of transient WSS fields
- Hemodynamic metrics (TAWSS, OSI, RRT): Clinically relevant derived quantities for aneurysm assessment; quick check: accurately predicted from WSS fields

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Surface Mesh Input -> GHD Encoding -> Graph Transformer -> WSS Prediction -> Derived Metrics (TAWSS, OSI, RRT)

Critical Path:
Surface Mesh Input -> GHD Encoding -> Graph Transformer Layers -> WSS Field Prediction

Design Tradeoffs:
- Graph Transformer vs standard GNN: Better long-range dependency capture but higher computational complexity
- Steady-flow augmentation ratio: Balancing computational efficiency with model performance on pulsatile predictions
- GHD encoding dimensionality: Tradeoff between geometric detail preservation and model complexity

Failure Signatures:
- Poor generalization to aneurysm morphologies structurally different from training data
- Inaccurate predictions in regions of high hemodynamic gradients
- Overfitting to training data distribution when steady-flow augmentation is insufficient

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study on steady-flow augmentation ratio to determine optimal mixing strategy
2. Cross-validation on structurally diverse aneurysm morphologies to assess generalization
3. Uncertainty quantification through ensemble predictions or Monte Carlo dropout

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Clinical validation is limited to qualitative comparisons without establishing ground truth correlations with clinical outcomes or rupture data
- Model's generalization capability to aneurysm morphologies not represented in training data remains unclear
- Evaluation focuses primarily on SSIM and relative L2 error metrics without comprehensive uncertainty quantification

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Technical implementation of Graph Transformer architecture and GHD encoding is well-described and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Steady-flow augmentation strategy appears effective but optimal ratio and mixing strategy not thoroughly explored
- **Medium Confidence**: Good agreement with CFD simulations demonstrated, but clinical relevance for patient risk stratification not established

## Next Checks
1. Perform systematic ablation studies to quantify exact contribution of steady-flow augmentation versus base Graph Transformer architecture
2. Evaluate model performance on held-out test set containing aneurysm morphologies structurally dissimilar to training samples
3. Conduct uncertainty quantification by running ensemble predictions or Monte Carlo dropout to generate confidence intervals for WSS predictions, particularly in regions of high hemodynamic gradients
