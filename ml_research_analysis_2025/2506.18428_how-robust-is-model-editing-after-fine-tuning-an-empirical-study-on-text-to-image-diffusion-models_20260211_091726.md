- This study investigates whether model edits persist after fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates the persistence of model edits through fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. The authors examine two editing methods (UCE, ReFACT) and three fine-tuning approaches (DreamBooth, LoRA, DoRA) across Stable Diffusion and FLUX models on four editing tasks including concept appearance/role edits, gender debiasing, and unsafe content removal. The research reveals that model edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning, with DoRA showing the strongest reversal effect. These findings highlight critical limitations in current editing methodologies and emphasize the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term control of deployed AI systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comprehensive experimental framework comparing edit persistence across different editing and fine-tuning combinations. Researchers systematically apply editing techniques (UCE and ReFACT) to text-to-image diffusion models, then subject edited models to various fine-tuning approaches (DreamBooth, LoRA, DoRA). The evaluation spans multiple models including Stable Diffusion and FLUX, testing four distinct editing tasks: concept appearance/role modifications, gender debiasing, and unsafe content removal. Post-fine-tuning efficacy is measured through quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments to determine how well edits survive the fine-tuning process.

## Key Results
- Edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning, with DoRA exhibiting the strongest edit reversal effect
- UCE demonstrates greater robustness than ReFACT with higher post-tuning efficacy
- Full-size fine-tuning and DoRA are most effective at removing prior edits
- Lightweight methods like DreamBooth better preserve editing effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The edit reversal phenomenon occurs through the fine-tuning process fundamentally modifying the model's learned representations. When fine-tuning methods like DoRA are applied, they actively reshape the model's weights and attention patterns, effectively overwriting the specific modifications made during editing. The study reveals that more aggressive fine-tuning approaches that target larger portions of the model parameters are particularly effective at removing prior edits. This suggests that edit persistence is inversely related to the extent of parameter modifications during fine-tuning, with lightweight methods preserving more of the original editing modifications by making fewer overall changes to the model architecture.

## Foundational Learning
- **Text-to-image diffusion models**: Need to understand how these models generate images from text prompts through iterative denoising processes. Quick check: Verify understanding of forward and reverse diffusion processes.
- **Model editing techniques**: Must grasp how targeted modifications are made to model weights or attention patterns to change specific behaviors. Quick check: Understand difference between editing and fine-tuning at the parameter level.
- **Fine-tuning methodologies**: Need to comprehend various approaches (full, LoRA, DoRA) and their impact on model parameters. Quick check: Compare parameter efficiency and scope of different fine-tuning methods.
- **Edit persistence evaluation**: Must understand metrics and methods for measuring whether edits survive subsequent modifications. Quick check: Know how to measure behavioral changes before and after fine-tuning.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Text encoder -> Cross-attention layers -> UNet backbone -> Diffusion sampling loop -> Image decoder

**Critical path:** Input text prompt → Text encoder → Cross-attention in UNet → Noise prediction → Image generation through iterative denoising

**Design tradeoffs:** Full fine-tuning offers maximum control but highest computational cost; lightweight methods (LoRA, DoRA) reduce resource requirements but may provide less comprehensive modifications; editing methods must balance specificity with generalizability.

**Failure signatures:** Edit reversal manifests as return to baseline behavior for edited concepts; complete loss of intended modifications; inconsistent behavior across similar prompts; degradation in overall model performance.

**First experiments:**
1. Apply UCE editing to a specific concept, then test persistence after DreamBooth fine-tuning
2. Compare edit reversal rates between LoRA and DoRA on the same edited model
3. Measure quantitative performance degradation across different fine-tuning intensities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on Stable Diffusion and FLUX models, potentially limiting generalizability
- Experimental setup tests only four specific editing tasks, possibly missing edge cases
- Study does not investigate mechanisms underlying edit reversal at the architectural level

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: DoRA exhibits strongest edit reversal effect across multiple tasks
- **Medium confidence**: General patterns of edit persistence differences between UCE and ReFACT
- **Medium confidence**: Relative effectiveness rankings of different fine-tuning approaches in removing edits

## Next Checks
1. Test edit persistence across a broader range of editing tasks, including multilingual and multimodal scenarios
2. Investigate the impact of edit persistence on downstream applications through human evaluation studies
3. Examine whether repeated editing-fine-tuning cycles lead to cumulative degradation or adaptation effects
