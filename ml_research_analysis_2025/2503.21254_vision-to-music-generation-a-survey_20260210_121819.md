# Vision-to-Music Generation: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.21254
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21254
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** First comprehensive survey of vision-to-music generation methods, categorizing by input/output types and identifying key technical challenges.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of the emerging field of vision-to-music generation, which encompasses both video-to-music and image-to-music tasks. Unlike general music generation surveys, this work systematically analyzes methodologies specific to vision-music cross-modal synthesis. The authors categorize methods by input types (general videos, human movement videos, images) and output types (symbolic music, audio music), examining technical characteristics and core challenges across the domain.

The survey identifies three critical challenges: lack of standardized benchmarks, limited customization capabilities, and trade-offs between symbolic and audio generation forms. It also highlights the under-utilization of large model capabilities in current approaches. The work provides valuable insights for both academic researchers and industry practitioners looking to advance multimodal AI systems that bridge visual and musical domains.

## Method Summary
This paper is a comprehensive survey rather than a novel method. It defines vision-to-music generation as a task categorized by input types (General Video, Human Movement, Image) and output types (Symbolic, Audio). The survey analyzes existing methods using a standardized three-stage architecture framework: Vision Encoding (using models like CLIP, VideoCLIP, or ViViT), Vision-Music Projection (feature mapping, adapter, or text bridging layers), and Music Generation (auto-regressive like MusicGen or diffusion like AudioLDM).

The survey categorizes datasets (e.g., SymMV for symbolic/video pairs, MusicCaps for audio/video pairs, MUVideo for instruction/video pairs) and evaluation metrics (objective metrics like FAD, KL Divergence, ImageBind Score, CLAP Score; subjective metrics like Melody, Rhythm, Overall Correspondence MOS). While no single training procedure is provided, the survey synthesizes common architectural patterns and evaluation approaches across the field.

## Key Results
- This is the first comprehensive survey specifically focused on vision-to-music generation methods
- Identifies three core input types (general videos, human movement videos, images) and two output types (symbolic music, audio music)
- Standardizes analysis using a three-stage architectural framework across surveyed methods
- Highlights critical challenges including lack of standardized benchmarks, limited customization, and cross-domain generalization issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
This survey works by providing a systematic framework for understanding vision-to-music generation methods through categorization and pattern identification. By analyzing over 40 papers, it extracts common architectural patterns (vision encoding → projection → music generation) and identifies recurring challenges across the field. The survey's methodology of standardizing evaluation metrics and datasets enables meaningful comparisons between different approaches, while highlighting gaps in current research that point toward future directions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-modal representation learning**: Understanding how visual features map to musical features is fundamental to vision-to-music generation. Quick check: Can the model generate musically coherent output from simple visual inputs like color changes or basic movements?
- **Temporal synchronization**: Aligning musical rhythm with visual temporal patterns is critical, especially for video inputs. Quick check: Does the generated music match the pacing and beat of the source video?
- **Discretization vs. continuous generation**: Symbolic music uses discrete tokens while audio uses continuous waveforms, creating different architectural requirements. Quick check: Does the model maintain structural coherence when generating longer sequences?
- **Multimodal evaluation metrics**: FAD, CLAP, and ImageBind scores measure different aspects of cross-modal alignment. Quick check: Do multiple metrics agree on the quality of generated outputs?
- **One-to-many mapping problem**: Single visual inputs can map to multiple valid musical interpretations. Quick check: Can the model generate diverse musical outputs from the same visual input?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Vision Encoder → Vision-Music Projection → Music Generator

**Critical Path**: The vision encoding stage must extract semantically meaningful features that capture both global context and local temporal patterns. The projection layer must effectively bridge the semantic gap between visual and musical feature spaces while preserving rhythmic information.

**Design Tradeoffs**: CLIP-based encoders provide strong semantic understanding but may miss local rhythmic patterns; human movement-specific encoders capture motion but may lack general semantic understanding; auto-regressive models offer better long-term coherence while diffusion models provide higher quality short sequences.

**Failure Signatures**: Rhythmic misalignment (music ignores video cuts/motion), semantic ambiguity (generated music valid but mismatched to specific user intent), and poor cross-domain generalization (models fail on inputs from different distributions than training data).

**First Experiments**: 1) Implement baseline pipeline using CLIP + MusicGen with MusicCaps dataset, 2) Evaluate generated music using FAD and CLAP metrics, 3) Test model on held-out test set with both objective and subjective evaluation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How can the field establish standardized benchmarks and objective metrics that accurately align with human subjective perception? The survey notes current metrics often don't align with human perception and lack standardized datasets, undermining fair model comparisons. Resolution would require unified benchmarks demonstrating high statistical correlation between objective metrics and human evaluations.

**Open Question 2**: What hybrid architectures can effectively combine the controllability of symbolic music with the expressiveness of raw audio generation? The survey identifies a critical trade-off where audio methods offer expressiveness but lack controllability, while symbolic methods offer control but lack data scale. Resolution would require models generating long-duration, high-fidelity audio with precise symbolic-level control over attributes.

**Open Question 3**: How can "human-in-the-loop" frameworks be formally integrated into the training cycle to capture qualitative aspects like narrative tension and stylistic nuance? The survey suggests current systems miss subtle aspects like "narrative tension" and proposes incorporating expert feedback through interactive fine-tuning and active learning. Resolution would require methodologies demonstrating models fine-tuned with active expert feedback outperform those trained solely on static datasets.

## Limitations
- This is a survey paper that summarizes existing methods rather than presenting novel research
- The survey's value depends on completeness and accuracy of coverage in a rapidly evolving field
- Technical details of specific methods are necessarily simplified, potentially obscuring important architectural differences
- No original experimental results or benchmark comparisons are provided

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The survey accurately categorizes existing V2M methods by input/output types and identifies the three-stage architectural pattern. Dataset and metric summaries appear comprehensive.
- **Medium Confidence**: Identification of core challenges is well-supported by literature, though relative importance may evolve as the field matures.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim of being the "first comprehensive survey" appears accurate based on related but distinct survey work in the field.

## Next Checks
1. Verify survey comprehensiveness by checking for missed V2M methods published between 2022-2024 in recent conference proceedings (ICCV, CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR).
2. Test reproducibility of the summarized 3-stage architecture by implementing a simple baseline pipeline using CLIP + MusicGen with MusicCaps dataset, then evaluating with FAD and CLAP metrics.
3. Cross-validate the survey's challenge identifications by running multiple V2M methods from the survey and documenting which specific limitations (rhythmic misalignment, customization issues) manifest most prominently.
