# Filter, Obstruct and Dilute: Defending Against Backdoor Attacks on Semi-Supervised Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.05755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05755
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: BI reduces attack success rate from 84.7% to 1.8% while maintaining clean accuracy in SSL backdoor defense

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of semi-supervised learning (SSL) to backdoor attacks, where adversaries inject triggers into unlabeled data to manipulate model behavior. The authors propose Backdoor Invalidator (BI), a three-stage defense that filters out trigger patterns, obstructs direct trigger-target correlations through complementary learning, and dilutes backdoor influence via trigger mix-up. BI achieves significant reduction in attack success rate while maintaining high clean data accuracy across multiple datasets and attack types.

## Method Summary
Backdoor Invalidator (BI) employs a three-pronged approach to defend SSL against backdoor attacks: Gaussian filtering to remove high-frequency trigger patterns during preprocessing, complementary learning to obstruct direct trigger-target correlations by training models to identify which classes data does NOT belong to, and trigger mix-up to dilute backdoor influence by mixing triggered unlabeled data with clean labeled data. The method operates in two stages - an obstruction phase using complementary learning followed by a dilution phase using mix-up - while applying Gaussian filtering throughout. BI demonstrates effectiveness across multiple attack types including CL-Badnets, Narcissus, DeHiB, Mosaic, and Freq patterns.

## Key Results
- BI reduces attack success rate from 84.7% to 1.8% on CIFAR-10 with FixMatch
- Maintains clean accuracy above 92% across datasets while defending against multiple backdoor attack types
- Theoretical guarantee that complementary risk minimizer coincides with optimal classifier under invertible transition matrix assumption

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Gaussian Filter Removes High-Frequency Trigger Patterns
- Claim: Pre-processing images with a Gaussian filter attenuates noise-like backdoor trigger patterns while preserving semantic image structure.
- Mechanism: The filter convolves images with a Gaussian function, smoothing sudden local pixel changes characteristic of high-frequency triggers before they enter the training pipeline.
- Core assumption: Successful SSL backdoor triggers exhibit noise-like, repetitive, high-frequency patterns that are separable from genuine image content.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 3.1], [corpus] - Limited direct corpus evidence for Gaussian filtering specifically in SSL backdoor defense; related work focuses on detection or post-hoc methods.
- Break condition: If attackers use low-frequency, semantically-aligned triggers indistinguishable from genuine image features, this mechanism's efficacy likely degrades.

### Mechanism 2: Complementary Learning Obstructs Direct Trigger-Target Correlations
- Claim: Training models to identify which classes data does NOT belong to (complementary labels) obstructs the formation of direct spurious correlations between triggers and target classes.
- Mechanism: Replaces standard consistency loss with complementary loss; instead of reinforcing trigger→target mappings, forces the model to establish multiple negative correlations, which is substantially harder for backdoors to exploit.
- Core assumption: Establishing a spurious correlation to one specific target label is easy, but establishing multiple correlations to exclude all other categories is difficult for the backdoor to achieve.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 3.2], [section 4, Theorem 1] - Provides theoretical guarantee that minimizer of complementary risk coincides with optimal classifier from traditional consistency loss (assuming invertible transition matrix Q).
- Break condition: If the transition matrix Q is poorly estimated or non-invertible, complementary labels may not converge to optimal classifier behavior.

### Mechanism 3: Trigger Mix-Up Dilutes Correlations Across All Classes
- Claim: Mixing triggered unlabeled data with clean labeled data associates trigger patterns with multiple classes, neutralizing specific trigger-to-target correlations.
- Mechanism: In stage two training, high-confidence unlabeled data (potentially poisoned) is mixed with labeled data using a mix-up coefficient that ensures the trigger becomes associated with the mixed class label rather than solely the original target.
- Core assumption: Backdoor effectiveness relies on strong, specific one-to-one trigger→target correlations; diluting this across classes weakens attack success.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 3.3], [corpus] - Weak corpus evidence; related defense papers do not explicitly validate mix-up for SSL backdoor dilution.
- Break condition: If mix-up coefficient λ' is poorly tuned or labeled data is extremely scarce, trigger dilution may be insufficient or harm clean accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Pseudo-Labeling**
  - Why needed here: SSL methods like FixMatch and FlexMatch use pseudo-labeling on unlabeled data with consistency regularization; backdoors exploit this by injecting triggers into unlabeled sets that get incorrectly pseudo-labeled as the target class.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how consistency regularization works in FixMatch and why it makes SSL vulnerable to poisoned unlabeled data?

- Concept: **Spurious Correlations in Deep Neural Networks**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames backdoor attacks as exploiting DNNs' tendency to learn spurious correlations (coincidental feature-label associations) between triggers and target classes, which overshadow genuine causal relationships.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a causal feature-label relationship and a spurious correlation, and why do DNNs favor the latter in early training?

- Concept: **Backdoor Attack Characteristics in SSL**
  - Why needed here: SSL-specific backdoor triggers (Mosaic, Freq) differ from supervised learning triggers—they span the entire image, are noise-resistant, and use clean-label poisoning to survive data augmentation.
  - Quick check question: Why do successful SSL backdoor triggers need to be resistant to weak and strong augmentations, and how does this differ from typical supervised learning backdoor triggers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Gaussian Filter → Stage 1: Complementary Label Generator → Transition Matrix Estimator → Complementary Loss on Unlabeled + Supervised Loss on Labeled → Stage 2: Mix-Up Module (λ' sampling) → Mixed Loss + Consistency Loss on High-Confidence Unlabeled Data

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing applies Gaussian Filter (γ radius) to all images
  2. Stage 1: Model trains with complementary loss on unlabeled data for t₁ iterations, learning to reject incorrect classes rather than confirm correct ones
  3. Stage 2: Switch to mix-up + consistency loss, associating any remaining trigger patterns with multiple class labels
  4. Transition matrix Q is estimated online via moving average across batches

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher γ increases backdoor defense but reduces clean accuracy (more image blur)
  - Earlier phase switch (smaller t₁) may better obstruct backdoors but requires more iterations for convergence
  - Smaller α_min (mix-up coefficient) provides milder defense but preserves clean accuracy
  - Complementary learning requires more training iterations than standard consistency loss

- Failure signatures:
  - Clean accuracy drops significantly on low-resolution datasets (CIFAR10/100) when γ is too large
  - Attack success rate remains high (>10%) when target class has inherently high ASR variance (class-dependent vulnerability observed in Figure 7)
  - Stage 1 fails to converge if transition matrix Q estimation is unstable with limited labeled data (nc < 25)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation on Mosaic attack with single components**: Run FixMatch + Gaussian Filter only, FixMatch + Complementary Loss only, and FixMatch + Mix-Up only to isolate each mechanism's contribution to ASR reduction and CA impact (reference Table 3).
  2. **Sensitivity analysis on γ**: Sweep γ ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 1.4} on CIFAR10 and STL10 with Mosaic attack to plot CA vs ASR tradeoff curves (reference Figure 5).
  3. **Cross-attack validation**: Test BI against all 5 attack types (CL-Badnets, Narcissus, DeHiB, Mosaic, Freq) on CIFAR10 with FixMatch to verify ASR reduction from ~85% baseline to <5% (reference Table 1).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical guarantees for complementary learning depend on the invertibility of the transition matrix Q, but practical validation across different datasets and architectures is limited.
- Mix-up dilution assumes abundant labeled data (tested only with 25-400 labeled samples), potentially limiting effectiveness when labeled data is scarce.
- Gaussian filtering's effectiveness relies on high-frequency trigger patterns, making the defense vulnerable to low-frequency or semantically-aligned triggers.
- Evaluation is limited to CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets, restricting generalizability to more complex real-world scenarios.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Empirical attack success rate reduction (84.7% to 1.8%) is well-supported by experimental results across multiple attack types and datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: Complementary learning framework's theoretical convergence guarantees are sound, but practical implementation details (transition matrix estimation accuracy, convergence stability with limited data) require further validation.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about BI's robustness to adaptive attacks and transferability across different SSL architectures are based on limited experimental evidence.

## Next Checks
1. **Transition Matrix Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the number of labeled samples (nc) from 10 to 400 and measure how estimation error in Q affects complementary learning convergence and final backdoor defense performance.
2. **Low-Frequency Trigger Vulnerability Test**: Design and evaluate backdoor triggers with low-frequency patterns (e.g., gradual color shifts, semantic-aligned patterns) that are specifically engineered to evade Gaussian filtering.
3. **Cross-Architecture Generalization**: Implement BI on alternative SSL frameworks beyond FixMatch and FlexMatch (e.g., Mean Teacher, RemixMatch) and evaluate whether the same hyperparameter settings maintain effectiveness.
