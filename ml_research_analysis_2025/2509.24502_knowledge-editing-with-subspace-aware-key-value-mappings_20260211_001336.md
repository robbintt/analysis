core_contribution: This paper introduces SUIT, a method for knowledge editing in large
  language models that improves upon existing approaches by identifying and modifying
  only the subspace of critical features relevant to the edit. While previous locate-then-edit
  methods without constraints cause significant perturbations, SUIT computes a subspace-aware
  key vector that isolates entity-specific features and a residual vector restricted
  to directions that primarily influence the new object's logit.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SUIT, a method for knowledge editing in large language models that improves upon existing approaches by identifying and modifying only the subspace of critical features relevant to the edit. While previous locate-then-edit methods without constraints cause significant perturbations, SUIT computes a subspace-aware key vector that isolates entity-specific features and a residual vector restricted to directions that primarily influence the new object's logit. Experimental results on LLaMA-3-8B, GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that SUIT achieves substantial improvements in specificity while maintaining high edit efficacy and preserving general model capabilities.

## Method Summary
SUIT improves knowledge editing by computing a subspace-aware key vector that isolates entity-specific features and a residual vector restricted to directions that primarily influence the new object's logit. The method first extracts a key vector from the subject's last-token activation, then uses SVD on a large corpus of subject vectors to identify a high-variance "entity-agnostic" subspace. By projecting the key vector out of this common subspace, the resulting constrained key vector encodes primarily entity-specific features. For the residual vector, SUIT learns two orthogonal unit vectors that control the object logits through a magnitude swap mechanism. These subspace-aware vectors are then used in the AlphaEdit weight update formula, resulting in edits that preserve unrelated knowledge better than unconstrained approaches.

## Key Results
- SUIT achieves up to 43.2 points higher specificity than AlphaEdit on LLaMA-3-8B
- Maintains high edit efficacy while significantly reducing perturbation to unrelated knowledge
- Validated across multiple models (LLaMA-3-8B, GPT-J-6B, Qwen2.5-7B) and benchmarks (COUNTERFACT, ZSRE)
- Shows reduced perturbation at subject entities' last token positions compared to MEMIT/AlphaEdit

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Subspace-Aware Key Vector Computation
- **Claim:** Confining the key vector to an entity-specific subspace reduces unintended changes to unrelated knowledge.
- **Mechanism:** The method extracts a key vector from the subject's last-token activation, then uses SVD on a large corpus of subject vectors to identify a high-variance "entity-agnostic" subspace. By projecting the key vector out of this common subspace, the resulting constrained key vector encodes primarily entity-specific features.
- **Core assumption:** Key vectors for different subjects share a low-rank common subspace corresponding to general linguistic or structural features.
- **Evidence anchors:** Variance analysis in Table 2 shows higher variance in entity-specific components; the abstract states SUIT "isolates entity-specific features."

### Mechanism 2: Subspace-Aware Residual Vector via Critical Logit Directions
- **Claim:** Restricting the residual vector to a low-dimensional subspace that governs object logits minimizes unnecessary changes to the residual stream.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of optimizing a full-dimensional residual vector, the method learns two orthogonal unit vectors, w1 and w2. The update swaps the hidden state's magnitudes along these directions: increasing along w1 boosts the new object logit, while decreasing along w2 suppresses the old object logit.
- **Core assumption:** The primary factors controlling the logit for a specific object reside in a low-dimensional subspace.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 6.2.2 analysis shows δ_∥W (in the w1,w2 subspace) is more effective at increasing o* logit despite being ~24% of total norm.

### Mechanism 3: Constrained Weight Update via Subspace-Projected Key and Residual
- **Claim:** Plugging the subspace-aware key and residual vectors into a locate-then-edit update formula preserves unrelated knowledge better than unconstrained updates.
- **Mechanism:** The subspace-aware key k' and residual δ' are used in place of standard k and δ in the AlphaEdit weight update formula.
- **Core assumption:** The AlphaEdit formula's effectiveness at preserving knowledge transfers when inputs (k, δ) are already constrained to relevant subspaces.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 6.2.1 analysis shows SUIT's ∆k has negligible proportion in entity-agnostic subspace (Table 3).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Linear Representation Hypothesis**
  - Why needed here: SUIT is explicitly grounded in this hypothesis—the idea that hidden states are linear combinations of semantic features in distinct subspaces is the basis for subspace isolation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how this hypothesis justifies decomposing a key vector into entity-specific and entity-agnostic components?

- **Concept: Linear Associative Memory in MLP Layers**
  - Why needed here: Locate-then-edit methods view the MLP down-projection as a key→value associative memory, where editing means changing this mapping for a specific key.
  - Quick check question: In the equation Wk = v, what do k and v represent in the context of factual knowledge (s, r, o)?

- **Concept: Locate-Then-Edit Knowledge Editing (ROME/MEMIT/AlphaEdit)**
  - Why needed here: SUIT builds directly on AlphaEdit's update formula and the broader locate-then-edit paradigm; understanding how these methods compute ∆ is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does AlphaEdit's update formula differ from a simple least-squares solution for ∆k ≈ r, and what role does the projection matrix P play?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Pre-compute entity-agnostic subspace (SVD on 10k subjects) → Key Vector Subspace Filter (project k to k') → Residual Vector Subspace Optimizer (learn w1, w2 with λ penalty) → Constrained Weight Update Calculator (apply AlphaEdit formula) → Apply ∆ to layers 4-8
- **Critical path:** Success depends on accurate SVD-based subspace identification, successful learning of semantically meaningful w1, w2 directions, and the combined effect of k' and δ' in the update formula
- **Design tradeoffs:** τ_energy controls entity-agnostic feature removal (higher = more specificity but risk of over-constraining); λ controls orthogonality of w1, w2 (higher = more divergent directions but may reduce efficacy)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low specificity: τ_energy too low or flawed subspace identification
  - Low efficacy: τ_energy too high or λ too high
  - High perturbation: SVD subspace unstable or captures wrong features
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate subspace decomposition: Replicate Table 2 variance analysis
  2. Measure perturbation reduction: Replicate Figure 3 L2 norm comparison
  3. Hyperparameter sensitivity ablation: Vary τ_energy and λ as in Figure 5

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the optimization constraints be modified to fully disentangle the roles of feature directions w1 and w2 so that each exclusively affects a single object logit?
- Basis: Section 6.2.2 observes that w1 also suppresses the old object and w2 promotes the new object
- Why unresolved: Current penalty term encourages distinct directions but doesn't enforce hard constraints preventing cross-influence
- What evidence would resolve it: Introducing a loss term penalizing cross-influence on non-target logits and measuring impact on specificity

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does modeling the interaction between feature directions w1 and w2 (relaxing the orthogonality assumption) improve the precision of knowledge edits?
- Basis: Section 4.3 states the method ignores interactions between w1 and w2 to implement a simple additive update
- Why unresolved: Simplified for tractability but may introduce approximation errors if optimal edit directions aren't perfectly orthogonal
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing current additive update against variants accounting for non-orthogonal interaction terms

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the entity-agnostic subspace K_s^⊥ stable across different domains, or does it require domain-specific recomputation to maintain high specificity?
- Basis: Section 4.2 defines entity-agnostic subspace using 10,000 general subjects from ParaRel
- Why unresolved: Features considered "agnostic" in general text might be "specific" in specialized domains
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating SUIT's performance on domain-specific datasets using general vs. domain-specific subspaces

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness depends on the validity of key assumptions about subspace decomposition that require further validation
- The entity-agnostic subspace computed from ParaRel subjects may not generalize across different domains or model architectures
- Hyperparameter τ_energy is chosen somewhat arbitrarily without systematic exploration of its impact

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Experimental results showing SUIT's superiority over baselines on multiple models and benchmarks
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism by which SUIT achieves reduced perturbation through subspace constraints
- **Medium Confidence:** The generalizability of the entity-agnostic subspace across different domains and models

## Next Checks

1. **Subspace Stability Test:** Recompute the entity-agnostic subspace using different random seeds for ParaRel subject selection and measure variance in the SVD components

2. **Dimensionality Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary τ_energy (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) and measure corresponding changes in Specificity, Efficacy, and Generalization

3. **Critical Subspace Validation:** Conduct ablation studies varying the number of basis vectors (currently fixed at 2) and measure impact on edit quality
