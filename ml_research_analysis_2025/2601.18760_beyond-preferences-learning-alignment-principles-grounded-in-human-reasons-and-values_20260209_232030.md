# Beyond Preferences: Learning Alignment Principles Grounded in Human Reasons and Values

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18760
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18760
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes Grounded Constitutional AI (GCAI), a unified framework that generates alignment principles from both human preference annotations with reasons and general value statements, improving upon existing approaches that rely solely on preference data.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning large language models to human values in pluralistic societies by proposing Grounded Constitutional AI (GCAI), a unified framework for generating constitutions of alignment principles. GCAI generates contextual principles from human preference annotations with reasons and general principles from human statements of values, improving upon the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) approach that relies solely on preference data. In human evaluations, participants strongly preferred the GCAI-generated constitution over ICAI across multiple dimensions including moral grounding (96% preference), personal preference (80% preference), and coherence (74% preference).

The GCAI framework demonstrates that incorporating both preference data with reasoning and direct value statements produces more ethically grounded and coherent alignment principles. Models aligned to the GCAI constitution showed consistent thematic differences, with greater emphasis on ethics, safety, and non-discrimination compared to ICAI-aligned models, while maintaining similar performance on standard benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The GCAI framework integrates two types of human input: preference annotations with reasons and general statements of values. Using these inputs, the system generates contextual principles that explain specific preference decisions and general principles that capture broader value statements. The framework employs supervised fine-tuning on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (AHH) dataset, with models trained using constitutional fine-tuning that incorporates the generated principles. The process involves first collecting preference data with accompanying reasons, then extracting value statements from various sources, and finally using these to generate a comprehensive constitution of alignment principles that guide model behavior.

## Key Results
- Human participants strongly preferred GCAI-generated constitutions over ICAI across multiple dimensions: moral grounding (96% preference), personal preference (80% preference), and coherence (74% preference)
- GCAI constitutions were considered more ethically grounded and focused on safety and fairness, while ICAI emphasized direct responses and clarity
- Models aligned to GCAI constitutions showed greater emphasis on ethics, safety, and non-discrimination compared to ICAI-aligned models, with similar benchmark performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind GCAI's effectiveness lies in its ability to ground alignment principles in both specific human preferences and broader value systems. By incorporating reasons for preferences alongside the preferences themselves, the framework captures the contextual and moral dimensions that pure preference data misses. The addition of general value statements provides a foundation of shared principles that can guide behavior across diverse scenarios. This dual-input approach allows the generated constitution to be both practically relevant (grounded in actual preference data) and ethically coherent (rooted in stated values), creating alignment principles that better reflect the complexity of human values.

## Foundational Learning
- Constitutional AI fine-tuning: Why needed - enables alignment without extensive human feedback; Quick check - verify principle extraction from constitutions
- Preference annotation with reasoning: Why needed - captures contextual and moral dimensions of choices; Quick check - ensure reasons are diverse and meaningful
- Value statement extraction: Why needed - grounds principles in broader ethical frameworks; Quick check - validate that extracted values are coherent and representative
- Supervised fine-tuning on preference datasets: Why needed - provides baseline model behavior; Quick check - confirm dataset quality and coverage
- Human evaluation methodology: Why needed - assesses subjective quality of generated principles; Quick check - ensure participant diversity and evaluation consistency

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Data Collection -> Principle Generation -> Constitutional Fine-tuning -> Model Evaluation

**Critical Path**
1. Collect preference annotations with reasons and general value statements
2. Generate contextual and general principles from the collected data
3. Create a comprehensive constitution from the generated principles
4. Perform constitutional fine-tuning on the base model using the constitution
5. Evaluate model behavior through human assessments and benchmarks

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Balanced input diversity vs. coherence: Using both preference data and value statements increases diversity but may reduce coherence if not properly integrated
- Principle specificity vs. generalizability: More specific principles may be more actionable but less applicable across contexts
- Human evaluation depth vs. scale: In-depth evaluations provide richer insights but limit sample size and generalizability

**Failure Signatures**
- Inconsistent principles that contradict each other
- Over-reliance on specific contexts leading to poor generalization
- Principles that are too abstract to guide practical behavior
- Bias in collected data leading to skewed alignment

**First Experiments**
1. Compare GCAI-generated principles against human-written constitutions for coherence and ethical grounding
2. Evaluate model outputs aligned with GCAI constitution against baseline models on safety and ethical metrics
3. Test the generalizability of GCAI principles across different cultural contexts and value systems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small human evaluation sample size (49 participants) raises questions about generalizability
- Limited examination of how GCAI principles perform across diverse cultural contexts and demographic groups
- Focus on short conversations may not capture the complexity of real-world interactions

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Methodological innovation of combining preference annotations with value statements
- Clear articulation of the GCAI framework and its relationship to constitutional AI approaches

**Medium confidence:**
- Comparative performance metrics given limited sample size and potential selection bias
- Thematic analysis of model behavior differences between GCAI and ICAI-aligned models

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale human evaluation with diverse participant demographics to confirm the robustness of the preference results
2. Test GCAI-aligned models across longer conversation sequences and more complex task scenarios to assess real-world applicability
3. Perform cross-cultural validation studies to evaluate how well GCAI principles generalize across different value systems and societal norms
