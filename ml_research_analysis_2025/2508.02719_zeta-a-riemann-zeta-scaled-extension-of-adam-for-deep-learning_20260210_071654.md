# ZetA: A Riemann Zeta-Scaled Extension of Adam for Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.02719
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02719
- **Reference count:** 4
- **Primary result:** ZetA improves test accuracy by 3.5% on noisy CIFAR-10 and 2.7% on CIFAR-100 compared to Adam

## Executive Summary
ZetA introduces a novel optimizer that extends Adam by integrating Riemann zeta function-based gradient scaling to improve generalization and robustness in deep learning. The method employs a hybrid update mechanism combining adaptive damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss, and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Experiments on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 show consistent test accuracy improvements over Adam, with gains up to 3.5% on noisy data and 2.7% on CIFAR100. A lightweight fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings demonstrates that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust alternative to Adam, especially in noisy or high-granularity classification tasks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dynamic zeta-based gradient scaling
- Claim: Dynamic zeta-based gradient scaling modulates update magnitudes to stabilize training under gradient variance
- Mechanism: The Riemann zeta function ζ(s_t) is evaluated at a dynamically cycling exponent s_t ∈ (1, 2]. The update term divides by ∥g_t∥^{s_t-1} · ζ(s_t), damping large gradients more aggressively while preserving small gradient updates
- Core assumption: The analytic convergence properties of ζ(s) for s > 1 transfer meaningful regularization to gradient scaling; the cycling schedule aligns with training dynamics
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function"; [Section 3] "the term 1/∥g_t∥^{s_t-1}+ε provides adaptive damping based on gradient magnitude, exploiting ζ(s_t)'s decreasing behavior to stabilize large gradients"
- Break condition: If gradient norms cluster near a narrow range, the adaptive damping term provides minimal differentiation; if s_t converges to values where ζ(s_t) ≈ 1, the zeta contribution becomes negligible

### Mechanism 2: Cosine similarity-based momentum boosting
- Claim: Cosine similarity-based momentum boosting reinforces consistent descent directions while suppressing oscillatory updates
- Mechanism: Compute ρ_t = max(0, ⟨g_t, g_{t-1}⟩ / (∥g_t∥·∥g_{t-1}∥ + ε)) between consecutive gradients. The boost factor b_t = 1 + δ_t · 0.2 · ρ_t increases momentum when gradients align, accelerating convergence along stable directions
- Core assumption: Gradient alignment correlates with productive descent directions rather than pathological oscillations in narrow valleys
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3] "This reinforces consistent descent directions when gradients align, reducing oscillatory updates"; [Section 5] "zeta-based gradient scaling, which dynamically modulates update magnitudes" (implicitly attributes stability to combined mechanism)
- Break condition: If gradients are nearly orthogonal across consecutive steps (common in high-curvature regions), ρ_t ≈ 0 and boost provides no benefit; if loss landscape has many local plateaus, alignment may not indicate productive direction

### Mechanism 3: SAM-style perturbations with entropy regularization
- Claim: SAM-style perturbations combined with entropy regularization improve generalization by seeking flat minima and calibrated confidence
- Mechanism: Perturb parameters as θ+ = θ + γ·u_t/(∥u_t∥ + ε) before computing the update, encouraging robustness to small parameter shifts. Entropy regularization L_entropy = L_CE - λ·E[-∑p_k log p_k] penalizes overconfident predictions
- Core assumption: Flat minima correlate with generalization; entropy penalty improves calibration without conflicting with perturbation-driven flatness seeking
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3] "ZetA integrates a SAM-inspired perturbation to seek flatter minima"; [Section 3] "promotes smoother posterior distributions, enhancing calibration under uncertainty"
- Break condition: If SAM perturbation scale γ is too large relative to loss curvature, perturbation may exit the basin; if entropy weight λ is too high, predictions become underconfident and accuracy degrades

## Foundational Learning

- **Riemann zeta function ζ(s) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^s for Re(s) > 1**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why ζ(s) decreases monotonically for s > 1 and why the paper restricts s ∈ (1, 2] is essential to interpret the scaling mechanism
  - Quick check question: Compute ζ(1.5) using scipy—does it match the paper's stated ≈ 2.612?

- **Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) intuition**
  - Why needed here: SAM is not a minor modification; it requires a second forward-backward pass per step. Understanding the computational overhead is critical for practical adoption
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why perturbing weights in the gradient ascent direction before descent encourages flat minima?

- **Gradient centralization**
  - Why needed here: The paper applies g_t ← g_t - mean(g_t, dim=1) for weight matrices. This zero-centers gradients per output dimension
  - Quick check question: For a weight matrix [d_out, d_in], what does dim=1 centralization accomplish versus dim=0?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Gradient clipping → Gradient centralization → Compute moments → Compute both update terms → Blend → Apply SAM → Update with cosine-scheduled LR
- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize m_0 = 0, v_0 = 0, ∥g∥_EMA = 0, L_EMA = loss at init
  2. Per iteration: Clip → Centralize → Compute moments → Compute both update terms → Blend → Apply SAM → Update with cosine-scheduled LR
  3. Store g_{t-1} for next iteration's cosine similarity
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **α (Adam vs. Zeta mix):** α → 1 recovers Adam; α → 0 relies entirely on zeta scaling. Paper does not specify optimal α; requires tuning
  - **Computational cost:** SAM requires two forward/backward passes per step. Mixed-precision helps but ≈2× per-step cost
  - **Hyperparameter count:** Adds s_min, s_max, δ, α, γ, λ beyond Adam's β_1, β_2, ε, η. More tuning surface
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **NaN in ζ(s_t):** If s_t ≤ 1, zeta diverges. Ensure s_min > 1
  - **Gradient explosion despite clipping:** EMA-based damping may lag; if ∥g∥_EMA underestimates current ∥g∥, damping is insufficient
  - **No improvement over Adam:** If learning rate not adjusted (paper uses η=0.0015 for ZetA vs. 0.001 for Adam), unfair comparison. Always retune η
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline parity check:** Train the same 2-layer FC network on CIFAR-10 with Adam (η=0.001) vs. ZetA (η=0.0015) for 5 epochs. Verify the paper's reported accuracy gap exists in your implementation
  2. **Ablation study:** Disable each component (zeta scaling, cosine boost, SAM, entropy) one at a time. Quantify each component's contribution to the accuracy gain
  3. **Noise robustness test:** Inject 10% label noise into CIFAR-10. Compare Adam vs. ZetA degradation. Confirm ZetA's claimed 3.5% relative improvement holds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Does ZetA satisfy formal convergence guarantees under standard convex or non-convex optimization assumptions?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Conclusion states "Future work includes...formally analyzing its convergence properties"
  - Why unresolved: The paper introduces multiple interacting mechanisms (zeta scaling, SAM perturbations, entropy regularization) without theoretical analysis of their combined dynamics
  - What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof establishing convergence rates or conditions, or counterexamples showing non-convergence

- **Question:** Do ZetA's performance gains generalize to transformer architectures and sequence modeling tasks?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Conclusion identifies "extending ZetA to transformer architectures, applying it to sequence models in NLP" as future work
  - Why unresolved: Experiments only cover small image classification datasets using a lightweight fully connected network
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks on standard NLP tasks (e.g., language modeling, machine translation) comparing ZetA against Adam and other baselines

- **Question:** Which of ZetA's five components (zeta scaling, cosine boosting, entropy regularization, SAM perturbations, gradient centralization) are necessary for the observed improvements?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The method combines multiple mechanisms without ablation studies; improvements cannot be attributed to individual components
  - Why unresolved: The paper reports only end-to-end comparisons against Adam, leaving component contributions unquantified
  - What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation experiments isolating each mechanism while controlling for others

## Limitations

- Critical hyperparameters (s_min, s_max, δ, α, γ, ρ) are not specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Computational cost of SAM-style perturbations (≈2× per-step cost) is not explicitly discussed in terms of wall-clock time or memory impact
- Generalization to larger models and datasets is mentioned but not deeply analyzed with ablation studies

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The core algorithmic framework combining Adam with zeta scaling, cosine similarity boosting, and entropy regularization is well-defined and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence:** The noise robustness results are promising but depend heavily on the unspecified hyperparameters; computational efficiency claim is plausible but unverified
- **Low confidence:** The generalization to larger models and datasets is mentioned but lacks deep analysis and ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary s_min (1.1-1.5), s_max (1.5-2.0), δ (0.1-0.5), and α (0.3-0.7) on CIFAR-10 to identify optimal ranges and ensure zeta scaling is functioning as intended
2. **Computational Overhead Measurement:** Measure wall-clock time per epoch for ZetA vs. Adam on a standard GPU (e.g., RTX 4090) with mixed-precision enabled, confirming the practical efficiency claim
3. **Ablation Study on Large Model:** Train ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100 with each ZetA component (zeta scaling, cosine boost, SAM, entropy) disabled individually to quantify each mechanism's contribution to the 2.7% improvement
