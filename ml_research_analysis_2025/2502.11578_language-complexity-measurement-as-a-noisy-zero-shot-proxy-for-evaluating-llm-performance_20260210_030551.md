# Language Complexity Measurement as a Noisy Zero-Shot Proxy for Evaluating LLM Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.11578
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11578
- Authors: Birger Moell; Johan Boye
- Reference count: 20
- Models tested on LIX and ADD metrics using Swedish texts; ChatGPT-o1-mini achieved LIX error of 7.4 and lowest ADD differences, with negative correlation (-0.875, p=0.026) between LIX accuracy and MMLU scores across six models

## Executive Summary
This study proposes using language complexity metrics as a zero-shot proxy for evaluating large language model capabilities. The authors tested six models on computing LIX readability and Average Dependency Distance metrics using Swedish texts, finding that ChatGPT-o1-mini achieved the best performance. They discovered a strong negative correlation between LIX accuracy and MMLU benchmark scores across models, suggesting that language complexity measurement abilities can serve as a noisy indicator of general LLM capabilities. The method is language-independent and requires no extensive benchmarking datasets, making it practical for rapid model evaluation.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated six language models on their ability to compute two language complexity metrics: LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability and Average Dependency Distance (ADD) using Swedish texts. Models were tested using zero-shot prompting without any task-specific fine-tuning or adaptation. Performance was measured by comparing model outputs to ground truth values for both metrics. The LIX metric calculates readability based on sentence length and long-word frequency, while ADD measures syntactic complexity through average distances between syntactically related words. The authors then correlated the models' LIX accuracy with their MMLU benchmark scores to assess whether language complexity measurement performance predicts general capabilities.

## Key Results
- ChatGPT-o1-mini achieved the best performance with LIX error of 7.4 and lowest ADD differences across all tested models
- Strong negative correlation (r=-0.875, p=0.026) found between LIX accuracy and MMLU benchmark scores across six models
- Language complexity measurement method proved language-independent and practical for rapid model evaluation without requiring extensive benchmarking datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on the observation that accurate computation of language complexity metrics requires sophisticated understanding of syntactic structures, semantic relationships, and linguistic patterns. Models that can correctly parse sentence structures and identify long words while understanding their distribution across text demonstrate advanced language processing capabilities. The negative correlation with MMLU scores suggests that these computational abilities align with broader language understanding and reasoning skills measured by standardized benchmarks.

## Foundational Learning
- Language complexity metrics (LIX, ADD) - These metrics quantify different aspects of text complexity through sentence structure analysis and word distribution patterns. Why needed: Provide quantitative measures of linguistic sophistication that models must compute accurately. Quick check: Can the model correctly identify sentence boundaries and word lengths in Swedish text?
- Zero-shot evaluation methodology - Testing models without task-specific adaptation or fine-tuning. Why needed: Ensures the evaluation reflects general language understanding rather than memorization of task-specific patterns. Quick check: Does the model perform well without any examples or demonstrations?
- Statistical correlation analysis - Measuring relationships between different performance metrics. Why needed: Determines whether language complexity measurement ability predicts general LLM capabilities. Quick check: Is the correlation statistically significant with appropriate sample sizes?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Language Input -> Parsing Engine -> Metric Computation -> Output Validation -> Performance Evaluation

Critical Path: The model must first accurately parse Swedish text structure, then correctly compute linguistic features (sentence counts, word lengths, syntactic dependencies), and finally produce numerical metric values that match ground truth within acceptable error margins.

Design Tradeoffs: Zero-shot evaluation maximizes generalizability but may miss task-specific optimization opportunities. Swedish language focus enables testing without translation needs but limits cross-linguistic validation. Single-run testing reduces computational cost but increases result uncertainty.

Failure Signatures: High LIX errors indicate problems with sentence boundary detection or long-word identification. Large ADD differences suggest difficulties with syntactic parsing and dependency relationship tracking. Poor correlation with MMLU may indicate that language complexity tasks don't capture all aspects of model capability.

3 First Experiments:
1. Test model performance on LIX and ADD metrics across multiple Swedish text samples of varying complexity levels
2. Evaluate the same models on equivalent complexity metrics for English texts to assess language independence
3. Conduct multi-run testing (5+ runs) for each model to establish performance variance and reliability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Sample size limited to only six models tested across two complexity metrics, reducing generalizability
- Single-run testing protocol introduces substantial uncertainty about result stability and performance variance
- Swedish language focus creates uncertainty about whether findings extend to other languages with different syntactic structures

## Confidence
- Language complexity metrics as zero-shot proxies: Medium
- Strong correlation between LIX accuracy and MMLU performance: Low
- Method's language independence and practicality: High
- ChatGPT-o1-mini as best performer: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multi-run evaluations (minimum 5 runs per model) to establish performance variance and reliability of results
2. Test the methodology across 10+ additional languages spanning different language families and syntactic structures
3. Expand the study to include 20+ models with diverse architectures and training approaches to strengthen correlation analysis and generalizability findings
