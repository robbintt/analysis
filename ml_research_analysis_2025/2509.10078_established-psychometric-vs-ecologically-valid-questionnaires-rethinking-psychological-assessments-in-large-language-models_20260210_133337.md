core_contribution: This paper compares established psychometric questionnaires with
  ecologically valid questionnaires for assessing psychological constructs in large
  language models. The study reveals that established questionnaires yield substantially
  different profiles from ecologically valid ones, suffer from higher measurement
  uncertainty, create false impressions of consistent constructs, and produce exaggerated
  results for persona-prompted models.

# Established Psychometric vs. Ecologically Valid Questionnaires: Rethinking Psychological Assessments in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.10078
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10078
- Reference count: 21
- Established questionnaires yield substantially different profiles from ecologically valid ones, with mean absolute differences of 0.74-0.75 points and higher measurement uncertainty (confidence intervals 0.913-1.337 vs 0.656-0.721).

## Executive Summary
This paper reveals fundamental discrepancies between established psychometric questionnaires and ecologically valid assessments when applied to large language models. The study demonstrates that established questionnaires (BFI, PVQ) produce profiles substantially different from ecologically valid assessments (Value Portrait), suffer from higher measurement uncertainty, create false impressions of consistent psychological constructs, and exaggerate persona-induced differences. These findings challenge the validity of using traditional human psychology tools to assess LLM characteristics, suggesting researchers need new assessment approaches that better reflect real-world LLM deployment contexts.

## Method Summary
The study compared four established questionnaires (BFI-10, BFI-44, PVQ-21, PVQ-40) against the Value Portrait dataset across 10 LLM models. Each item was presented in 6 prompt variants (3 instruction versions × 2 orderings). Responses were converted to numeric scores and aggregated by construct. The analysis employed Mean Absolute Difference for profile comparison, Spearman rank correlation for similarity, 1,000-iteration bootstrap for confidence intervals, and Average Inter-item Correlation for consistency measurement. Item-construct recognition tests were conducted to assess whether models identified which construct each item measured.

## Key Results
- Established questionnaires show mean absolute differences of 0.74-0.75 points from ecologically valid assessments
- Established questionnaires have wider confidence intervals (0.913-1.337 vs 0.656-0.721), indicating higher measurement uncertainty
- Item-recognition accuracy is 89-95% for established questionnaires versus 20% for ecologically valid items
- Established questionnaires produce exaggerated persona effects compared to ecologically valid assessments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Established questionnaires may produce artificially high response consistency because LLMs recognize the measurement intent and respond in expected patterns. When measurement intent is obscured—as in ecologically valid items—this consistency diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
Limited item counts in established questionnaires may produce unstable measurements with higher uncertainty compared to ecologically valid questionnaires with more items. More items reduce sampling variance, and LLMs lack human attention constraints.

### Mechanism 3
Established questionnaires may exaggerate persona-induced differences in psychological profiles, producing patterns that don't emerge in ecologically valid contexts. When assigned personas, LLMs access learned associations between persona types and expected questionnaire responses.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Ecological validity in LLM assessment**
  - Why needed here: Distinguishes whether assessment items resemble real-world deployment contexts versus hypothetical self-report scenarios
  - Quick check question: Does the assessment context match how the LLM is actually used in deployment?

- **Concept: Average Inter-item Correlation (AIC)**
  - Why needed here: Measures internal consistency of items supposedly measuring the same construct
  - Quick check question: Are items within a construct correlated because they measure the same thing, or because they trigger similar pattern-matching responses?

- **Concept: Bootstrap confidence intervals for construct scores**
  - Why needed here: Quantifies measurement uncertainty; wider intervals suggest insufficient items or unstable measurement
  - Quick check question: If you resampled items with replacement 1000 times, how much would the construct score vary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Questionnaire item bank → Inference pipeline (6 prompt variants) → Scoring layer (Likert-to-numeric) → Construct aggregation → Analysis layer (MAD, Spearman, bootstrap, AIC, recognition testing)
- **Critical path**: Item presentation → LLM response → Score normalization → Construct aggregation → Uncertainty quantification → Cross-questionnaire comparison
- **Design tradeoffs**: Established questionnaires offer comparability to human literature but lack ecological validity; ecologically valid questionnaires better reflect deployment contexts but require new validation
- **Failure signatures**: Negative AIC on constructs with reverse-coded items; uniform responses regardless of context; recognition accuracy near 100% with low real-world differentiation
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run bootstrap analysis on your questionnaire: Resample items 1000 times with replacement, compute 95% CIs for each construct score to assess measurement stability
  2. Test item-construct recognition: Prompt the same LLM to identify which construct each item measures; high accuracy suggests potential response bias
  3. Compare persona effects across questionnaire types: Assign contrasting personas, measure constructs with both established and ecologically valid items; divergent patterns indicate questionnaire-specific artifacts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Do the discrepancies between established and ecologically valid questionnaires persist across non-English languages and diverse cultural frameworks?
- What is the optimal number of items required to achieve stable psychometric measurements in LLMs, given that they do not suffer from human fatigue?
- To what extent does safety alignment training cause the observed divergence between established and ecologically valid personality assessments?

## Limitations

- Questionnaire availability and representativeness: The study relies on specific established questionnaires and a custom Value Portrait dataset with partially unspecified construct annotations
- Model behavior consistency: Some models exhibit uniform responses across items, suggesting potential systematic response biases not fully characterized
- Persona implementation: Hero/villain and demographic persona prompts may not capture the full complexity of how LLMs internalize and express persona-consistent behavior

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Established questionnaires produce substantially different profiles from ecologically valid assessments (MAD 0.74-0.75)
- **Medium confidence**: Measurement uncertainty conclusions (CI widths 0.913-1.337 vs 0.656-0.721)
- **Medium confidence**: Item-recognition accuracy findings (89-95% vs 20%)
- **Low confidence**: Persona exaggeration claims due to insufficient specific evidence

## Next Checks

1. **Bootstrap sensitivity analysis**: Repeat the CI width calculations using different bootstrap sampling strategies and iteration counts to verify the stability of measurement uncertainty estimates

2. **Recognition accuracy validation**: Conduct controlled experiments where models are explicitly instructed to either "respond honestly" or "guess which construct this measures" for the same items

3. **Cross-dataset ecological validity**: Apply both questionnaire types to a separate ecologically valid dataset (e.g., real customer service interactions) to determine whether the profile differences persist in deployment contexts distinct from the original Value Portrait corpus
