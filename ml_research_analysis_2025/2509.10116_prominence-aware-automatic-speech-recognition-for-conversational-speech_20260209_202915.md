- This paper presents the first prominence-aware ASR system for spontaneous speech using wav2vec2 representations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to integrating prominence detection directly into automatic speech recognition systems. Using wav2vec2-based models fine-tuned on Austrian German conversational speech, the authors developed prominence detectors that classify words into prominence levels without requiring forced alignments or traditional prosodic feature extraction. The system achieves 85.53% accuracy in distinguishing unaccented from strongly accented words when the recognized word sequence is correct. By incorporating prominence information into ASR training, performance remains comparable to baseline systems while enabling simultaneous transcription of words and their prominence levels. This represents the first prominence-aware ASR system for spontaneous speech, with potential applications in linguistic research and dialogue systems.

## Method Summary
The approach uses wav2vec2 XLSR pre-trained representations to encode prosodic information for prominence detection. Manual prominence annotations on a subset of Austrian German conversational speech train prominence detectors (PDET) using CTC loss. These detectors automatically label a larger corpus, which is then used to train prominence-aware ASR systems. Prominence information is encoded at the character level (e.g., "d0i0e0" for a non-prominent word), allowing joint transcription-prominence learning. The system evaluates using Prominence Error Rate (PER) and Word Error Rate (WER), comparing performance across different decoding strategies and prominence level configurations.

## Key Results
- Binary prominence detector (PL0 vs PL2) achieved 85.53% accuracy on correctly recognized word sequences
- Three-level prominence classification accuracy was 69.45%, with PL1 showing poor detection (49% recall)
- ASR performance remained comparable to baseline systems with absolute WER deterioration of 1.6-2.3%
- The approach works without forced alignments, relying solely on wav2vec2 representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Self-supervised wav2vec2 representations encode prosodic prominence information without requiring explicit acoustic feature extraction. The wav2vec2 architecture's convolutional layers capture phonetic features while transformer layers hierarchically integrate suprasegmental patterns. These learned representations implicitly encode prominence cues (energy, duration, spectral emphasis) that traditionally required separate F0, RMS, and duration extraction pipelines. Core assumption: Wav2vec2 pre-training on diverse speech exposes the model to sufficient prosodic variation to learn prominence-relevant patterns. Evidence: Transformer-based models can effectively encode prosodic information and wav2vec2 codebook entries encode languages, language varieties, speaking styles and speakers. Break condition: If target speech exhibits prominence patterns substantially different from pre-training data, representations may not transfer effectively without additional domain-specific fine-tuning.

### Mechanism 2
Character-level prominence encoding enables joint transcription-prominence learning without degrading word recognition accuracy. Each character token is augmented with a prominence suffix (e.g., "a2 l2 l2 e2" for a prominent word "alle"). CTC loss learns to align audio frames to this extended token sequence. The expanded vocabulary (~102 tokens vs. ~37 baseline) increases search space but wav2vec2's acoustic representations provide sufficient signal to disambiguate. Core assumption: Prominence is consistent across all characters within a prosodic word, allowing uniform label assignment. Evidence: Integration of prominence information did not change performance compared to baseline ASR system and WERs of prominence-aware ASR systems were comparable to baseline. Break condition: If word boundaries are frequently misrecognized, prominence labels cannot be reliably assigned (only 52-66% of utterances aligned in experiments). Performance degrades when expanding to three prominence levels due to increased token vocabulary and label ambiguity.

### Mechanism 3
Two-stage annotation (detector → corpus labeling → ASR training) enables scaling prominence-aware systems with limited manual annotations. A small manually-annotated subset (~4.4 hours) trains an initial detector. This detector automatically labels a larger corpus (~14.4 hours after filtering). The expanded labeled data then trains the final prominence-aware ASR. This pseudo-labeling approach trades annotation precision for quantity. Core assumption: Detector errors are sufficiently random or inconsequential that they do not systematically bias downstream ASR training. Evidence: Automatic annotation of the entire GRCS component was based on word boundaries from forced alignments and study demonstrates prominence detection in conversational speech using wav2vec2 is feasible without relying on forced alignments. Break condition: If the initial detector has systematic biases (e.g., over-predicting prominence for certain speakers or word types), these errors propagate to final ASR. The lower accuracy for three-level classification (69.45%) suggests this approach works best for coarse binary distinctions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses CTC to train both prominence detectors and ASR systems without requiring frame-level alignments. CTC learns to map variable-length audio sequences to token sequences by introducing a blank token and allowing repeated symbols.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why CTC enables training without forced alignments, and what the "blank" token accomplishes during decoding?

- Concept: **wav2vec2 self-supervised representations**
  - Why needed here: The entire approach depends on wav2vec2 XLSR pre-trained representations encoding prosodic information. Understanding the convolutional encoder + transformer architecture helps diagnose what linguistic information is captured at each layer.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the convolutional feature encoder and the transformer context network in wav2vec2, and why might each be relevant for prosodic vs. phonetic information?

- Concept: **Prominence annotation schemes (KIM)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses the Kiel Intonation Model's 4-level prominence scale (0=none, 1=weak, 2=strong, 3=emphatic), collapsing to 2-3 levels. Understanding perceptual prominence vs. acoustic correlates clarifies why PL1 proved unreliable.
  - Quick check question: Why might intermediate prominence levels (PL1) show lower inter-annotator agreement than extreme levels (PL0 vs. PL2), and what does this imply for automatic classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
Raw Audio → Wav2vec2-XLSR (frozen or fine-tuned)
         → CTC Head (prominence-only OR character+prominence)
         → Decoder (greedy for prominence output, beam+LM for words-only)

Training Pipeline:
Manual prominence labels (4.4h) → PDET training → Auto-annotate corpus (14.4h) → ASR training

- Critical path:
  1. Obtain/verify manual prominence annotations on subset (KIM scheme or similar)
  2. Train PDET02 (binary: PL0 vs PL2) first—achieves higher accuracy than 3-class
  3. Validate detector on held-out conversations before corpus annotation
  4. Filter automatically-annotated utterances (exclude laughter, overlapping speech, unintelligible tokens)
  5. Train ASR with character-level prominence suffixes; use greedy decoding for prominence output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Binary (PL0/PL2) vs. ternary (PL0/PL1/PL2): Binary yields ~90% accuracy vs. ~69% for ternary, but loses granularity. Paper suggests human agreement on PL1 is also poor (κ=0.57-0.72).
  - Lexicon-constrained vs. lexicon-free decoding: Beam search with LM improves WER but cannot output prominence labels. Greedy decoding outputs prominence but has higher WER.
  - Token vocabulary size: More prominence levels → larger character vocabulary → small WER degradation (1.6-2.3% absolute in paper).

- Failure signatures:
  - Low alignment rate (<60%): Detector produces wrong number of word boundary tokens, preventing word-level prominence assignment
  - High PER but high accuracy on aligned words: Indicates ASR word-count errors, not prominence detection failures
  - PL1 confusion with both PL0 and PL2: Inherent ambiguity in intermediate prominence; consider collapsing to binary
  - WER degradation >3%: Character vocabulary may be too large; verify tokenization scheme

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Replicate PDET02 on held-out data**: Train binary prominence detector on your manually-annotated subset. Target: >85% accuracy on correctly-aligned words, >60% alignment rate. This validates that wav2vec2 captures prominence in your target language/condition.
  2. **Ablation on annotation granularity**: Compare binary (PL0/PL2) vs. collapsed (PL0 vs. PL1+PL2) vs. full 3-class. If PL1 recall <50% and confusion with both other classes is high, binary is appropriate for your data.
  3. **Pilot ASR with oracle prominence labels**: Train prominence-aware ASR using ground-truth prominence labels (not auto-generated). Compare WER to baseline. If WER degrades >2% even with correct labels, the character-level encoding scheme may need adjustment before investing in pseudo-labeling pipeline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the prominence-aware ASR approach generalize effectively to languages with different prosodic systems, such as tonal languages or pitch-accent languages?
- Basis in paper: Authors state the tool "could enable efficient prominence annotation for various languages where extensive training data might not be available."
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluated Austrian German; cross-linguistic prosodic phenomena differ substantially in their acoustic correlates and perceptual salience.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on diverse languages (e.g., Mandarin, Japanese, English) using the same wav2vec2-based methodology with language-specific prominence annotations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can intermediate prominence levels (PL1) be reliably detected in spontaneous speech, or is weak prominence fundamentally ambiguous for both humans and machines?
- Basis in paper: PDET012 achieved only 69.45% accuracy vs. 89.72% for binary classification; PL1 recall was 49% with 30% confused as PL0 and 21% as PL2; inter-annotator agreement for PL1 was κ=0.57.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate whether alternative annotation protocols, larger datasets, or architectural modifications could improve PL1 detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of annotation schemes and model architectures specifically targeting intermediate prominence levels.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can prominence information be integrated with language model-constrained beam search decoding while preserving detection accuracy?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes "including prominence levels in the lexicon did not improve ASR performance"; prominence detection only works with greedy (Lexfree) decoding.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture forces a trade-off between LM-based WER improvement and prominence output capability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with modified lexicon structures, auxiliary prediction heads, or joint decoding strategies.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does incorporating prominence information into ASR transcripts measurably improve performance on downstream tasks such as dialogue act recognition or machine translation?
- Basis in paper: Authors state potential applications for "prosody-informed dialogue systems" where prominence could help "better understand not just what words were spoken, but also their relative importance."
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates prominence detection accuracy and ASR WER; no downstream NLU/SLU tasks were tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: End-to-end benchmark comparisons on spoken language understanding tasks with and without prominence-enhanced inputs.

## Limitations

- The approach's generalization to languages with different prosodic systems (tonal, pitch-accent) remains unproven.
- PL1 prominence levels show poor detection accuracy (49% recall) and low inter-annotator agreement, suggesting fundamental ambiguity.
- Character-level prominence encoding causes measurable WER degradation (1.6-2.3%) that may be unacceptable for some applications.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- wav2vec2 representations encode sufficient prosodic information for binary prominence detection (PL0 vs PL2)
- Joint transcription-prominence learning is feasible with character-level encoding
- Two-stage annotation pipeline works for binary prominence classification

**Medium Confidence**:
- wav2vec2 representations generalize to ternary prominence classification (PL0/PL1/PL2)
- The pseudo-labeling approach maintains annotation quality for downstream ASR
- WER degradation from vocabulary expansion is acceptable for all applications

**Low Confidence**:
- The approach generalizes to languages/domains with substantially different prominence patterns
- PL1 can be reliably detected and used in downstream applications
- The specific character-level encoding scheme is optimal for joint learning

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply the binary prominence detector (PDET02) to a different conversational speech corpus (e.g., English Switchboard or French ETAPE). Measure accuracy on correctly-aligned words and alignment rate. Target: >80% accuracy and >50% alignment rate. This validates whether wav2vec2 representations transfer across languages and speaking styles.

2. **Oracle Label ASR Ablation**: Train prominence-aware ASR using ground-truth prominence labels instead of detector-generated labels. Compare WER to baseline ASR and to the system using auto-generated labels. Target: WER degradation <1.5% with oracle labels. If degradation exceeds 2% even with correct labels, the character-level encoding scheme needs fundamental revision.

3. **Alternative Encoding Scheme Evaluation**: Implement a word-boundary-only prominence encoding (e.g., "alle|2" instead of "a2 l2 l2 e2") and compare WER and PER to the character-level approach. Target: Reduce WER degradation to <1% while maintaining >85% prominence accuracy. This tests whether the current encoding scheme is optimal for joint learning.
