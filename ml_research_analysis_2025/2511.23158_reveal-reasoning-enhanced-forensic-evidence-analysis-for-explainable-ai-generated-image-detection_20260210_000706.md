## Executive Summary
REVEAL introduces the first reasoning-enhanced dataset for AI-generated image detection, explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models. The framework integrates detection with expert-grounded reinforcement learning through a novel R-GRPO algorithm, jointly optimizing detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence. REVEAL achieves superior detection accuracy (95.31% on REVEAL-Bench) and significantly better cross-domain generalization compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

## Method Summary
REVEAL constructs a chain-of-evidence dataset (REVEAL-Bench) using 8 forensic expert models to generate structured evidence from images, then synthesizes this into reasoning traces using a large vision-language model. The framework employs a two-stage training approach: CoE Tuning with KL regularization to establish output format, followed by R-GRPO reinforcement learning optimizing detection accuracy, reasoning coherence, and multi-view evidence alignment. The method enforces a "think-then-answer" generation order and uses group-relative policy optimization to stabilize training.

## Key Results
- Achieves 95.31% detection accuracy on REVEAL-Bench
- Demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Successfully balances detection performance with explanation fidelity and logical coherence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Expert-Grounded Chain-of-Evidence Construction
Grounding MLLM reasoning traces in structured outputs from lightweight forensic expert models improves explanation verifiability and cross-domain generalization. Eight specialized experts generate machine-readable evidence that conditions the LVLM to produce consolidated chain-of-evidence annotations.

### Mechanism 2: Causal Reasoning-Then-Answer Training Objective
Enforcing a "think-then-answer" generation order (reasoning trace before classification) produces causally grounded explanations rather than post-hoc rationalizations. The joint probability is factorized as p(y,z|x) = p(z|x)p(y|x,z).

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Objective R-GRPO Reward Optimization
Jointly optimizing detection accuracy, reasoning coherence, and multi-view evidence alignment via reinforcement learning improves both performance and explanation fidelity. R-GRPO extends GRPO with a composite reward including logical coherence and consistency across forensic transformations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Chain-of-Evidence vs. Post-Hoc Rationalization**
  - Why needed here: Distinguishes genuine forensic reasoning (evidence → conclusion) from after-the-fact justification (conclusion → fabricated explanation)
  - Quick check question: Given a model output "This image is fake because the eyes lack reflections," can you trace back to which expert model detected this artifact?

- Concept: **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - Why needed here: R-GRPO builds on GRPO, which stabilizes RL by comparing groups of sampled trajectories rather than relying on single-sample rewards
  - Quick check question: How does computing advantages relative to a group mean differ from traditional policy gradient methods?

- Concept: **Multi-View Forensic Evidence Alignment**
  - Why needed here: The rview reward requires reasoning to be consistent across transformed image views (spectral, high-pass), promoting artifact discovery that transcends single representations
  - Quick check question: If an explanation cites "high-frequency artifacts," which transformed view should you verify this against?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
Input Image → [8 Expert Models] → Structured Evidence (masks, labels) → [LVLM: Qwen-2.5VL-72B for annotation] → REVEAL-Bench (CoE dataset) → [Stage 1: CoE Tuning] → [Stage 2: R-GRPO] → [Deployed MLLM: Detection + Explanation]

- Critical path:
1. Expert model outputs must be machine-readable (masks, labels) — not just global scores
2. CoE annotations must follow structured `reasoning...<answer>label</answer>` format
3. Stage 1 establishes output format; Stage 2 refines reasoning quality

- Design tradeoffs:
  - 8 expert models vs. end-to-end learning: Experts provide interpretability but may miss novel artifacts
  - Agent-based reward vs. metric-based: More aligned with human judgment but higher compute cost
  - Group size K in GRPO: Larger K improves advantage estimation but increases sampling cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Explanations mention artifacts not present in expert outputs (hallucination)
  - Detection accuracy high on in-domain but low on out-of-domain (overfitting to surface patterns)
  - Reasoning traces are coherent but don't change conclusion when perturbed (rthink reward failure)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate expert model outputs: Run each expert on held-out images, verify mask/label quality against manual inspection
  2. Ablate reward components: Train with only rsem, then add rthink, then rview — measure accuracy vs. explanation fidelity tradeoffs
  3. Cross-domain stress test: Evaluate on GenImage generators not seen during training (Midjourney, VQDM) and analyze which experts fail first

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can REVEAL maintain detection performance when facing novel generative artifacts that do not trigger alerts in the eight specific lightweight expert models? This remains unresolved as the framework may fail to generate a "Chain-of-Evidence" for artifacts outside the sensitivity of the current expert set.

### Open Question 2
How robust is the reasoning chain when the input evidence from forensic experts is adversarially perturbed? The paper tests Gaussian blur and JPEG compression but doesn't address adversarial attacks targeting the expert models specifically.

### Open Question 3
Does the automated "Chain-of-Evidence Synthesis" using Qwen-2.5VL-72B propagate hallucinations or logical inconsistencies to the student model? The paper relies on automated rewards for evaluation without human verification of reasoning quality.

## Limitations
- Expert model overfitting may limit detection of novel artifacts from unseen generators
- High computational cost of agent-based reward modeling and group sampling
- Lack of human evaluation for reasoning trace quality and hallucination detection

## Confidence

- **Detection accuracy claims**: High confidence (direct empirical validation on REVEAL-Bench)
- **Cross-domain generalization claims**: Medium confidence (tested on limited GenImage variants, no real-world generator evaluation)
- **Explainability mechanism claims**: Low confidence (mechanism relies on design assumption rather than ablation isolation)

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain robustness test**: Evaluate on real-world generators (Midjourney, DALL-E, VQDM) not represented in training data to verify claimed generalization beyond synthetic benchmarks.

2. **Ablation isolation study**: Train identical architectures with shuffled reasoning-answer order and post-hoc explanation generation to quantify the causal contribution of the "think-then-answer" mechanism.

3. **Expert hallucination audit**: Systematically compare generated explanations against expert model outputs across 1,000 held-out samples to measure hallucination rates and identify failure modes where reasoning diverges from evidence.
