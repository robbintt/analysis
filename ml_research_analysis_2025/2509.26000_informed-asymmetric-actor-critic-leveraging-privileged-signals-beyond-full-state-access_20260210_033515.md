# Informed Asymmetric Actor-Critic: Leveraging Privileged Signals Beyond Full-State Access

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26000
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26000
- Authors: Daniel Ebi; Gaspard Lambrechts; Damien Ernst; Klemens Böhm
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: IAAC achieves performance comparable to or better than full-state baselines by leveraging privileged signals without requiring full-state access.

## Executive Summary
Informed Asymmetric Actor-Critic (IAAC) extends asymmetric actor-critic methods by conditioning the critic on arbitrary state-dependent privileged signals while maintaining unbiased policy gradients, without requiring full-state access. The framework introduces two informativeness criteria—residual-based and prediction-based—to identify useful training-time signals that can enhance learning efficiency. Empirical results on benchmark POMDPs and synthetic environments demonstrate that carefully selected privileged signals enable IAAC to match or exceed performance of full-state baseline methods.

## Method Summary
IAAC generalizes asymmetric actor-critic approaches by allowing the critic to access privileged state-dependent signals during training while the actor only observes partial observations, thus addressing POMDP challenges without full-state requirements. The framework introduces two novel informativeness criteria—residual-based (measuring prediction error reduction) and prediction-based (evaluating signal utility in forecasting)—to identify and select informative privileged signals from available data sources. These criteria guide the selection of signals that enhance critic training while preserving the unbiased policy gradient property essential for stable learning.

## Key Results
- IAAC achieves performance comparable to or better than full-state baseline methods on benchmark POMDPs
- The framework successfully operates without requiring full-state access, only needing informative privileged signals
- Residual-based and prediction-based informativeness criteria effectively identify useful training-time signals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
IAAC leverages privileged signals to provide the critic with additional information that improves value function estimation, while maintaining the actor's partial observability constraint. The asymmetric information structure allows the critic to learn more accurate value estimates using privileged signals, which in turn guides the actor toward better policies through unbiased policy gradients. The informativeness criteria ensure that only signals contributing meaningful information are utilized, preventing overfitting to noisy or irrelevant data.

## Foundational Learning
- **POMDPs (Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes)**: Understanding why needed - these are the problem class IAAC addresses where agents lack full state information. Quick check - can you explain the belief state concept and its computational challenges?
- **Asymmetric Actor-Critic Methods**: Why needed - forms the basis for separating information access between actor and critic. Quick check - can you describe how asymmetric information flow differs from standard actor-critic?
- **Policy Gradients**: Why needed - IAAC maintains unbiased policy gradients despite asymmetric information. Quick check - can you derive the policy gradient theorem and explain its unbiasedness property?
- **Informativeness Criteria**: Why needed - these guide selection of useful privileged signals. Quick check - can you explain the difference between residual-based and prediction-based criteria?
- **Value Function Estimation**: Why needed - the critic's improved estimation drives policy improvement. Quick check - can you describe how privileged signals enhance value function learning?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Environment -> Partial Observation (Actor) -> Action; Environment -> Partial Observation + Privileged Signals (Critic) -> Value Estimate
- **Critical Path**: Partial observation → Actor → Action → Environment → (Observation, Reward, Privileged Signal) → Critic → Value → Policy Update
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing signal informativeness against computational cost and potential overfitting; selecting between residual-based vs prediction-based criteria based on signal characteristics
- **Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when privileged signals are uninformative or noisy; instability when informativeness criteria select poor signals; convergence issues when signal quality varies significantly
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test on simple POMDP with synthetic privileged signals of known informativeness 2) Ablation study removing privileged signals to establish baseline 3) Compare residual-based vs prediction-based criteria on same problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Informativeness criteria lack theoretical guarantees for optimal signal selection
- Performance gains highly dependent on quality and availability of privileged signals
- Evaluation limited to discrete-action environments, leaving continuous control performance uncertain

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core algorithm formulation and unbiased policy gradient property
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical performance claims relative to full-state baselines due to limited test environment diversity
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability of informativeness criteria across different problem domains

## Next Checks
1. Test IAAC on continuous control benchmarks (e.g., DeepMind Control Suite) to evaluate performance in environments with complex dynamics and high-dimensional action spaces
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the quality and quantity of privileged signals to quantify sensitivity and identify minimum requirements for performance gains
3. Implement theoretical analysis proving convergence properties and bounds for the proposed informativeness criteria in selecting privileged signals
