# InJecteD: Analyzing Trajectories and Drift Dynamics in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for 2D Point Cloud Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.12239
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12239
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Primary result**: Introduces trajectory analysis framework for denoising diffusion models on 2D point clouds

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the interpretability challenge in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by introducing InJecteD, a framework that analyzes sample trajectories during 2D point cloud generation. The core method quantifies trajectory properties—displacement, velocity, clustering, and drift field dynamics—using statistical metrics such as Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. Experiments on three datasets (bullseye, dino, circle) reveal three distinct denoising phases: initial noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement. Fourier-based embeddings improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality, with the Fourier-Fourier configuration achieving the best performance. The framework enables practitioners to debug and refine generative models, enhancing transparency and supporting human-AI collaboration in generative modeling.

## Method Summary
InJecteD introduces a systematic approach to analyze and visualize sample trajectories in denoising diffusion models for 2D point cloud generation. The framework tracks how individual points evolve from pure noise to structured shapes by quantifying displacement, velocity, and clustering behavior across denoising steps. Key innovations include drift field visualization that reveals local dynamics and statistical metrics (Wasserstein distance, cosine similarity) that measure trajectory convergence and stability. The method employs Fourier-based embeddings to improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality. By decomposing the denoising process into distinct phases, InJecteD provides interpretable insights into how generative models create structured outputs from noise.

## Key Results
- Revealed three distinct denoising phases: initial noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement
- Fourier-Fourier embedding configuration achieved superior trajectory stability and reconstruction quality
- Drift field analysis identified regions of high and low local dynamics during point cloud generation
- Trajectory visualization demonstrated how structured shapes emerge from random noise through predictable patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the inherent structure of diffusion processes, where samples follow deterministic trajectories governed by learned drift fields. By tracking individual points across denoising steps, the method captures how local and global structure emerges systematically. Fourier embeddings provide stable representations that preserve geometric relationships while enabling smooth trajectory evolution. The statistical metrics quantify convergence behavior, revealing how different regions of the latent space organize during generation. This mechanistic understanding bridges the gap between black-box generative models and interpretable dynamics, enabling targeted interventions for model improvement.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Point Cloud Input -> Fourier Embeddings -> DDPM Network -> Trajectory Tracker -> Visualization Layer -> Statistical Analysis

**Critical Path**: The essential flow is from input point clouds through Fourier embeddings, through the DDPM denoising process, to trajectory tracking and analysis. Each component must maintain geometric consistency to enable meaningful trajectory analysis.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Fourier embeddings versus learned embeddings (stability vs. flexibility), trajectory resolution versus computational cost, qualitative visualization versus quantitative metrics. The choice of embedding strategy significantly impacts trajectory smoothness and interpretability.

**Failure Signatures**: Noisy or discontinuous trajectories indicate embedding instability or model pathologies. Inconsistent drift fields suggest learning failures in the denoising process. Poor Wasserstein scores despite smooth trajectories may indicate mode collapse or distribution mismatch.

**First Experiments**:
1. Generate basic trajectories on synthetic bullseye dataset to verify framework functionality
2. Compare Fourier versus positional embeddings on simple geometric shapes
3. Analyze drift field dynamics on multi-cluster datasets to test local structure capture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation across diverse point cloud datasets, focusing primarily on synthetic 2D shapes
- Analysis focuses on qualitative trajectory visualization without extensive quantitative validation of correlation with generative quality metrics
- Claims about Fourier embedding superiority need verification across more varied data distributions and dimensionality

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate InJecteD on real-world 3D point cloud datasets (e.g., ShapeNet, ModelNet) to verify trajectory analysis generalizes beyond synthetic 2D shapes
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing Fourier embeddings against other embedding methods (sinusoidal, positional encodings) across multiple dataset types to validate claimed superiority
3. Implement a documented case study where trajectory analysis identifies a specific model pathology and demonstrate how insights from InJecteD lead to measurable improvements in generative quality
