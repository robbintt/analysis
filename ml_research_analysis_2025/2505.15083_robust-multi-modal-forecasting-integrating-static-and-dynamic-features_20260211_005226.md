# Robust Multi-Modal Forecasting: Integrating Static and Dynamic Features

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.15083
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15083
- Authors: Jeremy Qin
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Mean squared error reductions of 0.082 to 0.173 across synthetic datasets by integrating static features with interpretable trend-property encoded dynamic features

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of integrating dynamic time series features with static features in transparent time series forecasting models. The authors extend the TIMEVIEW framework by introducing an interpretable encoding mechanism that decomposes time series data into trends and properties, enhancing robustness against measurement uncertainty. They also employ contrastive learning to align latent representations of static and dynamic modalities. Experiments on synthetic datasets (D-Sine, D-Beta, and D-Tumor) demonstrate that this approach improves predictive performance compared to raw time series features while maintaining interpretability and enabling intuitive counterfactual reasoning about dynamic inputs.

## Method Summary
The method extends TIMEVIEW by decomposing dynamic time series into trends (shape/motifs over intervals) and properties (transition points), then interleaving them as [I1, P1, I2, P2, ...] for encoding. Static features are processed through an MLP encoder while the interleaved dynamic sequence passes through an LSTM encoder. The latent vectors are combined element-wise and decoded via B-Spline basis functions to generate trajectories. The training objective includes MSE loss, L2 regularization, and a contrastive loss that aligns normalized static and dynamic latent representations. This design aims to improve robustness to measurement noise while maintaining interpretability for counterfactual reasoning.

## Key Results
- MSE reductions of 0.082-0.173 across D-Sine, D-Beta, and D-Tumor datasets compared to raw time series baselines
- Contrastive learning improved D-Tumor (0.082→0.077) but hurt D-Sine (0.151→0.163), showing mixed effects
- Trend-property encoding demonstrated reduced sensitivity to measurement noise compared to raw time series features
- Interleaving structure preserved temporal correlations enabling intuitive counterfactual reasoning about trajectories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing time series into trends and properties reduces sensitivity to measurement noise.
- Mechanism: Raw time series features propagate small perturbations through the encoder (LSTM), whereas trend-property encoding aggregates behavior over intervals, making local perturbations cancel out: ∂Ii/∂ϵ(t) ≈ 0 and ∂Pi/∂ϵ(t) ≈ 0. The combined sensitivity ∂h_dynamic/∂ϵ(t) ≈ 0.
- Core assumption: Trends and properties remain stable across measurement instruments and conditions, even when individual readings vary.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "enhancing robustness against measurement uncertainty"; [Section 3.2]: "trends refer to the shape or motifs of the curve over specific intervals, while properties denote the transition points between different intervals"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Interleaving trends with their corresponding properties preserves temporal correlation for interpretable reasoning.
- Mechanism: Instead of concatenating all trends then all properties [I1...I8, P1...P8], interleaving produces [I1, P1, I2, P2...]. Each trend remains associated with its transition point, enabling queries like "what if this trend had been steeper?" rather than "what if glucose was 0.1 higher on day 14?"
- Core assumption: Counterfactual reasoning about trajectories is more intuitive at the trend-property level than at individual time points.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3.2]: "This approach ensures that each trend remains closely linked with its corresponding property, which is critical for maintaining interpretability"; [Section 6]: "enabling intuitive counterfactual reasoning"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Contrastive loss aligns static and dynamic latent spaces, acting as a regularizer on composition changes.
- Mechanism: Normalized static and dynamic latent vectors (h̄_s, h̄_d) are pulled together for same samples and pushed apart for different samples via cross-entropy over similarity scores. This encourages both modalities to encode consistent sample-level information.
- Core assumption: Static and dynamic features of the same sample should produce similar latent representations when properly encoded.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3.3]: "the inclusion of the contrastive loss not only aligns the static and dynamic representations but also regularizes the model by constraining how the compositions change"; [Table 1]: Results show mixed effects; CL improved D-Tumor (0.082→0.077) but increased error on D-Sine (0.151→0.163)

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: B-Spline basis functions and spline-parametrized trajectories
  - Why needed here: TIMEVIEW represents predicted trajectories as linear combinations of B-Splines, where latent vectors control spline coefficients. Understanding how splines decompose curves into intervals is essential for interpreting the "compositions" the paper references.
  - Quick check question: Given a cubic B-Spline with knots at t=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, how many basis functions are non-zero at t=0.3?

- Concept: Contrastive learning (InfoNCE-style objectives)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a symmetric cross-entropy loss over similarity matrices to align static and dynamic representations. Understanding temperature scaling and negative sampling helps diagnose why results were mixed.
  - Quick check question: What happens to gradient magnitudes when temperature τ is too small vs. too large?

- Concept: Sensitivity analysis and perturbation robustness
  - Why needed here: The paper's robustness claim rests on showing ∂h_dynamic/∂ϵ(t) ≈ 0 for trend-encoded inputs. Understanding chain rule applications through neural architectures is needed to verify or challenge this derivation.
  - Quick check question: For a simple RNN h_t = tanh(W h_{t-1} + U x_t), how does a perturbation ϵ at timestep k propagate to h_T for T >> k?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Static encoder h: R^M → R^B -> Dynamic encoder r: R^{t×D} → R^B -> Latent combination m = h + h_dynamic -> Trajectory output ŷ(t) = Σ_{b=1}^B m_b × φ_b(t)

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess dynamic features → extract trends and properties (interval segmentation, derivative analysis)
  2. Interleave trends and properties into single sequence per sample
  3. Pass through static encoder (MLP-style) and dynamic encoder (RNN) in parallel
  4. Combine latents, decode via B-Spline basis
  5. Compute MSE on observed trajectory points, contrastive loss on paired static-dynamic latents

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interval granularity: Finer intervals preserve more information but reduce robustness to noise. Paper does not specify automatic interval selection.
  - Contrastive weight β: Table 1 shows CL hurt D-Sine (simple periodic patterns) but helped D-Tumor (multi-feature interactions). May need dataset-specific tuning.
  - Static-dynamic fusion via addition vs. concatenation: Addition forces both encoders to output in same latent space; may limit expressiveness if modalities are genuinely orthogonal.

- Failure signatures:
  - MSE increases when adding CL: Static and dynamic features may not be redundant views; try reducing β or using asymmetric loss.
  - Predictions over-smoothed: Interval granularity too coarse; trends are collapsing distinct patterns.
  - Counterfactuals produce identical outputs: Trend-property encoding may be discarding discriminative detail; check interval boundaries.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce Table 1 on D-Sine with and without trend-property encoding. Verify that raw time series baseline produces higher MSE and higher sensitivity to Gaussian noise injection.
  2. Ablate the interleaving structure: Compare [I1, P1, I2, P2...] vs. [I1...I8, P1...P8] on interpretability metrics (if available) or proxy measures like counterfactual consistency.
  3. Sensitivity stress test: Add calibrated noise to dynamic inputs and measure output variance. Plot R_raw vs. R_trend empirically to validate the theoretical robustness claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the trend-property encoding mechanism maintain its robustness and interpretability when applied to real-world clinical datasets containing irregular sampling and missing values?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states, "Experiments were conducted on 3 synthetic datasets," acknowledging a gap in validating the method on messy, real-world data mentioned in the introduction.
- Why unresolved: The synthetic datasets (D-Sine, D-Beta, D-Tumor) allow for controlled "realistic ranges" but likely lack the irregularity and noise complexity of actual hospital records.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the framework on a public clinical benchmark (e.g., MIMIC-IV) involving irregularly sampled vital signs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the contrastive loss regularization provide consistent benefits in complex scenarios where the alignment between static and dynamic modalities is weaker than in the synthetic examples?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The results section notes "mixed effects" of contrastive learning, which the authors attribute to the "simplicity of the synthetic datasets used."
- Why unresolved: The utility of the alignment mechanism is currently ambiguous, improving results on D-Tumor but worsening them on D-Sine/D-Beta, suggesting its utility is dataset-dependent.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies on datasets with artificially decoupled static and dynamic features to test the alignment hypothesis.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed dynamic encoding strategy be effectively adapted to other time-series forecasting architectures (e.g., Transformers) without relying on the B-Spline basis functions of TIMEVIEW?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors limit their scope, stating, "we focus solely on the TIMEVIEW model," leaving the generalizability of the specific encoding module untested.
- Why unresolved: The current architecture fuses latent vectors specifically designed for spline reconstruction ($m = h + h_{dynamic}$), which may not transfer directly to other model latent spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of the trend-property encoder within a standard Transformer or LSTM architecture to compare performance against raw-feature baselines.

## Limitations
- Implementation details missing: Hyperparameters (α, β, τ, learning rate, batch size, LSTM architecture), trend-property extraction algorithms, and synthetic dataset generation scripts are not provided
- Mixed contrastive learning results: CL improved D-Tumor but hurt D-Sine, suggesting dataset-specific tuning requirements that aren't fully explored
- Limited scope to TIMEVIEW architecture: The encoding strategy may not generalize to other forecasting architectures without modification

## Confidence
- High confidence: Theoretical mechanism for trend-property encoding providing measurement noise robustness, supported by decomposition approach and sensitivity analysis framework
- Medium confidence: Interpretability benefits of interleaving trends with properties, though relies heavily on intuition rather than formal user studies
- Low confidence: Universal effectiveness of contrastive learning for static-dynamic alignment, given mixed empirical results and lack of ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity stress tests by injecting calibrated Gaussian noise at different levels into dynamic inputs and measuring output variance, comparing raw time series vs. trend-property encoded representations
2. Perform ablation studies on the interleaving structure by comparing [I1, P1, I2, P2...] vs. [I1...I8, P1...P8] on counterfactual consistency metrics
3. Systematically tune contrastive loss hyperparameters (τ, β) across all three datasets to identify optimal settings and determine whether CL consistently helps or hurts based on data complexity
