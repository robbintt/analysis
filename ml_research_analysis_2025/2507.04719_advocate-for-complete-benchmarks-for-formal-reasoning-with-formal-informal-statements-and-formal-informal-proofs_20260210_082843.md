# Advocate for Complete Benchmarks for Formal Reasoning with Formal/Informal Statements and Formal/Informal Proofs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.04719
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04719
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: The paper discusses challenges in formal reasoning and automated theorem proving, emphasizing the need for complete, error-free benchmarks and open code/data to accelerate progress.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses critical challenges in formal reasoning and automated theorem proving, highlighting the urgent need for complete, error-free benchmarks with formal/informal statement and proof pairs. The authors identify major barriers including scarce high-quality data pairs, unreliable automated evaluation methods, and errors in existing benchmarks that significantly impede progress. They advocate for open practices including full release of training data and evaluation code, realistic evaluation pipelines from informal to formal reasoning, and community efforts to correct and complete benchmarks. The paper emphasizes that current automated evaluation methods can overestimate accuracy by up to 30 percentage points, urging verification before deployment.

## Method Summary
The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of current limitations in formal reasoning benchmarks through systematic examination of existing datasets and evaluation practices. The authors review benchmark construction methodologies, identify common error patterns, and analyze the reliability of automated evaluation systems. They examine specific cases where automated judges produce inflated accuracy scores compared to manual verification, and document instances of incomplete or erroneous benchmark entries. The analysis includes a detailed examination of the miniF2F benchmark and similar datasets to illustrate systemic issues in the field.

## Key Results
- Current automated evaluation methods significantly overestimate accuracy, with LLMs achieving 97% on their own translations versus true 67% accuracy
- Major barriers include scarce formal/informal data pairs, difficulty evaluating model accuracy, and lack of transparency in training data
- Existing benchmarks contain errors that require redundant manual verification efforts and create barriers for contributors unfamiliar with formal languages
- Open practices including full release of training data and evaluation code are essential for accelerating progress

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper works by identifying fundamental bottlenecks in formal reasoning research and proposing concrete solutions to address them. By demonstrating the unreliability of current automated evaluation methods and documenting specific errors in existing benchmarks, the authors establish a clear case for reform. The mechanism for improvement centers on creating complete, verifiable datasets and adopting transparent practices that enable reproducible research. The emphasis on open code and data addresses the root causes of progress barriers by removing the need for redundant manual efforts and enabling community verification.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Formal vs Informal Mathematical Statements**
   - Why needed: Understanding the distinction between natural language mathematics and formal proof languages is essential for developing autoformalization systems
   - Quick check: Can identify whether a given mathematical statement is expressed in formal proof language or natural language

2. **Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) Evaluation**
   - Why needed: Reliable evaluation methods are crucial for measuring progress in formal reasoning systems
   - Quick check: Understand how automated judges compare to manual verification in terms of accuracy and reliability

3. **Benchmark Construction Principles**
   - Why needed: Proper benchmark design ensures fair and meaningful evaluation of formal reasoning systems
   - Quick check: Can identify key components of a complete benchmark including formal/informal statement pairs and proof availability

4. **Autoformalization Pipeline**
   - Why needed: Understanding the complete chain from informal statements through formalization to theorem proving is essential for system development
   - Quick check: Can describe the full pipeline from natural language input to formal proof output

5. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - Why needed: Ensuring data quality is critical for reliable model training and evaluation
   - Quick check: Can identify common error patterns in formal reasoning datasets

6. **Open Science Practices**
   - Why needed: Open practices enable reproducibility and community verification in formal reasoning research
   - Quick check: Understand the benefits and implementation requirements of open code and data policies

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data Collection -> Formalization -> Theorem Proving -> Evaluation -> Verification

**Critical Path:**
The most critical path is the evaluation and verification stage, as unreliable evaluation can lead to false progress claims and wasted research effort. This connects directly to data collection, as poor quality data leads to unreliable evaluation.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Completeness vs. Practicality: Complete benchmarks with formal/informal pairs are ideal but require significant manual effort
- Automation vs. Accuracy: Automated evaluation is faster but less reliable than manual verification
- Openness vs. Intellectual Property: Open data accelerates progress but may conflict with competitive interests

**Failure Signatures:**
- Automated judges producing accuracy scores 20-30 percentage points higher than manual verification
- Benchmark entries with mismatched formal/informal statements or incomplete proofs
- Models failing to reproduce proofs they were trained on despite high evaluation scores

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare automated judge accuracy against manual verification on a small benchmark subset
2. Analyze error patterns in existing formal reasoning datasets to identify common failure modes
3. Implement a simple formal/informal statement pair verification system to test the feasibility of automated verification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can automated systems be developed that reliably evaluate the correctness of formal translations by comparing only formal and informal statements, without access to ground-truth translations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.2 states: "It would be a useful contribution to the field to develop models that can reliably verify the correctness of formal translations merely by comparing the formal and informal statements without the need for the ground-truth translation."
- Why unresolved: Current LLM-based judges produce inflated results (97% vs. true 67% accuracy), demonstrating unreliability.
- What evidence would resolve it: An automated evaluator achieving accuracy comparable to human Lean experts (>90% agreement) on benchmark test sets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the minimum model architectures and training methods required for LLMs to reliably reproduce formal proofs they have been exposed to during training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 notes this is "a question currently without an answer in the literature" despite proofs being available for benchmarks like miniF2F.
- Why unresolved: Current models do not release training data, making it impossible to determine what enables proof reproduction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies showing which architectural choices and training configurations achieve high reproduction rates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can complete autonomous pipelines be constructed that handle the full reasoning chain from informal statements through autoformalization to theorem proving?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.1 advocates for "full pipelines of autoformalization models plus theorem provers" where "the starting point is the informal statement" and Section A envisions "automated pipeline for mathematical reasoning."
- Why unresolved: Current pipelines are incomplete, often failing to verify formalized statements match original problems.
- What evidence would resolve it: End-to-end systems successfully proving competition-level problems from natural language statements without human intervention.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks specific quantitative data on the extent of benchmark errors and their prevalence across different datasets
- Claims about automated evaluation methods significantly overestimating accuracy are not supported by detailed empirical evidence
- The paper does not address potential trade-offs between benchmark completeness and practical constraints of data collection

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The need for complete, error-free benchmarks and open code/data to accelerate progress in formal reasoning is a well-established principle in the field
- The benefits of open practices and transparent evaluation pipelines are widely recognized

**Medium Confidence:**
- The specific barriers identified (scarce data pairs, difficulty evaluating model accuracy, lack of transparency, errors in existing benchmarks) are plausible but not empirically substantiated
- The assertion that incomplete benchmarks slow progress by requiring redundant manual efforts is reasonable but lacks concrete examples or data

**Low Confidence:**
- The paper's claims about automated evaluation methods significantly overestimating accuracy are not supported by evidence or specific examples
- The proposed solutions (community efforts to complete and correct benchmarks, credit for manual contributions) are general recommendations without detailed implementation strategies

## Next Checks
1. **Benchmark Error Analysis**: Conduct a systematic analysis of existing formal reasoning benchmarks to quantify the prevalence and impact of errors. This would involve reviewing multiple benchmarks and identifying specific instances of errors, their sources, and their effects on model performance.

2. **Evaluation Method Comparison**: Compare automated evaluation methods with manual verification for a set of formal proofs. This would involve selecting a representative sample of proofs, applying both automated and manual evaluation methods, and analyzing the discrepancies between the two approaches.

3. **Community Survey**: Survey the formal reasoning community to gather data on the challenges faced in benchmark creation, the prevalence of errors, and the perceived benefits of open practices. This would provide qualitative insights into the issues raised in the paper and inform the development of more effective solutions.
