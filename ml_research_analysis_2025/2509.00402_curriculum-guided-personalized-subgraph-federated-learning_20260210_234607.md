# Curriculum Guided Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.00402
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00402
- Authors: Minku Kang; Hogun Park
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Improves accuracy by 1-3% and convergence speed on six graph datasets

## Executive Summary
CUFL addresses overfitting in subgraph federated learning by introducing a curriculum-guided personalization strategy. The method incrementally exposes local GNNs to easier, shared substructures before harder, client-specific ones, preventing early overfitting. It estimates client similarity through a shared random graph reconstruction, avoiding data exposure while maintaining effective collaboration. Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines across multiple datasets.

## Method Summary
CUFL implements an incremental edge selection mechanism that defines "easy" edges as those with low reconstruction error, exposing them first through a learnable mask and aging parameter. Client similarity is computed via Linear CKA on reconstructed shared random graphs, enabling privacy-preserving collaboration intensity estimation. The server aggregates models using these similarity weights, transitioning from generic to personalized knowledge transfer as training progresses.

## Key Results
- Accuracy improvements of 1-3% over baselines on six datasets
- Faster convergence compared to standard personalized FL methods
- Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of adaptive curriculum and proper collaboration scaling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Anti-Overfitting via Gradual Edge Exposure
The Incremental Edge Selection (IES) module calculates reconstruction scores for edges based on current node embeddings. Edges with small reconstruction errors (high predictability) are deemed "easy" and included in training first via a learnable mask and aging parameter. This forces the GNN to learn cross-client regularities before memorizing local noise.

### Mechanism 2: Stabilization of Client Similarity Estimation
Rapid overfitting causes client embeddings to diverge or lock into biased local minima, making similarity estimation impossible. By pacing the learning, CUFL ensures that the model states sent to the server reflect a gradual shift from generic to specific knowledge, allowing the similarity matrix to evolve correctly rather than collapsing.

### Mechanism 3: Privacy-Preserving Structural Proxies
All clients process the same shared random graph (generated via Stochastic Block Model). They project this graph through their local GNNs to create reconstructed adjacency matrices. The structural alignment of these reconstructions reveals functional similarity between models without sharing local adjacency matrices.

## Foundational Learning

- **Subgraph Federated Learning & Data Heterogeneity**
  - Why needed: Understanding that data is partitioned by topology (subgraphs) with heavy local bias due to community structure generation algorithms
  - Quick check: Why does averaging models from clients with disjoint community structures degrade performance compared to local training?

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) & Spectral Bias**
  - Why needed: The paper leverages the observation that GNNs learn low-frequency (generic) signals faster than high-frequency (client-specific) signals
  - Quick check: In message passing, what types of structural features typically converge faster: local node anomalies or global community aggregates?

- **Curriculum Learning (CL)**
  - Why needed: Understanding the shift from "random sampling" to "paced sampling" with automatic feedback-driven strategy
  - Quick check: Why would a pre-defined curriculum (using a fixed teacher model) fail in a Federated Learning setting where local distributions drift?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Local GNN -> IES_train (Mask optimizer for local data) -> Server: Aggregator -> IES_aggr (Mask optimizer for random graph) -> Similarity Calculator (Linear CKA)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Pre-train mask S_k using FedProx to align initial curriculums
  2. Local Train: Optimize GNN → Reconstruct Adjacency → Update Edge Mask (Curriculum step)
  3. Server Comms: Upload model weights W̄_k and the mask of the random graph S̃_k
  4. Aggregation: Server computes similarity α_kn based on S̃_k alignment → Weighted aggregation

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Random Graph Size: Larger |Ṽ| captures more structural nuance but increases computation; |Ṽ|=500 found optimal
  - Scaling Factor (τ): High τ forces collaboration only among highly similar clients; low τ allows generic averaging

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Collapsing Similarity Matrix: If loss curves drop too fast, similarity matrix shows noise or binary blocks
  - Lock-in: If similarity weights don't change after round 20, clients are likely reinforcing biases

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Overfitting Validation: Run baseline and CUFL on Cora/CiteSeer, plot training loss vs. test accuracy
  2. Similarity Ablation: Visualize similarity matrices at Rounds 1, 50, 100 comparing "Random Init" vs. "CUFL"
  3. Curriculum vs. Random: Replace "easy-to-hard" scheduler with uniform random edge sampling, quantify accuracy drop

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- The reconstruction score definition may not hold for graphs with inherently high local variance (e.g., protein interaction networks)
- Coherence assumption for random graph similarity estimation is unverified for heterogeneous domains
- Adaptive scaling of collaboration intensity introduces unexplored hyperparameters for stability

## Confidence

- **High:** The mechanism of gradual edge exposure (IES) reducing early overfitting, directly validated by training curves and ablation studies
- **Medium:** The claim that curriculum learning stabilizes client similarity matrices, supported by similarity matrix visualizations but lacking long-term dynamics analysis
- **Medium:** The privacy-preserving nature of structural proxies via random graph reconstruction, theoretically grounded but with no empirical privacy analysis

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Robustness:** Test CUFL on graphs with high local variance (e.g., social vs. citation graphs) to validate the universality of the "easy" edge definition
2. **Similarity Matrix Dynamics:** Track and analyze the evolution of the client similarity matrix over 200+ rounds to detect potential collapse or drift under prolonged training
3. **Privacy Analysis:** Conduct formal privacy risk assessment (e.g., membership inference) on the reconstructed random graph to quantify information leakage
