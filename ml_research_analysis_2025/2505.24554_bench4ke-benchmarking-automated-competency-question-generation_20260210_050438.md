core_contribution: Bench4KE introduces a standardized benchmarking system for evaluating
  automated competency question (CQ) generation in knowledge engineering. It addresses
  the lack of methodological rigor in comparing LLM-based CQ generation tools by providing
  a gold standard dataset of 843 CQs from 17 real-world ontology projects and supporting
  multiple similarity metrics including Cosine, BERTScore, and LLM-based scoring.

# Bench4KE: Benchmarking Automated Competency Question Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24554
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24554
- Reference count: 40
- Bench4KE provides standardized benchmarking system for automated CQ generation with gold standard dataset and multiple similarity metrics

## Executive Summary
Bench4KE introduces a systematic benchmarking framework for evaluating automated competency question generation tools in knowledge engineering. The system addresses the lack of standardized evaluation methods by providing a gold standard dataset of 843 CQs from 17 real-world ontology projects and supporting multiple evaluation metrics including Cosine similarity, BERTScore, and LLM-based scoring. The framework evaluates six recent CQ generation tools across different input modalities (user stories, ontologies, documents, datasets), establishing baseline performance metrics. The system demonstrates moderate semantic alignment between generated and gold standard CQs, highlighting the current challenges in automated CQ generation while providing extensible architecture for future KE automation tasks.

## Method Summary
The benchmarking system employs a multi-metric evaluation approach combining traditional similarity measures with advanced LLM-based scoring. The framework processes input sources through automated CQ generation tools, then compares outputs against a gold standard dataset using three distinct similarity metrics. The evaluation pipeline includes preprocessing, generation, and comparison stages, with results aggregated to provide comprehensive performance assessments. The system supports extensibility through modular design, allowing integration of new tools and evaluation methods while maintaining consistent benchmarking standards across different KE automation tasks.

## Key Results
- Gold standard dataset contains 843 CQs from 17 real-world ontology projects
- Generated CQs show moderate similarity scores: 0.16-0.32 (Cosine), 0.57-0.60 (BERTScore)
- Framework successfully benchmarks six recent CQ generation tools across multiple input modalities
- System demonstrates extensibility for future KE automation task integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmarking system leverages multiple complementary evaluation metrics to capture different aspects of CQ quality. Cosine similarity provides baseline lexical overlap measurement, while BERTScore captures semantic similarity through contextual embeddings. The LLM-based scoring adds nuanced assessment of question quality and relevance. This multi-metric approach addresses the inherent complexity of evaluating natural language generation in technical domains, where semantic correctness and contextual appropriateness are as important as lexical similarity. The gold standard dataset provides ground truth for quantitative comparison, while the extensible architecture allows adaptation to evolving generation technologies.

## Foundational Learning
- Competency Questions: Formal queries representing knowledge requirements for ontologies; essential for ensuring ontologies capture intended domain knowledge
- Gold Standard Dataset: Curated collection of verified CQs used for benchmarking; provides reference for evaluating generated outputs
- BERTScore: Semantic similarity metric using contextual embeddings; captures meaning beyond surface-level text matching
- Cosine Similarity: Vector-based similarity measure; provides baseline lexical overlap assessment
- LLM-based Scoring: AI model evaluation of generated content; adds qualitative assessment of CQ quality and relevance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Sources -> Preprocessing -> CQ Generation Tools -> Similarity Metrics -> Results Aggregation -> Benchmark Report

**Critical Path:** Raw input (user stories/ontology/docs) → Preprocessing → Tool execution → Multi-metric evaluation → Result compilation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Comprehensive evaluation (multiple metrics) vs computational overhead; Extensibility (modular design) vs initial complexity; Gold standard reliance (benchmark quality) vs maintenance burden

**Failure Signatures:** Low similarity scores across metrics indicate poor tool performance; Inconsistent metric results suggest evaluation method limitations; High computational costs signal scalability issues

**First Experiments:**
1. Run single tool with minimal input to verify basic functionality
2. Test all three similarity metrics on known identical inputs
3. Evaluate framework performance with different input modalities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Gold standard dataset represents limited scope of real-world applications
- Performance evaluation shows significant variability across tools
- Current similarity metrics may not fully capture semantic nuances
- Framework extensibility remains unproven beyond current implementations

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Dataset utility for benchmarking purposes
- Framework's basic functionality and architecture

**Medium Confidence:**
- Comparative analysis of current CQ generation tools
- Baseline performance metrics establishment

**Low Confidence:**
- Long-term applicability to evolving LLM technologies
- Cross-domain generalizability of results

## Next Checks
1. Expand gold standard dataset to include additional domain ontologies and validate cross-domain applicability
2. Conduct user studies to correlate automated similarity scores with expert human assessment of CQ quality
3. Implement longitudinal testing to evaluate framework performance as newer LLM models and generation techniques emerge
