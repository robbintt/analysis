# Building Task Bots with Self-learning for Enhanced Adaptability, Extensibility, and Factuality

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.19689
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19689
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Three contributions addressing task bot adaptability, extensibility, and factuality with minimal human intervention

## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses the critical challenge of building task bots that can operate autonomously with minimal human intervention while maintaining adaptability, extensibility, and factual accuracy. The research introduces three innovative frameworks: SL-A GENT for self-learning adaptation, SGP-TOD for schema-guided task creation, and a self-alignment approach for improving factuality. These contributions enable task bots to handle unseen user behaviors, support effortless task bot creation and extension, and mitigate hallucinations through self-evaluation. Experimental results across established dialogue tasks demonstrate significant improvements in automatic adaptation, zero-shot performance, and factual accuracy.

## Method Summary
The thesis introduces three complementary frameworks for building autonomous task bots. SL-A GENT employs reinforcement learning with a pre-trained reward model to enable task bots to adapt to unseen user behaviors without human intervention. SGP-TOD leverages schema-guided LLM prompting to facilitate effortless task bot creation and extension by integrating symbolic task schemas into LLMs. The self-alignment framework uses an LLM's self-evaluation capability to improve factual accuracy through two key techniques: SELF-EVAL for self-assessment and SK-TUNING for knowledge refinement. Together, these approaches create a comprehensive system for developing highly autonomous and reliable task bots.

## Key Results
- SL-A GENT successfully enables task bots to adapt to unseen user behaviors through reinforcement learning with pre-trained reward models
- SGP-TOD achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance for effortless task bot creation and extension
- Self-alignment framework significantly improves factual accuracy by mitigating hallucinations through SELF-EVAL and SK-TUNING

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of these approaches stems from their synergistic integration of symbolic reasoning with neural learning capabilities. The self-learning framework (SL-A GENT) works by leveraging reinforcement learning signals from a pre-trained reward model that captures human preferences and task success criteria. This allows the system to continuously improve through interaction without requiring explicit human supervision. The schema-guided prompting strategy (SGP-TOD) bridges the gap between structured task definitions and LLM flexibility by encoding task-specific knowledge into symbolic schemas that guide generation. The self-alignment mechanism exploits the LLM's inherent ability to evaluate its own outputs against internal consistency checks and external knowledge, creating a closed-loop refinement process that progressively reduces hallucinations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning with Reward Models**: Why needed - Enables autonomous adaptation without human feedback; Quick check - Validate reward model stability across diverse user behaviors
- **Schema-guided Prompting**: Why needed - Bridges structured task definitions with LLM flexibility; Quick check - Test schema completeness across task domains
- **Self-Evaluation Mechanisms**: Why needed - Provides internal consistency checking for factuality; Quick check - Measure self-evaluation accuracy against ground truth
- **Symbolic-Subsymbolic Integration**: Why needed - Combines structured knowledge with pattern learning; Quick check - Assess schema coverage in complex scenarios
- **Zero-shot Learning Capabilities**: Why needed - Enables rapid task bot deployment; Quick check - Evaluate performance on unseen task types

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Input -> Task Understanding -> Schema Application -> Response Generation -> Self-Evaluation -> Knowledge Update

**Critical Path:**
The core workflow begins with user input processing, followed by schema-guided task understanding, response generation through the LLM, self-evaluation of factual accuracy, and knowledge base updates. The reinforcement learning component operates in parallel, continuously adapting behavior based on reward signals.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework prioritizes autonomy over precision, accepting occasional errors in exchange for reduced human intervention requirements. Schema complexity versus flexibility represents another key tradeoff, where richer schemas improve accuracy but reduce adaptability to novel situations. The self-alignment approach trades computational overhead for improved factuality, with the self-evaluation step potentially slowing response times.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Schema incompleteness leading to task misunderstanding
- Reward model bias causing suboptimal adaptation
- Self-evaluation overconfidence masking hallucinations
- Schema rigidity preventing adaptation to novel user behaviors
- Computational overhead from continuous self-evaluation

**First Experiments:**
1. Test SGP-TOD with minimal schemas on simple task completion
2. Evaluate SL-A GENT adaptation on gradually changing user behaviors
3. Measure self-alignment effectiveness on controlled hallucination scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Generalizability uncertainty beyond tested dialogue tasks to more complex real-world scenarios
- Unclear effectiveness handling extremely rare or novel edge cases due to potential reward model brittleness
- Schema quality and completeness variability in practical applications may affect extensibility claims
- Self-alignment framework's reliance on LLM self-evaluation introduces potential circular reasoning risks

## Confidence
- **High**: Experimental results demonstrating improved factual accuracy through the self-alignment framework are well-supported by the data
- **Medium**: Zero-shot performance claims for SGP-TOD are convincing within tested domains but require validation across broader task types
- **Medium**: Adaptation capabilities of SL-A GENT show promise but need longer-term validation in dynamic, real-world environments

## Next Checks
1. Deploy the complete framework in a live customer service environment for 6+ months to evaluate real-world adaptability and factuality maintenance over time
2. Test schema-guided prompting across 10+ diverse task domains with varying schema complexity to assess true extensibility limits
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the reward model component from SL-A GENT to quantify its specific contribution versus baseline reinforcement learning approaches
