# ACADATA: Parallel Dataset of Academic Data for Machine Translation

## Quick Facts

- 1.5 million human-generated paragraph pairs across 12 European languages for academic translation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation consisting of 1.5 million human-generated paragraph pairs (ACAD-TRAIN) and a curated evaluation set (ACAD-BENCH) covering 12 European languages. The authors fine-tune two Large Language Models (7B and 2B parameters) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them against specialized MT systems, open-weight LLMs, and proprietary models. Results demonstrate significant improvements: +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively, with the top model surpassing both proprietary and open-weight systems on academic translation. The fine-tuned models also improve long-context translation in general domains by up to 24.9% when translating out of English. The dataset and models are released under permissive licenses to advance academic domain and long-context translation research.

## Method Summary
The authors created ACADATA by collecting and aligning academic content across 12 European languages, generating 1.5 million human-produced paragraph pairs for training (ACAD-TRAIN) and curating a separate evaluation set (ACAD-BENCH). Two Large Language Models (7B and 2B parameters) were fine-tuned on ACAD-TRAIN. The fine-tuned models were then benchmarked against specialized machine translation systems, open-weight LLMs, and proprietary models using ACAD-BENCH. Performance was measured using d-BLEU metrics, and generalization to long-context translation in general domains was also evaluated.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned 7B model achieved +6.1 d-BLEU points improvement over baseline on academic translation
- Fine-tuned 2B model achieved +12.4 d-BLEU points improvement over baseline on academic translation
- Top model surpassed both proprietary and open-weight systems on academic translation tasks
- Generalization improvement of up to 24.9% in long-context translation for general domains when translating out of English

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success stems from domain-specific fine-tuning on high-quality academic content. By training on human-generated paragraph pairs specifically from academic texts, the models learn specialized terminology, discourse structures, and stylistic conventions unique to scholarly writing. The parallel nature of the dataset ensures consistent alignment across languages, while the large scale (1.5 million pairs) provides sufficient coverage of academic vocabulary and patterns. The fine-tuning process adapts general-purpose language models to the specific challenges of academic translation, including handling technical terminology and maintaining formal register across languages.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Parallel Corpus Alignment**
   - Why needed: Ensures source and target texts convey identical meaning across languages
   - Quick check: Verify sentence-level alignment quality using automatic metrics like BLEU or TER

2. **Domain Adaptation**
   - Why needed: General models lack specialized vocabulary and conventions of academic writing
   - Quick check: Compare terminology consistency between general and domain-specific translations

3. **Fine-tuning vs. Training from Scratch**
   - Why needed: Fine-tuning leverages pre-existing language understanding while adapting to domain
   - Quick check: Measure performance difference between fine-tuned and from-scratch models on academic tasks

4. **Long-context Processing**
   - Why needed: Academic texts often require maintaining coherence across longer passages
   - Quick check: Evaluate model performance on increasing context lengths

5. **Multilingual Alignment Quality**
   - Why needed: Poor alignment degrades translation quality across all language pairs
   - Quick check: Sample alignment verification by bilingual experts

6. **Evaluation Metric Selection**
   - Why needed: BLEU may not fully capture academic translation quality nuances
   - Quick check: Supplement automatic metrics with human evaluation on sample translations

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: ACAD-TRAIN corpus -> Fine-tuning process -> Fine-tuned LLM -> ACAD-BENCH evaluation -> Performance comparison

Critical path: Dataset creation → Model fine-tuning → Benchmarking → Analysis

Design tradeoffs:
- Human-generated vs. automatically aligned data: Higher quality but more resource-intensive
- Model size selection: Balance between performance gains and computational cost
- Evaluation scope: Academic domain focus vs. generalization to general translation

Failure signatures:
- Low BLEU scores indicating poor alignment or inadequate fine-tuning
- Terminology inconsistencies suggesting insufficient domain exposure
- Context collapse in longer passages indicating limited attention capacity

3 first experiments:
1. Fine-tune smaller models (1B, 3B) to establish performance scaling relationship
2. Test different fine-tuning durations to find optimal convergence point
3. Evaluate on out-of-domain academic texts to assess generalization boundaries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Limited details about human annotation process and quality control measures for the 1.5 million paragraph pairs
- Proprietary models compared against lack specificity in terms of which models were tested
- Generalization claims based on single metric and direction need broader validation across language pairs

## Confidence

High confidence: Dataset creation methodology and basic premise of creating specialized academic translation dataset
Medium confidence: Reported benchmark results and comparative performance metrics
Low confidence: Generalization claims about dataset utility and specific quality assessments of human-generated content

## Next Checks

1. Conduct inter-annotator agreement studies on a subset of the dataset to empirically validate human-generated paragraph pair quality
2. Test fine-tuned models on additional academic domains and general translation tasks to verify generalization improvements across multiple scenarios
3. Perform ablation studies comparing different model sizes and training configurations to understand relationship between parameters and translation quality in academic domain
