core_contribution: ThematicPlane is a system that enables users to navigate and manipulate
  high-level semantic concepts within an interactive thematic design plane, bridging
  the gap between tacit creative intent and system control for image generation. In
  an exploratory study with 6 participants, users engaged in divergent and convergent
  creative modes, with mean satisfaction ratings of 5.86 (SD = 0.90) despite some
  unexpected outputs (mean 3.43, SD = 1.27).

# ThematicPlane: Bridging Tacit User Intent and Latent Spaces for Image Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06065
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06065
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: System enables navigation and manipulation of high-level semantic concepts in interactive thematic design plane

## Executive Summary
ThematicPlane introduces an interactive system that bridges tacit creative intent with latent space control for image generation. The system allows users to navigate and manipulate high-level semantic concepts through a thematic design plane, enabling both divergent exploration and convergent refinement of generated images. In an exploratory study with 6 participants, users demonstrated expressive, iterative workflows despite some inconsistencies in output generation. The work identifies opportunities for more explainable controls while advancing intuitive, semantics-driven interaction in generative design tools.

## Method Summary
The study employed an exploratory design with 6 participants using ThematicPlane to engage in creative tasks. Users interacted with the thematic design plane to navigate semantic concepts and generate images, operating in both divergent (exploration) and convergent (refinement) modes. The system aimed to map high-level thematic concepts to latent space manipulations, though participants reported varying expectations about how themes translated to outputs. Satisfaction was measured through user ratings, and qualitative feedback was collected on the system's ability to support expressive workflows.

## Key Results
- Users achieved mean satisfaction rating of 5.86 (SD = 0.90) on unspecified scale
- System enabled both divergent and convergent creative modes
- Participants reported "unexpected outputs" with mean rating of 3.43 (SD = 1.27)
- Users found system fostered expressive, iterative workflows despite control interpretability challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by creating an intermediate semantic layer between user intent and latent space operations. Instead of requiring users to manipulate abstract latent vectors directly, ThematicPlane maps high-level thematic concepts to regions in the latent space. This semantic bridging allows users to navigate conceptual relationships (e.g., "vintage" vs "modern" or "natural" vs "urban") through intuitive controls, with the system translating these semantic selections into appropriate latent space transformations. The thematic design plane serves as a visual interface for exploring these semantic relationships and their corresponding visual outputs.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Semantic-to-latent mapping** - Translating high-level concepts into latent space coordinates is non-trivial due to the complex, distributed nature of semantic information in generative models. This mapping is needed because users cannot directly manipulate abstract latent vectors. Quick check: Can the system consistently reproduce the same semantic input with similar outputs?

2. **Divergent-convergent creative cycles** - Creative workflows typically involve exploration (divergent) followed by refinement (convergent). Understanding this pattern is needed to design interfaces that support both modes effectively. Quick check: Does the interface provide distinct affordances for exploration versus refinement?

3. **User expectation alignment** - The gap between user mental models and system behavior affects usability. This understanding is needed because users may have different interpretations of how themes should map to visual outputs. Quick check: Do users' initial expectations match their actual experience with the system?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Input -> Semantic Interpreter -> Latent Space Mapper -> Image Generator -> Output Display -> Feedback Loop

**Critical Path:** User selects thematic concepts → Semantic interpreter translates to latent coordinates → Latent space mapper applies transformations → Image generator produces output → Display shows result → User provides feedback for next iteration

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system prioritizes semantic intuitiveness over precise control, accepting some unpredictability in exchange for accessibility. This means sacrificing pixel-perfect reproducibility for conceptual navigation ease. The tradeoff accepts that some users may experience "unexpected outputs" as a cost of semantic abstraction.

**Failure Signatures:** When outputs don't match semantic intent, the system may show: 1) Completely unrelated visual content, 2) Partial matches with unexpected elements, or 3) Semantic drift where related but unintended concepts appear. These failures indicate either poor semantic-latent mapping or user-system expectation mismatch.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Map a single semantic concept (e.g., "vintage") to its corresponding latent region and verify consistency across multiple generations
2. Test semantic interpolation between two concepts (e.g., "vintage" → "modern") and measure visual smoothness
3. Have users perform both divergent exploration and convergent refinement tasks, measuring completion time and satisfaction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=6) limits generalizability of findings
- Lack of baseline comparison makes it difficult to assess improvement over existing tools
- Inconsistent output generation ("unexpected outputs") suggests fundamental limitations in semantic-latent mapping
- Unspecified satisfaction scale prevents proper quantitative interpretation

## Confidence
- Core claim about enabling intuitive semantic navigation: Medium
- Observation of divergent/convergent creative modes: High
- Finding about differing user expectations for theme-output mapping: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled study comparing ThematicPlane against standard text-to-image interfaces with larger sample size (n≥20) to establish whether thematic design plane provides measurable benefits in creative task completion and user satisfaction.

2. Perform systematic evaluation of output consistency by having multiple users attempt to reproduce identical semantic manipulations, measuring variation in outputs to quantify the "unexpected" behavior reported by participants.

3. Implement and test explainable control mechanisms that visualize how theme parameters map to latent space coordinates, then evaluate whether this transparency reduces user confusion and improves satisfaction scores.
