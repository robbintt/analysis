# SEBA: Sample-Efficient Black-Box Attacks on Visual Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09681
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09681
- Authors: Tairan Huang; Yulin Jin; Junxu Liu; Qingqing Ye; Haibo Hu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves strong attack performance with 160K queries vs 4M for baselines

## Executive Summary
SEBA introduces a sample-efficient black-box adversarial attack framework for visual reinforcement learning that achieves strong performance with dramatically fewer environment queries than existing methods. The framework combines a shadow Q model to estimate victim rewards under perturbations, a GAN-based generator for producing imperceptible perturbations, and a world model to simulate environment dynamics and reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage alternating optimization procedure, SEBA trains the shadow critic first, then refines the generator with fixed critic supervision, enabling effective attacks while maintaining visual imperceptibility.

## Method Summary
SEBA is a four-component framework that attacks visual RL agents without gradient access. It uses a shadow Q model trained via TD learning on perturbed states, a GAN generator producing bounded perturbations, a world model (IRIS-based) for synthetic rollouts, and a discriminator for visual quality. The two-stage alternating optimization first trains the shadow critic on real and synthetic transitions, then updates the generator/discriminator using fixed critic supervision. Key hyperparameters include ε=8/255 perturbation bound, H=4 world model horizon, and 20 training iterations with 5K-step phases.

## Key Results
- MuJoCo tasks: Reduces cumulative rewards from ~150 to 1.61 with only 160K environment queries
- FID scores: Maintains visual imperceptibility at 62.43 vs 97.18 for ablation without discriminator
- Query efficiency: Uses 160K queries vs 4M for baselines, achieving comparable or superior attack strength
- Atari benchmarks: Reduces Alien reward from 8858 to 982 with 80K queries vs 2M for baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A shadow Q model provides differentiable optimization signals for black-box attack generation without accessing victim gradients.
- Mechanism: The shadow critic learns TD-based value estimates from perturbed state transitions collected via victim policy queries. Once trained, it serves as a surrogate objective: gradient descent on Q_shadow(s', a) w.r.t. perturbation parameters yields attack directions that reduce estimated victim return.
- Core assumption: The shadow critic's value landscape approximates the victim's true expected return under perturbations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions"
  - [Section 3.2] "The shadow critic Q_shadow serves as a differentiable surrogate for the victim policy... providing the attacker's optimization signal in a fully black-box setting."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus focuses on black-box attacks for classification/MARL, not visual RL surrogate critics.
- Break condition: If victim policy changes or environment dynamics shift significantly, shadow model estimates diverge from true returns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-stage alternating optimization stabilizes coupled generator-critic training.
- Mechanism: Stage 1 freezes (G_φ, D_ψ) and updates Q_shadow on perturbed transitions. Stage 2 freezes Q_shadow and updates (G_φ, D_ψ) using fixed critic supervision. This prevents chase-and-flee dynamics where a moving target misleads gradient signals.
- Core assumption: Temporal separation allows each component to converge sufficiently before the other shifts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator"
  - [Section 3.4] "Directly optimizing the generator G_φ and the shadow critic Q_shadow together often leads to instability... SEBA adopts a two-stage alternating strategy"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for alternating critic-generator optimization in RL attacks.
- Break condition: If stage lengths are too short, neither component stabilizes; if too long, the frozen component becomes stale.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A learned world model reduces real-environment queries by generating synthetic rollouts for training.
- Mechanism: World model W (discrete tokenizer + autoregressive transformer) predicts next latent tokens and rewards. Synthetic transitions (s'_t, a_t, r̂_t, ŝ'_{t+1}) augment the replay buffer at ratio H:1, providing off-policy supervision for Q_shadow and G_φ without real interaction.
- Core assumption: The world model's imagined dynamics remain sufficiently accurate under adversarial perturbations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries"
  - [Section 3.5] "Each real interaction is paired with H model-generated transitions, effectively expanding the replay buffer and reducing real environment queries by O(H)."
  - [Section 4.4] "Removing the world model (-WM) yields comparable or slightly higher attack strength, but increases environment queries from 160K to 800K."
  - [corpus] IRIS framework cited but not directly analyzed; corpus lacks world-model attack papers.
- Break condition: If perturbations push states outside world model's training distribution, imagined dynamics become unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning
  - Why needed here: Shadow critic uses TD targets (r_t + γQ(s_{t+1}, a)) to bootstrap value estimates. Understanding bootstrapping, discount factors, and off-policy learning is prerequisite for debugging critic divergence.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why TD learning has lower variance than Monte Carlo returns but introduces bias?

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Why needed here: Perturbation generator G_φ and discriminator D_ψ are trained adversarially. The generator loss L_G = -log D_ψ(s') + λQ_shadow(s', a) balances realism against attack effectiveness.
  - Quick check question: What mode collapse symptoms would you expect if the discriminator overpowers the generator?

- Concept: Model-Based RL / World Models
  - Why needed here: SEBA's world model learns p(z_{t+1}, r_t | z_{≤t}, a_{≤t}) to generate synthetic rollouts. Understanding latent dynamics, compounding errors, and model exploitation is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why might imagined rollouts degrade when trained on clean states but deployed on adversarially perturbed states?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Victim Policy π -> Shadow Critic Q_shadow -> Generator G_φ -> Discriminator D_ψ -> Perturbed States
  - World Model W -> Synthetic Transitions -> Replay Buffer D
  - Replay Buffer D -> (Q_shadow, G_φ, D_ψ) updates

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train world model W on clean environment transitions (Eq. 7)
  2. Loop: Stage 1 → collect perturbed transitions → update Q_shadow via TD (Eq. 2)
  3. Loop: Stage 2 → sample states → update (G_φ, D_ψ) via adversarial + Q-guided loss (Eq. 3)
  4. Deploy G_φ for attack-time perturbation generation (zero victim queries at execution)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - World model horizon H: Higher H → more synthetic data but compounding model errors. Paper uses H=4
  - Stage lengths T_1, T_2: Longer stages improve component stability but slow overall convergence. Paper uses T_1 = T_2 = 5K
  - Perturbation bound ε: Larger ε increases attack strength but reduces imperceptibility (FID). Paper uses ε = 8/255

- Failure signatures:
  - Q_shadow diverges → check TD target stability, learning rate, replay buffer distribution
  - FID spikes → discriminator collapsed; check gradient balance, D/G update ratio
  - Attack effectiveness degrades over iterations → world model distribution shift from accumulating perturbations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sanity check**: Train SEBA on a single MuJoCo task with world model disabled (-WM). Verify Q_shadow converges and attack reduces reward, isolating critic-generator loop
  2. **Ablation**: Remove discriminator (-D) and measure FID increase. Confirm visual imperceptibility degrades per Table 4 (62.43 → 97.18)
  3. **Transfer test**: Train world model on one task (e.g., Cheetah Run), apply to another (Walker Walk). Assess model generalization and query efficiency degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SEBA perform against victim agents trained with adversarial defense mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates SEBA against standard pre-trained agents (DrQ-SAC and Rainbow) but does not test against agents explicitly trained for robustness using adversarial training or other defense strategies.
- Why unresolved: The vulnerability of standard agents is established, but the "arms race" dynamic is unexplored; it is unknown if the shadow model guidance remains effective when the victim's policy is robustified against perturbations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results of SEBA on victim agents trained with adversarial training or certified defense methods in the MuJoCo and Atari environments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is SEBA's sample efficiency to the visual fidelity and complexity of the environment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] SEBA relies on a world model (IRIS) to generate synthetic rollouts and reduce queries. The paper uses MuJoCo and Atari, which have relatively structured or low-resolution visuals.
- Why unresolved: In high-fidelity, photo-realistic environments (e.g., autonomous driving simulators), world models often struggle with prediction accuracy. It is unclear if world model errors would compound, reducing the effectiveness of the synthetic rollouts and negating the sample efficiency gains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying SEBA to high-dimensional, photo-realistic benchmarks (e.g., CARLA or Habitat) comparing the performance drop against the current MuJoCo/Atari results.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the learned generator generalize to perform long-horizon targeted behavioral attacks rather than single-step action manipulation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates targeted attacks on specific action dimensions (Sec 4.5), but notes the goal is "steering the selected action dimension into the target interval" rather than achieving complex, temporally extended goals.
- Why unresolved: The current targeted attack optimizes immediate action selection. It is unexplored whether the shadow Q-model provides sufficient long-horizon signal to guide a victim through a specific sequence of states (e.g., "navigate to coordinate X") without getting stuck in local optima.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results showing the success rate of SEBA in achieving specific state-based goals (e.g., reaching a location) that require multi-step planning, rather than just satisfying an immediate action constraint.

## Limitations
- World model accuracy degrades under adversarial perturbations, limiting synthetic rollout reliability
- Shadow critic may not generalize well to different victim policy architectures
- Absolute query efficiency vs white-box attacks not established

## Confidence
**High Confidence** (supported by quantitative results and ablation studies):
- SEBA achieves superior query efficiency compared to black-box baselines
- FID scores demonstrate improved visual imperceptibility
- Two-stage optimization provides training stability

**Medium Confidence** (mechanism plausible but partially evidenced):
- World model effectively reduces real environment queries
- Shadow critic provides reliable gradient signals for attack optimization
- Alternating optimization prevents training collapse

**Low Confidence** (claimed but minimally demonstrated):
- Absolute sample efficiency advantage over white-box attacks
- Generalization of world model to novel perturbation distributions
- Long-term stability of attacks across extended deployment

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary generator and discriminator architectures while holding other components constant to determine minimum viable network sizes that maintain attack effectiveness and FID scores below 100.

2. **Distribution Shift Robustness**: Train the world model on clean states, then apply SEBA's generator to produce perturbations. Measure how prediction accuracy degrades as a function of perturbation magnitude and horizon length H, quantifying the theoretical trade-off between query savings and model reliability.

3. **Transfer Attack Evaluation**: Evaluate SEBA's performance when trained on one victim policy (e.g., DrQ-SAC) and deployed against a different policy architecture (e.g., PPO) on the same task. This tests whether the shadow critic generalizes beyond the specific victim it was trained against.
