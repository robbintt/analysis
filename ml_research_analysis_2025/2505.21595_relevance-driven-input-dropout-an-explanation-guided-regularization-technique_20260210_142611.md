# Relevance-driven Input Dropout: an Explanation-guided Regularization Technique

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.21595
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21595
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RelDrop achieves 95.70% CIFAR-10 accuracy vs 94.98% baseline on ResNet-18

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Relevance-driven Input Dropout (RelDrop), a novel data augmentation technique that leverages explainability-guided regularization to improve model generalization. Unlike traditional random occlusion methods, RelDrop selectively masks the most relevant regions of the input during training based on attribution maps, encouraging the model to utilize more diverse features for prediction. The authors demonstrate RelDrop's effectiveness on both 2D image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-1k) and 3D point cloud classification (ModelNet40, ShapeNet).

## Method Summary
RelDrop is a data augmentation technique that occludes the most relevant regions of input data during training based on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) attribution maps. For 2D images, it masks rectangular blocks centered on the most relevant pixel with dataset mean values, while for 3D point clouds, it replaces individual points with the origin. The method uses a balanced approach (α=0.5) combining random and attribution-guided occlusion, with β=0.15 for 3D point clouds. During training, LRP computes pixel/point-level attributions identifying features the model currently relies on, and these regions are occluded with controlled probability, compelling the network to activate alternative pathways and learn supplementary discriminative features.

## Key Results
- RelDrop achieves 95.70% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18) vs 94.98% baseline and 95.27% for random erasing
- On ImageNet-1k, RelDrop improves ResNet-50 accuracy from 77.39% to 77.79% with 224×224 images
- For 3D point clouds, RelDrop with α=0.5, β=0.15 achieves 92.41% instance accuracy on ModelNet40 vs 91.94% baseline
- RelDrop shows improved robustness to occlusion and better zero-shot performance on challenging datasets (ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, ImageNet-O)
- The method increases Relevance Rank Accuracy, indicating models rely more on object features rather than background context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Attribution-Guided Feature Diversification
Selectively masking high-attribution regions forces models to learn distributed representations across more features rather than overfitting to a few. During training, LRP computes pixel/point-level attributions identifying features the model currently relies on. These regions are then occluded with high probability (controlled by hyperparameters), compelling the network to activate alternative pathways and learn supplementary discriminative features.

### Mechanism 2: Informed Regularization via Dynamic Targeting
Unlike random occlusion methods, RelDrop targets the specific features most likely causing overfitting at each training step. Attribution maps are computed per-batch, making the regularization adaptive to the model's current decision-making state. The occlusion strategy updates as the model learns, continuously challenging newly-formed dependencies.

### Mechanism 3: Distributed Channel Relevance in Deep Layers
RelDrop induces less sparse relevance distributions across channels in deeper network layers, correlating with improved semantic robustness. By forcing reliance on more features, later layers must integrate information from more diverse upstream channels rather than specializing on narrow pathways.

## Foundational Learning

- **Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)**: Core attribution method for identifying which input regions to occlude; understanding its rules (ε-rule, z⁺-rule, Flat-rule) and stabilizer parameter (ε) is essential for debugging attribution quality. Quick check: Can you explain why LRP requires batch normalization canonization before attribution computation?

- **Input-space vs. Feature-space Regularization**: RelDrop operates on inputs (complete information removal) unlike dropout on activations (partial information via alternate paths). This distinction explains why occlusion percentages must be lower (~15% optimal) than standard dropout rates (~50%). Quick check: Why would 50% input occlusion be more harmful than 50% dropout on hidden activations?

- **Robustness Metrics (Point Flipping, RRA)**: Evaluating RelDrop requires understanding robustness beyond accuracy—e.g., progressive feature removal tests and Relevance Rank Accuracy for measuring object-feature alignment. Quick check: What does a higher RRA score indicate about model decision-making?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Model forward pass -> LRP backward pass for attributions -> Normalize attributions to [0,1] -> Generate mask based on modality-specific rules -> Apply mask (Equation 1): I_RelDrop = M_R ⊙ I + (1 - M_R) · s -> Continue training on augmented inputs

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Forward pass on batch
  2. LRP backward pass → attribution maps
  3. Normalize attributions to [0,1] probability space
  4. Generate mask based on modality-specific rules
  5. Apply mask (Equation 1): I_RelDrop = M_R ⊙ I + (1 - M_R) · s
  6. Continue training on augmented inputs

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Compute vs. regularization strength: Higher attribution frequency improves targeting but increases overhead; paper computes per-batch
  - Complete vs. balanced targeting: α=0.5 (50% random, 50% guided) empirically best; pure guided can hurt convergence
  - Occlusion size: Larger β/SO removes more signal; β=0.15 optimal for 3D, SO in [0.02, 0.4] for 2D

- **Failure signatures**: 
  - Training loss diverges or plateaus early: β or SO too high (excessive information removal)
  - No improvement over Random Erasing: LRP ε parameter poorly tuned (try ε=0.001 as baseline)
  - RRA decreases: Model shifting to background features; check attribution quality on validation samples

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline comparison on CIFAR-10/100**: Train ResNet-18 with no augmentation, Random Erasing (p=0.5), and RelDrop (p=0.5, ε=0.001). Compare test accuracy gap.
  2. **Hyperparameter sweep for β (3D)**: On ModelNet40 with PointNet++, test β ∈ {0.15, 0.3, 0.5} with α=0.5. Monitor instance accuracy and point-flipping robustness curves.
  3. **Attribution quality diagnostic**: Visualize LRP maps on 20 validation samples before training starts. If maps don't highlight expected object regions, adjust LRP rule configuration (ε-rule vs. z⁺-rule) before proceeding.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can RelDrop be effectively adapted for transformer-based architectures like Vision Transformers (ViTs)?**
  - Basis: Section 6 states the approach can be extended to "transformers... provided corresponding attribution methods are available," specifically citing attention modules.
  - Why unresolved: Current study is restricted to ResNet and PointNet++; interaction between RelDrop and self-attention mechanisms remains untested.

- **Does combining RelDrop with mixing-based augmentation strategies (e.g., CutMix, MixUp) yield superior performance?**
  - Basis: Section 6 notes that the localized block erasure technique can serve as a foundation for developing "RelDrop-based adaptations of CutMix [74], MixUp [77]."
  - Why unresolved: Unclear if feature diversification forced by RelDrop complements or conflicts with label/feature mixing processes of other state-of-the-art augmentations.

- **Can the balance between random and relevance-guided augmentation be automated dynamically during training?**
  - Basis: Section 6 identifies "balancing the strategy of random and attribution-guided augmentations beyond hyperparameter selection" as a subject for future work.
  - Why unresolved: Current method relies on static hyperparameters (α and β) found via search, which may be suboptimal as model's feature representations evolve over epochs.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks ablation studies on LRP rule selection across different model architectures, leaving attribution method sensitivity unaddressed.
- Zero-shot robustness improvements on ImageNet-R/A/O are shown, but the mechanism connecting RelDrop's training-time regularization to these specific failure modes remains hypothesized.
- Compute overhead (2-2.5×) due to per-batch LRP computation is significant, potentially limiting scalability to larger models or datasets.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core empirical claims of improved test accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and ModelNet40 (95.70% vs 94.98% baseline on CIFAR-10) are well-supported with multiple runs and statistical significance.
- **Medium Confidence**: Attribution-guided mechanism explanation is plausible but relies on qualitative visualizations and post-hoc analysis rather than controlled intervention studies.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific claim that RelDrop "leverages explainability" meaningfully is somewhat circular - the method uses attributions to mask inputs, but doesn't validate that these attributions are accurate or meaningful.

## Next Checks
1. **Attribution Quality Validation**: Run controlled experiments where ground-truth relevant features are known (e.g., synthetic datasets with labeled discriminative regions) to verify LRP attributions align with true feature importance before applying RelDrop.

2. **Rule Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically compare RelDrop performance across different LRP rules (ε-rule with varying ε, z+-rule, Flat-rule) on the same model/dataset pairs to identify optimal attribution configurations.

3. **Compute Overhead Mitigation**: Profile the per-batch LRP computation to identify bottlenecks, then implement batch-wise attribution caching or approximation methods to reduce the 2-2.5× overhead while maintaining performance gains.
