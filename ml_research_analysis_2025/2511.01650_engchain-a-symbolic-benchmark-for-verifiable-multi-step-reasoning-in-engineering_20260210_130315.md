## Executive Summary
EngChain introduces EngTrace, a symbolic benchmark designed to evaluate verifiable multi-step reasoning in engineering domains. The benchmark comprises 90 parameterized problem templates across three engineering branches, organized into nine domains and 20 distinct areas. A two-stage evaluation framework combines automated symbolic verification with an LLM-as-a-judge system to classify reasoning errors. Results show that while frontier reasoning models outperform others, even top models exhibit a "complexity cliff," with reasoning quality degrading sharply on advanced tasks. The benchmark demonstrates the need for process supervision beyond final-answer accuracy in high-stakes engineering applications.

## Method Summary
EngTrace uses Python-based symbolic templates that sample domain-aware parameters from authoritative engineering sources (Perry's Handbook, NIST) and apply physical constraints before computation. The two-stage evaluation framework first uses automated symbolic verification (numerical tolerance ε=0.02, semantic similarity τ=0.7) to check step-level consistency, then escalates to an AI Tribunal (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3) when alignment ratio <0.8 to classify discrepancies. Templates are rated on three difficulty axes: Conceptual Complexity, Mathematical Sophistication, and Procedural Depth. The benchmark evaluates 24 models using zero-shot prompting with temperature 0.2 and max tokens 4096, computing Final Answer Accuracy (FAC) and Reasoning F1 (F1_rec) via Hungarian matching.

## Key Results
- Frontier models (Gemini 3 Pro, DeepSeek R1) outperform others but all exhibit a "complexity cliff" on advanced tasks
- Llama 3.1 70B collapses to 23.33% on Advanced-tier problems, identifying frontier systems as the sole viable option
- Conceptual errors outnumber calculation errors by 2:1 to 3.7:1 ratio on advanced problems
- 85.86% of traces flagged as discrepancies were identified by the AI Tribunal as Alternative Correct derivations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Symbolic template generation with domain-aware parameterization produces contamination-resistant, physically grounded test cases.
- Mechanism: Templates are Python blueprints that sample parameters from authoritative engineering data sources (e.g., Perry's Handbook, NIST) and apply physical constraints before computation. This ensures generated instances are both diverse and physically plausible.
- Core assumption: Parameter space coverage is sufficient to stress-test generalization without requiring infinite templates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "The pipeline first samples domain-aware parameters from authoritative data sources... then performs core computations with multi-layer sanity checks"
  - [section F.0.1-F.0.3] Detailed examples of parameterization constraints per branch (e.g., temperature-dependent heat capacities for thermodynamics)
  - [corpus] Weak signal—FinChain applies similar symbolic template methodology to finance but not engineering physics

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The two-stage tiered evaluation captures valid alternative reasoning paths that strict outcome matching would reject.
- Mechanism: Tier 1 uses automated symbolic verification (numerical tolerance ε=0.02, semantic similarity τ=0.7). If alignment ratio <0.8, escalation to Tier 2 triggers a heterogeneous AI Tribunal (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3) to classify discrepancies as Alternative Correct, Calculation Error, or Conceptual Error.
- Core assumption: The AI Tribunal's majority consensus reliably approximates expert judgment on alternative derivations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4] "Tier 2: Multi-Model Heuristic Verification... majority consensus of these scalar scores defines ST2"
  - [section 5.4] "85.86% of traces flagged as discrepancies were identified by the AI Tribunal as Alternative Correct derivations"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for multi-model tribunal validation in engineering benchmarks

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Difficulty scaling via Conceptual Complexity, Mathematical Sophistication, and Procedural Depth exposes a "complexity cliff" where non-frontier models collapse.
- Mechanism: Templates are rated on three axes (isolated principles vs. multi-domain synthesis; algebraic substitution vs. differential equations; short vs. long reasoning chains). This stratification reveals that open-weights models perform competitively on Easy tasks but degrade sharply on Advanced tasks.
- Core assumption: The three-axis difficulty framework correlates with real-world engineering problem complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4] "Problem difficulty in EngTrace is calibrated through a multi-axis framework defined by three dimensions"
  - [section 5.3.4] "Llama 3.1 70B collapses to 23.33% [on Advanced], identifying frontier systems as the sole viable option"
  - [corpus] Weak signal—EngiBench mentions real-world engineering complexity but uses subjective rubric scoring, not multi-axis scaling

## Foundational Learning

- **Symbolic Template Design**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how templates encode variable slots, constraints, and ground-truth derivations is prerequisite to modifying or extending the benchmark.
  - Quick check question: Given a CSTR template with F_A0, F_A, and -r_A as parameters, what constraint ensures V > 0?

- **Process Supervision vs. Outcome Matching**
  - Why needed here: The benchmark's core innovation is evaluating reasoning traces, not just final answers—essential for interpreting F1_rec scores.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model with 100% final-answer accuracy still receive low Reasoning F1?

- **Physical Plausibility Constraints**
  - Why needed here: Templates must enforce domain-specific limits (e.g., material yield stresses, thermodynamic consistency) to prevent generating physically impossible scenarios.
  - Quick check question: In a heat transfer problem, why must temperature-dependent Cp coefficients be co-selected with the substance identity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Template Engine -> Validation Layer -> Evaluation Pipeline
  - Template Engine: Python generators with parameter samplers, constraint validators, and NL serializers
  - Validation Layer: AI Tribunal (3 frontier models) + human expert certification interface
  - Evaluation Pipeline: Tier 1 symbolic verifier → Tier 2 tribunal classifier → F1_rec calculator

- Critical path:
  1. Define template structure (variable slots, equations, output format)
  2. Implement domain-aware parameter samplers with physical constraints
  3. Generate instances, run AI Tribunal pre-screening, flag for human review
  4. Deploy to evaluation pipeline with step-level alignment

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Strict numerical tolerance (ε=0.02) catches small errors but may reject valid rounding; tiered escalation mitigates this
  - Multi-model tribunal adds computational cost but reduces single-model bias
  - Synthetic generation avoids contamination but lacks real-world linguistic ambiguity

- Failure signatures:
  - High FAC with low Reasoning F1 → likely "lucky guesses" (795 cases identified)
  - High Conceptual Error rate on Advanced tasks → abstract math pre-training not transferring (2:1 to 3.7:1 ratio)
  - Low Tribunal agreement → template may have ambiguous ground-truth

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablate Tier 2 tribunal and measure F1_rec correlation with expert judgment (baseline: ρ=0.632 with tribunal, ρ=0.411 without)
  2. Test contamination resistance by generating 100 instances per template with overlapping seeds and measuring variance in model performance
  3. Extend to a new domain (e.g., Civil Engineering) with 10 templates to validate generalizability of difficulty scaling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can tool-augmented reasoning effectively decouple semantic physical logic from computational precision in high-stakes engineering tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion states that future work will "explore tool-augmented reasoning to decouple semantic physical logic from computational precision."
- **Why unresolved:** Current models exhibit a trade-off between reasoning fidelity and numerical precision, and often fail to maintain physical consistency during complex calculations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study showing that equipping LLMs with external symbolic solvers significantly improves physical plausibility scores without sacrificing numerical accuracy on Advanced-tier problems.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can LLMs reliably calibrate confidence levels to distinguish between sound reasoning and hallucinations in safety-critical scenarios?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion proposes investigating "uncertainty quantification to determine if models can reliably calibrate confidence in safety-critical engineering scenarios."
- **Why unresolved:** The error analysis revealed that conceptual errors (hallucinating physics principles) outnumber calculation errors by 2:1, suggesting models lack awareness of their own limitations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A strong correlation between low model-assigned confidence scores and the "Conceptual Error" category identified by the AI Tribunal.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does reasoning performance degrade or improve when text-only problem descriptions are replaced with technical diagrams and schematics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Limitations section notes the current benchmark is "entirely synthetic" and "does not capture... non-textual information, such as technical diagrams."
- **Why unresolved:** Real-world engineering relies heavily on visual interpretation, a capability entirely absent from the current EngTrace evaluation pipeline.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An evaluation of vision-language models on a multi-modal extension of the benchmark containing visual representations of the physical systems.

## Limitations
- Benchmark's synthetic nature may not capture real-world engineering ambiguity and linguistic complexity
- AI Tribunal assumption that majority consensus approximates expert judgment could fail if models share systematic biases
- Three-axis difficulty calibration may not fully align with practical engineering problem complexity

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Symbolic template generation methodology, two-stage evaluation framework structure, and general findings about model performance degradation on advanced tasks.

**Medium Confidence**: Specific difficulty scaling calibration across three axes, reliability of AI Tribunal as expert judgment proxy, generalizability beyond tested 24 models.

**Low Confidence**: Benchmark's ability to capture real-world engineering complexity given synthetic nature, long-term stability of difficulty classification as models evolve.

## Next Checks
1. **Expert Validation Study**: Commission double-blind evaluation where domain experts independently review 100 reasoning traces and compare classifications with AI Tribunal consensus, measuring inter-rater reliability and identifying systematic divergences.

2. **Real-World Transfer Test**: Apply benchmark to evaluate performance on 50 real engineering problems from textbooks and industry case studies (ensuring no template overlap), measuring correlation between benchmark scores and real-world problem-solving success.

3. **Longitudinal Model Evolution Study**: Re-run evaluation with 3-4 subsequent versions of same models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro → Gemini 4 Pro) over 12-18 months to track whether "complexity cliff" shifts or persists as models evolve.
