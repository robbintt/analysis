# Beyond MedQA: Towards Real-world Clinical Decision Making in the Era of LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20001
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20001
- Authors: Yunpeng Xiao; Carl Yang; Mark Mai; Xiao Hu; Kai Shu
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: None (survey paper proposing a unifying taxonomy)

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a unifying paradigm to characterize clinical decision-making tasks along two axes: Clinical Backgrounds (No Background → Precise Information → Rich Information → Incomplete Information) and Clinical Questions (True/False → Multiple Choice → Short Answer → Open-ended). The framework aims to move beyond simplified benchmarks like MedQA by better representing real-world clinical workflows that require information gathering, synthesis, and iterative reasoning. The authors survey existing datasets, review training and test-time techniques, and identify key evaluation gaps in efficiency and explainability for complex clinical reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
This survey paper categorizes existing medical datasets into a proposed taxonomy based on two dimensions: Clinical Background type and Clinical Question type. It reviews training-time techniques (Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning) and test-time techniques (Chain-of-Thought, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Multi-agent Systems) for improving clinical reasoning. The authors propose three evaluation dimensions: Effectiveness (accuracy), Efficiency (step-wise reasoning quality), and Explainability (LLM-as-a-judge scoring). The paper synthesizes findings from 37 existing datasets and benchmarks without introducing novel experimental methods.

## Key Results
- Existing medical benchmarks like MedQA rely on simplified Q&A that underrepresents real-world clinical decision-making complexity
- Performance degrades significantly when moving from Precise Information/Multiple Choice settings toward Rich Information/Short Answer or Incomplete Information/Open-ended scenarios
- Test-time techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation show promise for handling complex clinical backgrounds and open-ended questions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Performance on clinical tasks degrades as task complexity increases from simplified Q&A towards real-world clinical decision-making scenarios.
- Mechanism: A unifying paradigm characterizes task difficulty along two axes: Clinical Background (No → Precise → Rich → Incomplete) and Clinical Question (True/False → Multiple Choice → Short Answer → Open-ended). Performance decreases as tasks move towards more challenging settings (Rich/Incomplete Backgrounds, Short/Open-ended Questions) that better reflect real clinical workflows requiring data gathering and synthesis.
- Core assumption: Real-world clinical decision-making is a multi-step, interactive process requiring information gathering and continuous evaluation, which simplified Q&A benchmarks fundamentally underrepresent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Many medical datasets, such as MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q&A) that underrepresents real-world clinical decision-making."
  - [section 3.5] "Existing papers all show that the performance of the same dataset in an incomplete information background setting is significantly lower than that in a complete information background setting."
  - [corpus] Corpus provides weak direct evidence for this specific paradigm. Neighbor paper "MTBBench" notes that existing benchmarks "fail to capture the complexity of real-world clinical workflows."
- Break condition: If models specifically trained for long-context reasoning and multi-turn dialogue can match or exceed their performance on simpler benchmarks without specialized architecture.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-agent systems can simulate clinical environments by modeling doctor-patient interactions, improving diagnostic reasoning through iterative information gathering.
- Mechanism: A system uses at least two agents: a "doctor" agent asks questions and requests tests, while a "patient" agent retrieves and provides relevant information from a dataset. This forces the doctor model to actively gather data under incomplete information settings rather than receiving pre-packaged context.
- Core assumption: Decomposing clinical tasks into interactive roles with iterative information retrieval improves reasoning accuracy compared to single-shot prompting with equivalent information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4] "In order to simulate the real clinical environment, the existing task set an incomplete information background as a multi-agent model."
  - [section 5.2] "Multi-agent systems have unique advantages in simulating doctor-patient interactions. Using doctor agents and patient agents can simulate real medical scenarios."
  - [corpus] "Language Agents for Hypothesis-driven Clinical Decision Making" uses language agents for interactive decision-making with reinforcement learning. "Second Opinion Matters" proposes multi-agent ensembles for clinical AI consensus.
- Break condition: If a single LLM with equivalent long-context access achieves similar or better accuracy without multi-agent overhead.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Test-time techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extend model capabilities to complex clinical backgrounds and open-ended questions without weight updates.
- Mechanism: CoT decomposes complex clinical tasks into step-by-step reasoning processes mimicking diagnostic thinking. RAG enhances accuracy by retrieving relevant external knowledge (e.g., PubMed, clinical guidelines), addressing Rich Information and Open-ended challenges.
- Core assumption: The model possesses sufficient underlying reasoning ability to follow structured prompts and integrate retrieved information accurately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.2] "CoT facilitates problem-solving by guiding the model through a step-by-step reasoning process... In clinical diagnostic tasks, some works decompose the task into the doctor's underlying reasoning process."
  - [corpus] "O1 Replication Journey -- Part 3" explores inference-time scaling for medical reasoning. "Medical Reasoning in LLMs" analyzes DeepSeek R1's CoT-like diagnostic processes.
- Break condition: If the model lacks foundational medical knowledge, causing confident but incorrect reasoning chains, or if retrieval surfaces irrelevant/low-quality evidence.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Multimodal Clinical Data**
  - Why needed here: Rich and Incomplete Information backgrounds require processing EHR data containing text, lab results, medical images, and time-series data (e.g., ECGs, vital signs from MIMIC datasets).
  - Quick check question: Can a standard LLM process raw numerical time-series data from an ICU monitor directly, or does it require preprocessing and formatting?

- Concept: **Benchmarks vs. Real-World Clinical Decision Making**
  - Why needed here: The core argument distinguishes simplified multiple-choice benchmarks from interactive, multi-step clinical reasoning requiring information gathering under uncertainty.
  - Quick check question: Why does achieving high accuracy on MedQA (Precise Information, Multiple Choice) not guarantee readiness for deployment in a clinical ward?

- Concept: **Training-Time vs. Test-Time Techniques**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes methods modifying model weights (SFT, RL) from inference-time enhancements (CoT, RAG). Understanding this guides architecture selection given computational and data constraints.
  - Quick check question: For adapting a pre-trained general LLM to a new clinical sub-domain with scarce labeled data, would a test-time technique (RAG) or training-time technique (SFT) be preferable as a first step?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Layer -> Context Manager -> LLM Core -> Enhancement Layer -> Agent Orchestrator (Optional) -> Output & Explanation
- Critical path:
  1. Patient history and clinical context fed to Context Manager
  2. Manager structures background into prompt. For Incomplete settings, initiates multi-agent dialogue; for Rich settings, applies relevance filtering
  3. Enhancement Layer retrieves external knowledge (RAG) or structures reasoning steps (CoT) as needed
  4. LLM Core processes enhanced prompt to generate Clinical Question answer (diagnosis, treatment plan)
  5. Final answer presented with CoT trace or explanation if explainability is required
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Latency vs. Quality: RAG and extended CoT traces improve accuracy but increase inference time and computational cost
  - Completeness vs. Noise: Rich Information backgrounds provide comprehensive data but introduce redundancy that may degrade reasoning; filtering mechanisms add complexity
  - Evaluation Simplicity vs. Realism: Multiple-choice outputs enable automated evaluation but poorly reflect open-ended clinical reality; open-ended answers require expensive human or LLM-as-judge evaluation
- Failure signatures:
  1. Hallucination in RAG: Model generates facts not supported by retrieved documents
  2. Reasoning Drift in CoT: Step-by-step logic contains subtle errors that compound, leading to confident but incorrect conclusions
  3. Context Window Saturation: In Rich Information settings, critical patient details are ignored when buried in long prompts, causing accuracy drops
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline Benchmarking: Evaluate base model on standard MedQA (Precise Information, Multiple Choice) to establish accuracy baseline
  2. Add Redundancy: Retest on modified MedQA with irrelevant clinical information inserted (simulating Rich Information background). Measure accuracy degradation
  3. Incomplete Information Simulation: Convert MedQA cases to multi-turn dialogue format where model must ask questions to obtain patient information. Measure both accuracy and efficiency (turns required for correct diagnosis). Apply simple CoT prompt to test recovery

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can loss functions or reward mechanisms be effectively designed for training LLMs on open-ended clinical questions where multiple answers may be valid and no standardized ground truth exists?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors ask, "How to design the loss function or reward is a problem that needs to be solved" for open-ended questions where standard ground truths are unavailable.
- Why unresolved: Unlike closed-ended tasks (e.g., multiple choice), open-ended questions lack a single correct answer, making traditional supervised fine-tuning and standard reinforcement learning reward signals difficult to formulate.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of label-free reinforcement learning methods or soft-constraint reward models that align with human clinical judgment without requiring discrete ground truths.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can LLMs be guided to effectively filter redundant information in rich clinical contexts or formulate high-value questions in incomplete information settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need to "guide LLMs to filter out redundant information" and extend this to helping doctor agents "ask a 'good' question" in incomplete scenarios.
- Why unresolved: Real clinical environments contain noisy data that degrades LLM reasoning, and current models struggle to distinguish useful signals from noise without explicit guidance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Novel training techniques or prompting strategies that demonstrate improved reasoning performance (accuracy and efficiency) in high-redundancy or information-retrieval scenarios compared to standard models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific evaluation metrics can be designed to measure the efficiency and explainability of LLMs in multi-round clinical dialogues?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.5 states, "Currently, there are few evaluation metrics for efficiency, and there are no evaluation efficiency metrics specifically designed for multi-round doctor-patient dialogues."
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation relies heavily on accuracy; efficiency (time/cost to decision) and explainability (quality of reasoning steps) lack standardized, automated measures, and LLM-as-a-judge methods suffer from hallucinations.
- What evidence would resolve it: The creation and validation of automated metrics that strongly correlate with expert human evaluation of clinical efficiency and reasoning quality.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How reliable are patient agents in multi-agent clinical simulations at retrieving dataset information and accurately answering doctor agents' inquiries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.3 notes, "There is insufficient research on whether patient agents can effectively retrieve datasets and accurately answer doctors' questions."
- Why unresolved: While multi-agent systems are used to simulate doctor-patient interactions, the fidelity of the "patient" in providing correct information from the source data is often assumed rather than verified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies benchmarking the accuracy of patient agents in retrieving and relaying clinical ground truths within simulated dialogues.

## Limitations

- The proposed evaluation metrics (efficiency, explainability) are described conceptually but not validated on the claimed 37 datasets, leaving their practical applicability unclear
- The boundaries between task categories (e.g., Rich vs. Precise Information) are subjective and lack objective operational definitions, risking inconsistent annotation
- The survey relies heavily on English-language datasets, limiting claims about global clinical practice representation

## Confidence

- **High**: The taxonomy framework is well-articulated and logically structured, providing a clear organizing principle for characterizing clinical decision-making tasks
- **Medium**: The claims about performance degradation with task complexity are supported by referenced literature but not directly tested in this survey
- **Low**: The proposed evaluation metrics lack empirical validation, making their effectiveness uncertain

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a small-scale inter-rater reliability study where multiple annotators categorize 10 diverse clinical datasets using the proposed taxonomy, measuring agreement to quantify the framework's objectivity
2. Implement the efficiency metric (efficiency = (1/N)Σei) on a single dataset (e.g., MedQA) using the exact step-by-step decomposition prompt, and compare results against baseline accuracy to verify its sensitivity to reasoning quality
3. Validate the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation by comparing its explainability scores against a small set of human expert ratings on clinical reasoning outputs, calculating correlation to assess reliability
