# Achieving Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Under Rényi Differential Privacy for Fair and Private Data Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.21815
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21815
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: FLIP achieves 67.84% improvement in balanced error rate and 20.87% improvement in adversarial normalized cluster balance on Adult dataset while maintaining privacy guarantees

## Executive Summary
FLIP introduces a transformer-based variational autoencoder combined with latent diffusion to generate fair and privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data. The method employs a two-phase training approach: first learning high-quality data representations, then performing fairness interventions through latent space disentanglement. By integrating Rényi differential privacy (RDP) constraints with fairness-promoting techniques like balanced sampling and neuron activation alignment via Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), FLIP addresses the challenge of simultaneously ensuring data privacy and fairness in synthetic data generation.

The empirical evaluation demonstrates that FLIP significantly improves task-agnostic fairness measures while maintaining competitive utility compared to existing baselines. On the Adult dataset, FLIP achieves substantial improvements in balanced error rate and adversarial normalized cluster balance, showcasing its effectiveness in generating synthetic data that respects both privacy and fairness requirements. The method provides a balanced approach to the trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and data quality in synthetic tabular data generation.

## Method Summary
FLIP utilizes a transformer-based variational autoencoder architecture combined with latent diffusion techniques to generate heterogeneous tabular data. The method implements a two-phase training strategy: an initial phase focused on learning high-quality data representations, followed by a fairness intervention phase that performs latent space disentanglement. Privacy is enforced through Rényi differential privacy (RDP) constraints, while fairness is promoted via balanced sampling techniques and neuron activation alignment across protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). This approach enables the generation of synthetic tabular data that simultaneously satisfies privacy requirements and fairness constraints.

## Key Results
- FLIP achieves 67.84% improvement in balanced error rate on Adult dataset
- FLIP demonstrates 20.87% improvement in adversarial normalized cluster balance
- Maintains competitive utility compared to existing baselines while ensuring privacy under RDP constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FLIP's effectiveness stems from its two-phase training approach that separately addresses representation learning and fairness intervention. The transformer-based architecture captures complex dependencies in heterogeneous tabular data, while latent diffusion helps in generating realistic synthetic samples. The integration of Rényi differential privacy provides rigorous privacy guarantees, and the use of CKA for neuron activation alignment ensures fairness across protected groups. The balanced sampling technique during training further reinforces fairness by preventing bias propagation in the synthetic data generation process.

## Foundational Learning
- Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP): A generalization of differential privacy that provides tighter privacy guarantees for iterative algorithms
  - Why needed: Traditional differential privacy can be too restrictive for iterative training processes like VAEs
  - Quick check: Verify RDP composition theorems are correctly applied across training iterations

- Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA): A similarity metric for comparing representations across different neural network layers or models
  - Why needed: Enables measurement and alignment of neuron activations across protected groups to promote fairness
  - Quick check: Confirm CKA values are computed correctly between group-specific representations

- Latent Diffusion: A technique for generating data by gradually denoising latent representations
  - Why needed: Helps generate realistic synthetic data from the learned latent space representations
  - Quick check: Validate that diffusion process preserves the learned representation quality

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data Input -> Transformer VAE -> Latent Space -> Latent Diffusion -> Synthetic Data Output

Critical Path: The transformer VAE learns representations in phase one, which are then used in phase two for fairness intervention through CKA alignment and balanced sampling, followed by RDP-constrained generation via latent diffusion.

Design Tradeoffs: The two-phase training allows separation of representation learning from fairness intervention, but requires careful hyperparameter tuning to balance fairness, privacy, and utility. The transformer architecture provides strong modeling capacity but increases computational complexity compared to simpler VAE variants.

Failure Signatures: Poor fairness metrics may indicate insufficient CKA alignment or imbalanced sampling; degraded utility could result from overly strict RDP parameters; unrealistic synthetic data may suggest issues in the latent diffusion process or representation learning phase.

First Experiments:
1. Train the transformer VAE on a simple tabular dataset without privacy or fairness constraints to verify basic functionality
2. Implement CKA alignment on a small subset of data to validate fairness intervention mechanics
3. Test RDP implementation with synthetic gradients to ensure privacy accounting is correct

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Empirical evaluation relies heavily on the Adult dataset, limiting generalizability assessment
- The trade-off analysis between privacy budgets and fairness metrics lacks systematic sensitivity studies
- Theoretical tightness of privacy guarantees under the combined transformer-RDP architecture requires further investigation

## Confidence
- Fairness improvements on Adult dataset: Medium
- Privacy guarantees under RDP: Medium
- Utility maintenance compared to baselines: High
- Generalizability across datasets: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of each component (transformer architecture, latent diffusion, CKA alignment) to fairness and privacy performance.

2. Test FLIP on multiple tabular datasets beyond Adult to assess generalizability and identify potential failure modes in different data distributions.

3. Perform a comprehensive privacy-utility-fairness Pareto analysis across varying privacy budgets (ϵ values) to quantify the practical trade-offs in real-world deployment scenarios.
