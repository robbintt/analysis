# MultiBanAbs: A Comprehensive Multi-Domain Bangla Abstractive Text Summarization Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.19317
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19317
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: 54,620 article-summary pairs across news, business, and cinema domains

## Executive Summary
This study introduces MultiBanAbs, a multi-domain Bangla abstractive text summarization dataset addressing the limitations of existing single-domain resources. The dataset comprises 54,620 article-summary pairs collected from diverse online sources including news, business, and cinema blogs, capturing varied writing styles and linguistic patterns across Bangla. Baseline models including BanglaT5-small, mT5-small, and a 3-layer LSTM were established, with BanglaT5-small achieving the best performance with ROUGE-1 of 24.01, ROUGE-2 of 12.12, ROUGE-L of 20.2, and BLEU score of 8.38. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of language-specific pre-training for Bangla summarization tasks and establish MultiBanAbs as a valuable benchmark for low-resource language processing research.

## Method Summary
The MultiBanAbs dataset was constructed by collecting Bangla articles and their corresponding summaries from various online sources across multiple domains including news, business, and cinema blogs. The dataset construction process involved systematic web scraping and data cleaning to ensure quality article-summary pairs. Baseline models were implemented using three different architectures: BanglaT5-small, mT5-small, and a 3-layer LSTM network. All models were trained and evaluated on the MultiBanAbs dataset using standard evaluation metrics including ROUGE and BLEU scores. The language-specific pre-training of BanglaT5-small was leveraged to achieve superior performance compared to the multilingual mT5-small model and the LSTM baseline.

## Key Results
- MultiBanAbs dataset contains 54,620 high-quality article-summary pairs across diverse Bangla domains
- BanglaT5-small achieved the best performance with ROUGE-1: 24.01, ROUGE-2: 12.12, ROUGE-L: 20.2, and BLEU: 8.38
- Language-specific pre-training (BanglaT5-small) outperformed multilingual mT5-small and LSTM baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of MultiBanAbs stems from its multi-domain coverage that captures diverse linguistic patterns and writing styles in Bangla, unlike previous single-domain datasets. The dataset's size of 54,620 pairs provides sufficient training data for neural models to learn abstractive summarization patterns. The superior performance of BanglaT5-small demonstrates that language-specific pre-training is crucial for low-resource languages, as it captures language-specific nuances and structures that multilingual models may miss. The LSTM baseline provides a strong comparison point, showing that even simple architectures can achieve reasonable performance when trained on sufficient multi-domain data.

## Foundational Learning

**ROUGE Metrics**: Measures n-gram overlap between generated and reference summaries, essential for evaluating summarization quality. Quick check: Calculate ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores for sample summaries.

**BLEU Score**: Evaluates translation quality by comparing n-gram precision, applicable to summarization evaluation. Quick check: Compute BLEU score between generated and reference summaries.

**Abstractive vs Extractive Summarization**: Abstractive generation creates new sentences while extractive selects existing ones, requiring different modeling approaches. Quick check: Analyze summary generation method by examining output diversity.

**Language-Specific Pre-training**: Models trained on target language data capture linguistic nuances better than multilingual alternatives. Quick check: Compare performance of language-specific vs multilingual models on same task.

**Multi-Domain Dataset Construction**: Collecting data from diverse sources improves model generalization across different writing styles. Quick check: Analyze vocabulary overlap between different domains in the dataset.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Web Scraper -> Data Cleaner -> Dataset Splitter -> Model Trainer -> Evaluator
**Critical Path**: Data Collection → Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation → Analysis
**Design Tradeoffs**: Language-specific pre-training (BanglaT5) vs multilingual (mT5) - better performance vs broader applicability; larger dataset vs computational cost; abstractive vs extractive approaches - creativity vs fidelity.
**Failure Signatures**: Low ROUGE scores indicate poor summary quality; domain-specific performance drops suggest limited generalization; BLEU score variations reveal translation-like errors in generated summaries.
**First Experiments**:
1. Train and evaluate BanglaT5-small on the MultiBanAbs dataset using ROUGE and BLEU metrics
2. Compare BanglaT5-small performance against mT5-small on the same dataset
3. Analyze domain-specific performance variations by training separate models for news, business, and cinema domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Dataset size of 54,620 pairs may not fully capture Bangla linguistic diversity across all domains
- Exclusive reliance on extractive metrics (ROUGE and BLEU) without human evaluation of summary quality
- Potential sampling bias from online sources that may underrepresent colloquial or regional Bangla variations
- Absence of cross-domain evaluation makes generalization capability unclear

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Dataset construction methodology and baseline model implementations are clearly described and reproducible
**Medium Confidence**: Reported performance metrics are internally consistent but lack external validation through human evaluation
**Low Confidence**: Claims about dataset comprehensiveness and coverage of all Bangla writing styles are not empirically substantiated

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluation studies with Bangla native speakers to assess summary coherence, informativeness, and fluency across different domains
2. Perform cross-domain evaluation by training models on one domain (e.g., news) and testing on others (e.g., cinema blogs) to measure generalization capability
3. Compare the dataset's linguistic diversity against established benchmarks for low-resource languages by analyzing vocabulary coverage, sentence complexity distributions, and domain-specific terminology
