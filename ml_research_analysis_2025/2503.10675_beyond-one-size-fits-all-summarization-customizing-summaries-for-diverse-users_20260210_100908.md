# Beyond One-Size-Fits-All Summarization: Customizing Summaries for Diverse Users

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.10675
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10675
- **Reference count**: 40
- **One-line primary result**: Multi-task VBART architecture achieves readability-controlled Turkish summarization with 87% YOD accuracy at highest level while maintaining semantic quality.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of controlling readability in Turkish text summarization, an under-explored area critical for effective communication across diverse literacy levels. The authors developed a custom dataset with controlled YOD (Yeni Okunabilirlik Düzeyi) readability scores and trained a multi-task architecture based on VBART. The model simultaneously generates summaries and predicts readability using both regression and classification heads. Evaluation against a supervised fine-tuned baseline showed comparable semantic accuracy (ROUGE-1 scores 0.345-0.666) but superior stability in maintaining target readability levels, particularly in mid-range YOD scores (9-12), with performance gaps of 7-15 percentage points.

## Method Summary
The approach uses VBART-Large (387M parameters) with special tokens `<yod_1>` through `<yod_16>` prepended to input text to control readability. A multi-task architecture with dual prediction heads (regression and classification) shares the mean-pooled encoder representation. The model is trained on a custom dataset of 76,759 Turkish summaries balanced across YOD levels 1-16, augmented with synthetic data via paraphrasing and ChatGPT. Training uses dynamic loss weighting (starting at 0.4, increasing by 0.05 every 3 epochs) and standard NLP optimizations including AdamW, FP16, and gradient checkpointing.

## Key Results
- Readability-controlled model achieved 87% success rate at highest YOD level (16) with ±1.5 tolerance
- Model outperformed baseline by 7-15 percentage points in mid-range YOD scores (9-12)
- Maintained comparable semantic quality with ROUGE-1 scores between 0.345-0.666 against baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Special token conditioning enables readable-controlled generation by binding target readability levels to input representations.
- Mechanism: Tokens `<yod_1>` through `<yod_16>` are prepended to source text; the encoder learns to associate each token with linguistic features (sentence length, syllable density) that characterize target YOD levels, guiding decoder output complexity.
- Core assumption: The model can disentangle readability-related features from semantic content during encoding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 3.4 describes special tokens placed "at the beginning of the input" to "specify the desired readability level" and "guide the model to interpret or generate text aligned with the indicated YOD level."
  - [corpus] Corpus shows weak direct validation; related work (CTRL, CTRLSUM) supports control-code conditioning but for English.
- Break condition: If semantic content and readability features are tightly coupled in Turkish morphology, special tokens may fail to decouple them, causing tradeoffs between meaning preservation and readability control.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dual prediction heads (regression + classification) reinforce readability learning through complementary supervision signals.
- Mechanism: The regression head (4-layer MLP → scalar) provides fine-grained feedback; the classification head (4-layer MLP → 16 classes) provides discrete category pressure. Both share the mean-pooled encoder representation, creating mutual regularization.
- Core assumption: Continuous and discrete readability signals encode overlapping but non-identical information about text complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 3.4.1–3.4.2 describe the two heads sharing "the same pooled input representation" to ensure coherence between predictions.
  - [section] Equation 8 shows both losses contribute to `L_total`, with classification weighted at 4×.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers validate dual-head architectures for readability; mechanism remains architecture-specific.
- Break condition: If regression and classification objectives conflict (e.g., regression predicts 9.8 but classification assigns class 11), gradient interference may destabilize training.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic loss weighting prevents early training instability by gradually shifting focus from summarization to readability control.
- Mechanism: `w_YOD` starts at 0.4 and increases by 0.05 every 3 epochs (max 0.8). This allows the model to first learn stable text generation, then refine readability alignment.
- Core assumption: Readability control requires a stable generation foundation; early readability pressure may disrupt language modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 3.6 describes the weighting: "dynamic weight, starting at 0.4 and increasing by 0.05 every 3 epochs (max 0.8)."
  - [section] Section 3.7 notes custom model loss "rapidly decreased from 4.60 to 0.28" despite complex multi-task learning.
  - [corpus] No corpus validation; dynamic weighting is paper-specific.
- Break condition: If the summarization foundation is unstable after warm-up (e.g., semantic drift), increasing readability weight may amplify errors rather than correct them.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transformer encoder-decoder architectures (seq2seq with attention)**
  - Why needed here: VBART is an mBART-derived encoder-decoder; understanding cross-attention and autoregressive decoding is essential for debugging generation quality.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the decoder attends to encoder outputs during token generation?

- **Multi-task learning and gradient interference**
  - Why needed here: The model optimizes three losses simultaneously; understanding task competition helps diagnose why validation loss may plateau or diverge.
  - Quick check question: If classification loss decreases but regression loss increases, what does this suggest about shared representations?

- **Readability metrics and linguistic features**
  - Why needed here: YOD formula weights polysyllabic words (H3–H6) and sentence length; knowing what the metric measures helps interpret why certain outputs fail to hit target YOD.
  - Quick check question: Given YOD weights, would replacing "araştırma" (5 syllables) with "inceleme" (4 syllables) raise or lower the score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Input: Source text + `<yod_i>` special token
  - Encoder (VBART-Large, 387M params): Produces hidden states
  - Mean pooling: Condenses encoder output to fixed vector
  - Regression head: 4-layer MLP (hidden→512→256→128→1)
  - Classification head: 4-layer MLP (hidden→512→256→128→16)
  - Decoder: Autoregressive summary generation
  - Loss combiner: `L_total = L_CE + w_YOD×L_YOD + 4×L_class`

- **Critical path:**
  1. Tokenize with `<yod_i>` prepended
  2. Encode; pool encoder output
  3. Pass pooled vector to both heads for auxiliary supervision
  4. Decode summary; compute CE loss vs. target
  5. Backpropagate combined loss

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - VBART-Large vs. VBART-XLarge: Chose Large for efficiency; XLarge may improve readability precision but doubles compute.
  - ±1.5 YOD tolerance: Relaxes evaluation to accommodate LLM stochasticity; may mask systematic bias.
  - Synthetic data augmentation: Balances YOD distribution but risks semantic drift; BERTScore filtering mitigates but does not eliminate.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low ROUGE + low YOD accuracy: Model fails to learn both tasks; check learning rate or data quality.
  - High ROUGE + low YOD accuracy: Model ignores readability tokens; verify token embedding and `w_YOD` schedule.
  - High regression loss + low classification loss (or vice versa): Head conflict; consider decoupling heads or adjusting relative weights.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablate classification head:** Train with only regression to test if discrete supervision is necessary; compare YOD hit rate at mid-range (9–12).
  2. **Vary `w_YOD` schedule:** Test static weight (e.g., fixed 0.6) vs. dynamic; measure training stability and final readability accuracy.
  3. **Token position test:** Move `<yod_i>` from start to end of input; assess if position affects controllability (hypothesis: start position provides stronger conditioning signal).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the proposed multi-task architecture be extended to control additional stylistic attributes or applied to other text generation tasks beyond summarization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that "Future research directions might explore the integration of additional control mechanisms or the application of this architecture to other text generation tasks."
- Why unresolved: The current study restricted its scope to readability control (YOD) specifically for Turkish text summarization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful fine-tuning of the model with new control tokens (e.g., for tone or length) on tasks like style transfer or simplification.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the model's readability control effectiveness generalize to Turkish text domains not represented in the training data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note in the Limitations section that the study "focuses on specific domains or text types" which may limit generalizability across "all Turkish content."
- Why unresolved: The custom dataset was constructed primarily from news, Wikipedia, and similar sources, potentially lacking domain-specific vocabulary from other fields.
- What evidence would resolve it: Zero-shot evaluation of the model on out-of-domain Turkish corpora (e.g., legal or medical texts) to measure YOD control accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do human evaluations of factual accuracy correlate with the automated semantic preservation metrics reported?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Evaluation Limitations state that "Quantitative metrics, such as ROUGE... may not fully capture this trade-off" between simplification and content accuracy, particularly given the use of synthetic data.
- Why unresolved: Synthetic data generation and automated metrics may mask factual inconsistencies or hallucinations introduced during the paraphrasing process.
- What evidence would resolve it: A human annotation study comparing the factual consistency of generated summaries against the source text.

## Limitations
- **Synthetic data quality**: The dataset relies heavily on synthetic generation via VBART-Large-Paraphrasing and ChatGPT API. While BERTScore filtering was applied for semantic fidelity, the long-term impact of synthetic data on model generalization and the potential for distributional shift between real and synthetic summaries remain unclear.
- **YOD metric limitations**: YOD (Yeni Okunabilirlik Düzeyi) is a Turkish-specific readability metric. While it captures key linguistic features (syllable count, sentence length), its sensitivity to summarization-specific phenomena (information density, named entities) is untested. The ±1.5 tolerance may mask systematic bias toward certain YOD ranges.
- **Dual-head architecture validation**: The regression + classification head design is theoretically motivated but lacks empirical validation against ablation baselines. The 4× classification weight is arbitrary; optimal weighting may vary by YOD level or dataset.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Semantic quality preservation (ROUGE-1 0.345-0.666) and dynamic loss weighting mechanism. These claims are directly supported by evaluation tables and training curves.
- **Medium confidence**: Readability control effectiveness (87% success at YOD 16). While results show strong performance, synthetic data quality and YOD metric limitations introduce uncertainty about real-world generalizability.
- **Low confidence**: Mechanism 1 (special token conditioning). The claim that tokens decouple readability from semantics is theoretically plausible but lacks direct validation; the paper does not test token ablation or alternative conditioning strategies.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablate special tokens**: Train identical models with and without `<yod_i>` tokens; measure degradation in readability accuracy to validate token conditioning necessity.
2. **Cross-metric validation**: Evaluate summaries with Flesch-Kincaid and Coh-Metrix alongside YOD to assess whether readability gains generalize beyond the primary metric.
3. **Human readability assessment**: Conduct user studies with Turkish speakers across literacy levels to validate that YOD-targeted summaries actually improve comprehension relative to standard summaries.
