# Understanding How Value Neurons Shape the Generation of Specified Values in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17712
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17712
- Reference count: 40
- This study introduces ValueLocate, a mechanistic interpretability framework that identifies value-related neurons in LLMs by leveraging activation differences between opposing value aspects, enabling targeted manipulation of value representations.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of understanding how values are encoded in large language models (LLMs) by introducing ValueLocate, a systematic method for identifying value-related neurons. The authors construct ValueInsight, a dataset of 15,000 scenario-based questions operationalizing four dimensions of universal values from the Schwartz Values Survey. Using an activation difference method between opposing value aspects, ValueLocate identifies neurons that significantly influence model value orientations. Experimental results on four LLMs demonstrate that ValueLocate outperforms existing methods, with targeted manipulation of identified neurons effectively altering value representations while maintaining reasonable text quality.

## Method Summary
ValueLocate leverages the Schwartz Values Survey framework to identify value-related neurons through a mechanistic interpretability approach. The method involves prompting LLMs with scenario-based questions representing opposing value aspects (e.g., Self-Transcendence vs. Self-Enhancement), computing activation probabilities for each FFN neuron across multiple prompts, and identifying neurons where the activation difference exceeds a 3% threshold. The framework uses the ValueInsight dataset containing 15,000 questions generated from 640 value descriptions, and evaluates results using G-EVAL scores on benchmarks like PVQ40 and ValueBench. Neuron manipulation involves scaling activations of identified neurons during inference to shift value orientations, with experiments conducted on Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and Baichuan models.

## Key Results
- ValueLocate successfully identified value-related neurons across four different LLMs, with fewer than 0.4% of neurons being value-related and concentrated around layer 15
- Targeted manipulation of identified neurons effectively shifted model value scores as measured by G-EVAL, with a 3% threshold balancing alignment improvement against text quality degradation
- The method outperformed existing approaches in value neuron identification and demonstrated practical utility for value alignment research in LLMs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits the principle that neurons encoding opposing value aspects should show differential activation patterns when processing value-aligned vs. value-opposed content. By computing activation differences between opposing value descriptions, ValueLocate identifies neurons whose states systematically correlate with value orientations. The Schwartz Values Survey provides a theoretically grounded framework for defining value oppositions, while the activation difference method offers a quantitative, model-agnostic approach to detecting value-related neurons without requiring prior knowledge of model architecture or training data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Schwartz Values Survey framework**: A psychological theory organizing human values into four higher-order dimensions (Openness to Change, Self-Transcendence, Conservation, Self-Enhancement) with opposing value aspects. Needed to provide theoretically grounded value definitions for neuron identification. Quick check: Verify that value descriptions capture meaningful oppositions (e.g., "equality" vs. "social power").
- **Activation difference method**: Computing p^+ - p^- for opposing value aspects to identify neurons whose activation patterns correlate with value orientations. Needed to quantitatively identify value-related neurons from activation data. Quick check: Ensure δ values are consistently above/below threshold for true value neurons.
- **FFN neuron analysis**: Focusing on feed-forward network neurons rather than attention heads or other components. Needed because FFN layers contain the majority of parameters and show interpretable activation patterns. Quick check: Confirm that identified neurons are concentrated in middle layers (around layer 15) as reported.
- **ValueInsight dataset generation**: Using GPT-4o to generate 15,000 scenario-based questions from value descriptions. Needed to create a large-scale, diverse evaluation benchmark. Quick check: Validate that generated questions cover all four value dimensions with balanced representation.
- **G-EVAL scoring**: Using GPT-4 to score value alignment on a 1-5 scale. Needed to quantitatively measure changes in value orientation after neuron manipulation. Quick check: Ensure inter-rater reliability by comparing scores across multiple GPT-4 runs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: ValueInsight dataset -> ValueLocate neuron identification -> Neuron manipulation hooks -> G-EVAL evaluation

**Critical path**: The essential sequence is: (1) Generate value descriptions and questions → (2) Run prompts through LLM with neuron activation hooks → (3) Compute activation probabilities and differences → (4) Identify neurons above threshold → (5) Validate through manipulation and G-EVAL scoring

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades off between finding truly value-related neurons (requiring high δ thresholds) and maintaining text quality (requiring moderate thresholds). The 3% threshold represents a balance, though this may need adjustment for different models or value dimensions.

**Failure signatures**: 
- If no neurons meet the threshold, the value descriptions may be too similar or the activation differences too small
- If neuron manipulation doesn't shift scores, the identified neurons may not be causally related to value generation
- If text quality degrades significantly, the threshold may be too aggressive or the manipulation method too crude

**3 first experiments**:
1. Generate ValueInsight dataset using GPT-4o with Appendix A prompts and verify balanced coverage across all four value dimensions
2. Implement neuron activation hook on FFN layers and compute p^+ and p^- for one value pair to verify the activation difference method works
3. Apply neuron manipulation to a small subset of questions and verify that G-EVAL scores shift in the expected direction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Disentangling correlated value dimensions**: How can neuron identification methods be adapted to handle value dimensions that share atomic values (e.g., Self-Enhancement and Openness to Change both including "Enjoying life")? The current framework may lead to inaccuracies when higher-order dimensions are not independent.
- **Impact on general capabilities**: To what extent does targeted manipulation of value-related neurons degrade other essential model capabilities like logical reasoning, factual accuracy, and text coherence? The evaluation focuses solely on value orientation without measuring broader impacts.
- **Architecture generalization**: Is the observed distribution of value-related neurons consistent across diverse LLM architectures such as Mixture-of-Experts or non-Transformer models? Experiments were limited to four specific dense Transformer models.

## Limitations
- The method relies on the Schwartz Values Survey framework, which may not capture all cultural variations in value systems or account for correlations between value dimensions
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on value orientation without assessing impacts on language fluency, text coherence, factual accuracy, or logical reasoning capabilities
- Experiments were conducted on only four LLMs, potentially requiring adaptations for other architectures or model families

## Confidence
- Method reproducibility: Medium - The core approach is well-defined but lacks specification of sample size N and exact G-EVAL prompt templates
- Effectiveness claims: Medium - Demonstrated success on reported models but untested on broader architectures or value taxonomies
- Generalizability: Low - Limited to FFN neurons in dense Transformers; unknown if results transfer to MoE, attention mechanisms, or other architectures

## Next Checks
1. Verify neuron identification by reproducing activation probability differences for at least one value pair on a small subset of ValueInsight questions
2. Test neuron manipulation on a held-out subset of ValueInsight questions to confirm G-EVAL score shifts without significant fluency degradation
3. Evaluate whether identified neurons transfer across different LLMs or only within the same model family by testing on an unseen model from the same architecture family
