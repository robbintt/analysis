# On LLM-Based Scientific Inductive Reasoning Beyond Equations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.16226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16226
- Reference count: 37
- Current LLMs achieve only 43.81% average accuracy on scientific inductive reasoning tasks where rules cannot be expressed mathematically

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in evaluating large language models (LLMs) for scientific inductive reasoning tasks that go beyond mathematical equations. The authors introduce SIRBench-V1, a benchmark comprising 7 tasks across biology and chemistry domains where the underlying scientific rules cannot be expressed as mathematical formulas yet yield deterministic answers. Through experiments with three representative LLMs (Claude-3.5-Haiku, GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Flash) using four inference strategies, the study demonstrates that current LLMs struggle significantly with this type of reasoning, achieving an average accuracy of only 43.81%. The findings highlight the need for more sophisticated approaches to scientific inductive reasoning in LLMs, particularly for scenarios involving complex, non-mathematical rule discovery.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes SIRBench-V1, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on scientific inductive reasoning tasks where the underlying rules cannot be expressed mathematically. The benchmark includes 7 tasks spanning biology and chemistry domains, with examples ranging from few-shot to long-shot scenarios. The authors evaluate three representative LLMs (Claude-3.5-Haiku, GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Flash) using four inference strategies: Implicit Inductive Reasoning, Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Iterative Refinement. Experiments systematically test different shot settings (few-shot vs. many-shot) and example lengths (short vs. long) to understand model performance patterns. The evaluation framework measures accuracy on both the examples and final predictions to assess the effectiveness of each inference strategy.

## Key Results
- Gemini-2.5-Flash achieved the highest average accuracy of 43.81% across all tasks and models
- All three LLMs showed consistently low performance on scientific inductive reasoning beyond equations
- Sophisticated inference strategies like Self-Consistency provided minimal benefits and sometimes degraded performance
- Models performed significantly worse on "few-long-shot" tasks compared to "many-short-shot" scenarios, despite similar total token counts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that current LLMs struggle with scientific inductive reasoning beyond equations because they lack the ability to discover and apply non-mathematical rules from examples. The benchmark tasks require understanding complex scientific relationships that cannot be reduced to mathematical formulas, such as molecule captioning or biological process descriptions. The mechanism of failure appears to stem from a structural mismatch between rule-based derivations (which work well for mathematical tasks) and holistic scientific descriptions (which require understanding semantic relationships and patterns). This suggests that standard inference strategies like Chain-of-Thought or Self-Consistency are not well-suited for this type of reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- Scientific Inductive Reasoning: The ability to infer general principles from specific scientific observations when mathematical equations are insufficient. Why needed: To evaluate LLMs on realistic scientific discovery tasks. Quick check: Can the model identify patterns in biological processes that cannot be expressed as equations?
- Few-long-shot vs. Many-short-shot: Comparing model performance when given few complex examples versus many simple examples with similar total token counts. Why needed: To understand how example quantity and complexity affect reasoning performance. Quick check: Does the model learn better from 3 detailed case studies or 10 brief examples?
- Chain-of-Thought vs. Implicit Reasoning: Different inference strategies for problem-solving, where Chain-of-Thought involves explicit step-by-step reasoning while Implicit reasoning relies on direct inference. Why needed: To test which reasoning approach works better for non-mathematical scientific tasks. Quick check: Does requiring the model to show its reasoning improve accuracy on molecule captioning?
- Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Reasoning: Tasks with clear right/wrong answers versus those requiring probabilistic assessment. Why needed: To isolate pure inductive reasoning capability from uncertainty handling. Quick check: Can the model consistently identify the correct biological relationship when the answer is unambiguous?
- Scientific Rule Discovery: The process of identifying underlying principles from examples in scientific domains. Why needed: To measure LLMs' ability to perform genuine scientific discovery. Quick check: Can the model induce the rule governing a chemical reaction from multiple examples?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input Examples -> Inference Strategy -> Reasoning Process -> Final Prediction
Critical path: Task examples are processed through the chosen inference strategy, which guides the model's reasoning approach, ultimately producing a prediction that is evaluated against the correct answer.
Design tradeoffs: The benchmark prioritizes task difficulty and scientific validity over computational efficiency, using longer prompts and more complex reasoning processes. The choice to focus on deterministic tasks simplifies evaluation but may not capture all aspects of scientific reasoning.
Failure signatures: Models struggle particularly with long-shot scenarios and tasks requiring holistic understanding of scientific relationships. Performance degrades significantly when examples are complex rather than numerous.
Three first experiments:
1. Test model performance on a simple "many-short-shot" task to establish baseline capability
2. Evaluate the same model on a "few-long-shot" version of the same task to measure the impact of example complexity
3. Compare performance using different inference strategies (Chain-of-Thought vs. Implicit) on identical tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do LLMs perform on scientific inductive reasoning tasks in disciplines beyond biology and chemistry, such as physics or materials science?
- How can model architectures or prompting strategies be adapted to improve performance on "few-long-shot" inductive reasoning tasks?
- How can the "structural mismatch" between current reasoning strategies and non-equation scientific tasks be resolved?

## Limitations
- The benchmark is limited to chemistry and biology domains, restricting generalizability to other scientific fields
- The small sample size of 7 tasks may not capture the full diversity of scientific inductive reasoning challenges
- The evaluation does not account for varying difficulty levels across different tasks within the benchmark

## Confidence
- High confidence: The benchmark successfully demonstrates that current LLMs struggle with scientific inductive reasoning tasks where rules cannot be expressed mathematically
- Medium confidence: The 43.81% accuracy rate represents a meaningful baseline for this specific type of reasoning task
- Low confidence: The benchmark can be generalized to represent all forms of scientific inductive reasoning beyond equations

## Next Checks
1. Expand the benchmark to include tasks from additional scientific domains (physics, environmental science, materials science) and test with a broader range of LLM models and inference strategies to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine which types of inductive reasoning (pattern recognition, causal inference, analogical reasoning) contribute most to the observed performance gaps
3. Implement human evaluation studies comparing expert scientific reasoning performance on the same tasks to establish baseline human-level performance and better contextualize LLM results
