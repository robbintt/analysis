# DriveCritic: Towards Context-Aware, Human-Aligned Evaluation for Autonomous Driving with Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.13108
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13108
- **Authors:** Jingyu Song, Zhenxin Li, Shiyi Lan, Xinglong Sun, Nadine Chang, Maying Shen, Joshua Chen, Katherine A. Skinner, Jose M. Alvarez
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** A VLM fine-tuned via SFT + RLVR achieves 76% accuracy on human preference alignment in trajectory evaluation, outperforming EPDMS and other baselines.

## Executive Summary
DriveCritic addresses the context-awareness gap in autonomous driving evaluation by introducing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that integrates visual and symbolic context to evaluate trajectory pairs. The paper observes that rule-based metrics like EPDMS fail to align with human judgment in nuanced scenarios due to fixed thresholds and lack of visual context. To solve this, DriveCritic combines multi-camera imagery, BEV maps, ego-vehicle status, and EPDMS sub-scores to make pairwise trajectory comparisons. The model is trained via a two-stage pipeline (SFT + RLVR) and achieves 76% accuracy on a curated dataset of challenging driving scenarios.

## Method Summary
DriveCritic uses a two-stage fine-tuning approach on Qwen2.5-VL-7B. Stage 1 (SFT) fine-tunes the model on 1,100 trajectory pairs with GPT-5-generated chain-of-thought reasoning traces. Stage 2 applies DAPO (a GRPO variant) with format and accuracy rewards over the full dataset. Inputs include stitched three-camera views, BEV maps with overlaid trajectories, ego status (velocity, acceleration, command), and EPDMS sub-scores (Lane Keeping, Ego Progress). The model outputs a structured reasoning trace and binary preference (A > B or B > A).

## Key Results
- DriveCritic achieves 76% accuracy on the test set, outperforming EPDMS and other baselines.
- The two-stage training pipeline (SFT + RL) is essential, with SFT-only at 64.5% and GRPO-only degrading to 46.4%.
- The model shows 81.8% robustness rate (consistency under trajectory-order flip), confirming reduced position bias.
- Qualitative results show correct context understanding in ambiguous scenarios (e.g., distinguishing safe lane offsets from violations).

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Modal Context Integration
- **Claim:** Combining visual and symbolic inputs enables context-aware trajectory evaluation that rule-based metrics cannot achieve.
- **Mechanism:** The DriveCritic model conditions a VLM on four inputs: (i) stitched three-camera view, (ii) BEV map with overlaid trajectories, (iii) ego-vehicle status (velocity, acceleration, command), and (iv) EPDMS sub-scores (Lane Keeping and Ego Progress). This cross-modal grounding allows the model to reason about whether a lane deviation is a benign buffer adjustment versus a true safety violation.
- **Core assumption:** Visual context contains semantic cues (road width, obstacles, traffic state) that resolve ambiguities in symbolic scores.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section IV-B.1]: "We empirically found that the chosen setup has the most reliable performance" after experimenting with alternative configurations.
  - [Section V-C]: Qualitative examples show correct context understanding leads to human-aligned judgments.
  - [Corpus]: Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers discuss context-aware reasoning in driving but do not validate this specific multi-modal fusion strategy.
- **Break condition:** If visual inputs are degraded (occlusion, poor lighting) or symbolic scores are corrupted, cross-modal reasoning may fail or amplify errors.

### Mechanism 2: Two-Stage Training with RLVR
- **Claim:** Sequential supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning produces more stable and accurate evaluators than either approach alone.
- **Mechanism:** Stage 1 (SFT) warms up the model using 1,100 trajectory pairs with GPT-5-generated chain-of-thought reasoning traces, teaching format adherence and grounding. Stage 2 (RL fine-tuning) applies the DAPO algorithm with format and accuracy rewards to refine judgments. Ablation (Table V) shows SFT-only achieves 64.5%, GRPO-only degrades to 46.4%, and the full pipeline reaches 76%.
- **Core assumption:** SFT establishes a stable policy initialization that RL can refine without catastrophic forgetting or reward hacking.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section IV-B.2]: "Our initial attempts with reinforcement learning (RL) alone proved unstable, with the model requiring a long warm-up."
  - [Table V]: Systematic ablation confirms both stages are necessary.
  - [Corpus]: No direct validation of this specific two-stage RLVR pipeline in neighbor papers.
- **Break condition:** If SFT data contains systematic biases or RL rewards are misspecified (e.g., only format adherence), the model may exploit shortcuts rather than learn genuine reasoning.

### Mechanism 3: Pairwise Preference Formulation
- **Claim:** Framing evaluation as pairwise adjudication rather than absolute scoring better handles multimodal driving behaviors and avoids rubric ambiguity.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of assigning scalar scores, the model selects between Trajectory A and B. This sidesteps the challenge of defining what a "7 vs. 8" means (noted in RFS limitations) and naturally accommodates valid alternative behaviors. The dataset construction specifically targets ambiguous regimes where EPDMS and human preferences diverge.
- **Core assumption:** Human preferences in pairwise comparisons are sufficiently consistent and recoverable by a learned model.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section IV-A.1]: "We therefore formulate the dataset task as a pairwise adjudication problem... no widely accepted rubric exists for grading nuanced trade-offs."
  - [Section IV-A.2]: Case 1 shows 91.7% preference consistency; Case 2 shows 60.4%, reflecting genuine ambiguity.
  - [Corpus]: Neighbor paper on "Case-based Reasoning Augmented LLM Framework" also uses scenario-based reasoning but does not compare pairwise vs. absolute scoring.
- **Break condition:** If preference labels are noisy, contradictory, or fail to capture safety-critical distinctions, the model will learn inconsistent judgments.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Rule-Based Driving Metrics (EPDMS)**
  - **Why needed here:** DriveCritic is explicitly designed to address EPDMS limitations. Understanding how EPDMS combines multiplicative safety penalties with weighted trajectory-quality scores clarifies where context gaps emerge (e.g., LK=0 penalties for benign lane offsets).
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a human driver might receive LK=0 despite safe, context-appropriate behavior?

- **Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**
  - **Why needed here:** The second training stage uses DAPO, a GRPO-variant under the RLVR paradigm. Understanding how relative advantages are computed within sample groups, and why explicit value functions are avoided, is essential for debugging training instability.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between RLVR and traditional RLHF, and why might RLVR be preferred for structured reasoning tasks?

- **Concept: Vision-Language Models as Judges**
  - **Why needed here:** DriveCritic positions a VLM as an evaluator, inheriting both the strengths (contextual reasoning, common-sense knowledge) and weaknesses (hallucination, prompt sensitivity) of this paradigm.
  - **Quick check question:** What failure modes are unique to VLM-based judges compared to rule-based or classifier-based evaluators?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Stitched 3-camera view → BEV map with trajectories → Ego status vector → EPDMS sub-scores → Qwen2.5-VL-7B with LoRA adapters → Structured reasoning trace → Binary preference (A > B or B > A)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Audit EPDMS on human trajectories to identify low-LK/low-EP scenarios
  2. Construct pairwise dataset with vocabulary trajectories matching specific sub-score patterns
  3. Generate SFT reasoning traces with GPT-5 teacher
  4. Run DAPO fine-tuning with format + accuracy rewards
  5. Evaluate on held-out test set with position-flip robustness check

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **VLM size vs. efficiency:** 7B variant chosen for balance; larger models may improve accuracy but increase inference cost and carbon footprint (Section VI-A).
  - **Dataset scope vs. focus:** Curated 5,730 pairs target ambiguous regimes but may not generalize to all driving patterns (Section VI-A).
  - **SFT data volume:** Only 1,100 pairs used for SFT; larger SFT sets might improve warm-up but risk overfitting to teacher reasoning style.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Hallucination:** Model invents scene elements not present in visual input
  - **Position bias:** Preference flips when A/B order is swapped (mitigated but not eliminated; RR=81.8%)
  - **Domain shift:** Degraded performance on scenes outside training distribution (e.g., different weather, lighting)
  - **Temporal blindness:** Lack of video input means dynamic cues (e.g., changing traffic lights) may be misinterpreted

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce ablation (Table V):** Train variants (SFT-only, GRPO-only, full pipeline) to validate two-stage necessity on your infrastructure.
  2. **Position-flip robustness test:** Evaluate on test set with A/B order swapped to verify RR > 80%.
  3. **Out-of-distribution probe:** Test on scenarios not covered in the curated dataset (e.g., highway merges, adverse weather) to characterize generalization limits.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does incorporating temporal visual data into DriveCritic improve judgment accuracy in scenarios with dynamic state changes, such as shifting traffic lights?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that the current model "does not leverage temporal information," which may lead to misinterpretations of "changing traffic lights" (Sec. VI-A).
- **Why unresolved:** The current architecture processes static visual inputs to reduce resource overhead, leaving the handling of temporal dynamics for future investigation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study evaluating a temporal-aware variant of DriveCritic on traffic light transition scenarios versus the static baseline.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can DriveCritic effectively serve as a scalable reward signal to improve the human-alignment of reinforcement learning (RL) based driving planners?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors identify integrating DriveCritic to create a "human-aligned trajectory database with RL-based planners" like TrajHF as an "interesting future direction" (Sec. VI-B).
- **Why unresolved:** The paper validates the model as an evaluator (critic) but does not demonstrate its efficacy when used to optimize a planner (actor) in a closed loop.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Results showing improved performance and human preference alignment in planners trained with DriveCritic-derived rewards compared to those trained with standard rule-based metrics.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the reasoning capabilities of the 7B-parameter DriveCritic model be distilled into smaller, edge-deployable models without significant performance degradation?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors highlight the need to explore "lighter-weight models or knowledge distillation" to mitigate the substantial computational cost and carbon footprint of running large VLMs (Sec. VI-B).
- **Why unresolved:** While the current model proves the utility of VLMs, the practical deployment constraints of a 7B model in a vehicle or large-scale batch process remain a barrier.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A benchmark comparing the accuracy and latency of a distilled student model against the 7B teacher model on the DriveCritic test set.

## Limitations

- The 5,730-pair dataset, while carefully constructed, focuses on specific ambiguous regimes and may not capture the full diversity of real-world driving scenarios.
- The 7B VLM variant, though efficient, could be outperformed by larger models at increased computational cost and carbon footprint.
- The pairwise formulation, while avoiding rubric ambiguity, may not directly scale to continuous score assignments needed for some deployment scenarios.
- The reliance on GPT-5 for SFT reasoning traces introduces a dependency on proprietary model outputs that may not be reproducible.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The two-stage training pipeline (SFT + RL) demonstrably improves performance over single-stage approaches, supported by systematic ablation results (76% vs. 64.5% for SFT-only).
- **Medium confidence:** The multi-modal context integration mechanism effectively captures visual cues for trajectory evaluation, though this relies on the assumption that visual context consistently resolves symbolic ambiguities.
- **Medium confidence:** The pairwise preference formulation successfully handles multimodal behaviors and avoids rubric ambiguity, but preference consistency varies (91.7% in Case 1 vs. 60.4% in Case 2 scenarios).

## Next Checks

1. Test DriveCritic on out-of-distribution scenarios including adverse weather conditions, different lighting environments, and complex multi-agent interactions not represented in the curated dataset.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each input modality (visual, BEV, ego status, EPDMS scores) to quantify their relative importance and identify potential redundancy.
3. Evaluate the model's performance when EPDMS scores are intentionally corrupted or when visual inputs are degraded (occlusion, blur) to assess robustness to input noise and failure modes.
