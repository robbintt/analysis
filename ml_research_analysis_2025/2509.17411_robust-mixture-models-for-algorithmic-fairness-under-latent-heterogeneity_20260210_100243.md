# Robust Mixture Models for Algorithmic Fairness Under Latent Heterogeneity

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.17411
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17411
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 10.58% reduction in worst-group MSE on simulations; 2-13% improvements on real datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses algorithmic fairness in machine learning when minority subgroups are latent and heterogeneous, particularly when disparities involve complex interactions among both continuous and discrete features. The authors propose ROME (RObust Mixture Ensemble), a framework that discovers latent group structure while optimizing for worst-group performance through two approaches: an EM algorithm for linear models and a neural Mixture-of-Experts for nonlinear settings. ROME learns latent groups using sensitive attributes for group assignment but constrains experts to use only non-sensitive features for prediction, ensuring fairness. The method incorporates distributionally robust optimization to improve worst-case performance across discovered groups.

## Method Summary
ROME addresses algorithmic fairness under latent heterogeneity by discovering latent group structure while optimizing for worst-group performance. The framework consists of two main components: ROME-EM for linear models using an EM algorithm, and ROME-MoE for nonlinear settings using neural Mixture-of-Experts. The method uses sensitive attributes to assign data to latent groups but constrains prediction models to use only non-sensitive features, ensuring fairness. Distributionally robust optimization is incorporated to improve worst-case performance across discovered groups. The approach requires no predefined group labels, making it practical when sources of disparities are unknown or evolving.

## Key Results
- ROME-EM achieved a 10.58% reduction in worst-group MSE compared to pooled regression in simulation studies while maintaining accurate parameter recovery
- On three real-world datasets, ROME-MoE variants significantly improved worst-group performance (p<0.001) while maintaining competitive overall accuracy
- Improvements ranged from 2-13% depending on the dataset and evaluation metric

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ROME works by simultaneously discovering latent subgroup structure and optimizing for worst-group performance. The method uses sensitive attributes as a bridge to identify heterogeneous groups while preventing direct use of these attributes in prediction, thus maintaining fairness. Distributionally robust optimization ensures that the model performs well across all discovered groups, not just the majority. The mixture-of-experts architecture allows different prediction models for different subgroups, capturing complex interactions between features that may vary across latent groups.

## Foundational Learning
- **Latent Variable Models**: Why needed - to discover hidden subgroup structure without explicit labels; Quick check - verify that EM algorithm correctly recovers known group assignments in controlled simulations
- **Mixture-of-Experts Architecture**: Why needed - to allow different prediction models for different subgroups; Quick check - confirm that experts specialize to different input regions in toy examples
- **Distributionally Robust Optimization**: Why needed - to optimize for worst-case performance across groups; Quick check - test that the model's performance is robust to group distribution shifts
- **Fairness Constraints**: Why needed - to prevent discrimination while using sensitive attributes for discovery; Quick check - verify that sensitive attributes are not directly used in final predictions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data -> Sensitive Attributes + Features -> Latent Group Discovery -> Expert Assignment -> Prediction Models -> Aggregate Output

Critical path: The most critical path involves sensitive attribute processing for group discovery, followed by expert assignment and prediction, with distributionally robust optimization ensuring worst-group performance.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades computational complexity (mixture models with multiple experts) for improved fairness and performance on latent subgroups. Using sensitive attributes only for discovery but not prediction creates a balance between effective group identification and fairness.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation when the number of latent groups is misspecified, computational bottlenecks with many groups or high-dimensional features, and potential overfitting when subgroups are too small relative to model complexity.

First experiments:
1. Test ROME-EM on synthetic data with known group structure to verify parameter recovery
2. Evaluate worst-group performance sensitivity to the number of latent groups
3. Compare ROME-MoE with baseline methods on a small real dataset to establish practical improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on regression tasks with MSE metrics, leaving unclear how ROME would perform for classification problems or with alternative fairness measures
- Scalability to high-dimensional feature spaces and large numbers of latent groups remains untested, particularly given the EM algorithm's potential computational challenges
- The assumption that sensitive attributes can be used for group discovery but not for prediction may not hold in all real-world scenarios

## Confidence
- **High**: Theoretical framework and algorithm design are sound and well-justified
- **Medium**: Simulation results showing improvements over baseline methods are convincing
- **Low**: Generalizability of real-world performance due to limited dataset diversity and absence of long-term deployment studies

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ROME on diverse fairness metrics beyond MSE, including classification accuracy and fairness-specific measures across multiple real-world datasets with different data modalities
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (mixture modeling, distributionally robust optimization, sensitive attribute constraints) to overall performance
3. Test the method's robustness to misspecified numbers of latent groups and its behavior when sensitive attributes are partially observed or noisy
