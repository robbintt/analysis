core_contribution: This chapter reviews how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied
  to legal tasks, such as interpreting statutes, contracts, and case law, as well
  as summarising and retrieving legal information. It highlights benefits like improved
  efficiency in contract drafting and enhanced public understanding of legal texts,
  while also addressing risks such as hallucinations and algorithmic monoculture.

# LLMs in Interpreting Legal Documents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.09830
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09830
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: LLMs can assist legal tasks like interpreting statutes, contracts, and case law, but face challenges with hallucinations, accuracy, and algorithmic monoculture risks

## Executive Summary
This chapter examines the application of Large Language Models to legal interpretation tasks, including statute analysis, contract drafting, and case law summarization. While LLMs offer significant benefits in terms of efficiency and public accessibility of legal information, they also present notable risks such as hallucinations and potential for algorithmic monoculture in legal decision-making. The analysis includes evaluation of two major legal reasoning benchmarks, LegalBench and LawBench, which reveal that even top models like GPT-4 struggle with complex legal reasoning despite outperforming other models.

## Method Summary
The chapter reviews existing literature on LLM applications in legal domains and evaluates performance using established legal reasoning benchmarks. It analyzes compliance requirements under regulations like the EU AI Act and examines theoretical risks including data poisoning and algorithmic monoculture. The assessment draws on comparative model performance data and considers both practical benefits and systemic risks to legal interpretation processes.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 outperforms other models on legal reasoning benchmarks but still struggles with complex legal tasks
- Algorithmic monoculture poses risks to legal system diversity and resilience, potentially reducing overall decision quality
- LLM training data bias may exclude underrepresented populations, affecting "ordinary meaning" interpretations of legal terms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLMs excel at legal interpretation tasks due to their ability to process large volumes of legal text, identify patterns across case law and statutes, and generate coherent summaries. Their effectiveness stems from transformer architectures that capture contextual relationships in legal language and their training on extensive legal corpora. However, their limitations arise from training data biases, inability to access offline legal discourse, and susceptibility to prompt manipulation, which can compromise the accuracy and fairness of legal interpretations.

## Foundational Learning
- Legal reasoning benchmarks (LegalBench, LawBench) - why needed: to measure LLM performance on realistic legal tasks; quick check: compare benchmark scores across models
- Algorithmic monoculture concepts - why needed: to understand systemic risks from model convergence; quick check: analyze diversity of legal outcomes across different models
- EU AI Act compliance framework - why needed: to ensure legal AI applications meet regulatory requirements; quick check: assess specific compliance obligations for legal LLMs
- Data poisoning risks - why needed: to evaluate vulnerability to adversarial training data manipulation; quick check: test model robustness against corrupted training samples
- Ordinary meaning doctrine - why needed: to understand how LLMs interpret statutory language; quick check: compare LLM interpretations against dictionary definitions
- Legal reasoning hierarchies - why needed: to understand complexity levels in legal tasks; quick check: map tasks to appropriate reasoning complexity levels

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Training data -> LLM architecture -> Fine-tuning on legal corpora -> Benchmarking (LegalBench/LawBench) -> Deployment/Integration
- Critical path: Data preparation and legal corpus selection → Model training/fine-tuning → Evaluation on legal benchmarks → Regulatory compliance assessment → Deployment
- Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. computational cost, model size vs. deployment feasibility, general legal knowledge vs. jurisdiction-specific expertise
- Failure signatures: Hallucinations in legal interpretations, biased outputs from training data skew, inconsistent reasoning across similar cases, prompt sensitivity
- First experiments: 1) Test model performance on simple contract clause interpretation; 2) Evaluate accuracy on statutory definition tasks; 3) Measure hallucination rates in case law summarization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can prospective litigants successfully manipulate legal interpretations by corrupting LLM training data or prompts?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.1.2 cites Judge Newsom asking whether litigants might "corrupt the training data... to give out a preferred interpretation."
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests the large corpus size makes retroactive pollution difficult, it concedes that "model sycophancy" and prompt manipulation remain tangible risks.
- Evidence: Red-teaming experiments testing the susceptibility of legal LLMs to data poisoning or adversarial prompts designed to bias statutory definitions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the widespread adoption of a single "accurate" LLM inevitably reduce overall decision quality in the legal system?
- Basis in paper: Section 2.3 discusses "algorithmic monoculture" and Braess' paradox, noting that a single algorithmic framework can reduce social welfare and system robustness despite individual accuracy.
- Why unresolved: Benchmarks show GPT-4 outperforms others, incentivizing centralization, yet the paper warns this lack of heterogeneity leads to "correlated failures."
- Evidence: Comparative studies measuring the diversity of legal outcomes and error rates when using a single dominant model versus an ensemble of diverse models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do LLMs fail to capture the "ordinary meaning" of legal terms for populations underrepresented in online training data?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.1.2 notes that LLMs "do not capture offline speech," potentially missing usages by minorities or rural populations less represented online.
- Why unresolved: Validating "ordinary meaning" currently relies on dictionaries or LLMs, both of which may diverge from the actual understanding of marginalized groups.
- Evidence: Benchmarks comparing LLM-generated definitions against sociolinguistic surveys or "offline speech" corpora from underrepresented demographics.

## Limitations
- Hallucination and accuracy issues remain significant concerns, particularly for complex legal reasoning tasks
- Algorithmic monoculture risks are raised but lack empirical evidence or case studies demonstrating practical impact
- Compliance assessment with regulations like the EU AI Act is discussed at high level without specific implementation guidance

## Confidence
- High confidence: Benefits of LLMs in improving efficiency for contract drafting and enhancing public understanding of legal texts
- Medium confidence: Performance rankings of different models on LegalBench and LawBench benchmarks
- Low confidence: Risk assessment regarding algorithmic monoculture and its potential impact on legal systems

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic error analysis on LLM outputs for legal document interpretation, specifically categorizing types of hallucinations and accuracy failures across different legal domains
2. Perform cross-jurisdictional testing of LLM performance on legal reasoning tasks to assess whether results from LegalBench and LawBench generalize beyond their original test settings
3. Implement and evaluate pilot programs testing LLM integration in actual legal workflows to measure real-world efficiency gains versus theoretical benefits discussed in the literature
