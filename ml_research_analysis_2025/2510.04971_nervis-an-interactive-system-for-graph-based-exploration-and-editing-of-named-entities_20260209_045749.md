# NERVIS: An Interactive System for Graph-Based Exploration and Editing of Named Entities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04971
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04971
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Expert evaluation confirms system's effectiveness for interactive exploration and editing of large, noisy named entity graphs.

## Executive Summary
NERVIS is a web-based system designed for exploring and editing named entities and their relationships across document collections. It employs a graph-based model with three node types (documents, entity mentions, entities) and supports fuzzy views, interactive editing, filtering, and export functions. An evaluation with a Digital Humanities scholar confirmed its practical utility for iterative exploration and refinement of named entity graphs.

## Method Summary
The system implements a graph-based model using three node types—documents, entity mentions, and entities—connected by four edge types to capture relationships and co-occurrences. It is implemented in HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, using Graphology for ForceAtlas2 layout and Sigma.js for WebGL GPU-accelerated rendering, with MiniSearch for node search. The evaluation involved a single expert user in Digital Humanities, focusing on usability and workflow support rather than quantitative performance metrics.

## Key Results
- Expert evaluation with a Digital Humanities scholar confirmed system's practical utility for real-world exploration and editing.
- Supports iterative exploration and refinement of large, noisy named entity graphs with interactive editing features.
- Provides export to JSON and image formats and integrates filtering and minimap navigation for complex graph exploration.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by integrating graph visualization with interactive editing, enabling users to directly manipulate named entity relationships. ForceAtlas2 layout with WebGL rendering ensures responsive performance even with large graphs. Filtering and fuzzy views help users focus on relevant parts of the graph while preserving context. The three-layer node model captures both entity identities and their mention-level context, supporting iterative refinement.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graphology and ForceAtlas2 layout**: Needed for dynamic, force-directed placement of nodes in large graphs; quick check: confirm layout stabilizes within a few seconds for 500+ nodes.
- **Sigma.js WebGL rendering**: Required for GPU-accelerated, interactive rendering of complex graphs; quick check: verify smooth panning/zooming at 60fps for 1000-node graphs.
- **MiniSearch for node search**: Enables fast, full-text search over node attributes; quick check: test search response time under 100ms for 1000 nodes.
- **CoNLL-2003 entity classes**: Standard schema for named entity recognition; quick check: ensure all mentions are labeled with one of four entity types (Person, Organization, Location, Miscellaneous).
- **Interactive graph editing**: Supports iterative refinement of noisy entity data; quick check: test addition/removal of edges and nodes without breaking graph integrity.
- **5-stage visualization pipeline**: Separates concerns from data to display, enabling modular updates; quick check: confirm each stage (filter, map, layout, render) can be modified independently.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Data JSON → View Filter → Data Filter → Data Mapper → ForceAtlas2 Layout → Sigma.js WebGL Renderer → User Interaction (edit, filter, search)

### Critical Path
User interaction (edit/filter/search) → View/Data Filter → Data Mapper → Layout (ForceAtlas2) → Sigma.js Renderer → Display update

### Design Tradeoffs
- **GPU-accelerated WebGL vs. CPU rendering**: Prioritizes interactivity for large graphs at the cost of some compatibility with older hardware.
- **ForceAtlas2 multithreading (Web Workers)**: Improves responsiveness but requires careful state synchronization.
- **Fuzzy view vs. exact connections**: Supports discovery of approximate entity links but may introduce noise.

### Failure Signatures
- Layout instability (oscillating or overlapping nodes) → ForceAtlas2 parameters or Web Worker synchronization issue.
- Slow interaction with large graphs → GPU memory limits or inefficient filtering.
- Missing or misclassified entities → Incorrect input data schema or parsing errors.

### Exactly 3 First Experiments
1. Load a small synthetic CoNLL-2003 dataset (10 documents, 50 mentions, 20 entities) and verify all node and edge types are rendered correctly.
2. Apply filters to isolate entities of a single class and confirm minimap updates accordingly.
3. Add and remove an edge between two nodes and check that the graph updates without errors and maintains layout stability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
**How can undo/redo functionality and action history be effectively implemented for iterative graph editing workflows in NERVIS?**
The expert evaluator highlighted the need for undo/redo and action history to support iterative refinement. The current system lacks version control, making error recovery difficult. Evidence: Implementation with user study demonstrating workflow continuity.

### Open Question 2
**What interaction techniques best support viewing entity mentions within their original text context while maintaining graph-based exploration?**
The expert wished to see specific mentions in their text context during evaluation. Current design emphasizes graph topology, but integration with source text views is missing. Evidence: Prototype with coordinated text-graph views and efficiency evaluation.

### Open Question 3
**How can entity node merging be implemented to correct NEL errors while preserving mention-to-entity relationship integrity?**
Entity merging was needed due to NEL errors, but no mechanism exists for updating multiple mentions or maintaining layout. Evidence: Implementation supporting merge operations with maintained data consistency and layout stability.

### Open Question 4
**How does NERVIS perform across diverse user populations beyond Digital Humanities scholars?**
Evaluation was limited to one domain expert; generalizability to other user groups (journalists, social scientists) is unknown. Evidence: Comparative user studies with multiple participant groups and task types.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a single expert user, limiting generalizability.
- No quantitative performance benchmarks or scalability claims supported by data.
- Input schema and ForceAtlas2 hyperparameters are underspecified, risking reproduction differences.

## Confidence
- Expert usability evaluation: **Medium**
- Interactive graph manipulation features: **High**
- Scalability and performance claims: **Low**
- Implementation fidelity (exact visual layout): **Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Verify the input data schema by testing with a small synthetic CoNLL-2003 entity dataset and confirming all node and edge types are correctly parsed and rendered.
2. Compare the ForceAtlas2 layout output (node positions, convergence behavior) with the live demo to identify discrepancies in layout hyperparameters or implementation.
3. Perform a stress test with graphs containing 500-2000 nodes to confirm WebGL rendering stability and measure frame rates under interactive manipulation.
