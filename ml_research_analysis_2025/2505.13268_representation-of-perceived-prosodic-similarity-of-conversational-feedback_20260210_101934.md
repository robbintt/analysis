# Representation of perceived prosodic similarity of conversational feedback

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.13268
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13268
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Middle layers of self-supervised speech models encode prosodic information best for feedback similarity perception

## Executive Summary
This work investigates how self-supervised speech representations capture prosodic similarity in vocal feedback, a key component of natural spoken dialogue. The authors collected human judgments of prosodic similarity for feedback utterances through a triadic comparison task using two datasets—one with multiple speakers and one with a single speaker. They evaluated pitch features, spectral metrics, and embeddings from four speech models (HuBERT, Whisper, wav2vec 2.0, W2v-BERT), finding that spectral and embedding-based measures aligned better with human perception than pitch alone, especially for same-speaker feedback. By applying contrastive learning on the perceptual data, the authors successfully projected embeddings into lower-dimensional spaces that preserved or even improved alignment with human judgments, achieving up to 81.22% agreement for HuBERT in the multi-speaker case and maintaining strong performance with dimensions as low as 16. The study highlights the middle layers of models as most informative for prosody and suggests that compact, perception-aligned prosodic representations can enhance dialogue systems.

## Method Summary
The authors collected human triadic similarity judgments for feedback utterances from two datasets: Fisher (multi-speaker) and FiCa (single speaker). They extracted pitch features using Parselmouth, computed spectral similarity, and loaded embeddings from four pre-trained SSL models at all layers. Cosine similarity was used to score representations. A linear projection layer was trained with triplet loss (margin=0.5) on human-annotated triplets using 5-fold cross-validation, testing dimensions from 2 to 1024. The evaluation measured agreement between representation-based similarity and human triadic choices.

## Key Results
- Spectral and embedding-based measures outperformed pitch features for prosodic similarity alignment
- Middle layers (6-18) of SSL models encode prosody best, not final layers
- Contrastive learning preserved alignment while compressing to 16 dimensions
- HuBERT achieved 81.22% agreement (multi-speaker) and 72.63% (same-speaker) with human judgments
- Learned projections outperformed raw embeddings in higher dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Self-supervised speech models encode prosodic information primarily in middle layers, not final representations.
- **Mechanism**: SSL models learn hierarchical representations where early layers capture acoustic/spectral features and later layers focus on phonetic/lexical content. Middle layers (roughly layers 6-18 in 24-layer models) retain suprasegmental prosodic information while abstracting away from raw acoustics.
- **Core assumption**: Prosodic patterns relevant to feedback perception are suprasegmental features that persist at intermediate abstraction levels.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "highlights the middle layers of models as most informative for prosody"
  - [section 5.2] "later layers are less relevant for distinguishing feedback prosody the way humans do... shallower layers encode spectral and acoustic features, whereas later layers focus on phonetic, word identity, and word meaning"
  - [corpus] "Prosodic Structure Beyond Lexical Content" (arxiv:2506.02584) confirms SSL models encode prosody independently of lexical content
- **Break condition**: If your downstream task requires speaker-specific prosody or very fine-grained temporal patterns, middle layers may be insufficient; earlier layers or specialized prosodic features may be needed.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Contrastive learning with human perceptual judgments can compress 1024-dimensional embeddings to 16 dimensions while preserving prosodic similarity alignment.
- **Mechanism**: Triplet loss trains a projection to bring perceptually similar feedback pairs closer and push dissimilar pairs apart. The supervision signal from human triadic comparisons provides a learned metric that extracts only prosodically-relevant dimensions from the full embedding.
- **Core assumption**: Human perceptual similarity judgments on triads provide consistent supervision signal; the prosodic subspace is low-dimensional and can be linearly projected from SSL embeddings.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "projected embeddings into lower-dimensional spaces that preserved or even improved alignment with human judgments, achieving up to 81.22% agreement for HuBERT... maintaining strong performance with dimensions as low as 16"
  - [section 6] "The learned embeddings can outperform the original embeddings in higher dimensions, e.g., 81.22% (FiCa, HuBERT with dimension 1024) versus 72.63% (FiCa, pre-trained HuBERT with dimension 1024)"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific compression technique on prosody
- **Break condition**: If triadic perceptual data is noisy, inconsistent, or task-mismatched to your use case, the projection may overfit to irrelevant perceptual dimensions. Cross-dataset generalization is unproven.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Spectral features and SSL embeddings capture prosodic similarity better than pitch-only features, especially for same-speaker feedback.
- **Mechanism**: Pitch features miss voice quality, intensity contours, and spectral envelope information that humans use for prosodic judgments. SSL embeddings trained on large speech corpora implicitly encode these additional acoustic dimensions.
- **Core assumption**: Prosodic perception integrates multiple acoustic cues beyond pitch; listeners attend to timbre, duration, and spectral patterns.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "spectral and embedding-based measures aligned better with human perception than pitch alone, especially for same-speaker feedback"
  - [section 5.1] "Speech embeddings and spectrograms generally capture feedback prosodic similarity better than pitch features... voiced length plays a key role in human perception"
  - [corpus] "The Role of Prosody in Spoken Question Answering" (arxiv:2502.05389) notes prosody carries information beyond lexical content
- **Break condition**: For multi-speaker scenarios, pitch height and range may dominate perception (as seen in Fisher dataset), making pitch features more competitive but potentially conflating speaker identity with prosody.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Triadic comparison for perceptual similarity**
  - Why needed here: The paper's entire supervision signal comes from human judgments on "which two of three are most similar." Understanding this protocol is essential for replicating or extending the data collection.
  - Quick check question: Given three audio clips A, B, C where humans consistently choose (A, B) as most similar, what does this imply about the relative distances d(A,B), d(A,C), d(B,C) in a perceptual space?

- **Concept: Triplet loss with margin**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses triplet loss L(a, p, n) = max{d(a,p) - d(a,n) + margin, 0} to train projections. Understanding margin selection (0.5 here) and anchor/positive/negative sampling is critical for training stability.
  - Quick check question: If the margin is too small relative to embedding distances, what happens to the gradient signal during training?

- **Concept: Layer-wise probing of SSL speech models**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates all 24+1 layers across four models. Different layers encode different information; selecting the wrong layer for your task will degrade performance.
  - Quick check question: In a 24-layer wav2vec 2.0 model, which layer range would you probe first for a speaker-independent prosodic feature extraction task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Audio Input → Montreal Forced Aligner (word boundaries) → Feedback token extraction by lexical form → SSL Encoder (HuBERT/wav2vec2/W2v-BERT/Whisper) → Layer selection (middle layers: 6-18) → Mean pooling over frames → [Training path] Linear projection + Triplet loss → [Inference path] Cosine similarity for similarity scoring

- **Critical path**: Layer selection → projection dimensionality → triplet sampling strategy. Incorrect layer selection wastes capacity on irrelevant features; poor triplet sampling (e.g., insufficient negatives) leads to collapsed embeddings.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Same-speaker (FiCa) vs multi-speaker (Fisher): Same-speaker yields higher human-model agreement (81% vs 70%) but may not generalize. Multi-speaker is more realistic but conflates speaker identity with prosody.
  - Embedding dimension: 16-32 dimensions retain ~90% of peak performance; below 8, degradation accelerates. Latency-sensitive applications should target 16-32.
  - Pitch features vs embeddings: Pitch is interpretable and low-dimensional but underperforms. Embeddings are black-box but capture richer information.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Embeddings cluster by speaker identity rather than prosody (check by computing speaker-attributed silhouette scores)
  - Triplet loss fails to converge (margin too large or negatives too easy)
  - Layer-wise agreement curve is flat (model doesn't encode prosody at any layer—may indicate model/task mismatch)
  - Large gap between train and test accuracy in cross-validation (overfitting to limited perceptual data)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Layer sweep**: For your chosen SSL model, compute human agreement at each layer on a held-out triadic comparison set. Plot agreement vs layer to confirm middle-layer peak for your data.
  2. **Dimensionality ablation**: Train projections at dimensions [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024] with 5-fold cross-validation. Identify the knee point where further compression hurts performance.
  3. **Speaker independence test**: Train projection on FiCa (single speaker), evaluate on Fisher (multi-speaker) and vice versa. Quantify the generalization gap to assess whether learned representations are speaker-conditional.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: To what extent does intensity contribute to perceived prosodic similarity of vocal feedback?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "In this work, we have not included intensity as a parameter (mainly because it is hard to normalize properly for the perception experiment), but this should also be investigated in future work."
- **Why unresolved**: Intensity normalization proved difficult for the perception experiment setup, and the authors focused only on pitch and duration features.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A follow-up perception study incorporating normalized intensity measures and evaluating their correlation with human similarity judgments, alongside existing pitch and spectral features.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the contrastive learning approach for prosodic representation be extended to longer utterances beyond short feedback tokens?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "This method could very well extend to represent prosody of longer utterances as well, and this should be an interesting question for future work."
- **Why unresolved**: The current study only evaluated short feedback utterances (single lexical items), leaving open whether the learned compact representations generalize to longer speech.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Application of the same contrastive learning pipeline to longer utterance datasets with human similarity judgments, comparing representation quality across utterance lengths.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What role do gender-based differences play in perceived prosodic similarity of feedback?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "Another avenue for future work is to explore gender-based differences, given the significant impact of speaker variation on pitch perception."
- **Why unresolved**: The Fisher dataset included both male and female speakers, but the analysis did not disentangle gender effects from other speaker characteristics, and the FiCa dataset used only a single female speaker.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A controlled perception study with balanced gender representation and explicit analysis of same-gender vs. cross-gender similarity judgments.

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: How does background noise and recording quality affect the alignment between speech representations and human prosodic perception?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "Further investigation is needed to assess the accuracy of the pitch contours and the influence of background noise."
- **Why unresolved**: Fisher recordings contained telephone-quality audio with background static, potentially degrading pitch extraction and embedding quality, but this was not systematically controlled.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Controlled experiments comparing the same feedback tokens in clean vs. noisy conditions, measuring agreement degradation across representations.

## Limitations

- Human triadic judgments may not generalize across languages, cultures, or feedback types
- Speaker-dependent learned projections raise questions about cross-speaker generalization
- Focus on lexical-level feedback grouping may miss prosodic distinctions at sub-lexical or phrase level
- Unanimous agreement among three raters assumed sufficient for perceptual ground truth without measuring inter-rater reliability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Middle layers of SSL models encode prosody best, spectral features outperform pitch for same-speaker feedback, contrastive projection preserves similarity structure up to 16 dimensions
- **Medium Confidence**: 81.22% agreement for HuBERT represents meaningful prosodic alignment (depends on dataset-specific factors), learned projections outperform raw embeddings (could be overfitting), generalization across datasets is limited but not impossible
- **Low Confidence**: The specific margin of 0.5 is optimal, 16 dimensions is universally sufficient, and findings transfer to non-feedback prosody or other languages

## Next Checks

1. **Layer Generalization Test**: Evaluate middle-layer representations (layer 12) on a held-out feedback dataset with different speakers and lexical forms. Compare agreement drop to within-dataset performance to quantify layer-specific generalization.

2. **Cross-Corpus Transfer**: Train projections on Fisher dataset, evaluate on FiCa and vice versa. Report both agreement drop and qualitative analysis of which prosodic dimensions transfer versus break.

3. **Temporal Granularity Analysis**: Compare agreement when computing embeddings at utterance-level versus word-level granularity for multi-word feedback. Test whether the 16-dimensional projections retain fine-grained temporal patterns.
