# Time series forecasting for multidimensional telemetry data using GAN and BiLSTM in a Digital Twin

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.08464
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08464
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GAN + BiLSTM hybrid achieves average RMSE of 9.532 on multivariate telemetry forecasting, outperforming reverse integration (13.076) and capturing feature variations better than ARIMA

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning architecture combining a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network for multivariate time series forecasting in digital twin applications. The approach uses GAN to learn data distribution and BiLSTM to capture temporal dynamics, achieving lower RMSE values compared to reverse integration and outperforming ARIMA for capturing feature variations. The method demonstrates capability to forecast future behaviors in digital twin contexts, supporting anomaly detection and predictive maintenance.

## Method Summary
The proposed architecture uses a Predictive GAN that optimizes its latent vector to match recent history, then feeds this output to a BiLSTM network for temporal refinement. The GAN generator creates 9x4 matrices representing 9 time steps with 4 features (voltage, rotation, pressure, vibration), while the BiLSTM processes these sequences to predict future windows. During inference, the latent vector is iteratively updated via gradient descent to minimize MSE between generated and known values, then the final output passes through BiLSTM for forecasting. The dataset consists of 8760 hourly samples from machine 1, preprocessed with 3-hour fusion windows and 24-hour averaging, with 70% used for training.

## Key Results
- GAN + BiLSTM achieves average RMSE of 9.532 across all features
- Reverse integration (BiLSTM + GAN) yields higher RMSE of 13.076
- Outperforms ARIMA in capturing feature variations despite slightly higher average RMSE
- Method successfully forecasts telemetry data for digital twin applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Optimizing the latent vector of a GAN allows it to function as a predictor by aligning generated samples with recent history.
- **Mechanism:** The architecture employs a "Predictive GAN" where a random latent vector $z$ is iteratively updated via an optimizer (gradient descent) to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the generator's output and the known $n-1$ historical steps. Once aligned, the $n$-th step of the generated output is treated as the forecast.
- **Core assumption:** The latent space of the generator is continuous enough that vector optimization converges to a state representing the immediate history, allowing meaningful extrapolation.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.1] describes the optimization loop; [Figure 4] visualizes the predictive GAN iteration; related work supports general efficacy of deep learning in time series.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Sequential integration of GAN and BiLSTM captures both data distribution characteristics and temporal dependencies better than standalone GANs.
- **Mechanism:** The GAN learns the underlying probability distribution and feature correlations (e.g., how voltage relates to rotation). The BiLSTM then takes the GAN's output to enforce temporal consistency. This appears to correct the GAN's tendency to drift or lose temporal coherence over longer horizons.
- **Core assumption:** The GAN provides a "distributionally correct" baseline that is easier for the BiLSTM to correct than generating the sequence from scratch or relying solely on ARIMA.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 4.2] states integration with BiLSTM is essential for long-term forecasting; [Figure 7] shows Predictive GAN becoming inaccurate after certain time steps.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The ordering of the hybrid architecture (GAN $\to$ BiLSTM) is statistically significant for error reduction.
- **Mechanism:** Feeding the GAN-generated distribution into the BiLSTM yielded lower RMSE (9.532) compared to the reverse integration (BiLSTM $\to$ GAN, 13.076). This suggests that establishing the structural/data distribution constraints via GAN before applying temporal smoothing yields more accurate physical mirroring.
- **Core assumption:** In telemetry data, the validity of a data point is more dependent on its distributional relationship with other features (learned by GAN) than purely on its temporal sequence.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Table 1] compares RMSE values; [Section 5.3] notes ARIMA failed to capture variations unlike the proposed method.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Latent Space Optimization**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard GANs generate random samples. To predict, you must understand how to invert the generator (find the input $z$ that produces the current output) to extrapolate.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why you cannot simply ask a standard GAN generator to "predict the next step" without this optimization loop?

- **Concept: Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**
  - **Why needed here:** Used to capture temporal dynamics. You must understand why looking at data "backwards" helps in time series (though technically, for pure forecasting, BiLSTM is often used to understand the context of the training window better).
  - **Quick check question:** How does a BiLSTM process a sequence differently than a standard LSTM during the training phase?

- **Concept: Digital Twin Services (Ss)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper frames the forecasting as a service within a larger Digital Twin architecture.
  - **Quick check question:** In the paper's definition (referencing Figure 1), is the forecasting model considered "Physical Entity (PE)" data or a "Service (Ss)"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input -> GAN (Generator + Discriminator) -> Latent Optimizer -> BiLSTM -> Output
- **Critical path:** 1) Preprocess data into 9-step windows with 4 features; 2) Train GAN to generate realistic 9-step windows; 3) Train BiLSTM on historical sequences to predict next window; 4) Inference: Optimize $z$ to match last 8 known steps → Generate 9 steps → Feed to BiLSTM → Final Forecast
- **Design tradeoffs:** ARIMA provides flat "safe" average (low RMSE on mean values) but fails to detect anomalies/variations. The Hybrid method captures variance and feature correlations but has higher absolute error on average values than baseline ARIMA in this specific study.
- **Failure signatures:** GAN Drift - if prediction horizon extends too far without "grounding" by real data, GAN may produce physically impossible values; Latent Non-Convergence - if optimizer fails to find $z$ that matches history, output will be random noise relative to timeline.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Sanity Check (ARIMA Baseline) - Replicate ARIMA result to confirm "flat line" prediction behavior; 2) GAN-Only Drift Test - Run Predictive GAN for 50+ steps into future without BiLSTM intervention to verify accuracy degradation; 3) Order Ablation - Swap integration order (BiLSTM $\to$ PredGAN) vs (PredGAN $\to$ BiLSTM) on single feature to verify RMSE difference.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can the integration of Kalman filters replace the current fusion window approach to improve noise handling and prediction accuracy? (Basis: authors intend to explore Kalman filters in conclusion; unresolved because current method uses manually defined fusion window which may not be optimal for all telemetry types)

- **Open Question 2:** How can the generated time series forecasts be formally utilized to calculate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and detect anomalies? (Basis: authors list anomaly detection and RUL calculations as future research directions; unresolved because paper demonstrates forecasting capability but doesn't implement downstream classification/regression tasks)

- **Open Question 3:** Does the proposed architecture generalize to different machinery profiles without retraining? (Basis: case study validates only on "machine 1" out of 100 available; unresolved because validating on single machine leaves model's ability to handle varying operational distributions untested)

- **Open Question 4:** To what extent can systematic hyperparameter optimization reduce the RMSE gap between the proposed method and ARIMA? (Basis: conclusion identifies need to improve BiLSTM and GAN hyperparameters; unresolved because while model captures variations better than ARIMA, its average RMSE is numerically higher than ARIMA baseline)

## Limitations
- Limited validation on single machine profile (machine 1 only) leaves generalizability to different machinery untested
- No rigorous validation of latent space optimization convergence across different GAN architectures or data distributions
- Higher average RMSE compared to ARIMA baseline despite better feature variation capture
- Lack of ablation studies on pure BiLSTM or GAN-only baselines to isolate hybrid architecture benefits

## Confidence
- **High:** RMSE comparison between hybrid methods (Table 1 data is directly reported)
- **Medium:** Mechanism 2 (justification relies on qualitative claims about temporal coherence)
- **Low:** Mechanism 1 (latent optimization convergence is asserted but not rigorously tested)

## Next Checks
1. Test latent optimization convergence across multiple random seeds and latent vector initializations to confirm robustness
2. Run a pure BiLSTM baseline on the same window size to isolate the GAN's contribution to accuracy gains
3. Validate the ordering claim by swapping the integration sequence on multiple datasets (e.g., MIMIC-IV, NASA turbofan) to test generalizability
