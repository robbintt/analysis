# Correcting Mean Bias in Text Embeddings: A Refined Renormalization with Training-Free Improvements on MMTEB

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.11041
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11041
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** Training-free renormalization removing shared mean vector μ improves MMTEB performance by 9.7σ (retrieval), 3.1σ (classification), 0.8σ (other tasks)

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies a systematic bias in text embedding models where all output vectors share a nearly identical mean vector μ. The authors propose a training-free renormalization method to correct this bias by removing μ from the embeddings, which improves model performance across the MMTEB benchmark. Two variants are considered: direct subtraction of μ and removal of the projection onto μ, with the latter predicted to perform better theoretically and confirmed experimentally. Across 38 models, renormalization yields significant improvements: 9.7σ on retrieval tasks, 3.1σ on classification tasks, and 0.8σ on other tasks. The method is lightweight, model-agnostic, and especially effective for tasks sensitive to embedding noise, such as retrieval and classification.

## Method Summary
The method computes the mean vector μ from 100K Wikipedia sentences (64-512 characters), then applies one of two renormalization variants: R1 (direct subtraction: e'₁ = (e - μ)/||e - μ||) or R2 (projection-based: e'₂ = (e - (e·μ̂)μ̂)/||e - (e·μ̂)μ̂||, where μ̂ = μ/||μ||). R2 is theoretically preferred as it cancels estimation error parallel to μ while only removing the orthogonal component. The approach is training-free and can be applied as a post-hoc wrapper around any embedding model.

## Key Results
- R2 outperforms R1 across all MMTEB task types, confirming theoretical predictions
- Improvements correlate with μ norm magnitude: larger ||μ|| yields greater benefits
- Retrieval tasks show largest gains (9.7σ), followed by classification (3.1σ), with minimal impact on other tasks (0.8σ)
- Across 38 tested models, renormalization consistently improves performance when ||μ|| > 0.2

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Removing the shared mean vector μ from embeddings improves angular discrimination.
- Mechanism: Embeddings decompose as e = ẽ + μ, where μ is nearly constant across inputs. Normalized embeddings cluster around μ (anisotropy), reducing effective angular resolution. Subtracting μ redistributes embeddings more evenly on the unit sphere.
- Core assumption: ẽ is approximately orthogonal to μ and to typical random directions in the orthogonal subspace (high-dimensional near-orthogonality).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "each embedding vector e can be decomposed as ẽ + μ, where μ is almost identical across all sentences"
  - [section 4] "Reducing anisotropy helps restore these properties by spreading sentence embeddings more evenly across the unit sphere"
  - [corpus] Related work (Arora et al., 2017) found removing first principal component improves semantic similarity, suggesting shared components hinder expressiveness.
- Break condition: If μ carries task-relevant signal (e.g., domain-specific bias needed for classification), removal degrades performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Projection-based removal (R2) outperforms direct subtraction (R1) by canceling estimation error parallel to μ.
- Mechanism: Estimating μ from finite samples introduces error ε = ε∥ + ε⊥. R1 retains both error components. R2 removes only ε⊥ while canceling ε∥ through the projection operation, leaving cleaner embeddings.
- Core assumption: ||ε|| << ||μ|| (estimation error small relative to mean magnitude) and ẽ · μ ≈ 0.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction"
  - [section 2] Equations 8-11 derive that R2 yields ẽ₂ ≈ ẽ − ε⊥ while R1 yields ẽ₁ = ẽ − ε∥ − ε⊥
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence on error propagation specifics.
- Break condition: If estimation sample is too small (||ε|| approaches ||μ||), approximation breaks down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Larger mean norm ||μ|| predicts greater renormalization benefit.
- Mechanism: Higher ||μ|| indicates stronger anisotropy (narrower cone), meaning more information is concentrated in the shared direction rather than discriminative directions. Removing larger bias yields greater angular separation gains.
- Core assumption: ||μ|| magnitude reflects degree of anisotropy, not dataset artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2, Figure 2] "A clear positive correlation can be observed between the two" (||μ|| and proportion of tasks with >2σ improvement)
  - [Figure 1] Models sorted by ||μ|| show pattern of larger gains for higher ||μ|| models
  - [corpus] No direct corpus confirmation of this specific correlation.
- Break condition: If ||μ|| is driven by corpus-specific artifacts rather than model bias, correlation may not generalize.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Unit sphere normalization and cosine similarity**
  - Why needed here: All embeddings are pre-normalized to unit length; operations like projection and subtraction must be followed by re-normalization. Understanding why angular distance matters for retrieval/classification is essential.
  - Quick check question: If two vectors have cosine similarity 0.95, what is their angular separation in degrees?

- Concept: **Anisotropy and distributional degeneration**
  - Why needed here: The mean bias causes embeddings to cluster in a narrow cone, reducing effective dimensionality and discriminative power. Renormalization directly addresses this.
  - Quick check question: Why might full isotropy be undesirable for classification (per Mickus et al., 2024)?

- Concept: **Error propagation in high-dimensional spaces**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why R2's projection cancellation works requires grasping how orthogonal vs parallel error components affect normalized vectors differently.
  - Quick check question: In d=768 dimensions, why is ||ε⊥|| expected to be smaller than ||ε∥|| for a fixed ||ε||?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Wikipedia corpus (100K sentences) -> Mean estimator (μ) -> R2 transform (e'₂ = (e - (e·μ̂)μ̂)/||e - (e·μ̂)μ̂||) -> Downstream tasks

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-compute μ offline using representative corpus (100K sentences, 64-512 chars)
  2. At inference, apply R2: project out μ component, re-normalize
  3. Use transformed embeddings for all downstream tasks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - R1 vs R2: R2 is theoretically superior and experimentally confirmed; use R2 unless computational budget prohibits projection step
  - Corpus for μ estimation: Must be disjoint from evaluation data; Wikipedia is domain-agnostic but may not match target domain
  - Sample size: 100K sentences used; smaller samples increase ε, potentially reducing R2 advantage

- Failure signatures:
  - R1 showing negative results (see potion-multilingual-128M in Figure 1): Switch to R2
  - Near-zero ||μ|| (< 0.2): Renormalization unlikely to help significantly
  - Tasks with <2σ improvement across most models (Table 4): Check if task inherently benefits from anisotropy

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compute ||μ|| for your model on your target corpus; if >0.4, proceed; if <0.2, skip renormalization
  2. Run R2 on a held-out validation set across 5 diverse tasks (retrieval, classification, clustering); compare to baseline
  3. If validation shows improvement, implement R2 as inference wrapper with <1ms overhead per batch

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Does the estimation of the mean vector $\mu$ vary significantly across different text domains, and does in-domain estimation improve performance?
  - Basis: [inferred] The methodology uses a fixed Wikipedia snapshot to estimate $\mu$, leaving the domain sensitivity of this bias unexplored.
  - Why unresolved: The authors do not evaluate if domain-specific biases exist or if a general $\mu$ is optimal for specialized tasks like medical or legal retrieval.
  - Evidence: Experiments calculating $\mu$ on specific domain corpora (e.g., biomedical) and comparing performance against the general Wikipedia $\mu$.

- Question: Can the renormalization constraint be integrated into the training objective to produce models that are unbiased by design?
  - Basis: [inferred] The paper introduces a "training-free" solution, leaving open the possibility of more permanent architectural or loss-based corrections.
  - Why unresolved: It is unclear if post-hoc removal is equivalent to preventing the bias during representation learning, which could theoretically preserve more signal.
  - Evidence: Training embedding models with an explicit regularization term to minimize the mean vector and evaluating the resulting geometry.

- Question: Why does renormalization yield significantly higher improvements in retrieval tasks ($9.7\sigma$) compared to Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks?
  - Basis: [inferred] The paper attributes retrieval gains to noise reduction but does not fully explain the minimal impact on tasks in the "Other" category ($0.8\sigma$), which include STS.
  - Why unresolved: The geometric relationship between the mean bias $\mu$ and specific task metrics like cosine similarity for STS is not fully characterized.
  - Evidence: Theoretical analysis of how removing the projection onto $\mu$ changes the relative angular distances central to STS benchmarks.

## Limitations
- The method's effectiveness depends critically on μ magnitude being large enough (>0.2) to warrant correction
- Domain-specific biases in μ may not generalize across specialized embedding use cases
- R2's theoretical advantage over R1 may diminish with very small estimation samples

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The empirical results showing R2 outperforms R1 across the MMTEB benchmark, with statistically significant improvements in retrieval (9.7σ) and classification (3.1σ) tasks.
- **Medium Confidence**: The theoretical prediction that R2 should outperform R1 due to error cancellation, as the proof relies on approximations (ẽ · μ ≈ 0, ||ε|| << ||μ||) that may not hold for all models.
- **Medium Confidence**: The correlation between ||μ|| magnitude and renormalization benefit, as this relationship was observed within the tested model set but may not generalize to models trained on different corpora or with different architectures.

## Next Checks
1. Apply renormalization to models trained on specialized corpora (legal, biomedical, code) to verify that ||μ|| magnitude and improvement correlation hold outside Wikipedia-based training distributions.
2. Measure ||ε|| in the mean estimation process across different sample sizes (10K, 50K, 100K, 200K) to quantify the breakdown point where R2's advantage over R1 diminishes.
3. For classification tasks where R1 showed negative results, conduct controlled experiments to determine whether removing μ eliminates domain-specific bias that was previously serving as a useful signal.
