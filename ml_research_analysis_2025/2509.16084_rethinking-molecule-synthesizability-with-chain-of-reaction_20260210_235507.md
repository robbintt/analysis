# Rethinking Molecule Synthesizability with Chain-of-Reaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.16084
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16084
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces ReaSyn, a generative framework that outperforms existing methods in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and goal-directed molecular optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of generating synthesizable molecules in drug discovery, where existing molecular generative models often produce synthetically inaccessible structures. The authors propose ReaSyn, a novel generative framework that explores the space of synthesizable molecules by generating and refining synthetic pathways. The framework employs a bidirectional autoregressive model that can generate pathways in both bottom-up and top-down directions, combined with an Edit Bridge model for holistic pathway refinement. Trained using a simple sequential representation of synthetic pathways, ReaSyn significantly outperforms existing methods in synthesizable molecule reconstruction, goal-directed molecular optimization, and synthesizable hit expansion.

## Method Summary
The ReaSyn framework introduces a novel approach to molecule synthesis by treating synthetic pathways as sequential data rather than hierarchical structures. It employs a bidirectional autoregressive model capable of generating pathways in both directions - from starting materials to products (bottom-up) and from target molecules to precursors (top-down). This bidirectional capability allows the model to explore synthesizable chemical space more comprehensively. The framework also incorporates an Edit Bridge model that refines synthetic pathways holistically, improving both synthetic feasibility and molecular properties. The training approach uses a simple sequential representation of synthetic pathways, which eliminates the complexity and information loss associated with traditional hierarchical representations. This design enables ReaSyn to generate chemically valid synthetic routes while maintaining molecular diversity and optimizing for desired properties.

## Key Results
- Significantly outperforms existing methods in synthesizable molecule reconstruction tasks
- Demonstrates superior performance in goal-directed molecular optimization while maintaining synthesizability
- Shows improved synthesizable hit expansion capabilities compared to baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The bidirectional autoregressive generation approach allows ReaSyn to explore synthetic space from multiple directions, reducing the risk of generating chemically implausible routes. The Edit Bridge model provides a mechanism for holistic pathway refinement, ensuring both synthetic feasibility and molecular property optimization. The sequential representation of synthetic pathways eliminates information loss that occurs in hierarchical representations, enabling more accurate modeling of complex synthetic relationships.

## Foundational Learning
- Synthetic pathway representation: Why needed - to capture chemical relationships between reactants and products; Quick check - can the model generate valid SMILES strings from pathway components
- Bidirectional generation: Why needed - to explore synthetic space from multiple starting points; Quick check - does bottom-up and top-down generation produce consistent results
- Edit Bridge refinement: Why needed - to ensure both synthetic feasibility and molecular properties; Quick check - can the model improve synthetic accessibility of initially generated pathways
- Sequential vs hierarchical representation: Why needed - to eliminate information loss in pathway encoding; Quick check - does sequential representation improve reconstruction accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Synthetic Pathway Data -> Sequential Encoder -> Bidirectional Autoregressive Model -> Edit Bridge Model -> Refined Pathways

Critical Path:
The core innovation lies in the bidirectional autoregressive generation combined with the Edit Bridge refinement. The sequential encoder converts synthetic pathway data into a format suitable for autoregressive modeling, while the bidirectional model explores synthetic space in both directions. The Edit Bridge then refines these pathways for optimal synthetic feasibility and molecular properties.

Design Tradeoffs:
The choice of sequential representation over hierarchical structures sacrifices some structural clarity for improved information retention and model performance. The bidirectional approach increases computational complexity but provides more comprehensive exploration of synthetic space. The Edit Bridge adds refinement capability but also increases model complexity and inference time.

Failure Signatures:
Poor performance on out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds, generation of chemically implausible intermediates, inability to handle complex multi-step syntheses, and computational inefficiency for large-scale applications.

First Experiments:
1. Validate bidirectional generation by comparing bottom-up and top-down pathway consistency
2. Test Edit Bridge refinement on synthetic accessibility of known drug molecules
3. Benchmark sequential vs hierarchical representation performance on synthetic pathway reconstruction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several implicit questions emerge from the limitations section regarding generalization to novel chemical spaces and real-world synthetic accessibility challenges.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily relies on synthetic pathway reconstruction and controlled optimization tasks, which may not fully capture real-world synthetic accessibility challenges
- Dataset represents a specific subset of chemical space that may not generalize to all drug-like molecules or novel chemical scaffolds
- Computational efficiency and scalability for large-scale molecular design applications remain unclear

## Confidence
- High confidence in the methodological novelty and technical implementation of the bidirectional autoregressive model
- Medium confidence in the performance claims based on benchmark comparisons, as they rely on controlled experimental conditions
- Medium confidence in the practical applicability for real-world drug discovery, pending validation on more diverse chemical spaces

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ReaSyn's performance on out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds and novel chemical classes not represented in the training data
2. Conduct a blind assessment by synthetic chemists to validate the practical synthesizability of generated molecules
3. Benchmark the computational efficiency and scalability of the framework against existing methods for large-scale molecular design campaigns
