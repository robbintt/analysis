# Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Discrete World Models for Adaptive Load Balancing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.08872
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08872
- Authors: Cameron Redovian
- Reference count: 14
- One-line primary result: DreamerV3-based RL2 agent with GRU policy significantly outperforms A2C in adaptive load balancing by reducing catastrophic forgetting and maintaining stable performance under dynamic workloads.

## Executive Summary
This paper integrates DreamerV3's discrete world models with a recurrent GRU policy network to create a meta-reinforcement learning approach for adaptive load balancing in operating systems. The method addresses catastrophic forgetting by leveraging discrete latent representations and short-term memory mechanisms, enabling rapid adaptation to dynamic workloads with minimal retraining. The proposed system achieves stable, high performance across varying workload distributions, outperforming the Advantage Actor-Critic baseline in both standard and adaptive trials.

## Method Summary
The approach combines DreamerV3's model-based RL framework with a 256-unit GRU layer inserted in the policy network before action selection. The world model encodes observations into discrete latent states, which are processed by the recurrent policy to condition actions on recent workload patterns. Training uses imagined rollouts within the latent space for sample efficiency. The system is evaluated on a 10-server heterogeneous load balancing environment with Poisson job arrivals and Pareto-distributed job sizes across three difficulty levels.

## Key Results
- DreamerV3-based RL2 agent maintains stable, high performance under varying workload distributions while A2C exhibits high variance and degradation
- The recurrent GRU policy enables rapid in-episode adaptation to dynamic workloads without explicit gradient updates
- Discrete latent representations improve task differentiation, reducing catastrophic forgetting compared to continuous representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Discrete latent representations reduce catastrophic forgetting by improving task differentiation in non-stationary environments. The DreamerV3 world model encodes high-dimensional states into a compact discrete latent space, creating separable embeddings for different workload distributions that enable the agent to distinguish between old and new task contexts.

### Mechanism 2
The GRU-based recurrent policy enables rapid in-episode adaptation by encoding workload history into hidden states. The 256-unit GRU layer receives latent state representations and maintains a hidden state across timesteps, allowing the policy to condition actions on recent workload patterns without explicit gradient updates.

### Mechanism 3
Model-based imagination improves sample efficiency and stabilizes learning under distribution shift. DreamerV3 learns a world model that predicts future latent states, and the policy is trained on imagined rollouts within this latent space rather than solely on environment samples, decoupling policy updates from real environment interaction.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Meta-reinforcement learning (RL² paradigm)
  - Why needed here: The approach treats adaptation itself as a learned capability. Understanding how recurrent policies encode task information in hidden states is essential to grasp why the GRU augmentation enables rapid workload adaptation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how an RNN policy differs from a feedforward policy in its ability to handle distribution shift without retraining?

- Concept: World models and latent dynamics
  - Why needed here: DreamerV3's core innovation is learning a predictive model of environment dynamics in a compressed latent space. Understanding encoder-decoder architectures, sequence models, and imagination-based planning is prerequisite to modifying or debugging this system.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between model-free and model-based RL, and why does the latter require learning a dynamics model?

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning
  - Why needed here: The paper's central claim is resilience to forgetting. Understanding why neural networks overwrite previous knowledge when training on new distributions helps evaluate whether the proposed mechanisms actually address the root cause.
  - Quick check question: Why does standard gradient descent cause forgetting when task distributions change sequentially?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Environment observation → World model encoder → discrete latent z_t → GRU (256 units, SiLU) → Actor head + Critic head → action selection
- Critical path: 1) Environment observation → World model encoder → discrete latent z_t; 2) Latent z_t + previous GRU hidden state → new hidden state h_t; 3) h_t → Actor head → action selection; 4) Transitions stored in replay buffer; world model and policy updated asynchronously
- Design tradeoffs: GRU hidden size (256) balances memory capacity vs. computational overhead; imagination horizon (H=15) trades off planning depth vs. compounding model errors; discrete latent space may lose fine-grained information vs. continuous representations but improves task separability
- Failure signatures: Sudden reward drops after workload shifts → possible GRU memory overflow or world model distribution shift; high variance across seeds → check replay buffer diversity and latent space clustering; reconstruction loss increasing → world model degrading
- First 3 experiments: 1) Baseline replication: Train DreamerV3 (without GRU) on fixed workload distribution to validate implementation; 2) GRU ablation: Compare DreamerV3 with and without GRU augmentation on dynamic workload trials; 3) Forgetting probe: After training on all three difficulty levels, re-evaluate on Easy workload to quantify retention vs. A2C baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The claim that discrete latent representations improve task differentiation relies on unverified assumptions about workload pattern separability in latent space
- Specific Park OS environment modifications required for reproduction are not fully documented
- The effective memory capacity of the GRU policy for longer-term workload adaptation patterns remains unexplored

## Confidence
- High confidence: DreamerV3 outperforms A2C on fixed workload distributions
- Medium confidence: Recurrent policy enables adaptation to dynamic workloads
- Low confidence: Discrete latent representations specifically reduce catastrophic forgetting

## Next Checks
1. Verify latent space clustering by visualizing discrete representations under different workload distributions using t-SNE or similar techniques
2. Implement a forgetting metric that quantifies performance degradation on previously-seen workload distributions over training
3. Test the GRU's effective memory capacity by varying episode lengths and measuring adaptation quality across different time horizons
