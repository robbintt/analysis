# Generalization in VAE and Diffusion Models: A Unified Information-Theoretic Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.00849
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00849
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Presents unified information-theoretic framework analyzing generalization in VAEs and diffusion models through encoder/generator divergence bounds

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a unified information-theoretic framework for analyzing generalization in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). The authors treat encoder and generator components as randomized mappings and derive bounds on the divergence between generated and original data distributions. The framework provides improved analysis for VAEs by considering both encoder and generator generalization, establishes explicit trade-offs for DMs based on diffusion time, and offers computable bounds for DMs using only training data. Empirical results validate the theory across synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that longer diffusion time doesn't necessarily improve generalization and showing how the bounds can guide hyperparameter selection.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a unified information-theoretic framework by treating both VAEs and DMs as compositions of randomized mappings - encoder with decoder in VAEs, and diffusion/noising with generation/denoising in DMs. The core approach involves deriving generalization bounds based on the mutual information between the original and generated data distributions. For VAEs, the analysis considers generalization in both the encoder and generator components. For DMs, the framework explicitly captures how generalization depends on diffusion time T, revealing a trade-off between denoising capability and generalization performance. The authors also propose computable bounds for DMs that can be evaluated using only the training data, making the theoretical results practically applicable.

## Key Results
- Improved VAE analysis by jointly considering encoder and generator generalization, providing tighter bounds than previous work
- Explicit trade-off revealed in DM generalization: performance depends non-monotonically on diffusion time T, showing longer diffusion doesn't guarantee better generalization
- Computable bounds developed for DMs based solely on training data, enabling practical hyperparameter selection and optimization guidance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating the learning process as a randomized mapping from input to output distributions. By analyzing the mutual information between the original and generated distributions, the bounds capture how well the learned model preserves the structure of the true data distribution. The key insight is that generalization can be quantified through information-theoretic measures of how much the learned mappings (encoder/decoder or noising/denoising) distort the underlying data distribution. This approach unifies VAEs and DMs under a common theoretical lens while revealing architecture-specific generalization behaviors.

## Foundational Learning

**Sub-Gaussian distributions:** Why needed - assumptions about data distribution tails affect bound validity. Quick check - verify data kurtosis values are bounded.

**Mutual information estimation:** Why needed - core quantity for computing generalization bounds. Quick check - compare multiple estimation methods on validation data.

**Randomized mappings:** Why needed - framework treats both VAEs and DMs as stochastic transformations. Quick check - verify encoder/decoder or noising/denoising processes are properly randomized.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** VAE: Data -> Encoder -> Latent -> Decoder -> Generated. DM: Data -> Noising (t steps) -> Latent -> Denoising -> Generated

**Critical path:** The mutual information between original and generated distributions forms the critical path for generalization analysis. For DMs, this depends critically on diffusion time T.

**Design tradeoffs:** Longer diffusion time improves denoising but may hurt generalization. The framework reveals an optimal T that balances these competing factors.

**Failure signatures:** Poor generalization manifests as high mutual information between original and generated distributions. Sub-Gaussian assumption violations lead to overly optimistic bounds.

**First experiments:**
1. Verify mutual information estimates on simple synthetic datasets with known distributions
2. Test bound sensitivity to sub-Gaussian assumption by varying data kurtosis
3. Compare bound predictions against actual generation quality across different diffusion times

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical bounds depend on sub-Gaussian assumptions about data distribution, which may not hold for all real-world datasets
- Empirical validation is limited in scope regarding model architecture diversity and dataset complexity
- Framework focuses on unconditional models, leaving extension to conditional variants as an open question

## Confidence

High: The mathematical derivations are sound within stated assumptions and the framework provides a more flexible, algorithm-dependent approach compared to previous work

Medium: Practical utility of bounds depends on sub-Gaussian assumption accuracy and stability of mutual information estimates; empirical results are promising but based on limited experimental setups

## Next Checks

1. Test computable bounds on wider variety of real-world datasets with different data distributions to assess robustness of sub-Gaussian assumptions

2. Extend empirical evaluation to include conditional VAEs and diffusion models to verify framework applicability to supervised settings

3. Compare proposed bounds against other generalization measures in terms of their ability to predict actual generation quality across multiple model architectures
