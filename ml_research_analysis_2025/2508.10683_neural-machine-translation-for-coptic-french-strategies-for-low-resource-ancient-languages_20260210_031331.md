- First systematic study of neural machine translation for Coptic→French

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of translating low-resource ancient languages by focusing on Coptic→French neural machine translation. The authors systematically evaluate four strategies: direct fine-tuning vs. pivot-based translation, choice of pre-trained models with and without Coptic exposure, leveraging stylistic diversity through multiple French Bible translations, and building robustness to noise by corrupting training data. Their experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning consistently outperforms pivot and multilingual baselines, that models pre-trained on related scripts or Coptic itself perform best, and that including diverse translation variants improves generalization. The study also shows that moderate noise injection (50% corruption) yields the best trade-off between clean-text quality and robustness to degradation.

## Method Summary
The authors build and evaluate neural machine translation systems for Coptic→French using a range of strategies tailored to low-resource settings. They compare direct fine-tuning of pre-trained models against pivot-based and multilingual approaches, test models with varying levels of prior exposure to Coptic (including script similarity), incorporate multiple French Bible translations to capture stylistic diversity, and inject synthetic noise into training data to enhance robustness. Evaluation is performed using BERTScore, BLEURT, and COMET metrics. Two strong NMT models are released as part of this work.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning outperforms pivot and multilingual baselines (BERTScore: 0.820 vs. 0.595–0.620)
- Models pre-trained on related scripts or Coptic (e.g., Helsinki) achieve best performance (BERTScore 0.850)
- Including all translation variants in training improves generalization (best BLEURT/COMET scores)
- Noise injection at 50% corruption provides optimal balance between clean-text quality and robustness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of the proposed strategies stems from aligning model pre-training with the linguistic and orthographic characteristics of the target language, leveraging stylistic diversity to improve generalization, and explicitly training for robustness to real-world degradation. Fine-tuning directly on the low-resource language pair avoids the compounding errors of pivot approaches, while pre-training on related scripts or the target language itself provides a better starting point for adaptation. Diverse training data and noise injection help models generalize beyond clean, canonical texts to the noisy realities of ancient manuscripts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Low-resource NMT**: Machine translation where little parallel data exists; critical for ancient or endangered languages where parallel corpora are scarce or nonexistent.
- **Fine-tuning vs. pivot translation**: Direct adaptation of a pre-trained model to the target language pair versus translating through an intermediate language; needed to avoid error propagation and leverage task-specific knowledge.
- **Script familiarity in pre-training**: Exposure to similar writing systems during pre-training can improve downstream performance; quick check: compare models pre-trained on related scripts vs. unrelated ones.
- **Noise robustness**: Training models to handle synthetic or real-world text degradation; important for ancient manuscripts with OCR errors or physical damage.
- **Evaluation metrics (BERTScore, BLEURT, COMET)**: Reference-based and reference-free metrics for translation quality; needed to capture both semantic and stylistic aspects in low-resource settings.
- **Multilingual pre-training**: Joint training on multiple languages to improve transfer; relevant for leveraging related languages or scripts in low-resource scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Pre-trained model (Helsinki, mBERT, etc.) -> Fine-tuning on Coptic→French data -> Evaluation with multiple metrics
- **Critical path**: Selection of pre-trained model with Coptic/script exposure → Fine-tuning on parallel corpus → Evaluation and robustness testing
- **Design tradeoffs**: Direct fine-tuning vs. pivot/multilingual baselines (accuracy vs. data availability), synthetic noise injection vs. real-world noise (control vs. realism), inclusion of multiple translation variants (diversity vs. data size)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on noisy or out-of-domain text, large gaps between clean and corrupted text scores, overfitting to a single translation style
- **First experiments**: 1) Compare fine-tuning vs. pivot baselines on a held-out test set; 2) Ablate pre-trained models with/without Coptic/script exposure; 3) Test robustness to increasing levels of synthetic noise

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental scope limited to one language pair (Coptic→French), restricting generalizability to other low-resource or ancient languages
- Noise robustness relies on synthetic corruption, which may not fully reflect real-world degradation types in historical manuscripts
- Pre-trained model comparisons conflate script familiarity with model architecture, making it difficult to isolate the key driver of performance gains

## Confidence
- High: Superiority of fine-tuning over pivot/multilingual baselines; benefit of noise injection at moderate levels
- Medium: Impact of pre-training data diversity (script familiarity, domain), due to lack of ablation studies
- Low: Generalizability of results to other language pairs or script families, given limited experimental scope

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed fine-tuning approach on additional low-resource language pairs (e.g., other ancient or minority languages) to assess cross-linguistic transferability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing models pre-trained on Coptic text vs. those pre-trained only on related scripts, to disentangle the effects of script vs. language modeling
3. Evaluate robustness to real-world OCR errors or manuscript noise, rather than synthetic corruption, to better reflect practical deployment scenarios
