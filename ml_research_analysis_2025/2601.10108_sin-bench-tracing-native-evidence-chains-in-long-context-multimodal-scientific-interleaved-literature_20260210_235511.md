## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO) paradigm for evaluating multimodal large language models' ability to understand long-form scientific documents. Unlike synthetic "Needle-In-A-Haystack" tests, FITO requires models to construct explicit cross-modal evidence chains within native scientific documents. The authors build SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus preserving text-figure alternation, and SIN-Bench, a four-task suite covering evidence discovery, hypothesis verification, grounded QA, and evidence-anchored synthesis.

Experiments with eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.566), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned scores. This gap between correctness and traceable support reveals that many models rely on parametric knowledge rather than genuine document comprehension.

## Method Summary
The authors propose the "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO) paradigm to evaluate MLLMs' comprehension of long scientific documents by requiring explicit cross-modal evidence chains rather than synthetic retrieval tasks. They construct SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus preserving text-figure alternation from 100 curated documents, and SIN-Bench, a four-task evaluation suite: evidence discovery (SIN-Evidence), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Synthesis). Each task demands models to trace evidence chains from source text to figures and back, using "No Evidence, No Score" evaluation that awards partial credit only when answers are explicitly grounded in the document. The corpus and benchmark are publicly released with standardized zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompts for consistent evaluation.

## Key Results
- Gemini-3-pro achieves the best overall average score (0.566) across all tasks, demonstrating superior evidence chain construction
- GPT-5 attains the highest answer accuracy (0.767) on SIN-QA but significantly underperforms on evidence-aligned scores, indicating reliance on parametric knowledge
- Models perform well on rejecting clearly irrelevant evidence but accuracy drops to near-chance levels when facing "near-miss" evidence with superficial plausibility
- Evidence grounding emerges as the primary bottleneck, with all models struggling to construct verifiable cross-modal chains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The FITO paradigm works by forcing models to demonstrate comprehension through explicit evidence chain construction rather than black-box answer generation. By requiring models to trace claims from text through figures and back, the evaluation exposes whether understanding comes from genuine document processing or parametric knowledge. The interleaved corpus structure mirrors real scientific documents where evidence flows bidirectionally between modalities, making the task more authentic than synthetic retrieval scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Evidence Chains**: Models must link claims across text and figures, requiring cross-modal reasoning that goes beyond unimodal understanding
  - Why needed: Scientific documents rely on bidirectional evidence flow between modalities
  - Quick check: Can the model trace a claim from text through figure to supporting detail?

- **Interleaved Document Structure**: SIN-Data preserves natural text-figure alternation found in real papers, creating authentic comprehension challenges
  - Why needed: Synthetic documents often lack the complex dependencies of real scientific writing
  - Quick check: Does the model understand how text and figures complement each other?

- **Evidence-Aligned Scoring**: "No Evidence, No Score" evaluation ensures models must ground answers in source documents
  - Why needed: Prevents models from relying solely on parametric knowledge for correct answers
  - Quick check: Can the model justify answers with explicit document references?

- **Near-Miss Detection**: Models must distinguish superficially plausible but logically insufficient evidence
  - Why needed: Real scientific reasoning requires deep logical sufficiency checks, not surface-level relevance
  - Quick check: Does the model reject evidence that seems relevant but doesn't actually support the claim?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
- Input Processing -> Multimodal Encoder -> Evidence Chain Constructor -> Answer Generator -> Evidence Alignment Checker

Critical Path:
Document text and figures → Multimodal encoder processing → Evidence chain construction (text→figure→text) → Answer generation with inline citations → Evidence alignment verification

Design Tradeoffs:
- Zero-shot evaluation preserves real-world applicability but may underestimate model capabilities
- "No Evidence, No Score" rigor ensures genuine comprehension but penalizes valid inferences without explicit anchors
- Small corpus size (100 documents) enables careful curation but limits domain coverage
- Text-figure alternation focus captures common patterns but may miss other scientific document structures

Failure Signatures:
- High answer accuracy with low evidence alignment scores indicates parametric knowledge reliance
- Performance collapse on near-miss evidence reveals surface-level reasoning
- Inability to construct bidirectional evidence chains shows unidirectional comprehension

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate a model on SIN-Evidence to test basic cross-modal evidence discovery capabilities
2. Test SIN-Verify with easy negatives to establish baseline hypothesis verification performance
3. Run SIN-QA with chain-of-thought prompting to assess grounded answer generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can model training objectives be modified to close the performance gap between high parametric answer accuracy and low evidence traceability?
- Basis in paper: The authors observe that GPT-5 achieves the highest answer accuracy (0.767) on SIN-QA but lags in evidence-aligned scores, indicating a reliance on memorization rather than document comprehension.
- Why unresolved: Current models appear optimized for result-oriented prediction rather than the process-oriented reasoning required by the FITO paradigm.
- What evidence would resolve it: A training curriculum that penalizes models for correct answers derived without explicit, verifiable anchors in the source text.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What architectural or fine-tuning interventions are required to improve model robustness against "near-miss" evidence in hypothesis verification?
- Basis in paper: Table 2 shows that while models easily reject clearly irrelevant evidence, their accuracy collapses to near-chance levels when facing "hard negatives" (near-miss evidence with superficial plausibility).
- Why unresolved: Models rely on surface-level semantic relevance cues rather than performing deep logical sufficiency checks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Significant performance improvements on adversarial SIN-Verify splits where evidence is perturbed or logically insufficient.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the "No Evidence, No Score" evaluation logic be adapted to detect academic fraud or inconsistencies in AI-generated scientific writing?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly urge the community to utilize evidence chains for the detection of academic fraud, noting the risk of "paper mills" exploiting generation technology.
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces the evaluation framework but leaves the application of this framework as a defensive detection tool for future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of SIN-Bench metrics to identify fabricated papers that lack consistent cross-modal evidence chains.

## Limitations
- Small corpus size (100 documents) may limit generalizability across scientific domains and document structures
- Human-generated evidence chains introduce potential subjectivity in assessing model performance
- Focus on documents with clear text-figure alternation may overlook other scientific document formats
- Limited to domains with explicit multimodal evidence patterns, potentially missing other scientific communication styles

## Confidence
- High confidence: FITO better captures true long-context comprehension than NITS, supported by systematic evidence-chain requirement
- Medium confidence: Gemini-3-pro achieves best overall evidence alignment score (0.566), dependent on human-annotated ground truth
- High confidence: Models often generate correct answers without traceable evidence support, demonstrated by GPT-5 case

## Next Checks
1. Expand SIN-Data to include diverse scientific domains and document structures, particularly those lacking explicit text-figure alternation patterns
2. Implement automated consistency checks for human-annotated evidence chains to reduce subjectivity and establish inter-annotator agreement metrics
3. Test whether models trained with FITO-style supervision show improved evidence traceability on held-out scientific documents compared to those trained with traditional long-context evaluation methods
