# Horizon Scans can be accelerated using novel information retrieval and artificial intelligence tools

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.01627
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01627
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: SCANAR and AIDOC tools achieve 62% average work savings in horizon scanning at 95% recall

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SCANAR and AIDOC, two open-source Python tools designed to automate and accelerate horizon scanning workflows. SCANAR handles bulk retrieval of news articles using Google News RSS feeds, incorporating de-duplication and full-text scraping capabilities. AIDOC employs neural networks to reorder references based on semantic similarity and supports active learning for efficient screening. The tools address critical inefficiencies in traditional horizon scanning by reducing manual screening workload while maintaining high recall rates.

The authors evaluate AIDOC across 12 datasets, demonstrating an average work savings of 62% at 95% recall, which is comparable to existing systematic review tools. The integration of large language models shows additional potential for faster detection, particularly in challenging news datasets. Both tools are openly available, providing accessible solutions for organizations conducting horizon scanning activities.

## Method Summary
The study presents two complementary tools for horizon scanning automation. SCANAR automates the retrieval process by accessing Google News RSS feeds, then performs de-duplication and full-text article scraping to create comprehensive datasets. AIDOC builds on this by applying neural networks to reorder retrieved references based on their semantic similarity to the screening criteria, enabling prioritized review of the most relevant documents. The system incorporates active learning capabilities, allowing users to iteratively refine the screening model based on their relevance judgments. The tools were tested across 12 different datasets spanning various topics and data types, with particular attention to news article collections which present unique challenges due to their noisy and variable nature.

## Key Results
- AIDOC achieved an average work savings of 62% at 95% recall across 12 datasets
- Performance varied substantially across datasets, ranging from 14% to 85% work savings
- News article datasets showed poorer performance due to language variability and noise
- LLM integration demonstrated additional potential for faster detection in challenging datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The tools work by addressing the fundamental bottleneck in horizon scanning: the manual screening of large volumes of potentially relevant documents. SCANAR automates the initial retrieval phase, ensuring comprehensive coverage of available news sources while eliminating duplicates. AIDOC then applies machine learning to prioritize documents based on their relevance likelihood, allowing human reviewers to focus on the most promising candidates first. This approach leverages the strengths of both automated systems (speed and consistency) and human judgment (contextual understanding and nuanced evaluation).

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic similarity ranking**: Why needed - to prioritize most relevant documents; Quick check - verify ranking correlates with human relevance judgments
- **Active learning**: Why needed - to iteratively improve model performance based on user feedback; Quick check - confirm model accuracy improves with additional training examples
- **RSS feed parsing**: Why needed - to automate bulk news retrieval; Quick check - validate complete and accurate article extraction
- **De-duplication algorithms**: Why needed - to eliminate redundant content and reduce screening burden; Quick check - ensure no false positives in duplicate detection
- **Neural network ranking**: Why needed - to handle complex semantic relationships in text; Quick check - test ranking performance across diverse topics
- **LLM integration**: Why needed - to enhance detection in noisy, variable text like news articles; Quick check - compare LLM-enhanced vs standard model performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: SCANAR (RSS parsing -> De-duplication -> Full-text scraping) -> AIDOC (Neural ranking -> Active learning -> Relevance screening)

**Critical Path**: Article retrieval through SCANAR → AIDOC ranking and prioritization → Human screening of top-ranked articles → Active learning feedback loop → Model refinement

**Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritized speed and automation over perfect accuracy, accepting some false negatives to achieve significant work savings; reliance on Google News API creates platform dependency but ensures comprehensive coverage

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on news datasets indicates sensitivity to text variability and noise; substantial performance variation across topics suggests model limitations with certain subject matter; API changes could break SCANAR functionality

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Run SCANAR on a test news topic to verify complete article retrieval and de-duplication
2. Test AIDOC ranking on a small labeled dataset to confirm semantic similarity ordering
3. Evaluate active learning loop by manually screening initial results and measuring model improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Substantial performance variation across datasets (14% to 85% work savings) suggests limited generalizability
- News article datasets showed notably poorer performance due to language variability and noise
- Platform dependency on Google News RSS feeds creates potential sustainability risks
- LLM integration showed promise but specific configurations were not fully detailed

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Technical implementation and open-sourcing of SCANAR and AIDOC | High |
| 62% average work savings at 95% recall | Medium |
| Comparable performance to existing systematic review tools | Medium |
| LLM integration potential for faster detection | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Independent replication of AIDOC performance across diverse topic areas, particularly testing with news datasets to verify the reported variability
2. Systematic comparison of AIDOC against established systematic review tools (e.g., Abstrackr, SWIFT-Review) using identical datasets and screening criteria
3. Evaluation of SCANAR's robustness to changes in Google News API structure and testing with alternative news source APIs to assess platform dependency risks
