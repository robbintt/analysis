# LM$^2$otifs : An Explainable Framework for Machine-Generated Texts Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.12507
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12507
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art MGT detection with average accuracy of 0.98 and AUC of 1.00 on multiple domains while providing interpretable motifs

## Executive Summary
LM$^2$otifs addresses the challenge of detecting machine-generated text (MGT) while providing explainable results. The framework constructs graphs from text based on word co-occurrence patterns, applies graph neural networks for detection, and extracts interpretable motifs to explain predictions. This approach draws from probabilistic graphical models to achieve both accurate detection and interpretability. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LM$^2$otifs achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with average accuracy of 0.98 and AUC of 1.00 on multiple domains. The extracted explainable motifs significantly outperform baseline methods in interpretability evaluation, revealing distinct linguistic patterns characteristic of MGT.

## Method Summary
LM$^2$otifs transforms text into heterogeneous graphs where nodes represent tokens and documents, connected by PMI-based edges for significant co-occurrences and binary links for document-token relationships. A 2-layer GCN performs message passing to aggregate neighborhood information, with document node embeddings classified as human- or machine-generated. Post-hoc motif extraction uses GNNExplainer to identify minimal subgraphs preserving prediction accuracy, providing interpretable evidence for classification decisions. The framework handles various LLM-generated texts including ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude-3, and others, providing both accurate detection and meaningful insights into what differentiates human from machine-generated content.

## Key Results

- Extracted explainable motifs significantly outperform baseline methods in interpretability evaluation
- Effectively handles various LLM-generated texts including ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude-3, and others
- Provides both accurate detection and meaningful insights into what differentiates human from machine-generated content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Graph-Based Lexical Dependency Modeling via PMI
Representing text as co-occurrence graphs captures discriminative lexical patterns distinguishing human-generated text (HGT) from machine-generated text (MGT). The framework constructs heterogeneous graphs with two node types (tokens and documents). Token-token edges are established when Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) > 0 within a sliding window. Document-token edges connect documents to their contained tokens. This transforms sequential text into a topological structure where message-passing can propagate information across non-adjacent but semantically related words. The core assumption is that statistical dependencies between word co-occurrences differ systematically between human and machine-generated text in a way that is more discriminative than sequential probability estimates alone.

### Mechanism 2: GNN-Based Detection via Multi-Hop Message Passing
Graph Neural Networks achieve detection by aggregating neighborhood information across the co-occurrence graph, modeling higher-order dependencies beyond n-gram sequences. A 2-layer GCN performs K=2 rounds of message passing, aggregating neighbor features and combining with current node representations. Final document node embeddings are classified via softmax. The core assumption is that information aggregated from a node's multi-hop neighborhood is more predictive of machine authorship than sequential conditional probabilities from fixed context lengths.

### Mechanism 3: Post-Hoc Subgraph Motif Extraction via GNNExplainer
Explaining predictions by identifying minimal, sufficient subgraphs (motifs) that preserve the original prediction, offering interpretable evidence for classification decisions. Adapts GNNExplainer to optimize an objective balancing prediction fidelity (cross-entropy between original and explanation-based predictions) against explanation complexity (subgraph size penalty). Edges receive continuous importance weights, discretized to form interpretable motifs. The core assumption is that the GNN's prediction relies on a sparse set of identifiable subgraph structures rather than diffuse, distributed features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's theoretical motivation frames MGT detection through PGMs, contrasting graph-based conditional independence with sequential autoregressive modeling.
  - Quick check question: Given variables A, B, C with edges A-B and B-C but no A-C edge, what conditional independence does this imply? (Answer: A is conditionally independent of C given B)

- **Concept: Graph Neural Networks and Message Passing**
  - Why needed here: The core detector is a GNN; understanding how information propagates and aggregates is critical for debugging and tuning.
  - Quick check question: In a 2-layer GCN, what is the effective receptive field after two message-passing rounds? (Answer: 2-hop neighborhood)

- **Concept: Post-hoc Explainability in XAI**
  - Why needed here: The framework's key contribution beyond detection is explainability; understanding fidelity vs. minimality trade-offs is essential.
  - Quick check question: If an explainer preserves 99% prediction accuracy but uses 95% of edges, is it a "good" explanation per the paper's criteria? (Answer: No—fails minimality; goal is compact sufficient explanation)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Text -> Tokenizer -> Graph Construction -> GNN Detector -> Classification -> Explainer -> Motif Extraction
- **Critical path:** Text → Tokenization → Graph Construction (PMI calculation) → GNN Forward Pass → Classification → (Optional) Explainer → Motif Extraction
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Graph sparsity: Sliding window size and PMI threshold control edge density; too sparse = disconnected, too dense = noise
  - GNN depth: More layers increase receptive field but risk over-smoothing (paper uses K=2)
  - Explanation λ parameter: Higher penalty forces sparser explanations but may reduce fidelity
  - Tokenizer choice: BertTokenizer vs GPT-2 tokenizer show similar performance (Table 13)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low accuracy on specific domains suggests HGT/MGT co-occurrence patterns too similar
  - Overly dense motifs (>20% edges) indicate explainer failing to find compact reasons
  - Poor cross-domain generalization (Table 10) indicates domain-specific patterns
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce in-domain detection on HC3 open-qa, verify ~0.97 ACC, 1.00 AUC (Table 8)
  2. Ablate graph construction: test sliding window sizes (W=3 vs W=5) and PMI thresholds, measure impact on graph density and accuracy
  3. Implement MoRF protocol (Section 6.3): compare accuracy drop when removing edges by LM2OTIFS importance vs. random ordering

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can the explicit extraction of explainable motifs be exploited by adversaries to modify machine-generated text and evade detection?
  - Basis in paper: The "Impact Statements" section warns that "malicious actors could leverage the identified motifs to modify machine-generated text in a way that circumvents detection."
  - Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the efficacy of detection and explanation extraction but does not evaluate the robustness of the extracted motifs against adversarial attacks designed to mask those specific patterns.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An adversarial robustness study where MGT is iteratively modified to remove or alter high-importance motifs, followed by a re-evaluation of detection accuracy.

- **Question:** How does the choice of Graph Neural Network architecture and hyperparameter settings impact the detection accuracy and the quality of the extracted motifs?
  - Basis in paper: The "Limitation" section states, "we have not explored the impact of different GNN architectures or variations in their hyperparameter settings."
  - Why unresolved: The experiments utilize a fixed two-layer GCN architecture, leaving the potential performance gains or interpretability shifts from using GATs, GraphSAGE, or deeper networks unknown.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative ablation studies using various GNN backbones (e.g., GAT, GIN) and different layer depths/hyperparameters on the benchmark datasets.

- **Question:** Can the framework maintain high performance in cross-domain detection scenarios where the target domain differs significantly from the training data?
  - Basis in paper: While the paper claims theoretical advantages, the "Cross-Domain Detection" results (Table 10) show performance drops in domains like Reddit (M4).
  - Why unresolved: It is unclear if the drop is due to data scarcity or a fundamental limitation of the graph construction method (co-occurrence) in adapting to different vocabularies and styles without retraining.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Zero-shot or few-shot cross-domain experiments measuring how much target domain data is required to recover peak performance.

## Limitations

- Theoretical claims about strict subsumption of sequential detectors lack empirical validation beyond proof structure
- Critical hyperparameters like sliding window size (W=3) and GNNExplainer regularization parameter λ are not fully specified
- Cross-domain performance shows significant degradation, suggesting potential overfitting to training domain patterns
- No evaluation of framework's robustness against adversarial modifications targeting identified motifs

## Confidence

- **Detection Performance:** High confidence - State-of-the-art results consistently reported across six benchmark datasets with specific numbers provided
- **Explainability Quality:** Medium confidence - MoRF evaluation shows superior performance compared to random baselines, but lacks external validation against established XAI methods
- **Theoretical Framework:** Medium confidence - PGM-based theoretical foundation provides coherent motivation, but strict subsumption claim lacks empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary the sliding window size (W=3, W=5, W=10, W=20) and report detection accuracy and graph density to test whether the unusually small W=3 is optimal or a limiting factor.

2. **Cross-Model Generalization Test:** Evaluate the trained models on MGT samples from LLM models not seen during training (e.g., Claude-3, Llama-2-70b, or future models) to directly test whether the framework captures universal MGT patterns or overfits to specific model signatures.

3. **External Explainability Benchmark:** Compare the extracted motifs against established XAI methods like SHAP or LIME applied to a baseline transformer classifier to validate whether graph-based explanations provide genuinely superior interpretability.
