# Ensuring Reliability of Curated EHR-Derived Data: The Validation of Accuracy for LLM/ML-Extracted Information and Data (VALID) Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08231
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08231
- Reference count: 0
- This paper introduces the VALID framework for assessing accuracy and reliability of clinical data extracted from EHRs using large language models (LLMs).

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the VALID framework, a comprehensive approach to validate the accuracy and reliability of clinical data extracted from electronic health records using large language models. The framework addresses the critical need for rigorous quality assessment of AI-powered real-world evidence generation by integrating three complementary evaluation components: variable-level performance benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. By evaluating LLM performance relative to human-level performance and identifying latent errors through systematic checks, VALID provides a transparent, multidimensional method for ensuring data quality and fitness-for-purpose in oncology research and practice. The framework supports bias assessment, continuous model improvement, and trustworthy use of AI in generating real-world evidence.

## Method Summary
The VALID framework evaluates LLM/ML-extracted clinical data through three pillars: (1) variable-level performance benchmarking where LLM output is compared against expert human abstraction using recall, precision, F1, and completeness metrics, with relative performance differences calculated to contextualize results; (2) automated verification checks applying rule-based conformance, plausibility, and consistency assessments at patient and cohort levels to surface latent errors that variable-level metrics miss; and (3) replication analyses comparing broad cohort characterizations and subcohort-specific findings from LLM-extracted data against internal human-abstracted datasets or external benchmarks like SEER. The framework requires creation of held-out test sets with reference standards (using duplicate abstraction or adjudication approaches), calculation of variable-level metrics, implementation of verification checks, and replication analyses to confirm dataset fitness-for-purpose.

## Key Results
- The VALID framework provides a comprehensive approach for validating LLM-extracted clinical data from EHRs
- Relative performance metrics (LLM vs. human abstractor) provide more interpretable quality signals than absolute metrics alone
- Automated verification checks surface latent errors that variable-level metrics miss, acting as a proxy for accuracy without requiring labeled data
- Replication analyses confirm dataset fitness-for-purpose by testing whether LLM-extracted data reproduces known clinical patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Relative performance metrics (LLM vs. human abstractor) provide more interpretable quality signals than absolute metrics alone.
- **Mechanism:** By calculating the difference between LLM and human accuracy on the same reference standard, task difficulty is partially controlled for. High human disagreement on a variable signals inherent ambiguity; low relative difference suggests the model is performing near ceiling for that task.
- **Core assumption:** Expert human abstraction, even with inter-rater variability, approximates a meaningful upper bound for extractable accuracy given documentation quality.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "variable-level performance benchmarking against expert human abstraction... enables identification of variables most in need of improvement"
  - [section] Table 2 shows surgery (-10% pt relative) vs. locoregional recurrence (-5% pt relative) with identical absolute LLM performance but different interpretation based on human benchmarks
  - [corpus] Weak/missing—neighbor papers focus on LLM evaluation for diagnosis/synthetic data, not EHR extraction benchmarking methodologies
- **Break condition:** If human abstractors are not using standardized procedures or if reference standards are of unknown quality, relative metrics become untrustworthy.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Automated verification checks surface latent errors that variable-level metrics miss, acting as a proxy for accuracy without requiring labeled data.
- **Mechanism:** Rule-based checks (conformance, plausibility, consistency) flag clinically illogical patterns (e.g., metastatic diagnosis prior to initial diagnosis). These conflicts are enriched for model errors but may also reflect real-world practice, requiring clinician review.
- **Core assumption:** Most model errors produce detectable logical or temporal inconsistencies; conversely, most real clinical edge cases still pass plausibility review.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "automated verification checks for internal consistency and plausibility... systematic detection of latent errors"
  - [section] p.6: "Even when LLM extraction performance is high, small amounts of misclassified data may result in usability issues... verification checks help mitigate this issue"
  - [corpus] Weak/missing—no corpus papers validate this specific verification-check-to-error-detection pathway
- **Break condition:** If checks are poorly designed (too sensitive or not clinically informed), they generate excessive false positives or miss error modes entirely.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Replication analyses confirm dataset fitness-for-purpose by testing whether LLM-extracted data reproduces known clinical patterns or research conclusions.
- **Mechanism:** Broad cohort characterization (distributions, survival outcomes) and subcohort replication (e.g., biomarker-specific groups) are compared to internal human-abstracted datasets or external benchmarks (SEER, published literature). Concordance supports validity; discordance surfaces where model errors compound across variables.
- **Core assumption:** Established clinical patterns and published outcomes are valid reference points for real-world data quality assessment.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "replication analyses comparing LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards... confirmation of dataset fitness-for-purpose"
  - [section] p.7-8: "replication analyses are critical for assessing the fitness-for-purpose of RWD in research and regulatory contexts... gives ability to describe how model errors across multiple LLM-extracted variables may interact together"
  - [corpus] Weak—corpus mentions RWD/AI integration conceptually but not this replication-validation mechanism
- **Break condition:** If population differences between LLM dataset and external benchmark are large, point estimates may not replicate even with high-quality extraction.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Inter-rater agreement and reference standard construction**
  - Why needed here: The framework depends on comparing LLM output to human abstraction; understanding duplicate abstraction, double adjudication, and triple adjudication (Table 1) is essential for designing valid test sets.
  - Quick check question: If two abstractors disagree on 20% of cases for a variable, what does that imply about the interpretability of LLM performance metrics?

- **Concept: Compounding error in derived variables**
  - Why needed here: Complex variables like "TNBC status at metastatic diagnosis" require correct alignment of multiple extracted components (ER, PR, HER2, dates); small errors cascade.
  - Quick check question: A model achieves 97% accuracy on each of 4 component variables. What is the approximate upper bound on end-to-end accuracy for the derived variable?

- **Concept: Stratified bias assessment**
  - Why needed here: High overall performance can mask differential errors in subgroups; the framework explicitly calls for stratifying metrics by demographics and clinical subgroups.
  - Quick check question: If model recall is 92% overall but 78% for patients aged 80+, what type of bias should be investigated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Test set generator -> Variable-level evaluator -> Verification check engine -> Replication analyzer -> Bias stratifier

- **Critical path:** Test set creation -> Variable-level metrics -> Human benchmark comparison -> Verification checks -> Replication analyses -> Bias stratification. Each stage gates the next; poor reference data invalidates downstream metrics.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Duplicate abstraction vs. adjudication: Duplicate is reusable during model iteration but underestimates absolute performance; adjudication is more accurate but must be regenerated when model changes.
  - Verification check sensitivity: Overly strict checks increase manual review burden; overly lenient checks miss errors.
  - External vs. internal benchmarks: External (e.g., SEER) enables validation when internal reference unavailable, but population differences complicate interpretation.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High LLM performance but low relative performance (e.g., -15% pt) -> task is achievable but model is underperforming
  - High variable-level metrics but high verification check failure rate -> latent errors in edge cases
  - Replication failure in specific subcohorts only -> differential model performance or documentation gaps
  - Stratified metrics show performance drops in specific demographics -> model bias requiring investigation

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Pilot variable-level assessment:** Select 3 variables of varying complexity (e.g., smoking status, surgery date, progression date). Build a test set using double adjudication. Compute LLM and human metrics. Calculate relative performance difference.
  2. **Verification check implementation:** Design 10 patient-level checks (temporal ordering, value conflicts) and 5 cohort-level checks (distribution alignment with guidelines). Apply to full LLM-extracted dataset. Flag and manually review conflicts.
  3. **Subcohort replication:** Identify one established clinical finding (e.g., survival difference by biomarker status). Replicate the analysis using LLM-extracted data and compare conclusions to published results or internal human-abstracted dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What specific performance thresholds for LLM-extracted data should be considered "good enough" for distinct research and regulatory applications?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that "additional work is still required, including a need to build consensus across the field regarding what thresholds of LLM performance (as well as the reference data) are considered 'good enough' for different research and regulatory applications."
- **Why unresolved:** Current standards focus on transparency and reproducibility, but do not define acceptable accuracy cut-offs for high-stakes clinical evidence generation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Consensus guidelines or regulatory benchmarks linking specific F1/accuracy thresholds to successful outcomes in regulatory submissions or clinical trial replication.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the VALID framework be effectively generalized to non-oncology therapeutic areas and healthcare systems with different documentation patterns?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper identifies "an opportunity to extend this framework beyond oncology to other diseases, therapeutic areas and healthcare systems."
- **Why unresolved:** The framework was developed and illustrated using oncology-specific data (e.g., biomarker status, cancer staging), and it is unclear if the three pillars (variable metrics, verification, replication) require modification for other specialties.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation studies applying the VALID framework to diverse therapeutic areas (e.g., cardiology, rare diseases) demonstrating similar capabilities in detecting latent errors and bias.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the evolution of model architectures and prompt engineering strategies impact the long-term stability and quality of LLM-extracted data?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that "ongoing research is needed... This includes evaluating the impact of new model architectures, training data sources, and prompt engineering strategies on extraction quality."
- **Why unresolved:** LLMs are dynamic, and the framework currently requires re-running assessments after updates, creating a maintenance burden; the sensitivity of the framework's checks to these changes is not fully characterized.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal studies tracking variable-level performance and verification check failures across sequential model versions and prompt iterations.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can the framework effectively validate data when the expert human abstraction used as the reference standard contains noise or errors?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors acknowledge a limitation that evaluation is "only meaningful when the reference data is of known and sufficient quality," warning that "poor-quality reference data can confound performance assessments."
- **Why unresolved:** The framework relies on human abstraction as the "ground truth," but does not offer a mechanism to validate the reference standard itself or adjust metrics when human error rates are unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Methodologies for quantifying reference standard uncertainty or simulation studies analyzing the robustness of the relative performance metric against varying degrees of noise in human labels.

## Limitations
- Dependence on high-quality human reference standards, which are resource-intensive to create
- Potential for verification checks to generate false positives that complicate interpretation
- Assumption that external benchmarks are appropriate comparators despite potential population differences

## Confidence
- **High:** Core premise that LLM performance relative to human benchmarks provides actionable quality signals
- **Medium:** Utility of automated verification checks for error detection
- **Low:** Framework's ability to detect subtle biases across demographic subgroups

## Next Checks
1. **Reference Standard Quality Assessment:** Apply the framework to a dataset with known inter-rater agreement levels (e.g., 10%, 20%, 30% disagreement) and measure how reference standard quality affects relative performance metrics and subsequent model improvement decisions.

2. **Verification Check Calibration:** Implement the framework's verification checks on a held-out test set where ground truth errors are known. Measure precision and recall of the verification system itself to establish appropriate thresholds and minimize false positive burden.

3. **External Benchmark Sensitivity:** Apply the replication analysis component using multiple external benchmarks (SEER, different published cohorts) for the same clinical questions. Quantify how population differences between benchmarks affect the interpretation of LLM performance and dataset fitness-for-purpose conclusions.
