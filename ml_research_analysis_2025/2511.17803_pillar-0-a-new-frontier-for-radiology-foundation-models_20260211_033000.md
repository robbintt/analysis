# Pillar-0: A New Frontier for Radiology Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.17803
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17803
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Pillar-0 achieves 7.8-15.8 AUROC points improvement over state-of-the-art medical foundation models on volumetric CT/MRI tasks.

## Executive Summary
Pillar-0 introduces a new radiology foundation model that processes volumetric CT and MRI scans with native 12-16-bit fidelity and full 3D structure. The model uses a novel multi-windowing tokenizer to preserve tissue contrast and Atlas architecture for efficient volumetric processing. Trained on 218,217 exams, it demonstrates strong generalization across abdomen-pelvis CT, chest CT, head CT, and breast MRI, outperforming existing models significantly. The authors release open code and evaluation tools to enable broader research and clinical deployment.

## Method Summary
Pillar-0 uses asymmetric contrastive learning with a 89M parameter Atlas backbone for vision and a frozen 8B parameter Qwen3 text encoder. The model processes volumetric scans through a multi-windowing tokenizer that preserves native bit-depth contrast, then encodes them using hierarchical multi-scale attention. Training employs AdamW with global batch 256, gradient accumulation, and supervised ImageNet pretraining initialization. Evaluation uses the RATE framework to extract 366 structured clinical findings from radiology reports for large-scale assessment.

## Key Results
- Achieves 7.8-15.8 AUROC points improvement over state-of-the-art medical foundation models
- Demonstrates >20× data efficiency improvement in brain hemorrhage detection
- Sets new state-of-the-art for lung cancer risk prediction when finetuned
- Shows strong generalization to external validation datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-windowing preserves tissue contrast
- **Claim:** Preserving native high bit-depth contrast via multi-windowing improves lesion detection over standard 8-bit normalization.
- **Mechanism:** Rather than compressing CT Hounsfield Units to single 8-bit range, the model projects volume patches into multiple channels, each highlighting different tissue properties (e.g., bone vs. lung). This mimics radiologist workflows, retaining subtle contrast information otherwise discarded.
- **Core assumption:** Clinical findings in CT/MRI rely heavily on intensity discrimination that is lost in standard min-max scaling to 8-bit.
- **Evidence anchors:** 4.6 AUROC gain (77.6 to 82.2) when using multi-windowing vs. min-max normalization on Merlin dataset.

### Mechanism 2: Native 3D volumetric processing captures context
- **Claim:** Native 3D volumetric processing captures inter-slice context that 2D slice-based aggregation misses.
- **Mechanism:** The model utilizes Atlas architecture (multi-scale attention) to process up to 256k tokens per volume ($384 \times 384 \times 384$) efficiently. This allows attention mechanism to model spatial dependencies across full depth of scan, rather than treating slices independently.
- **Core assumption:** Computational efficiency of $O(N \log N)$ attention (Atlas) is sufficient to model global context in large volumes without gradient instability or cost of standard $O(N^2)$ Transformers.
- **Evidence anchors:** Standard ViT-S requires ~38.8s/sample while Atlas requires 0.2s (175x speedup), making full-volume training feasible.

### Mechanism 3: Large frozen LLM provides rich supervision
- **Claim:** Asymmetric contrastive learning with large frozen LLM text encoder produces superior vision embeddings compared to smaller text encoders.
- **Mechanism:** Vision encoder (89M params) is trained to align with frozen 8B parameter text encoder (Qwen3). High capacity of text encoder allows it to capture nuanced clinical semantics in reports, providing richer supervisory signal for vision model.
- **Core assumption:** Quality of vision embedding is bottlenecked by text encoder's ability to parse complex clinical reports.
- **Evidence anchors:** Using Qwen3 (8B) yields near-perfect correlation (-0.947) between pretraining loss and downstream performance, unlike RoBERTa (-0.256).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Hounsfield Units (HU) & Windowing
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding why 8-bit normalization fails requires knowing that CT pixels represent physical density (-1000 to +3000 HU). "Windowing" is mapping of these densities to visible contrast.
  - **Quick check question:** If pixel value is 40 HU (soft tissue) and another is 400 HU (bone), how does standard JPEG conversion (0-255) distort this relationship compared to multi-window approach?

- **Concept:** Vision Transformer (ViT) Complexity
  - **Why needed here:** Paper claims 175x speedup using "Atlas." Need to understand that standard Transformers scale quadratically ($O(N^2)$) with token count to appreciate why processing 256k tokens requires architectural innovation.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does doubling resolution of input volume cause 4x increase in compute for standard ViT, but potentially less for multi-scale/hierarchical architecture?

- **Concept:** Contrastive Learning (CLIP-style)
  - **Why needed here:** Model is pretrained by aligning image and text embeddings. Must grasp how maximizing cosine similarity between paired reports and scans teaches model anatomy without explicit classification labels.
  - **Quick check question:** In batch of 32 scans and 32 reports, how does loss function penalize model if Scan A matches Report B instead of Report A?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** DICOMs -> RAVE engine (compresses/Decompresses using HEVC) -> Isotropic resampling -> Multi-windowing tokenizer -> Atlas backbone (3-stage hierarchical transformer) -> Linear projection head -> Frozen Qwen3 text encoder

- **Critical path:** The Tokenizer is most common point of failure. If windows are misconfigured (e.g., incorrect HU ranges), vision encoder receives garbage data that looks correct visually but lacks mathematical gradients needed for backprop.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Efficiency vs. Context: Authors chose patch size of $6 \times 6 \times 6$ (Abdomen) to manage token counts. This might smooth over micro-structures smaller than 6mm.
  - Single vs. Joint Modality: Paper notes "single-modality pretraining is easier to tune." Trade generality of unified model for stability of modality-specific training runs.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - OOM (Out of Memory): Even with efficient attention, 3D volumes are huge. Gradient accumulation is mandatory.
  - Slow Convergence: If using small text encoder (like BERT) instead of 8B LLM, pretraining loss will not correlate with downstream success.
  - Contrast Loss: If batch size is too small (e.g., <32), contrastive learning struggles due to insufficient negative samples.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Tokenizer Validation: Run multi-windowing tokenizer on sample volume. Visualize output channels to ensure "Lung Window" actually isolates lungs and "Bone Window" isolates bone.
  2. RAVE Throughput Test: Measure data loading pipeline speed. If GPU utilization is <80%, HEVC decompression in RAVE is bottleneck.
  3. Linear Probe Baseline: Freeze pretrained Pillar-0 encoder and train linear classifier on small labeled set (e.g., RSNA Brain Hemorrhage) to verify embeddings are semantically meaningful before full finetuning.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does scaling vision encoder parameters and pretraining data volume beyond current 89M parameter model and 218,000 exams yield consistent performance improvements?
- Basis in paper: Authors state model uses small (89M parameter) vision encoder and limited dataset from single center, noting they "expect that significantly scaling data and model capacity will unlock further model improvements."
- Why unresolved: Current experiments characterize performance at specific scale, but scaling laws for this 3D volumetric architecture relative to data and model size remain undefined.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing performance trajectories on RATE-Evals as parameter counts and dataset sizes are systematically increased.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can incorporating additional supervision sources, such as full report generation or clinical context, improve upon asymmetric contrastive pretraining objective used for Pillar-0?
- Basis in paper: Discussion notes that Pillar-0 "solely relies on contrastive pretraining, omitting many additional sources of supervision, including full report generation and additional clinical context."
- Why unresolved: While contrastive approach proved effective, potential performance gains or representation improvements from multi-modal generative objectives were not tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing current Pillar-0 against variants trained with generative or clinical prediction losses on same downstream tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can RATE evaluation framework be extended to assess model performance on localization, segmentation, and temporal evolution tasks?
- Basis in paper: Authors admit that "RATE does not directly assess localization, segmentation, and temporal evolution, which are critical for many clinical applications."
- Why unresolved: Current RATE framework extracts only binary labels, failing to capture spatial and longitudinal complexity required for comprehensive clinical application.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified RATE framework that successfully extracts spatial coordinates or segmentation masks from reports and correlates them with model outputs.

## Limitations
- Multi-windowing tokenizer configuration details (exact HU ranges) are not fully specified in text
- Pretraining dataset (218,217 exams) is private UCSF data, limiting reproducibility
- RATE framework label extraction accuracy is asserted but not independently validated

## Confidence
**High Confidence (8-10/10):** Architectural innovations (Atlas backbone, multi-windowing tokenizer) are well-specified with sufficient implementation details. Ablation studies directly support superiority of these components over baselines.

**Medium Confidence (6-7/10):** AUROC improvements (7.8-15.8 points) are well-documented across multiple organ systems, but absolute performance depends on private pretraining dataset. External validation results are promising but limited in scope.

**Low Confidence (3-5/10):** Claims about generalization to "novel" tasks are based on zero-shot retrieval experiments without systematic exploration of failure modes. RATE framework's label extraction quality is asserted but not independently verified.

## Next Checks
1. **Multi-windowing Reproducibility Test:** Implement tokenizer using window presets described in Figure 2a/b and validate it produces reported AUROC improvements on held-out subset of Merlin dataset. Visualize output channels to confirm tissue isolation.

2. **Label Extraction Quality Audit:** Sample 100 radiology reports and manually verify RATE framework's extracted labels against radiologist annotations. Quantify precision, recall, and any systematic biases in LLM extraction process.

3. **Pretraining Transfer Experiment:** Train Pillar-0 on subset of publicly available RSNA datasets (n≈20,000-50,000) and measure whether it achieves comparable performance to UCSF-pretrained model on same downstream tasks, establishing dataset dependency of reported advantages.
