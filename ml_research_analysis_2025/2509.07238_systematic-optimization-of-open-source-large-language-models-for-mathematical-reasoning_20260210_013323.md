# Systematic Optimization of Open Source Large Language Models for Mathematical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.07238
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07238
- **Reference count:** 21
- **Primary result:** Achieves 29.4% cost reduction and 23.9% speed improvement in LLM mathematical reasoning while maintaining accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study presents a systematic optimization framework for deploying large language models in mathematical reasoning tasks, addressing the critical trade-offs between computational efficiency, cost, and inference speed in production environments. Through extensive experimentation across five state-of-the-art open-source models and 50 GSM8K benchmark problems, the authors demonstrate that carefully tuned inference parameters can achieve substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing solution accuracy. The framework identifies universal optimization patterns, including the consistent benefits of lower temperature settings and reduced reasoning steps, providing actionable configurations for real-world deployment. DeepSeek-V3 achieved the highest accuracy (98%), while Mixtral-8x22B demonstrated the most cost-effective performance.

## Method Summary
The authors implement a three-phase optimization approach using a multi-agent framework based on the ReAct paradigm. They conduct smart grid search sampling across four inference parameters: temperature (0.1-0.5), maximum reasoning steps (4-12), planning interval (1-4), and nucleus sampling (top-p 0.85-0.98). The optimization objective combines accuracy (40%), efficiency (40%), and speed (20%) through a weighted scoring function. Experiments are performed on 50 GSM8K problems across five models (Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B, DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, Yi-Lightning), with statistical validation using paired t-tests and bootstrap confidence intervals.

## Key Results
- Average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in inference speed while maintaining accuracy
- DeepSeek-V3 achieved highest accuracy (98%) and lowest Cost-of-Pass (114.5 tokens per correct answer)
- Mixtral-8x22B demonstrated most cost-effective performance (361.5 tokens per accurate response)
- Universal optimization patterns identified: lower temperature (0.1-0.4) and reduced reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Lower temperature settings (0.1-0.4) improve mathematical reasoning precision by reducing output variance.
- Mechanism: Temperature controls the sharpness of the probability distribution over tokens. Lower values make the model more deterministic, reducing random deviations in numerical calculations and multi-step reasoning chains.
- Core assumption: Mathematical tasks typically have single correct answers, so reduced randomness correlates with higher precision.
- Evidence anchors: Section 5.4 shows 80% of configurations utilize temperatures ≤0.2; related work (Feng et al., arXiv:2506.09853) discusses causal factors in chain-of-thought reasoning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Constrained reasoning depth (4-6 steps) optimizes the efficiency-accuracy trade-off for most mathematical problems.
- Mechanism: Limiting maximum reasoning steps forces the model to compress solution paths, reducing unnecessary token generation.
- Core assumption: The benchmark problems can be solved within 4-6 steps; longer chains introduce computational overhead without proportional accuracy gains.
- Evidence anchors: Section 5.4 shows 60% of top configurations employ ≤6 reasoning steps; Table 6 shows optimal configurations with Max Steps ranging from 4-10.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-objective optimization with weighted scoring systematically identifies Pareto-efficient parameter configurations.
- Mechanism: The framework defines an objective function f(θ, M) = 0.4×Accuracy + 0.4×Efficiency + 0.2×Speed, enabling trade-off analysis across competing goals.
- Core assumption: The chosen weights (α=0.4, β=0.4, γ=0.2) reflect production deployment priorities and generalize across use cases.
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.4 states weights were determined through preliminary experiments; Section 5.1 reports 100% optimization success rate across all 5 models.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Temperature and Nucleus Sampling (Top-p)**
  - Why needed here: These parameters directly control output diversity vs. determinism, which is central to the paper's optimization strategy.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why temperature=0.1 produces more deterministic outputs than temperature=0.8?

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The "reasoning steps" parameter constrains CoT length; understanding CoT is prerequisite to evaluating whether step limits harm reasoning.
  - Quick check question: How does limiting reasoning steps to 4-6 affect problems that typically require 8+ intermediate calculations?

- **Concept: Pareto Efficiency and Multi-Objective Optimization**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames optimization as balancing accuracy, cost, and speed; practitioners must understand trade-off frontiers.
  - Quick check question: If you prioritize accuracy above all else, would Mixtral-8x22B or DeepSeek-V3 be your choice, and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** BaseAgent -> ModelManager -> ReActAgent -> AdaptivePlanner -> CostTracker -> Objective function evaluation

- **Critical path:** Dataset → ModelManager (load model) → ReActAgent (execute reasoning with parameters θ) → CostTracker (measure) → Objective function evaluation → Smart grid search iteration → Optimal θ* selection

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Exhaustive grid search (300 combinations) vs. smart sampling (8 configurations): Paper chooses latter for efficiency but may miss global optima
  - Simulation-based evaluation vs. actual inference: Paper uses simulations (Section 3.5 note); production validation recommended
  - Unified weights across models vs. model-specific weighting: Paper uses fixed weights; different models may benefit from re-weighting

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy drops below baseline when temperature too low for creative problems
  - Timeout/truncation when max steps insufficient for complex problems
  - High variance across runs suggests temperature or top-p too high
  - "Cost-of-Pass" metric increases despite optimization → check if accuracy degraded

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline reproduction:** Run default configurations on 10 GSM8K problems per model, record accuracy and token usage. Compare against paper's baseline values (~77.8% accuracy, 565 tokens avg).
  2. **Temperature sweep validation:** For DeepSeek-V3, test temperatures [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] with other parameters fixed at paper's optimal values (steps=6, top-p=0.98). Verify if 0.2-0.3 range yields best accuracy.
  3. **Cross-benchmark generalization:** Apply discovered optimal configurations to a different math dataset (e.g., MATH benchmark subset) to test if patterns transfer beyond GSM8K.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can dynamic parameter adaptation systems automatically adjust inference settings based on problem complexity to achieve greater efficiency than static configurations?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.3 identifies "Dynamic Parameter Adaptation" as a future direction to adjust parameters for different problem contexts.
- Why unresolved: The current study establishes static optimal configurations; it does not implement or test real-time, context-aware adjustment mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative benchmarks showing that complexity-aware dynamic tuners outperform the paper's static optimal configurations on datasets with variable difficulty.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does multi-model ensemble optimization allow for combining complementary strengths (e.g., DeepSeek-V3's accuracy with Yi-Lightning's speed) to outperform single-model deployments?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.3 proposes "Multi-Model Ensemble Optimization" to leverage complementary model strengths.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluated models in isolation; it did not assess collaborative inference or routing frameworks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments deploying a router that selects between the optimized DeepSeek and Yi models based on query constraints, showing superior aggregate performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the discovered universal optimization patterns (low temperature, reduced reasoning steps) generalize effectively to specialized reasoning domains outside of mathematics?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.3 recommends "Domain-Specific Extension" to verify if the methodology yields similar improvements in other fields.
- Why unresolved: The framework was validated solely on mathematical reasoning; applicability to logic, coding, or legal reasoning remains unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the optimization framework on non-mathematical benchmarks (e.g., logical entailment or code generation) to observe if efficiency gains persist.

## Limitations

- **Dataset Scope:** The study evaluates optimization on only 50 GSM8K problems, which may not represent the full diversity of mathematical reasoning tasks, particularly complex or advanced mathematical domains.
- **Model Representation:** The optimization framework tests five prominent models but does not cover smaller architectures or models specifically fine-tuned for mathematical reasoning, limiting generalizability.
- **Single Benchmark Dependency:** All optimization is performed on GSM8K with no cross-validation on alternative mathematical reasoning datasets, raising questions about pattern transferability.

## Confidence

**High Confidence (Mechanism 1 - Temperature Control):** The relationship between temperature and deterministic output quality is well-established in the literature. The paper's finding that 0.1-0.4 temperatures improve mathematical precision aligns with theoretical expectations about temperature controlling output variance.

**Medium Confidence (Mechanism 2 - Step Limitation):** While the paper demonstrates efficiency gains with 4-6 reasoning steps, the GSM8K dataset may not include sufficiently complex problems to test the upper bounds of this claim.

**Medium Confidence (Mechanism 3 - Multi-Objective Optimization):** The systematic approach to balancing accuracy, cost, and speed is methodologically sound, but the specific weightings (0.4, 0.4, 0.2) are heuristic choices rather than theoretically derived values.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Benchmark Generalization Test:** Apply the discovered optimal configurations to 50 problems from the MATH benchmark and compare performance retention to verify if temperature and step constraints maintain effectiveness on more challenging problems.

2. **Long-Running Inference Stability:** Execute the top 3 configurations per model for 100 consecutive runs on identical problems to quantify variance in accuracy and cost metrics, addressing the lack of information about result stability across repeated executions.

3. **Complexity-Dependent Parameter Adaptation:** Implement a simple adaptive mechanism that increases reasoning steps based on problem complexity indicators to test whether this improves accuracy on complex problems without significantly increasing cost on simple ones.
