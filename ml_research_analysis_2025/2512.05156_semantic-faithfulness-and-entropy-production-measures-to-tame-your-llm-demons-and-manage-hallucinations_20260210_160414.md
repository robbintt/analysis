# Semantic Faithfulness and Entropyfulness and Entropy Production Measures to Tame Your LLM Demons and Manage Hallucinations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05156
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05156
- Authors: Igor Halperin
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: SF and SEP metrics capture distinct aspects of semantic faithfulness, with SF detecting subtle hallucinations missed by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two unsupervised metrics—Semantic Faithfulness (SF) and Semantic Entropy Production (SEP)—to evaluate the faithfulness of LLM-generated answers to given contexts. The approach models Question-Context-Answer triplets as probability distributions over shared topics, with topic transformations represented as transition matrices. SF measures the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these matrices, capturing semantic alignment between question intent and answer content. SEP quantifies thermodynamic irreversibility in answer generation. Experiments on NVIDIA 10-K filings demonstrate that SF and SEP are related but capture distinct aspects of semantic faithfulness.

## Method Summary
The method embeds sentences using Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B, clusters embeddings into 23 topics using Upper-Bounded Deterministic Information Bottleneck (UDIB), and computes marginal probability distributions for Q, C, and A. SF is calculated via Alternating Minimization to find minimal KL divergence between transition matrices, while SEP is computed through dual maximization representing lower-bound thermodynamic irreversibility. Both metrics are derived through convex optimization procedures implemented in Algorithms 1 and 2.

## Key Results
- SF and SEP metrics capture distinct aspects of semantic faithfulness
- SF effectively detects subtle hallucinations missed by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation
- Metrics computed via convex optimization demonstrate mathematical soundness
- Validation performed on NVIDIA fiscal 2024 10-K Risk Factors section with 10 generated answers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by modeling the semantic relationship between questions, contexts, and answers as probabilistic transformations over shared topic spaces. By representing each element as a distribution over topics and measuring the divergence between transformation matrices, the metrics capture how faithfully the answer preserves the semantic intent of the question while incorporating context information. The thermodynamic interpretation of SEP provides additional insight into the irreversibility of the generation process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Topic Modeling via UDIB**: Why needed - To create shared semantic spaces for Q, C, A comparison. Quick check - Verify topic distributions sum to 1 and capture meaningful semantic groupings.
- **KL Divergence in Topic Space**: Why needed - To measure semantic misalignment between question intent and answer content. Quick check - Ensure divergence values are non-negative and sensitive to semantic shifts.
- **Convex Optimization for Metric Computation**: Why needed - To solve for optimal transition matrices that minimize divergence or entropy production. Quick check - Monitor monotonic decrease in objective function during optimization.
- **Sentence Embedding Integration**: Why needed - To convert text into numerical representations suitable for clustering and probability estimation. Quick check - Validate embedding quality through downstream clustering coherence.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B -> UDIB Clustering -> Probability Distribution Calculation -> SF/SEP Optimization
**Critical Path**: Embedding → Topic Modeling → Distribution Derivation → Metric Optimization
**Design Tradeoffs**: Fixed topic count (N=23) vs. adaptive determination; embedding model choice affects semantic capture; optimization convergence vs. computational cost
**Failure Signatures**: Non-convergence in alternating minimization; zero-division in log calculations; poor topic separation indicating embedding issues
**First Experiments**: 1) Test embedding quality on sample sentences before clustering 2) Verify topic distributions normalize correctly 3) Run optimization on synthetic data with known divergence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do SF and SEP metrics perform on larger, more diverse datasets beyond the financial domain?
- How do different LLM architectures, training objectives, and parameter scales influence semantic faithfulness and entropy production?
- Can the framework be effectively adapted for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems?
- How sensitive is the Semantic Faithfulness score to the choice of sentence embedding model and topic cluster count?

## Limitations
- UDIB clustering method implementation details not fully specified, requiring reference to another preprint
- Experimental validation limited to single source document (NVIDIA 10-K) with only 10 questions
- No computational complexity or runtime analysis provided for optimization procedures
- Thermodynamic interpretation of SEP lacks empirical grounding beyond mathematical derivation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical derivation of SF and SEP as divergence and entropy measures is internally consistent
- **Medium Confidence**: Relationship between SF and SEP capturing distinct faithfulness aspects supported by limited case study
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about detecting subtle hallucinations cannot be fully verified without ground truth answer quality assessments

## Next Checks
1. Implement UDIB clustering algorithm from cited preprint and verify consistent topic distribution derivation across document types
2. Conduct ablation studies varying topic count N and embedding models to test SF/SEP robustness
3. Compare SF and SEP against established faithfulness metrics on diverse dataset including known hallucination cases
