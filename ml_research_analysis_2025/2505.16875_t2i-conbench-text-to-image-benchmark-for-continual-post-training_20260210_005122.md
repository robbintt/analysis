# T2I-ConBench: Text-to-Image Benchmark for Continual Post-training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.16875
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16875
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: First unified benchmark for continual post-training of text-to-image models, revealing no single method excels in all evaluation dimensions.

## Executive Summary
T2I-ConBench is the first unified benchmark for continual post-training of text-to-image models, addressing the gap in standardized evaluation for sequential adaptation across tasks. It evaluates two practical scenarios—item customization and domain enhancement—across four dimensions: generality retention, target-task performance, catastrophic forgetting, and cross-task generalization. The benchmark employs automated metrics, human-preference modeling, and vision-language QA for comprehensive assessment. Experiments across three task sequences with ten representative methods reveal that no single approach excels in all aspects, that even joint oracle training fails to master every task, and that cross-task generalization remains an open challenge. The study underscores the need for advanced methods that balance stability and plasticity while enabling knowledge recombination across domains. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are released to accelerate research.

## Method Summary
T2I-ConBench evaluates continual post-training of text-to-image diffusion models across two scenarios: item customization (learning personalized objects like sneakers and pets) and domain enhancement (improving quality in specific domains like nature or human poses). The benchmark fixes base models (PixArt-α and SD v1.4) and uses curated real and synthetic datasets. Ten baselines—including sequential fine-tuning, LoRA variants, replay, and regularization methods—are evaluated on four dimensions: retention of generality (FID, CompBench), target-task performance (Unique-Sim, HPS), catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer), and cross-task generalization (VQA on compositional prompts). Automated evaluation pipelines enable scalable, reproducible assessment.

## Key Results
- No single continual learning method excels across all evaluation dimensions; each shows distinct trade-offs.
- Even joint oracle training fails to master every task under imbalanced data streams, with large domain datasets dominating few-shot item tasks.
- Cross-task compositional generalization remains an open challenge, with few methods matching the oracle’s ability to recombine concepts from different tasks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-dimensional Evaluation Isolates Method Trade-offs
- Claim: A unified benchmark combining retention, target performance, forgetting, and cross-task generalization reveals method-specific strengths and weaknesses that single-metric evaluations miss.
- Mechanism: T2I-ConBench fixes base models and datasets, then measures four distinct axes—pretrain preservation (FID, CompBench), downstream performance (Unique-Sim, HPS), forgetting (backward transfer), and cross-task generalization (VQA on compositional prompts). This multi-axis design prevents methods from optimizing one metric at the expense of others.
- Core assumption: The four measured dimensions are representative of the key trade-offs in continual post-training, and improvements in one should not catastrophically degrade others.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "analyzes four dimensions: (1) retention of generality, (2) target-task performance, (3) catastrophic forgetting, and (4) cross-task generalization"
  - [section 6.5] "no single method excels everywhere... LoRA variants indeed minimize forgetting, it severely degrades performance on item customization"
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper MLLM-CBench adopts a similar multi-dimensional approach for multimodal LLMs, reinforcing the design pattern.
- Break condition: If methods begin to overfit to the specific metrics or prompts in the benchmark, or if the four dimensions fail to capture critical real-world failure modes (e.g., subtle bias shifts), the mechanism's diagnostic power would degrade.

### Mechanism 2: Task Granularity and Order Expose Data Imbalance Effects
- Claim: Mixing fine-grained item customization with broader domain enhancement in different sequences reveals how data scale and granularity affect continual learning strategies.
- Mechanism: The benchmark includes two scenarios (item customization, domain enhancement) and tests multiple task orders (e.g., items→domains vs. domains→items). This design exposes how methods cope when one task's dataset dominates (e.g., large domain data swamping small item data), showing that even "oracle" joint training can fail under imbalance.
- Core assumption: The chosen item and domain tasks are representative of realistic post-training demands, and the synthetic data for domains (filtered from FLUX outputs) adequately simulates real distribution shifts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "Item Customization and Domain Enhancement differ in granularity and learning objectives"
  - [section 6.4] "Because the item and domain datasets differ substantially in size and quality, this imbalance will induce a pronounced effect on continual learning"
  - [corpus] Bisecle notes continual learning challenges with evolving video-language data streams, reinforcing the importance of task order.
- Break condition: If the synthetic domain data fails to capture real-world complexity, or if the item customization tasks are too narrow to generalize findings, the observed imbalance effects may not transfer to production settings.

### Mechanism 3: Automated VQA-based Compositional Testing Scales Cross-Task Assessment
- Claim: Decomposing compositional prompts into VQA questions with LLM-generated sub-questions enables scalable, interpretable evaluation of concept recombination across tasks.
- Mechanism: For cross-task generalization, an LLM decomposes each compositional prompt (e.g., "V3 cat playing with V4 sneaker") into 2–4 binary VQA questions covering objects and relations. A VLM (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) scores each image-question pair, and the overall score is the fraction of "yes" answers. This automates evaluation that would otherwise require costly human judgment.
- Core assumption: The VLM's "yes/no" judgments align with human assessments of compositional correctness, and the LLM-generated sub-questions cover all relevant aspects of each prompt.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "We generate prompts that merge concepts from different tasks... we also score cross-task performance using a VQA pipeline"
  - [appendix E] "The overall cross-task score for a test set is the fraction of 'yes' responses across all N image–question pairs"
  - [corpus] Evidence is weak; neighbor papers focus on other modalities or do not use VQA for compositional evaluation in T2I.
- Break condition: If the VLM systematically misjudges certain concept combinations, or if the LLM decomposition misses critical relational aspects, the metric would not accurately reflect true compositional generalization.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting in generative models
  - Why needed here: The entire benchmark is designed to measure and mitigate forgetting when sequentially adapting a T2I model to new tasks.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why naive sequential fine-tuning causes a model to lose its ability to generate previously learned concepts?

- Concept: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for diffusion models
  - Why needed here: Multiple baselines (SeqLoRA, IncLoRA, O-LoRA, C-LoRA) use LoRA variants, and understanding their trade-offs is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: How does LoRA reduce parameter updates compared to full fine-tuning, and what are the potential failure modes in continual learning?

- Concept: VQA-based evaluation for generative models
  - Why needed here: Cross-task generalization is measured via a VQA pipeline, which converts compositional prompts into yes/no questions for automated scoring.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and limitations of using VLM-based VQA for evaluating compositional image generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The benchmark has four main components: (1) Task sequences (item customization, domain enhancement, mixed orders); (2) Curated datasets (real images for items, synthetic FLUX-generated images for domains, filtered to 2.5k–2.5k samples); (3) Automated evaluation pipeline (FID, CompBench, HPS, VQA); (4) Metric suite (pretrain preservation, downstream performance, forgetting, cross-task generalization). All components are decoupled via model-agnostic interfaces.

- Critical path: Start by setting up the base model (PixArt-α or SD v1.4), then load the task datasets in the specified order. Run the chosen continual post-training method (e.g., Replay, EWC, LoRA variant) sequentially. After each task, evaluate all metrics using the automated pipeline. The most time-consuming step is the cross-task VQA evaluation, which requires LLM decomposition and VLM inference.

- Design tradeoffs: The benchmark fixes the base model and datasets to isolate the effect of continual learning methods, but this may underrepresent variations in data quality or model architecture. The use of synthetic domain data (from FLUX) enables controlled experiments but may inherit FLUX's biases. The VQA-based cross-task evaluation is scalable but depends on VLM reliability.

- Failure signatures: (1) LoRA variants show near-zero Unique-Sim after the first task in item customization (N/A in tables), indicating subspace collapse; (2) Joint training fails on imbalanced streams, dominated by larger domain datasets; (3) Replay's effectiveness varies by architecture (works on SD v1.4 but fails on PixArt-α when items come second).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run SeqFT (sequential fine-tuning) on the Sequential Item Customization task to establish a forgetting baseline.
  2. Compare SeqLoRA and IncLoRA on the same task to observe the difference between shared and independent adapters.
  3. Test Replay on the Sequential Item-Domain Adaptation task in both orders (items→domains vs. domains→items) to quantify the impact of data imbalance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How can continual post-training methods be designed to explicitly preserve the representational flexibility required for cross-task compositional generalization?
  - **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors state in the Conclusion that "Cross-task generalization remains an open challenge" and that few methods match the oracle’s ability to "seamlessly recombine prior and newly acquired knowledge."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current baselines alleviate catastrophic forgetting of specific tasks but fail to maintain the zero-shot compositional capabilities inherent in the pretrained model when concepts from different tasks (e.g., Item+Domain) must be combined.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A method that achieves parity with the "Joint" training baseline on cross-task metrics (Item+Item, Item+Domain) without accessing rehearsal data from previous tasks.

- **Question:** How can joint "oracle" training be adapted to prevent the overfitting to majority domains that causes it to fail on minority few-shot item tasks?
  - **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] Section 6.4 notes that under imbalanced tasks, Joint training is "Dominated by the larger domain dataset" and "fails to learn the fine-grained personalized generation required for items."
  - **Why unresolved:** Treating Joint training as an upper bound is standard in continual learning, but this paper shows it fails in mixed-granularity scenarios, suggesting standard multi-task optimization is insufficient for imbalanced generative data.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A multi-task training strategy that balances domain-scale and item-scale data, resulting in "Joint" performance that exceeds sequential baselines on Unique-Sim metrics.

- **Question:** Do the observed failures of parameter-isolation methods (like LoRA) in item customization generalize to autoregressive text-to-image architectures?
  - **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] The authors acknowledge in the Limitations section that they "focus exclusively on diffusion architectures and omit... autoregressive generative models," whose different inductive biases could alter the efficacy of continual learning methods.
  - **Why unresolved:** The benchmark shows LoRA variants struggle with constrained update subspaces in diffusion models, but it remains unknown if autoregressive models would suffer similar interference or forgetting due to their distinct training regimes.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking the same ten baselines (e.g., SeqLoRA, Replay) on an autoregressive base model using the T2I-ConBench protocols to compare forgetting dynamics.

## Limitations
- VQA-based cross-task evaluation relies on LLM-generated question decomposition and VLM scoring, but the robustness of this pipeline to concept complexity and relation types remains uncertain.
- Synthetic domain data (generated via FLUX_dev) may not fully capture real-world distribution shifts, limiting external validity.
- Benchmark results depend on fixed task orders and datasets; findings may not generalize to more complex or overlapping task streams.

## Confidence
- High: Multi-dimensional evaluation design effectively isolates method trade-offs; sequential LoRA variants show catastrophic forgetting under subspace collapse.
- Medium: Task order effects and data imbalance are representative of real-world scenarios; synthetic domain data adequately simulates distribution shifts.
- Low: VQA-based cross-task generalization reliably measures compositional concept recombination; LoRA failure modes transfer across model architectures.

## Next Checks
1. **VQA Pipeline Validation**: Manually annotate a subset of cross-task compositional prompts and compare human vs. VLM scores to quantify measurement error.
2. **Synthetic Data Fidelity**: Replace synthetic domain images with real-world domain datasets (e.g., outdoor scenes) and rerun key experiments to test robustness to data source.
3. **Architecture Generalization**: Replicate the main experiment on a third base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion XL) to confirm LoRA failure modes and replay effectiveness are not model-specific.
