# Alignment among Language, Vision and Action Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22948
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22948
- Reference count: 1
- Action-grounded language embeddings align strongly with decoder-only LLMs and BLIP (P@15: 0.70-0.73)

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether representations learned through different modalities—language, vision, and action—converge toward shared semantic structures. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, a transformer-based agent was trained to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions, generating action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, robust cross-modal alignment was observed, with action representations aligning strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves.

## Method Summary
Behavioral cloning was used on the BabyAI platform to train a transformer agent to map (observation, instruction) pairs to actions. The agent used identity-initialized word embeddings to ensure representations were shaped purely by action-learning requirements. Visual inputs were processed through a hybrid ResNet CNN (2 pre-trained + 2 untrained layers). Cross-modal integration was achieved via language-attends-to-vision attention. After training, 128-dimensional language embeddings were extracted for 108 instructions and compared with embeddings from LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and VLMs (CLIP, BLIP) using precision@k and Procrustes analysis.

## Key Results
- Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only LLMs and BLIP (P@15: 0.70-0.73)
- Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker (P@15: ~0.30-0.35)
- Even at P@1, alignment exceeded random baseline by an order of magnitude
- Despite different training data and objectives, representations converged toward partially shared semantic structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Representations trained on different modalities and objectives converge toward shared semantic geometries.
- Mechanism: The statistical structure of language encodes information about physical and functional world properties; models optimizing different objectives (next-token prediction, image-text alignment, action generation) extract overlapping regularities from this structure, producing aligned embedding spaces despite no shared training data.
- Core assumption: The 108 BabyAI instructions sufficiently sample semantic structure to reveal cross-modal alignment patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment."
  - [section 3, results] "The alignment between the ALM and the decoder-only LLMs (Llama, Qwen and Deepseek) is relatively high, ranging from 0.70 to 0.73."
  - [corpus] "Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels" confirms vision-only and language-only models project inputs into partially aligned representational space despite disjoint training modalities.
- Break condition: Alignment degrades significantly when instructions exceed training distribution vocabulary or require novel compositional reasoning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Decoder-only language models and generative VLMs (BLIP) achieve stronger alignment with action representations than encoder-only models (BERT) or contrastive-only VLMs (CLIP).
- Mechanism: Decoder-only models trained on generative objectives develop richer action-predictive representations because next-token prediction implicitly encodes sequential dependencies and causal structure. BLIP's generative component provides similar benefits, while CLIP's contrastive objective optimizes for static image-text association rather than sequential reasoning.
- Core assumption: Generative training objectives induce action-relevant structure absent in contrastive objectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3, figure 3] "The alignment between the ALM and the CLIP VSL and the BERT encoder-only LLM is substantially lower."
  - [section 2.4] "BLIP is designed to perform a broader range of tasks, including image-text retrieval, caption generation, and visual question answering... employing a unified encoder-decoder architecture."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence comparing generative vs. contrastive alignment with action representations.
- Break condition: If tested on continuous motor control or longer-horizon tasks, the generative advantage may diminish or invert.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Language embeddings shaped purely through sensorimotor control requirements naturally align with text-only LLM representations.
- Mechanism: Initializing word embeddings as identical vectors and training exclusively via behavioral cloning forces the embedding space to organize according to action-relevant semantics (what instructions require similar motor sequences). This pragmatic organization mirrors the functional semantics emergent in LLMs trained on next-token prediction over action-descriptive text.
- Core assumption: Action-conditional training with random environment initialization produces sufficiently diverse action contexts to generalize semantics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "In our model, the embedding vectors of words token are initialized as identity vectors... ensuring that the embeddings representing both individual words and the overall language request are shaped entirely through action learning."
  - [section 3] "Even in the P@1 condition, in which the two spaces must share the same nearest neighbor, the observed alignment is an order of magnitude higher than that of the random baseline."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for identity-initialized embeddings; mechanism is paper-specific.
- Break condition: Alignment fails if behavioral cloning demonstrations are insufficiently diverse or if environment dynamics don't require semantic differentiation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Behavioral Cloning**
  - Why needed here: The action model learns by imitating expert demonstrations mapping (observation, instruction) pairs to actions, not through reward signals.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how behavioral cloning differs from reinforcement learning in terms of supervision signal?

- Concept: **Cross-Attention Mechanisms**
  - Why needed here: The architecture uses Language-Attends-to-Vision cross-attention to integrate multimodal representations before action prediction.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-attention differ from self-attention in terms of query/key/value sources?

- Concept: **Precision@k and Procrustes Analysis**
  - Why needed here: These are the two primary metrics for quantifying embedding space alignment across models.
  - Quick check question: What does P@k measure, and why is Procrustes analysis needed as a complementary metric?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Language instruction → token embeddings → transformer → E_L (128d) → cross-attention with E_V → residual MLP → action prediction

- Critical path: Language instruction → token embeddings → transformer → E_L (128d) → cross-attention with E_V → residual MLP → action prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pre-trained vs. random visual encoder: Paper uses hybrid (2 pre-trained + 2 random layers)
  - Identity vs. pre-trained word embeddings: Paper chooses identity to isolate action-grounding effects
  - Sentence-level vs. token-level language representation: Paper uses sentence pooling for comparison simplicity

- Failure signatures:
  - Low P@k alignment with random baseline (~0.13 at k=15) indicates broken embedding extraction
  - Task success below 80% suggests insufficient training epochs or demonstration diversity
  - High variance across random seeds indicates unstable convergence

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate behavioral cloning training with 5 different seeds; verify task success rates match paper (85-95%)
  2. Extract embeddings from trained ALM and compute P@15 alignment with a single reference LLM (e.g., LLaMA) to validate pipeline
  3. Ablate the identity initialization by replacing with pre-trained word embeddings; measure alignment difference to isolate grounding contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do these alignment effects generalize to more complex environments with continuous action spaces and richer linguistic diversity?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The authors state that future work should investigate generalization to "more complex environments, richer linguistic inputs, continuous action spaces, and alternative learning paradigms."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study is restricted to the simplified BabyAI platform, which uses discrete actions and a closed vocabulary of only 108 instructions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Replicating the alignment analysis using a robotic simulation (e.g., MuJoCo) or real-world robot data involving continuous motor control and natural language commands.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does geometric similarity in embedding spaces imply functional equivalence or shared causal grounding?
- **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] The Discussion acknowledges that the "alignment analyses rely on geometric similarity measures that capture relational structure but do not directly assess functional equivalence or causal grounding."
- **Why unresolved:** High cosine similarity or Procrustes alignment indicates structural correlation, but it does not prove that the models process or "understand" the semantic content in the same way during task execution.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Intervention studies where specific dimensions of the aligned embedding spaces are manipulated to test if they produce identical changes in behavioral output across modalities.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can explicitly leveraging these cross-modal correspondences improve the grounding and adaptability of multimodal agents?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The Conclusion asks whether "explicitly leveraging these cross-modal correspondences can improve the grounding and adaptability of multimodal agents."
- **Why unresolved:** The study focused on measuring the existence and degree of alignment post-hoc, rather than utilizing the aligned representations to initialize or augment the training of the behavioral agent.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstrating that pre-training or initializing the action-language model (ALM) with weights from aligned LLMs results in faster convergence or better generalization in downstream embodied tasks.

## Limitations
- Sample size constraint: Only 108 unique instructions from a closed 16-word vocabulary limits generalizability to richer semantic domains.
- Architectural specificity: Identity-initialized word embeddings create highly specialized representation spaces that may not generalize to conventional initialization schemes.
- Modality pairing asymmetry: Action-to-language alignment is reported but reverse language-to-action alignment is not, leaving uncertainty about bidirectional alignment.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The observed alignment between action-grounded embeddings and decoder-only LLMs (P@15: 0.70-0.73) is robust across multiple model families and significantly exceeds random baseline.
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism explaining why generative models align better than contrastive models is plausible but under-supported by direct evidence.
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to more complex instruction sets, continuous action spaces, or real-world robotics applications remains untested.

## Next Checks
1. **Vocabulary expansion test**: Systematically increase instruction complexity by expanding vocabulary beyond 16 words and measuring alignment decay rates to identify the semantic complexity threshold where alignment breaks down.

2. **Bidirectional alignment verification**: Compute both action-to-language and language-to-action Precision@k scores to establish whether alignment is symmetric or asymmetric, and test whether Procrustes alignment improves with orthogonal transformations.

3. **Cross-task generalization**: Train ALMs on multiple BabyAI tasks simultaneously and measure whether task-specific alignment patterns emerge (e.g., stronger alignment for navigation-related instructions versus manipulation tasks).
