# Self-Supervised Learning at the Edge: The Cost of Labeling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.07033
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07033
- **Reference count**: 0
- **One-line primary result**: Semi-supervised contrastive learning achieves near-supervised accuracy with significantly reduced total energy by minimizing labeling overhead

## Executive Summary
This work evaluates energy consumption in supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised contrastive learning for edge deployment. It introduces a framework that accounts for both training and labeling energy costs, which are often neglected. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and EuroSAT datasets show that supervised contrastive learning (SupCon) achieves highest accuracy but requires up to 4× more total energy than self-supervised SimCLR due to labeling overhead. Semi-supervised approaches like CCSSL offer a favorable trade-off, delivering near-supervised accuracy with significantly reduced energy, especially in low-data regimes. The findings highlight that semi-supervised learning is a more sustainable choice for energy-constrained edge scenarios.

## Method Summary
The paper compares energy consumption across supervised (SupCon), self-supervised (SimCLR), and semi-supervised (CCSSL) contrastive learning methods. Energy is measured using CodeCarbon to track CPU, GPU, and RAM consumption during training, with labeling energy estimated separately based on annotation time and workstation power. Experiments use ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 and EuroSAT with varying data availability regimes (20%, 50%, 100%). Accuracy is measured via kNN evaluation protocol, and total energy includes both training and labeling costs.

## Key Results
- SupCon achieves highest accuracy but requires up to 4× more total energy than SimCLR due to labeling overhead
- CCSSL offers a favorable trade-off, delivering near-supervised accuracy with significantly reduced energy, especially in low-data regimes
- Total energy accounting reveals that labeling may consume twice the energy used for training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Total Energy Accounting Framework
Including labeling energy in total cost analysis reveals that supervised methods consume significantly more total energy than training-only metrics suggest. The framework uses E_total = E_training + E_labeling, where labeling energy is estimated as E_labeling = P_energy × K × T_label / 3600.

### Mechanism 2: Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning as Efficiency Bridge
Semi-supervised CL methods like CCSSL achieve near-supervised accuracy while substantially reducing total energy by requiring fewer labeled samples. CCSSL leverages a labeled subset to guide representation learning while using confidence-based pseudo-labeling for unlabeled data.

### Mechanism 3: Data Regime-Dependent Efficiency Patterns
Energy-performance trade-offs shift dramatically across data availability regimes. With limited training data, semi-supervised methods leverage unlabeled data for representation learning without incurring full labeling costs, making them relatively more efficient in data-scarce edge scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning (InfoNCE Loss)**
  - Why needed here: All compared methods use contrastive objectives. Understanding how positive/negative pairs are constructed is essential for interpreting energy-accuracy trade-offs.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how SupCon modifies the positive set P(i) compared to SimCLR, and why this affects label dependency?

- **Concept: Energy Measurement Methodologies (RAPL, pynvml)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's claims depend on accurate energy attribution across CPU, GPU, and RAM. Understanding measurement limitations prevents overconfident conclusions.
  - Quick check question: What are the sampling interval and potential blind spots when using 15-second polling for energy measurement?

- **Concept: kNN Evaluation Protocol**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses kNN accuracy as a non-parametric probe of representation quality rather than linear probing or fine-tuning, which affects generalizability claims.
  - Quick check question: Why might kNN evaluation under- or over-estimate representation quality compared to linear probing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: ResNet-18 backbone -> Contrastive Head -> Labeling Energy Module -> Training Energy Tracker -> Supervision Adapter
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Define data regime and label fraction for semi-supervised variants
  2. Configure temperature τ (0.1 for SimCLR/CCSSL, 0.5 for SupCon)
  3. Run 1,000 epochs with LR decay at 700/800/900
  4. Log component-level energy via CodeCarbon throughout
  5. Compute E_labeling separately based on labeled sample count and domain-specific T_label
  6. Evaluate via kNN protocol on test set
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - SupCon vs SimCLR: +3-4% accuracy at 4× total energy (labeling dominates)
  - CCSSL label fraction: 10% labels → 1.4× SimCLR energy; 50% labels → 2.4× SimCLR energy
  - Dataset choice: EuroSAT shows different energy profiles due to image size and sample count
  - Hardware target: Mid-range setup (GTX 1660 Ti, 6GB RAM) used—edge deployment may face tighter constraints
- **Failure signatures**:
  - CCSSL non-convergence: Hybrid SimCLR/SupCon approach failed to converge
  - High variance in low-data regimes: Accuracy variance may be higher
  - Labeling time underestimation: Complex domains may have T_label >> 10 seconds
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline replication: Train baseline, SimCLR, and SupCon on CIFAR-10 at 50% data with CodeCarbon logging
  2. Labeling sensitivity analysis: Vary T_label and compute E_labeling; plot total energy vs accuracy for each method
  3. CCSSL label fraction sweep: Train CCSSL with 10%, 25%, 50% labeled data on EuroSAT

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How do energy-performance trade-offs shift in distributed learning settings, particularly when data labeling is unbalanced across nodes? (explicit in conclusion)
- **Open Question 2**: How does the complexity of the annotation task impact the calculated energy trade-offs between supervised and semi-supervised methods? (inferred from labeling time assumptions)
- **Open Question 3**: Do the observed advantages of semi-supervised learning persist when deploying on actual resource-constrained edge hardware? (inferred from mid-range desktop simulation)

## Limitations
- Energy accounting framework assumes fixed 10-second annotation time and 30W workstation power, which may not generalize to complex domains
- CodeCarbon-based hardware energy measurements have inherent variability across different systems
- Analysis focuses on CIFAR-10 and EuroSAT, limiting generalizability to more complex datasets or real-world edge deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Total energy accounting framework; accuracy-energy trade-offs for SimCLR vs SupCon; CCSSL's improved efficiency at higher label fractions
- **Medium Confidence**: Semi-supervised performance across different data regimes; labeling energy estimates for non-image domains
- **Low Confidence**: Absolute energy values for edge devices; scalability to larger/more complex datasets

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to a complex domain (e.g., medical imaging) with measured annotation times to validate labeling energy estimates
2. Measure actual energy consumption on representative edge hardware (e.g., Jetson Xavier) to verify training energy assumptions
3. Conduct experiments with varying batch sizes and optimizer configurations to determine sensitivity of energy-accuracy trade-offs to implementation details
