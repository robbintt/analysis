# Domain Expansion: Parameter-Efficient Modules as Building Blocks for Composite Domains

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14321
- Reference count: 6
- This work proposes a novel approach to represent MBTI personalities using parameter-efficient modules (PEMs)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for representing MBTI personalities by composing parameter-efficient modules (PEMs) trained on individual personality traits. The approach uses LoRA and IA3 fine-tuning to create trait-specific PEMs from synthetic data generated by ChatGPT-4, then composes these modules through weighted parameter summation to represent all 16 MBTI personalities without additional fine-tuning. The composed personality PEMs are evaluated via an online MBTI personality quiz, demonstrating that most personalities align correctly with their target traits.

## Method Summary
The method trains eight trait-specific PEMs (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) using LoRA and IA3 fine-tuning on synthetic datasets generated by ChatGPT-4 (154 samples per trait). These trait PEMs are then composed via weighted parameter summation (ΘP = Σλi·θTi) to create personality PEMs representing all 16 MBTI types. Evaluation is performed through an automated pipeline that runs the 60-question 16Personalities quiz, with alignment scores determined by trait scores exceeding 50%.

## Key Results
- LoRA and IA3 PEMs outperform baseline BERT model for individual trait classification (>50% alignment vs ~50% baseline)
- Composed personality PEMs correctly align with target personalities in most cases (13/16 for LoRA, 12/16 for IA3)
- Only rare misalignments occur, with 3/16 LoRA and 4/16 IA3 personalities showing single-trait misalignments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LoRA and IA3 adapter modules can encode trait-specific behaviors that outperform non-adapted baselines on personality-aligned responses. LoRA injects low-rank matrices B and A into transformer layers (h ← h + BAx), updating only ~1-5% of parameters while freezing the base PLM. IA3 applies learnable scaling vectors (l_k, l_v, l_ff) to key/value projections and feed-forward activations. Both methods modify information flow without altering pretrained weights. Core assumption: Traits can be learned as independent behavioral patterns that don't require full model fine-tuning to capture.

### Mechanism 2
Composing trait PEMs via weighted parameter summation yields personality PEMs that reflect combined trait characteristics without additional fine-tuning. Given 4 trait PEMs (one per dichotomy), composite parameters ΘP = Σλi·θTi where λi ∈ (0,1) and Σλi = 1. The composition operates purely on adapter weights (θ), not activations or outputs. Core assumption: Models fine-tuned from identical PLM checkpoints occupy similar regions in parameter space, making arithmetic combination meaningful.

### Mechanism 3
Synthetic data generated by LLMs (ChatGPT-4) can serve as training signal for trait-specific adapters when real personality-labeled data is unavailable. 154 samples per trait generated via prompting ChatGPT-4 with trait-specific personas. Format: {question, answer} pairs where answers reflect 7-class Likert responses or generative text matching the target trait. Core assumption: GPT-4's internal personality model produces trait-consistent responses that transfer to smaller PLMs through adapter training.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: Core architecture for trait PEMs. Understanding that W' = W + BA where B∈R^(d×r), A∈R^(r×k) enables parameter-efficient updates.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why rank r ≪ min(d,k) reduces trainable parameters while preserving expressivity?

- Concept: **Task Arithmetic / Model Merging**
  - Why needed here: Composition mechanism relies on parameter-space addition. Prior work demonstrates weight averaging can improve generalization.
  - Quick check question: What assumption must hold for θ_combined = θ_A + θ_B to yield a model that performs both tasks A and B?

- Concept: **MBTI Dichotomy Structure**
  - Why needed here: The 4-dichotomy × 2-trait structure (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) determines composition combinatorics—16 personalities from 8 base modules.
  - Quick check question: Why is selecting "exactly one trait from each dichotomy" necessary for valid composition in this framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base PLM (BERT/RoBERTa, frozen) → LoRA adapters (query/value projections) OR IA3 scalars (key/value/FFN) → Classification head (zero-shot) OR generation head (chatbot) → Composition layer: Θ_P = Σ λ_i · θ_Ti (weight-space only, no gradient)

- Critical path: 1) Initialize 8 trait PEMs from same PLM checkpoint 2) Train each trait PEM on synthetic dataset (154 samples each) 3) Sweep λ ∈ (0,1) with 0.1 granularity to find optimal composition weights 4) Evaluate via 16Personalities questionnaire (60 questions, automated Selenium pipeline)

- Design tradeoffs: LoRA vs. IA3: LoRA shows higher peak performance (80% Sensor vs. 80%) but IA3 has fewer parameters (vectors vs. matrices). LoRA more expressive; IA3 more efficient. Synthetic vs. real data: Synthetic enables rapid iteration but may introduce GPT-4 biases. No ablation with human-labeled data reported. Weighted vs. uniform sum: Paper uses λ-sweep rather than naive sum, adding 4 hyperparameters per personality.

- Failure signatures: Single-trait misalignment: 3/16 LoRA personalities and 4/16 IA3 personalities show misalignment in exactly one trait. Dichotomy interference: Opposing traits (E vs. I) trained separately may not produce perfectly anticorrelated behaviors, risking composition conflicts. Evaluation leakage: 16Personalities questionnaire may share structural similarities with synthetic training prompts, inflating scores.

- First 3 experiments: 1) Baseline replication: Train 8 trait LoRA adapters on BERT-base with 154 synthetic samples each. Verify >50% alignment on all traits before composition. 2) Composition sweep: For one personality (e.g., INTJ), sweep all λ combinations (4^10 = ~10,000 possibilities with 0.1 granularity). Log alignment vs. λ pattern. 3) Ablation on initialization: Train trait PEMs from different PLM checkpoints (same architecture, different seeds). Compare composition success rate to shared-initialization baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does human evaluation of composed personality PEMs align with the automated questionnaire-based results reported in this work? The current evaluation relies solely on an automated 16personalities.com questionnaire, not human judgment of whether model outputs authentically reflect target personalities.

- Can PEM composition operations be extended to enable unlearning, domain transfer, multi-tasking, and detoxification? The paper only demonstrates additive composition; operations like subtraction (unlearning) or cross-domain transfer remain untested.

- What causes the occasional trait misalignment in composed personality PEMs, and can composition strategies be improved to prevent this? Table 2 shows 3 of 16 personalities had misalignments in at least one trait, yet no analysis explains this failure mode.

## Limitations

- Synthetic data dependency: The entire approach relies on ChatGPT-4 generated trait-specific datasets, with no validation that synthetic-to-real transfer is valid or that GPT-4's personality model accurately reflects human MBTI distributions.

- Single-trait misalignment frequency: Despite overall success, 3/16 LoRA and 4/16 IA3 personalities show misalignment in exactly one trait, suggesting fundamental limitations in the composition approach.

- Evaluation methodology constraints: The Selenium-based automated quiz system measures trait alignment via binary threshold (>50%), but doesn't capture nuanced personality dynamics or potential composition conflicts.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The parameter-efficient training mechanism (LoRA/IA3) works as described and achieves measurable performance gains over baseline. The weighted composition arithmetic is straightforward and reproducible.

- Medium confidence: The MBTI personality representation and alignment metrics are meaningful, though synthetic data quality and evaluation methodology introduce uncertainty about real-world applicability.

- Low confidence: Claims about trait orthogonality preservation and composition without conflicts are weakly supported. The single-trait misalignment pattern suggests fundamental limitations in the composition approach.

## Next Checks

1. **Synthetic-to-real transfer validation**: Train a subset of trait PEMs on human-labeled MBTI data and compare alignment performance against synthetic-trained counterparts. This directly tests whether ChatGPT-4 generation introduces distribution shift.

2. **Composition weight sensitivity analysis**: For each misaligned personality, perform a grid search (0.05 granularity) around the optimal λ values. Plot alignment vs. λ to identify which trait combinations are most sensitive to weight perturbations, revealing potential orthogonality violations.

3. **Cross-initialization ablation**: Train trait PEMs from different PLM checkpoints (same architecture, different random seeds) and attempt composition. Compare alignment success rate to the shared-initialization baseline, testing the assumption that models from identical checkpoints occupy similar parameter space regions.
