# AI-Guided Human-In-the-Loop Inverse Design of High Performance Engineering Structures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.10859
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10859
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: HiTopAI integrates U-Net-based AI co-pilot to predict user-preferred regions for topology optimization modifications, achieving 39% buckling load improvement with 15-second overhead.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents HiTopAI, a human-in-the-loop topology optimization framework that uses AI to predict regions users might want to modify in structural designs. The system employs a U-Net architecture for binary image segmentation, trained on synthetic datasets where preferences are algorithmically defined (longest topological member or most complex node). The framework demonstrates successful prediction of plausible modification regions and shows potential for improving both manufacturability and structural performance while maintaining minimal computational overhead.

## Method Summary
HiTopAI uses a U-Net architecture for binary image segmentation to predict user-preferred regions for design modifications in topology optimization outputs. The model is trained on the TopoDiff dataset (30,000 2D TO designs) with synthetic preference labels generated through skeletonization and geometric region fitting. The framework applies geometric augmentations (rotations and mirrors) to expand the dataset to 109,722 pairs. During inference, the system uses 90th percentile thresholding and connected component analysis to generate final recommendations. The approach successfully identifies regions for modification while adding only 15 seconds to conventional TO workflows.

## Key Results
- Successfully predicts plausible regions for design modification in topology optimization outputs
- Achieves 39% improvement in linear buckling load for demonstration problems
- Adds only 15 seconds of computational overhead compared to conventional topology optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the U-Net's ability to learn spatial patterns that correlate with human design preferences. By training on synthetically generated preference data based on geometric features (longest members, complex nodes), the model learns to identify structurally significant regions that users are likely to modify. The 90th percentile thresholding and connected component analysis ensure that predictions are both precise and actionable. The system's emergent behavior of identifying multiple near-maximum-length members, despite training on single-member annotations, suggests the model captures underlying structural patterns beyond the explicit training labels.

## Foundational Learning
- **U-Net Architecture**: A convolutional neural network designed for image segmentation tasks, particularly effective at capturing both local and global context through its encoder-decoder structure with skip connections.
  - *Why needed*: To accurately identify and segment regions of interest in topology optimization outputs where users might want to make modifications.
  - *Quick check*: Verify the model can segment simple geometric shapes before applying to complex TO outputs.

- **Skeletonization**: The process of reducing binary shapes to 1-pixel wide representations that preserve topology and connectivity.
  - *Why needed*: To extract the graph representation of topology optimization designs and identify structural features like longest members and complex nodes.
  - *Quick check*: Confirm skeletonization preserves all connectivity while reducing thickness to single pixels.

- **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss with Logits**: A loss function suitable for binary classification tasks that combines sigmoid activation with cross-entropy loss in a numerically stable way.
  - *Why needed*: To train the U-Net to accurately predict binary masks indicating user-preferred regions for modification.
  - *Quick check*: Monitor training loss to ensure it decreases steadily and converges.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: TopoDiff Dataset -> Preprocessing (upscale, padding) -> Label Generation (skeletonization, ellipse fitting) -> U-Net Training -> 90th Percentile Thresholding -> Largest Connected Component -> Ellipse Fitting -> AI Recommendations

**Critical Path**: The most time-consuming steps are the initial U-Net training (up to 1000 epochs with early stopping) and the post-processing steps (thresholding and connected component analysis). The actual inference time is minimal compared to the overall design workflow.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The use of synthetic preference labels enables large-scale training but may not fully capture human intuition. The 90th percentile thresholding balances precision and recall but may miss subtle features. The 10-pixel void border padding prevents edge artifacts but reduces the effective design space.

**Failure Signatures**: Low IoU scores (~0.58) are expected due to emergent behavior identifying multiple similar-length members versus single-member ground truths. Poor boundary detection often indicates missing void border padding. The model may struggle with designs where multiple features compete for "longest member" status.

**First Experiments**:
1. Train U-Net on simple geometric shapes (lines, circles) to verify basic segmentation capability before applying to TO outputs.
2. Test skeletonization pipeline on a small subset of TopoDiff to confirm correct graph extraction and longest member identification.
3. Validate post-processing pipeline by applying 90th percentile thresholding to synthetic labels and measuring IoU against ground truth.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does the HiTopAI framework empirically outperform individual experts or purely automated design methods in terms of mechanical performance, design time, and user satisfaction?
  - Basis: The conclusion explicitly states that "future research that conducts comprehensive human-subject surveys is needed to empirically validate that the new framework can outperform individual experts or purely automated AI design."
  - Why unresolved: Current study serves only as proof-of-concept using demonstration examples rather than controlled comparative studies.
  - What evidence would resolve: Quantitative results from user studies measuring objective metrics (design time, structural performance) and subjective metrics (workflow satisfaction) across different user groups.

- How does the AI co-pilot's prediction accuracy and utility improve when trained on authentic human interaction datasets versus the synthetic datasets used in this study?
  - Basis: Authors note that "a crucial next step is to conduct user studies to create authentic datasets of human interaction patterns" to learn more nuanced preference criteria.
  - Why unresolved: Current model trained on synthetic data where preferences are algorithmically defined, which may not align with complex human intuition.
  - What evidence would resolve: Comparative analysis of model performance when trained on real human preference logs versus synthetic skeleton-based labels.

- Can the prediction model be extended to handle multiple, potentially conflicting design criteria simultaneously within a single design iteration?
  - Basis: Conclusion suggests "future research should also expand the AI co-pilot's capabilities to incorporate multiple design criteria."
  - Why unresolved: Current framework demonstrated on isolated criteria as separate segmentation tasks.
  - What evidence would resolve: Successful demonstration of AI providing recommendations balancing competing objectives based on weighted user preferences.

## Limitations
- Relies on synthetic preference annotations rather than actual human input, potentially missing complex human decision-making patterns
- Validated primarily on 2D problems with specific objectives, with unexplored performance on 3D geometries or alternative engineering objectives
- 39% improvement achieved on simple benchmark problems; scaling to industrial designs may present computational challenges

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core U-Net architecture and general framework of integrating AI recommendations into human-in-the-loop design
- Medium confidence: Quantitative improvements (15-second overhead, 39% buckling load increase) based on presented experiments
- Medium confidence: Generalization claims and emergent behavior demonstrated but warrant further testing

## Next Checks
1. Validate the skeletonization and mask generation pipeline on a held-out subset of TopoDiff to confirm expected ~0.58 IOU and assess consistency of emergent behavior
2. Test the trained U-Net on designs from different TO algorithms beyond TopoDiff to evaluate true generalization capability
3. Conduct a user study with actual human designers to compare AI recommendation acceptance rates against synthetic preference model and measure real-world time savings versus claimed 15 seconds
