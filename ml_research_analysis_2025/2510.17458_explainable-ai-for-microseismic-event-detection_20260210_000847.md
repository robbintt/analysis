# Explainable AI for microseismic event detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17458
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17458
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: SHAP-gated inference improved PhaseNet F1-score from 0.97 to 0.98 on 9,000 waveforms

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the interpretability of deep neural networks, specifically PhaseNet, used for microseismic event detection. The authors apply explainable AI techniques (Grad-CAM and SHAP) to uncover how PhaseNet identifies P- and S-wave arrivals in seismic data. They discover that the model primarily relies on vertical components for P-phase picks and horizontal components for S-phase picks. Building on these insights, they introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that combines model output with SHAP-based evidence, achieving improved detection performance and robustness to noise.

## Method Summary
The authors apply Grad-CAM and SHAP to explain PhaseNet's decision-making process in microseismic event detection. They analyze how the model processes vertical and horizontal seismic components to identify P- and S-wave arrivals. Based on these interpretability insights, they develop a SHAP-gated inference scheme that weights the model's predictions using SHAP values as evidence of wave arrivals. This approach is tested on a dataset of 9,000 waveforms, comparing performance against the baseline PhaseNet model.

## Key Results
- SHAP-gated inference improved F1-score from 0.97 to 0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97)
- Enhanced robustness to noise in microseismic event detection
- PhaseNet relies primarily on vertical components for P-phase picks and horizontal components for S-phase picks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SHAP-gated inference works by incorporating interpretability evidence directly into the decision-making process. When SHAP values indicate strong evidence for P- or S-wave arrivals in specific components, the model's confidence in those predictions is appropriately weighted. This creates a feedback loop where the model's internal reasoning is validated against external interpretability metrics, leading to more reliable detections. The gating mechanism effectively filters out predictions where the interpretability evidence doesn't align with the model's output.

## Foundational Learning
- **Grad-CAM**: A visualization technique that highlights important regions in input data for neural network predictions. Why needed: To identify which parts of seismic waveforms PhaseNet focuses on. Quick check: Verify highlighted regions correspond to actual P- and S-wave arrivals.
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: A game-theoretic approach to explain individual predictions by quantifying feature importance. Why needed: To measure the contribution of each seismic component to PhaseNet's decisions. Quick check: Ensure SHAP values correlate with physically meaningful wave characteristics.
- **PhaseNet architecture**: A deep learning model specifically designed for seismic phase picking. Why needed: The target model whose interpretability is being enhanced. Quick check: Confirm the model's basic functionality before applying XAI techniques.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Raw seismic waveforms → PhaseNet model → Grad-CAM/SHAP analysis → SHAP-gated inference → Final detection output
- **Critical path**: Input data → PhaseNet prediction → SHAP value computation → Gated decision → Output
- **Design tradeoffs**: The SHAP-gated approach adds computational overhead but improves interpretability and performance. The choice between Grad-CAM and SHAP balances visualization quality with quantitative evidence.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor SHAP-gate performance when interpretability evidence doesn't align with model predictions, or when SHAP values fail to capture relevant features in complex waveforms.
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test SHAP-gated inference on waveforms with varying noise levels
  2. Compare Grad-CAM visualizations before and after implementing SHAP-gating
  3. Evaluate computational overhead impact on real-time detection capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to PhaseNet architecture, may not generalize to other detection models
- Tested on relatively small dataset (9,000 waveforms) compared to real-world applications
- Computational overhead of SHAP-based gating not fully characterized for real-time monitoring

## Confidence
- High: PhaseNet's reliance on P- and S-wave arrivals is directly supported by multiple XAI techniques
- Medium: Performance improvement metrics based on single dataset and model
- Low: Generalizability of SHAP-gated approach to other seismic contexts and architectures

## Next Checks
1. Test SHAP-gated inference scheme on larger, more diverse dataset including various seismic event types and noise profiles
2. Evaluate computational overhead and inference speed impact when applying SHAP-based gating in real-time monitoring scenarios
3. Compare interpretability and performance of SHAP-gated approach against other explainable AI methods and baseline detection models
