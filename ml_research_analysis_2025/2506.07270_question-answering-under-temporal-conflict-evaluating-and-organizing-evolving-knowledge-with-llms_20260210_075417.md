# Question Answering under Temporal Conflict: Evaluating and Organizing Evolving Knowledge with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07270
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07270
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Novel knowledge organization framework outperforms baselines (e.g., 0.76 accuracy vs. 0.43 for ICL on Unified Clark)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of question answering when underlying knowledge evolves over time, leading to conflicting or outdated information. The authors introduce two new benchmarks—Temporal Wiki and Unified Clark—to evaluate LLM performance under temporal conflict. They propose a knowledge organization (KO) framework that incrementally builds a structured, external memory from source documents, allowing models to retrieve and reason over temporally coherent information at inference time. KO outperforms strong baselines like in-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation, especially on questions requiring integration of conflicting facts.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a knowledge organization framework with three stages: (1) decompose questions into quadruples (subject, relation, object, timestamp) using in-context learning; (2) extract and store subject-related facts from documents into a structured knowledge base; (3) query the KB and generate answers using only retrieved entries. Two benchmarks are introduced: Temporal Wiki (historical Wikipedia snapshots) and Unified Clark (timestamped news articles). Performance is evaluated using accuracy via LLM-based consensus voting. Models tested include Llama 3.1 70B, Llama 3 8B, and Mistral 7B v2. KO outperforms baselines, particularly on complex temporal reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- On Unified Clark, KO achieves 0.76 accuracy, compared to 0.43 for ICL and 0.68 for RAG.
- On Temporal Wiki, KO outperforms baselines on questions requiring integration of conflicting facts.
- ICL suffers from context overflow (>8000 tokens) on larger datasets, making KO and RAG more practical.
- KO shows robustness to outdated or conflicting facts by relying on structured, external memory.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The knowledge organization framework works by structuring evolving information into an external, queryable memory, decoupling retrieval from parametric LLM knowledge. This allows the model to ground answers in temporally relevant facts and handle conflicts by storing and retrieving structured evidence, rather than relying solely on its own (potentially outdated) parametric knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal Knowledge Drift**: Facts change over time; models must retrieve the most relevant snapshot. Needed to understand the challenge of evolving knowledge. Quick check: Can the model answer questions correctly using only information from the relevant time period?
- **Knowledge Base (KB) Organization**: Structured storage of facts indexed by subject and relation. Needed to efficiently retrieve and reason over relevant facts. Quick check: Are KB lookups fast and accurate for the target queries?
- **In-Context Learning (ICL)**: Prompting models with examples or full documents. Needed for question decomposition and answer generation. Quick check: Does ICL handle context overflow or conflicting facts robustly?
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Chunking and embedding documents, then retrieving relevant passages. Needed as a strong baseline for comparison. Quick check: Is retrieval accuracy high for relevant documents?
- **LLM-based Consensus Voting**: Using multiple LLMs to vote on answers. Needed to reduce bias and improve reliability. Quick check: Do voting results align with manual judgments?
- **Question Decomposition**: Parsing questions into structured quadruples. Needed to enable precise KB queries. Quick check: Are decomposed quadruples correct and actionable?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Document → KB (Subject/Relation-indexed) ← Query ← LLM (Decomposition/Answer)

**Critical Path**: Question → Decomposition (ICL) → KB Query → Answer Generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Structured KB vs. parametric memory; upfront indexing cost vs. retrieval efficiency; model size vs. context limits.

**Failure Signatures**: Context overflow on ICL; models ignoring context and falling back to parametric memory; KB misses due to poor decomposition.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test KO prompt templates for question decomposition on a small sample from Temporal Wiki.
2. Implement and run RAG baseline with the same chunking and embedding parameters as KO.
3. Compare KO vs. ICL and RAG on a held-out subset of Unified Clark to confirm relative performance trends.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exact prompt templates and KB schema details are not fully specified, complicating faithful reproduction.
- Context overflow is a practical limitation for ICL on larger datasets.
- Accuracy numbers depend on reproducibility of KO and prompt details.
- KB construction and indexing add upfront cost and complexity.

## Confidence

**Claims about KO outperforming baselines on temporal benchmarks: High**
**Claims about specific accuracy numbers (e.g., 0.76 on Unified Clark): Medium** (depends on reproducibility of KO and prompt details)
**Claims about handling conflicting facts via structured KB: Medium** (requires access to full prompt and KB schema for full verification)

## Next Checks
1. Reconstruct and test the KO prompt templates for question decomposition and fact extraction on a small sample from Temporal Wiki.
2. Implement and run the RAG baseline using the same chunking and embedding parameters, ensuring fair comparison.
3. Evaluate KO vs. ICL and RAG on a held-out subset of Unified Clark to confirm relative performance trends.
