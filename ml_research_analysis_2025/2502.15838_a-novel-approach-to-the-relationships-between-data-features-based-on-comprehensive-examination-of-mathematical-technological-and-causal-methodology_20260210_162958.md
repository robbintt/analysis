# A novel approach to the relationships between data features -- based on comprehensive examination of mathematical, technological, and causal methodology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15838
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15838
- Reference count: 18
- The paper proposes Convergent Fusion Paradigm (CFP) theory to address limitations in current AI feature relationship modeling by integrating mathematical, technological, and causal perspectives, introducing Hilbert space and backward causation to reinterpret feature relationships as emergent structures.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fundamental challenges in interpreting relationships among data features in AI systems, particularly for counterfactual explanations and algorithmic transparency. Current methodologies relying on normalization and externalization techniques distort intrinsic feature interactions, leading to identifiability problems and common cause issues. The author proposes the Convergent Fusion Paradigm (CFP) theory, which integrates mathematical, technological, and causal perspectives to provide a novel framework for modeling feature relationships. CFP theory introduces Hilbert space and backward causation concepts to reinterpret feature relationships as emergent structures, offering potential solutions to longstanding problems in causal inference.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes mathematical, technological, and causal methodologies into a unified framework called Convergent Fusion Paradigm (CFP) theory. The mathematical-technical component uses Riemannian manifolds with pull-back metrics to preserve intrinsic feature relationships during dimensional transformations, addressing identifiability problems in VAEs and GANs. The causal inference component adopts abduction as a methodological foundation, employing Hilbert space for dynamic causal reasoning where feature relationships evolve as emergent properties. The framework proposes that features interact through state vector operations to generate emergent structures, with backward causation allowing effects to generate their causes as future possibilities. Implementation involves equipping latent spaces with Riemannian metrics via Jacobian pull-back operations and using Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Descent for counterfactual path optimization.

## Key Results
- CFP theory provides a novel AI modeling methodology that integrates mathematical, technological, and causal perspectives
- Introduces Riemannian manifold-based framework to improve structural representation of high- and low-dimensional data interactions
- Adopts abduction as methodological foundation for causal inference with emergent features
- Proposes Hilbert space and backward causation to reinterpret feature relationships as emergent structures, offering potential solution to common cause problem

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Equipping latent spaces with Riemannian metrics via pull-back operations preserves intrinsic feature relationships during dimensional transformations, addressing the identifiability problem where different latent representations yield identical densities.
- Mechanism: The Jacobian matrix J_γ maps tangent vectors from latent space Z to ambient space χ. By defining M_γ = J_γ^T J_γ as the Riemannian metric, curve lengths measured in ambient space remain invariant under smooth invertible transformations of Z, ensuring geometric consistency.
- Core assumption: Data naturally lies on low-dimensional nonlinear manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient space (manifold hypothesis).
- Evidence anchors: [section II.1.3.B]: "endowing the latent space with a Riemannian metric such that curve lengths are measured in the ambient observation space χ...immediately solves the identifiability problem"
- Break condition: If ambient space dimensionality is too high relative to data density, Riemannian metric estimation becomes unstable (curse of dimensionality noted in section II.1.3.C)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Interpreting common-cause features as emergent structures within Hilbert space, combined with backward causation, allows dynamic feature relationships where effects can generate their causes as future possibilities.
- Mechanism: In Hilbert space, features C and E (effects in Euclidean framing) interact through state vector operations to generate feature D (common cause) as an emergent upward dimension. This reverses conventional temporal ordering: D is not pre-existing but emerges from C-E interactions.
- Core assumption: Backward causation is mathematically coherent within infinite-dimensional complete inner product spaces; quantum entanglement provides analogy.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "CFP theory introduces Hilbert space and backward causation to reinterpret the feature relationships as emergent structures, offering a potential solution to the common cause problem"
- Break condition: If backward causation is rejected as incoherent, or if Hilbert space constraints (Cauchy convergence, linear matrix operations) prevent true nonlinear emergence, mechanism degrades to approximation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Abductive reasoning, framed within critical realist ontology and mapped to CFP's conceptual hypotheses (crSTR and DCPSs), provides methodological foundation for causal inference with emergent features.
- Mechanism: Abduction moves from observed facts (F) through explanatory hypotheses (E) to mechanisms via "creative leap." In CFP: Experience/Event → crSTR (mechanism as created relative space-time), with DCPSs of TC-EO as the creative leap enabling dimensional expansion.
- Core assumption: The three-layer critical realist ontology (empirical, actual, real) maps validly to CFP's relational structures.
- Evidence anchors: [section IV.2.1.B]: "abduction takes a different approach...it traces backward from a given event to explore the premises upon which that event is based"
- Break condition: If abductive hypotheses cannot be empirically distinguished, or if "creative leap" remains unoperationalizable, mechanism provides only post-hoc rationalization

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Riemannian manifolds and pull-back metrics**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how geometric structure transfers between latent and ambient spaces is essential for implementing the proposed internalization methodology. Without this, the identifiability problem in VAEs/GANs remains unsolved.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why straight lines in latent space don't correspond to shortest paths on the data manifold, and how a pull-back metric addresses this?

- Concept: **Hilbert space properties (completeness, inner products, infinite-dimensional extension)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central claim depends on Hilbert space enabling representations impossible in Euclidean space—specifically, handling non-diagonal matrix interactions and supporting backward causation reasoning.
  - Quick check question: What constraints does Hilbert space impose (Cauchy sequences, linearity) that might limit its ability to represent truly nonlinear qualitative emergence?

- Concept: **Abduction vs. deduction/induction in causal reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The proposed causal model rejects standard SCM assumptions by using abduction as its logical foundation. Engineers must distinguish this from correlation-based or purely interventional approaches.
  - Quick check question: Given observed outcome Y and candidate causes {A, B, C}, how would abduction select among them differently than Pearl-style do-calculus?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Generator/Decoder (g_ε) -> Jacobian J_g -> Riemannian Metric Module (M_Z) -> RSGD Optimizer -> Abductive Inference Layer

- Critical path:
  1. Train VAE/GAN with differentiable decoder
  2. Compute Jacobian J_g(z) at each latent point (requires autograd)
  3. Define ambient metric M_χ (via RBF networks or learned classifiers)
  4. Pull back to latent space: M_Z(z) = J_g(z)^T M_χ(g(z)) J_g(z)
  5. Optimize counterfactual paths via RSGD respecting manifold geometry

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Basic vs. enhanced pull-back metrics**: Basic uses decoder Jacobian only; enhanced incorporates classifier decision boundaries via sigmoid mapping—higher fidelity but O(H²) computation where H is classifier hidden dimension
  - **RBF parameter selection**: Number of components K and bandwidth selection remain underconstrained; cross-validation on manifold coherence metrics recommended
  - **Hilbert space approximation**: Paper acknowledges current implementation remains quantitative approximation; true infinite-dimensional Hilbert operations would require spectral methods or kernel tricks

- Failure signatures:
  - Vanishing gradients near decision boundaries (Pegios et al. 2024 limitation noted in section II.1.3.E)
  - Metric instability in high-dimensional latent spaces (curse of dimensionality)
  - Counterfactual paths extrapolating beyond data support when Riemannian structure is poorly estimated
  - "Common cause" features still unidentifiable if backward causation assumption is violated

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce Arvanitidis et al. (2018) latent space curvature visualization** on a simple manifold (MNIST or synthetic Swiss roll) to validate pull-back metric computation; compare Euclidean vs. Riemannian geodesic distances
  2. **Ablation study on enhanced pull-back metrics**: Implement both Eq. (7) basic and Eq. (11) enhanced metrics; measure counterfactual validity rate and path plausibility on UCI Adult dataset
  3. **Synthetic common-cause benchmark**: Create dataset with known latent common-cause structure (e.g., C→D, C→E where C is unobserved); test whether emergent feature identification recovers C better than standard SCM-based methods (Dominguez-Olmedo et al. 2023)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can backward causation be concretely implemented as a causal model within Hilbert space for AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author asks: "How can backward causation be concretely implemented into a causal model within Hilbert space?" noting this requires mathematical approaches like the Schrödinger equation or integrating Hilbert space with general relativity.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes backward causation theoretically but acknowledges it lacks concrete implementation methodology beyond philosophical grounding.
- What evidence would resolve it: A working causal inference algorithm that incorporates backward causation within Hilbert space representations, tested on counterfactual explanation tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can mathematical methodology be developed that directly represents qualitative data generation as inherently nonlinear, rather than relying on linear approximation techniques?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly asks: "is it possible to develop a mathematical and technological methodology that directly represents qualitative data generation as an inherently nonlinear process, rather than relying on linear approximation techniques?"
- Why unresolved: Current approaches use probabilistic approximations and continuous linear models; no mathematical tool directly captures nonlinearity in its entirety.
- What evidence would resolve it: A generative model architecture that produces qualitatively new features without relying on Bayesian approximations or differential equations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the CFP theory's Riemannian manifold framework with emergent features outperform existing counterfactual explanation methods on benchmark tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper critiques existing externalization and internalization methodologies but provides no empirical validation of CFP theory's superiority.
- Why unresolved: CFP theory is presented as a philosophical and theoretical framework without experimental validation against baseline methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring counterfactual validity, sparsity, and actionability on standard datasets (e.g., loan approval, LSAT) between CFP-based and existing methods.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can the "passivity" concept within DCPSs of TC-EO address fundamental issues like LLM hallucinations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states the passivity concept "may offer novel insights into addressing fundamental and critical issues in LLMs, such as hallucination, from a completely different perspective."
- Why unresolved: This is proposed as future direction without elaboration on mechanism or implementation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of passivity-based constraints to LLM generation showing reduced hallucination rates while maintaining output quality.

## Limitations
- Theoretical synthesis without empirical validation—key mechanisms (backward causation, emergent feature generation) remain conceptual rather than algorithmic
- Critical realist ontology mapping to CFP's relational structures lacks established precedent and empirical support
- Hilbert space and backward causation extensions are speculative and not grounded in operational AI implementations
- Mathematical framework assumes data lies on low-dimensional manifolds, which may not hold for complex real-world datasets

## Confidence
- Mathematical framework (Riemannian metrics, pull-back operations): High - well-grounded in differential geometry literature
- Causal inference methodology (abduction integration): Medium - philosophically coherent but untested in practice
- Backward causation and Hilbert space emergence: Low - speculative extension beyond established formalism

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical ablation on synthetic common-cause data**: Generate datasets with known latent common-cause structure; compare CFP-based emergent feature identification against standard SCM approaches (Dominguez-Olmedo et al. 2023) on recovery accuracy
2. **Riemannian metric stability benchmark**: Implement pull-back metrics on UCI Adult and MNIST; systematically vary latent dimension and ambient space complexity; measure positive definiteness retention and counterfactual path validity across configurations
3. **Counterfactual plausibility evaluation**: Using Arvanitidis et al. (2018) baseline, compare Euclidean vs. Riemannian geodesic counterfactual paths on high-dimensional datasets; quantify adherence to data manifold and semantic coherence of generated examples
