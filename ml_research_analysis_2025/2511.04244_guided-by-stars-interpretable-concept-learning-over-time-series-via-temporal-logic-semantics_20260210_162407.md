# Guided by Stars: Interpretable Concept Learning Over Time Series via Temporal Logic Semantics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.04244
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04244
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Neuro-symbolic time series classification with human-readable STL explanations, competitive accuracy on UEA benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper presents STELLE, a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds raw time series into a space of temporal logic concepts via an STL-inspired kernel. The approach enables predictions to be accompanied by interpretable STL conditions, offering both local (instance-specific) and global (class-characterising) explanations. STELLE achieves competitive classification accuracy while maintaining transparency, addressing the trade-off between model interpretability and performance in time series analysis.

## Method Summary
The framework introduces a neuro-symbolic integration where raw time series are transformed into a space of temporal logic concepts using an STL-inspired kernel. This embedding allows for both accurate predictions and the generation of human-readable STL conditions that explain the model's decisions. The approach leverages the expressive power of temporal logic to capture complex temporal patterns in time series data while maintaining interpretability.

## Key Results
- STELLE achieves competitive accuracy on UEA multivariate benchmark datasets
- Local explanations demonstrate high separability scores, indicating strong discriminative power
- Global explanations remain concise after postprocessing and replicate model performance with high specificity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach bridges symbolic reasoning with deep learning by embedding time series into a temporal logic concept space. The STL-inspired kernel captures temporal dependencies and patterns that are then made interpretable through formal logic expressions. This neuro-symbolic integration allows the model to maintain predictive accuracy while generating explanations that are both locally meaningful for individual instances and globally representative of class characteristics.

## Foundational Learning
- Temporal Logic Semantics: Provides a formal framework for expressing temporal patterns; needed for interpretable representations; quick check: can generate readable STL conditions
- STL-inspired Kernel: Transforms raw time series into logic concept space; needed for embedding temporal patterns; quick check: preserves discriminative information
- Neuro-symbolic Integration: Combines deep learning with symbolic reasoning; needed for accuracy + interpretability; quick check: maintains competitive performance
- Separability Metrics: Quantifies discriminative power of local explanations; needed to validate explanation quality; quick check: measures distinctiveness between classes
- Postprocessing for Global Explanations: Simplifies complex STL conditions; needed for human readability; quick check: retains model accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Time Series -> STL Kernel Embedding -> Neural Network -> STL Condition Generation

**Critical Path**: The most important computational path runs from raw time series through the STL-inspired kernel to the neural network, where temporal patterns are learned and then translated into interpretable STL conditions for both prediction and explanation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes interpretability through formal logic expressions at the potential cost of scalability to very long or high-dimensional time series. The postprocessing step for global explanations trades some complexity for conciseness, potentially losing fine-grained details.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor separability scores in local explanations would indicate weak discriminative power. Loss of accuracy after postprocessing global explanations would suggest over-simplification. Performance degradation on longer, more complex time series would reveal scalability limitations.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Classification accuracy comparison on UEA multivariate benchmark datasets
2. Local explanation separability score evaluation across different classes
3. Global explanation conciseness and specificity measurement with and without postprocessing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly identified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for longer, more complex multivariate time series and real-world noisy datasets
- Limited comparison of separability metric against alternative interpretability measures
- Brief description of global explanation postprocessing without full algorithmic detail affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

| Claim Area | Confidence Level |
|------------|------------------|
| Neuro-symbolic integration methodology | High |
| Competitive accuracy on UEA benchmarks | High |
| Explanation quality (separability scores) | Medium |
| Generalizability beyond tested datasets | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate STELLE on longer, higher-dimensional multivariate time series datasets (e.g., from industrial sensor monitoring or healthcare streaming data) to test scalability limits
2. Conduct ablation studies removing or modifying the postprocessing step for global explanations to quantify its impact on explanation conciseness and accuracy retention
3. Compare local explanation separability scores against alternative interpretability metrics (e.g., fidelity, stability, or human-grounded evaluations) to strengthen claims of discriminative power
