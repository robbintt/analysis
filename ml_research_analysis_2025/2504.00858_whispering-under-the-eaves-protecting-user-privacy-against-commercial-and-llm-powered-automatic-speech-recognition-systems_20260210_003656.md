# Whispering Under the Eaves: Protecting User Privacy Against Commercial and LLM-powered Automatic Speech Recognition Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.00858
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00858
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Latent-space universal adversarial perturbations achieve >75% protection success rate on commercial ASR APIs while preserving high audio quality.

## Executive Summary
AudioShield introduces a novel framework for protecting user privacy in voice communications by generating transferable universal adversarial perturbations (LS-TUAP) in the latent space of an autoencoder. Unlike existing methods that introduce noise in the audio space, AudioShield adds perturbations in the latent space, preserving audio quality while maintaining adversarial effectiveness. A key innovation is the target feature adaptation process, which enhances the transferability of perturbations by embedding target text features. The method is evaluated on ten ASR models, including four commercial APIs, two LLM-powered models, one NN-based model, and three voice assistants. AudioShield achieves a protection success rate of over 75% on commercial ASR APIs, surpassing competitors by 27.88-43.90%, while maintaining significantly higher audio quality (NISQA score of 2.45 vs. 1.14-1.54 for competitors). It also demonstrates strong resilience in real-time and over-the-air scenarios, with an average protection success rate of 87.5% in end-to-end evaluations.

## Method Summary
AudioShield generates transferable universal adversarial perturbations by optimizing perturbations in the latent space of a VITS autoencoder rather than the audio waveform. The method uses a surrogate DeepSpeech2 model to train perturbations that cause transcription errors while maintaining audio quality. Target feature adaptation aligns perturbations with target text features to improve cross-model transferability. Physical robustness is achieved through convolution with diverse room impulse responses during training. The framework operates by encoding audio to latent space, adding a pre-trained perturbation vector, decoding back to audio, and maintaining quality through the autoencoder's learned manifold.

## Key Results
- Achieves 75.8% protection success rate on commercial ASR APIs, outperforming competitors by 27.88-43.90%
- Maintains high audio quality with NISQA score of 2.45 versus 1.14-1.54 for competitors
- Demonstrates strong physical robustness with 87.5% average protection success rate in end-to-end over-the-air evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Space Perturbation Injection
Applying adversarial perturbations in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE) rather than directly in the audio waveform preserves perceptual quality while maintaining attack effectiveness. Audio is first encoded into a compact latent representation. A pre-optimized universal perturbation vector δ is added to this latent code (z + δ), then decoded back to audio. Because the decoder is trained to produce natural-sounding outputs from the latent distribution, the resulting audio stays within the manifold of plausible human speech, avoiding harsh noise artifacts typical of direct waveform perturbation. Core assumption: The decoder's Lipschitz continuity bounds the perceptual distance between outputs; small latent perturbations yield bounded acoustic changes.

### Mechanism 2: Target Feature Adaptation for Cross-Model Transfer
Optimizing perturbations to align with latent features of a target text increases transferability of adversarial examples to black-box ASR models. A heuristic search selects a target audio whose latent code minimizes ASR loss when scaled and decoded. During optimization, a cosine similarity loss LSim(δ, z_t) encourages δ to absorb robust phonetic/semantic features of the target text. These features are more likely to cross decision boundaries of different ASR architectures than source-audio-specific artifacts. Core assumption: Shared phonetic/semantic representations across ASR models dominate transferability; speaker-identity or style features are noise for transfer.

### Mechanism 3: Physical Robustness via RIR Augmentation
Convolution with diverse room impulse responses during training makes perturbations robust to over-the-air transmission (reverberation, attenuation, environmental noise). During optimization, the adversarial example x′ = D(z + δ + p) is convolved with a randomly sampled RIR r before computing the ASR loss: Ltotal = LASR(f(x′ ⊗ r), t) + λ·LSim(δ, z_t). This exposes δ to realistic acoustic distortions, encouraging solutions effective under physical playback. Core assumption: The distribution of RIRs during training covers the variability of real acoustic environments; perturbations that survive this augmentation generalize to physical scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Latent-Space Manifolds**: Understanding how VAEs enforce a structured latent space via KL regularization is essential to reason about why latent perturbations maintain audio quality. If you increase the perturbation bound τ beyond the decoder's tolerance, what would you expect to happen to NISQA scores and why?

- **Adversarial Transferability in Deep Models**: The method trains on a surrogate (DeepSpeech2) but must transfer to commercial APIs and LLM-powered ASR. Transferability arises from shared feature representations across models; the target feature adaptation exploits this. Why does overfitting to surrogate-specific artifacts reduce black-box transfer, and how does minimizing LSim(δ, z_t) mitigate this?

- **Room Impulse Response (RIR) and Physical Audio Channels**: Over-the-air robustness requires understanding how RIRs model multipath propagation and environmental filtering. This explains why RIR augmentation during optimization is necessary for physical deployment. If all RIRs in training were anechoic (no reverberation), how would over-the-air PSR likely change in a reverberant meeting room?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Audio -> VITS Encoder -> Latent Space -> Perturbation Addition -> VITS Decoder -> Adversarial Audio -> ASR Model -> Transcription
- **Critical path**: 1) Heuristic target-audio selection: Generate n candidate target audios from target text, encode each, find scaling factor w that minimizes ASR loss for D(w·z_i) transcribing as target text, pick lowest-loss target and initialize δ. 2) Perturbation optimization: For each batch, sample audio, encode to latent z, sample noise p and RIR r, compute total loss, update δ via PGD and clip to [−τ, τ]. 3) Real-time inference: Encode live audio, add pre-trained δ, decode to protected audio; latency dominated by encoder-decoder inference (~409ms measured).
- **Design tradeoffs**: τ (perturbation bound): Higher τ improves PSR but degrades NISQA; τ=0.5 balances both. λ (similarity weight): Higher λ strengthens transferability but may reduce source-model success; λ=50 chosen empirically. Autoencoder choice: VITS chosen for zero-shot capability and quality; larger models (HierSpeech++) have higher quality but excessive latency. Latent noise σ: σ=1.0 maximizes PSR/WER; too small leads to overfitting, too large disrupts optimization.
- **Failure signatures**: Latent-space out-of-distribution: If encoder receives highly noisy or out-of-scope audio, latent codes may be off-manifold; decoded audio becomes unintelligible (low NISQA). Surrogate overfitting: High surrogate success but near-zero black-box PSR; suggests target-audio selection or λ needs tuning. Physical-channel mismatch: Sharp PSR drop at >20cm in new environments; indicates insufficient RIR diversity or need for environment-specific fine-tuning. Detection/countermeasure triggers: High AUC in temporal-dependency detection may indicate τ is too large or perturbation lacks coherence.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline transfer test: Train δ on DeepSpeech2 with target text "open the door"; evaluate PSR/WER and NISQA on all four commercial ASR APIs and two LLM-powered ASRs; compare against AdvDDoS and Zong et al. 2) Ablation on target feature adaptation: Run optimization with LSim=0 vs LSim>0; plot PSR/WER across APIs to confirm transfer lift; verify NISQA does not collapse. 3) Over-the-air robustness sanity check: Play 10 protected samples via laptop speaker at 10cm/20cm/50cm to Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri; log PSR and note any recognition failures or ASR crashes; inspect whether failures correlate with low NISQA or extreme RIR conditions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can adversarial perturbations be optimized to ensure semantic coherence in the transcriptions induced by different Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models? Current optimization focuses on maximizing error rates (WER/CER) rather than controlling the semantic structure of the resulting transcription, which is difficult to align across diverse black-box model decision boundaries. Evidence would be a framework generating perturbations causing target models to produce grammatically fluid but incorrect sentences, rather than random or incoherent text, verified through linguistic analysis of outputs.

### Open Question 2
Can the inference latency of the AudioShield framework be reduced below the observed 409ms while maintaining high protection success rates and audio quality? The quality of the adversarial example relies on the VITS autoencoder, which imposes a computational bottleneck that simple audio-space addition does not. Evidence would be a modified AudioShield implementation demonstrating sub-100ms latency on standard consumer hardware without a statistically significant drop in NISQA audio quality scores or Protection Success Rates (PSR).

### Open Question 3
What specific architectural features or preprocessing pipelines of Amazon Alexa contribute to its higher resistance against universal adversarial perturbations compared to Google Assistant and Apple Siri? As a black-box system, the internal mechanisms of Alexa that filter or neutralize the perturbations are unknown. Evidence would be systematic black-box probing of Amazon Alexa's frequency sensitivity or noise rejection thresholds to identify the specific signal characteristics that trigger its robustness against latent space perturbations.

## Limitations
- Zero-shot generalization capability of VITS autoencoder for unseen speakers, accents, or content is a core uncertainty
- Potential overfitting of target feature adaptation to surrogate model idiosyncrasies may degrade transferability to Transformer-based or LLM-powered ASR
- Physical robustness depends on whether RIR training distribution covers real-world deployment environments
- Black-box ASR APIs may have undisclosed proprietary defenses that artificially suppress protection success rates

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The mechanism of latent space perturbation injection (VAE-based) and its effect on audio quality preservation, supported by NISQA scores and the Lipschitz continuity bound
- **Medium confidence**: The target feature adaptation's ability to improve cross-model transferability, given positive PSR/WER trends but limited ablation validation and no explicit feature-space analysis
- **Medium confidence**: The physical robustness claim via RIR augmentation, based on over-the-air tests but without full environmental variability coverage or failure analysis at extreme distances

## Next Checks
1. Implement target feature adaptation ablation study comparing PSR/WER with LSim=0 versus LSim>0 to verify transferability improvements
2. Conduct systematic latency measurement of the complete AudioShield pipeline on target deployment hardware to identify bottlenecks
3. Perform controlled over-the-air tests across diverse environmental conditions (reverberant room, outdoor, noisy environment) to validate RIR augmentation robustness limits
