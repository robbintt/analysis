# RareGraph-Synth: Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Models for Generating Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Patient Trajectories in Ultra-Rare Diseases

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06267
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06267
- Reference count: 29
- Knowledge-guided diffusion framework achieves 40% lower MMD than baseline and reduces privacy risk to below safe threshold

## Executive Summary
RareGraph-Synth introduces a knowledge-guided diffusion framework for generating privacy-preserving synthetic electronic health records for ultra-rare diseases. The approach combines five public biomedical knowledge graphs into an 8-million-edge KG and modulates diffusion noise schedules with meta-path scores to guide generation toward biologically plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences. Evaluated on simulated ultra-rare disease cohorts, the framework demonstrates significant improvements in both fidelity (40% lower categorical MMD) and privacy (reduced membership inference attack AUC to 0.53) compared to unguided diffusion baselines.

## Method Summary
RareGraph-Synth operates by integrating multiple public biomedical knowledge graphs into a unified 8-million-edge KG, then using meta-path scores derived from this KG to modulate the noise schedule during diffusion model generation. This knowledge-guided approach steers the synthetic data generation toward clinically meaningful patterns by incorporating domain expertise about relationships between laboratory results, medications, and adverse events. The framework is evaluated using simulated ultra-rare disease cohorts, comparing performance against an unguided diffusion baseline across both fidelity and privacy metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieves 40% lower categorical Maximum Mean Discrepancy compared to unguided diffusion baseline
- Reduces membership inference attack AUC to 0.53, below the 0.55 safe-release threshold
- Demonstrates that embedding biomedical knowledge into diffusion noise schedules enhances both fidelity and privacy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The knowledge-guided noise scheduling works by leveraging biomedical domain expertise encoded in knowledge graphs to inform the generation process. By modulating the diffusion noise schedule with meta-path scores, the model preferentially preserves biologically plausible relationships between clinical entities (labs, medications, adverse events) while adding uncertainty to implausible combinations. This targeted approach maintains clinically meaningful patterns while reducing the risk of overfitting to individual patient data, thereby achieving the dual objectives of high fidelity and strong privacy protection.

## Foundational Learning
1. Diffusion models: Generative models that learn to reverse a gradual noising process - needed for understanding the core generation mechanism
2. Knowledge graphs in healthcare: Structured representations of biomedical relationships - needed for understanding how domain knowledge is encoded
3. Meta-paths: Patterns that define relationships between entities in KGs - needed for understanding how to extract meaningful guidance signals
4. Privacy metrics: Membership inference attack AUC and MMD - needed for understanding evaluation criteria
5. Ultra-rare diseases: Conditions affecting very small patient populations - needed for understanding the unique challenges and requirements

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input KG -> Meta-path scoring -> Noise schedule modulation -> Diffusion generation -> Synthetic EHR output

Critical path: Knowledge graph integration and meta-path scoring are essential; without them, the framework reverts to standard diffusion generation with lower fidelity and weaker privacy guarantees.

Design tradeoffs: Balancing noise reduction (for fidelity) against noise addition (for privacy) - the knowledge-guided approach attempts to optimize this tradeoff by strategically reducing noise only where biological plausibility supports it.

Failure signatures: Poor meta-path selection leading to biologically implausible generations; over-reliance on KG knowledge causing underrepresentation of rare but valid clinical patterns; insufficient noise modulation failing to protect patient privacy.

First 3 experiments:
1. Ablation study removing meta-path guidance to establish baseline performance
2. Testing different knowledge graph combinations to identify most impactful sources
3. Evaluating sensitivity to KG quality and completeness using controlled perturbations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on simulated rather than real-world ultra-rare disease data
- 8-million-edge knowledge graph may miss rare disease-specific interactions only observable in longitudinal patient data
- Privacy evaluation focuses primarily on membership inference attacks, potentially overlooking other privacy risks

## Confidence
- Knowledge-guided diffusion noise scheduling improves fidelity: High confidence
- Privacy enhancement through knowledge guidance: Medium confidence
- Generalizability to real-world ultra-rare diseases: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Validate RareGraph-Synth on real-world rare disease datasets with confirmed diagnoses to assess performance on genuine clinical complexity
2. Conduct comprehensive privacy evaluation including attribute inference, record linkage, and differential privacy analysis beyond membership inference
3. Perform ablation studies testing individual knowledge graph contributions and meta-path selection strategies to quantify their relative impact on generation quality
