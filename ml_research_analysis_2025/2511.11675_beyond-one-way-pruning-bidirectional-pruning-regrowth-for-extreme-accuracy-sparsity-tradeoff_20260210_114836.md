# Beyond One-Way Pruning: Bidirectional Pruning-Regrowth for Extreme Accuracy-Sparsity Tradeoff

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11675
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11675
- Reference count: 17
- One-line primary result: Bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy achieves 92.77% accuracy at 96.39% sparsity for one-shot pruning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of performance degradation in deep neural networks when sparsity exceeds certain thresholds during model pruning. Traditional pruning methods suffer from steep accuracy drops at high sparsity levels, limiting achievable compression ratios and preventing deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. The authors propose a bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy that starts from an extremely compressed network and selectively regenerates critical connections to recover lost performance. Experiments on VGG16 demonstrate that this approach effectively mitigates accuracy degradation under extreme compression ratios, enabling practical deployment of highly compressed models while maintaining high performance.

## Method Summary
The proposed bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy operates in two phases: an initial extreme compression phase followed by a selective regrowth phase. The method begins by pruning the network to an extremely sparse state, beyond what traditional pruning would allow while maintaining acceptable accuracy. During the regrowth phase, critical connections are selectively regenerated based on their importance to network performance, effectively recovering lost accuracy while maintaining high sparsity levels. This approach differs from traditional pruning by working backward from extreme compression rather than forward from a dense model, allowing it to identify and preserve the most essential connections for network functionality.

## Key Results
- Achieves 92.77% accuracy at 96.39% sparsity for one-shot pruning
- Achieves 92.64% accuracy at 96.85% sparsity for iterative pruning
- Outperforms traditional pruning baselines by maintaining high accuracy at extreme compression ratios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy works by first identifying the network's core essential connections through extreme compression, then selectively regenerating the most critical connections that were pruned away. This approach allows the method to determine which connections are truly necessary for maintaining performance, rather than making irreversible pruning decisions early in the process. By starting from an extremely compressed state and working backward, the method can identify the minimal set of connections required for acceptable accuracy, effectively finding an optimal trade-off between sparsity and performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Model Pruning Fundamentals**: Understanding how weight pruning reduces model size while maintaining performance - needed to grasp the baseline methods being improved upon; quick check: can you explain the difference between structured and unstructured pruning?
- **Sparsity-Accuracy Tradeoff**: The relationship between compression level and model performance - needed to understand why extreme sparsity typically causes accuracy drops; quick check: what is the typical accuracy drop observed when sparsity exceeds 90%?
- **Connection Importance Metrics**: Methods for evaluating which weights are most critical to model performance - needed to understand how the regrowth phase selects which connections to regenerate; quick check: name two common metrics used to evaluate connection importance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Data -> Pruning Phase -> Extreme Compression State -> Regrowth Phase -> Output Model

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves the iterative evaluation of connection importance during both pruning and regrowth phases, with the most computationally intensive step being the calculation of importance metrics for potential regrowth candidates.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades additional training time and computational overhead during the regrowth phase for significantly higher achievable sparsity levels and maintained accuracy. This represents a shift from traditional pruning's focus on minimizing training time to maximizing compression efficiency.

**Failure Signatures:** The method may fail when the initial extreme compression removes too many critical connections, making accurate recovery impossible, or when the importance metrics fail to correctly identify which connections to regenerate, leading to suboptimal performance at high sparsity levels.

**First Experiments:** 
1. Replicate the VGG16 results on CIFAR-10 to verify baseline performance
2. Test the method on a ResNet architecture to assess generalizability
3. Evaluate performance degradation when the initial pruning phase is too aggressive

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to single architecture (VGG16), raising generalizability concerns
- Performance claims at extreme sparsity levels (96%+) need validation on larger datasets
- Computational overhead of regrowth phase not fully quantified in terms of training time and resource requirements

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The bidirectional pruning-regrowth methodology is conceptually sound and the theoretical framework is well-established
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported accuracy improvements at high sparsity levels for VGG16 are likely valid but require independent replication
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization claims to other architectures and datasets are not yet substantiated by current experimental evidence

## Next Checks
1. Validate the bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy on at least two additional network architectures (e.g., ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2) using the same datasets to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate the method on datasets beyond the current scope (e.g., CIFAR-100, ImageNet) to test robustness across different data distributions and complexity levels
3. Quantify the exact training time and computational resources required for the regrowth phase compared to traditional pruning methods, including GPU memory usage and wall-clock time measurements
