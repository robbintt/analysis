# Efficient Computation of Blackwell Optimal Policies using Rational Functions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.18252
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18252
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing Blackwell-Optimal policies in deterministic MDPs, with O(n⁴k) complexity.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel method for computing Blackwell-Optimal (BO) policies in Markov Decision Problems by replacing numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions near the discount factor γ = 1. The approach leverages the fact that value functions are rational functions of γ, allowing for policy improvements to be determined through symbolic comparisons rather than numerical evaluations. This technique achieves the first strongly polynomial-time algorithms for deterministic MDPs and provides subexponential bounds for general MDPs.

## Method Summary
The method computes BO policies by representing value functions as rational functions of the discount factor γ and using symbolic ordering (μ-ordering) to determine policy improvements without relying on specific numerical values of γ. The core insight is that for γ close to 1, the relative ordering of value functions becomes invariant and can be determined by evaluating the sign of the limit of the difference function at γ=1. This approach is integrated into standard policy iteration algorithms by replacing numeric comparisons with symbolic ones.

## Key Results
- Achieves O(n⁴k) complexity for deterministic MDPs, the first strongly polynomial-time algorithm for BO policies
- Provides subexponential bound of poly(n,k)·exp(O(√n log n)) for general MDPs when combined with Random-Facet
- Establishes exponential lower bound on threshold discount factor γbw, proving inherent computational complexity
- Successfully computes BO policies for healthcare models with n > 25 where numerical methods fail

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Symbolic Rational Function Ordering
The method replaces numerical evaluation with symbolic ordering of rational functions to preserve optimal policy trajectories for γ ≈ 1. Value functions V^π_γ are rational functions of γ, and the μ-ordering determines if one action is strictly better than another for all sufficiently large discount factors simultaneously by evaluating the sign of the limit at γ=1.

### Mechanism 2: Lifting Existing Algorithms
Existing strongly polynomial or subexponential algorithms for discounted MDPs can be adapted to compute BO policies by substituting their numeric argmax operators with symbolic μ-ordering. This forces algorithms to follow the policy trajectory that would occur if γ were infinitesimally close to 1, effectively running the algorithm on the limit MDP without picking a specific γ.

### Mechanism 3: Exponential Sensitivity of γbw
The threshold discount factor γbw can be exponentially close to 1, necessitating symbolic methods over standard floating-point solvers. The paper constructs Trap MDPs where the optimal policy changes at γ = 1 - O(2^(-n/3)), making numerical methods impossible for n > 50 due to precision limits.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Laurent Series Expansion** - Needed to understand why the rational function approach is a simpler algebraic alternative to series expansion around γ=1. Quick check: Can you explain why finding the first non-zero coefficient of a Laurent series for V^π_γ around γ=1 determines the "bias" or long-term behavior of the policy?

- **Concept: Strongly Polynomial Time** - Critical for understanding why removing bit-complexity dependence is the main theoretical contribution. Quick check: Does a strongly polynomial algorithm for an MDP guarantee a runtime independent of the magnitude of the rewards?

- **Concept: Policy Iteration (PI) & Simplex** - Necessary to understand how symbolic comparison replaces numeric improvement checks in switching logic. Quick check: In Howard's Policy Iteration, how does the choice of switching rule affect the worst-case iteration count?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** MDP-to-Rational Converter -> Symbolic Engine -> μ-Comparator -> Algorithm Driver
- **Critical path:** The Symbolic Engine. Efficient polynomial handling is the bottleneck, with costs potentially dominating runtime at O(n⁴).
- **Design tradeoffs:** Generality vs. Speed (using general symbolic libraries is slow, suggesting need for custom handlers); Deterministic vs. General (strongly polynomial bounds only apply to deterministic MDPs).
- **Failure signatures:** Bit-overflow in coefficients requiring arbitrary-precision integers; incorrect roots leading to cycling in Policy Iteration.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement the Trap MDP construction from Appendix A with n=10, 20, 30 to verify numerical solvers fail while symbolic method succeeds.
  2. Run the algorithm on the healthcare MDP with n > 25 to measure runtime and confirm polynomial scaling vs. exponential slowdown of numerical solvers.
  3. Apply the Random-Facet-Blackwell algorithm on random stochastic MDPs with n=50 to verify if the subexponential bound holds empirically.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can algebraic characterizations delineate specific classes of MDPs where reliable identification of Blackwell-Optimal policies is feasible within a model-free reinforcement learning context?
- Is a strongly polynomial-time algorithm possible for computing Blackwell-Optimal policies in general (stochastic) MDPs?
- How can the computational cost of symbolic matrix inversion be reduced to scale the rational function method to MDPs with large state spaces?

## Limitations
- Symbolic computation complexity may limit scalability due to polynomial degree growth and coefficient explosion
- Method assumes rational rewards and transitions, requiring approximation schemes for real-valued parameters
- Evaluation focuses on theoretical MDP families and one healthcare model, lacking broader empirical validation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Theoretical framework connecting rational function ordering to Blackwell optimality is sound; exponential lower bound on γbw is rigorously proven
- **Medium Confidence:** Complexity claims follow from combining established algorithms with μ-ordering, but practical performance may vary
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about real-world applicability are plausible but not empirically validated at scale

## Next Checks
1. Implement the Trap MDP construction from Appendix A with increasing n (10, 20, 30) to verify numerical solvers fail while the symbolic method succeeds
2. Benchmark on diverse MDP domains beyond healthcare, including inventory management and robotics control problems
3. Compare symbolic vs. numerical policy iteration on deterministic MDPs with varying n and k to empirically validate the O(n⁴k) complexity claim
