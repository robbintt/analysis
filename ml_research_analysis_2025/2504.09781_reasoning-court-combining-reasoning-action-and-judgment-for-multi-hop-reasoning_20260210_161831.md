core_contribution: Reasoning Court (RC) addresses the challenge of multi-hop reasoning
  in large language models by introducing a dedicated judge to evaluate candidate
  answers from multiple reasoning agents. RC extends iterative reasoning-and-retrieval
  methods by having agents interleave reasoning with evidence retrieval, after which
  an LLM judge evaluates the research trajectories to select the most factually grounded
  and logically coherent answer, or synthesizes a new answer when existing ones are

# Reasoning Court: Combining Reasoning, Action, and Judgment for Multi-Hop Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.09781
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09781
- Authors: Jingtian Wu; Claire Cardie
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: RC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot prompting methods on HotpotQA, FEVER, and MuSiQue, achieving significant improvements in EM and F1 scores.

## Executive Summary
Reasoning Court (RC) addresses the challenge of multi-hop reasoning in large language models by introducing a dedicated judge to evaluate candidate answers from multiple reasoning agents. The approach extends iterative reasoning-and-retrieval methods by having agents interleave reasoning with evidence retrieval, followed by an LLM judge that evaluates research trajectories to select the most factually grounded and logically coherent answer, or synthesizes a new answer when existing ones are inadequate. Evaluations demonstrate that RC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot prompting methods, achieving significant improvements in exact match (EM) and F1 scores across both GPT-4o-mini and Claude-3.5-Sonnet models.

## Method Summary
RC introduces a novel framework where multiple reasoning agents generate answers through interleaved reasoning and evidence retrieval, followed by a judge LLM that evaluates these answers based on factual accuracy, logical consistency, and evidence support. The judge can either select the best answer from the candidates or synthesize a new answer when existing ones are inadequate. This approach combines the strengths of multi-agent collaboration with structured evaluation, addressing limitations of existing few-shot prompting methods that struggle with complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- RC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot prompting methods on HotpotQA, FEVER, and MuSiQue datasets
- Significant improvements in exact match (EM) and F1 scores across both GPT-4o-mini and Claude-3.5-Sonnet models
- Judge mechanism effectively resolves conflicts between agents and can synthesize correct answers even when both agents fail

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of Reasoning Court stems from its multi-faceted approach to multi-hop reasoning. By having multiple agents generate answers through interleaved reasoning and retrieval, the method captures diverse reasoning trajectories. The judge LLM then evaluates these answers using a structured rubric that assesses factual accuracy, logical consistency, and evidence support. This creates a robust evaluation framework that can identify and select the most reliable answer, or synthesize a new one when necessary. The approach leverages the strengths of both collaborative reasoning and expert evaluation to overcome the limitations of single-agent few-shot prompting methods.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: Complex reasoning requiring multiple inference steps to reach a conclusion; needed to handle questions requiring synthesis of information from multiple sources
- **Interleaved reasoning and retrieval**: Alternating between reasoning steps and evidence gathering; needed to maintain context while incorporating new information
- **LLM-as-a-judge**: Using language models to evaluate answer quality; needed to provide consistent, scalable evaluation criteria
- **Factual grounding**: Verifying claims against evidence; needed to ensure answers are supported by retrieved information
- **Logical consistency**: Ensuring answers follow logically from evidence; needed to maintain coherence across reasoning steps
- **Evidence synthesis**: Combining multiple pieces of evidence to form conclusions; needed to handle complex reasoning chains

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Reasoning Agents -> Judge LLM -> Final Answer
Evidence Retriever -> Reasoning Agents (bidirectional)
Answer Candidates -> Judge LLM (evaluation)

**Critical Path:**
1. Evidence retrieval for initial context
2. Multiple agents generate answers through interleaved reasoning
3. Judge evaluates candidates using structured rubric
4. Selection or synthesis of final answer

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Multiple agents vs. single agent: Balances diversity of reasoning with computational cost
- Judge evaluation vs. direct selection: Adds evaluation overhead but improves answer quality
- Interleaved retrieval vs. batch retrieval: Maintains context but may increase computational steps

**Failure Signatures:**
- Judge cannot distinguish between high-quality candidates
- Agents converge on incorrect reasoning paths
- Evidence retrieval fails to provide relevant information
- Judge overfits to specific prompting patterns

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare RC performance with varying numbers of reasoning agents (2-4)
2. Test judge effectiveness with different evaluation rubrics
3. Evaluate impact of interleaved vs. batch retrieval on final answer quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance gains may be partially attributable to specific prompting strategies rather than fundamental architectural improvements
- Evaluation focuses primarily on accuracy metrics without extensive analysis of computational efficiency
- Judge mechanism reliability depends heavily on the judge model's own reasoning capabilities

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Experimental results showing RC outperforming few-shot baselines on HotpotQA, FEVER, and MuSiQue datasets

**Medium confidence:**
- Claims about computational efficiency being "comparable" to existing methods
- Generalizability of RC beyond tested datasets and model combinations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of judge mechanism versus reasoning agents' interleaved approach
2. Test RC's performance on additional multi-hop reasoning datasets with different characteristics
3. Implement comprehensive computational cost analysis comparing RC to baseline methods across varying batch sizes and model configurations
