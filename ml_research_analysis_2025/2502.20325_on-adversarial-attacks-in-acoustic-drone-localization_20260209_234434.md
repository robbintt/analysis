# On Adversarial Attacks In Acoustic Drone Localization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.20325
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20325
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Universal adversarial perturbations increase acoustic drone localization RMS error from ~5% to ~37%, with a novel defense reducing it back to ~6%

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first study of adversarial attacks on acoustic drone localization, a previously unexplored area. The authors develop a white-box attack method using projected gradient descent (PGD) to optimize universal adversarial perturbations that mislead acoustic localization models. They also propose a novel defense, "Phase Modulation Perturbation Delineation," which exploits the periodic nature of drone propulsion noise to recover the clean signal from perturbed input. The attack increases localization error from ~5% to ~37%, while the defense reduces it back to ~6%, nearly matching clean performance.

## Method Summary
The attack uses PGD to optimize sine-wave basis amplitudes that form a perturbation sound, which is propagated through a Neural Acoustic Field (NAF) to the microphone array. Gradients from the localization model's loss are backpropagated to update the perturbation amplitudes, maximizing localization error under acoustic feasibility constraints. The defense exploits phase modulation of the drone's propulsion sound: by subtracting sensor samples taken at different phase modulations, the drone's self-sound cancels out, leaving only the differential of the perturbation. This allows recovery of the clean signal.

## Key Results
- Universal adversarial perturbations increase RMS localization error from ~5% to ~37%
- Phase Modulation Perturbation Delineation defense reduces error back to ~6%
- Attack optimization saturates around β=0.5 amplitude constraint and γ=1 power constraint
- Source location optimization provides marginal performance gains (<1% error increase) at ~2-3x computational cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Universal adversarial perturbations optimized via PGD can mislead acoustic localization models by maximizing localization loss under acoustic feasibility constraints.
- **Mechanism:** The attacker optimizes the amplitudes of a sine-wave basis to generate a perturbation sound. This sound is propagated through a differentiable Neural Acoustic Field (NAF) to the microphone array. Gradients from the localization model's loss are backpropagated to update the perturbation amplitudes, maximizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and true locations.
- **Core assumption:** The attacker has white-box access to the localization model and the acoustic environment properties (via the NAF).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...universal adversarial perturbations, optimized via projected gradient descent... can increase localization RMS error from ~5% to ~37%."
  - [section 3.3.2] "We constrain both the amplitude and power of the emitted signal... to avoid trivial perturbations that dominate the clean signal."
  - [corpus] Direct evidence is weak; related papers focus on RF or visual attacks (e.g., "Real-World Adversarial Attacks on RF-Based Drone Detectors") rather than acoustic localization attacks.
- **Break condition:** If the perturbation sound does not propagate effectively to the microphones (e.g., extreme distance or occlusion not modeled by the NAF) or if constraints force the perturbation below the noise floor.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Phase Modulation Perturbation Delineation recovers the clean signal by exploiting the temporal shift-invariance of the external perturbation relative to the drone's self-sound.
- **Mechanism:** The drone actively modulates the phase (temporal offset) of its rotors. Because the external adversarial sound is stationary and independent of the drone's rotors, it remains constant relative to the drone's temporal frame. By subtracting sensor samples taken at different phase modulations, the drone's self-sound cancels out (as it shifts with the phase), leaving only the differential of the perturbation.
- **Core assumption:** The drone's propulsion sound is strictly periodic and can be actively phase-shifted; the perturbation is effectively stationary or periodic with a different known relationship.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...recovers the clean signal from perturbed input by exploiting the periodic nature of drone propulsion noise."
  - [section 3.4.2] "...utilizing the fact that the perturbation sound remains constant under these modulations... sµ(t=j; j) − sµ(t=0; 0) = σp(t=j) − σp(t=0)."
  - [corpus] Weak; standard acoustic localization papers (e.g., "AIM") do not discuss this active defense mechanism.
- **Break condition:** If the "clean" signal is not perfectly periodic or if the act of phase modulation introduces non-linear acoustic artifacts that violate the cancellation assumption.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Neural Acoustic Fields (NAFs) facilitate efficient, differentiable attack optimization by replacing expensive geometric acoustic simulation.
- **Mechanism:** Standard Image Source Models (ISM) are computationally prohibitive for iterative gradient-based attack optimization. NAFs provide a neural approximation of the Room Impulse Response (RIR) that allows for rapid querying of sound propagation (source -> mic) and efficient gradient flow for optimizing the attacker's source location or signal.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-trained NAF generalizes well enough to accurately model the acoustic response of the adversarial source in the environment.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2] "NAFs produce RIRs already encompassing higher-order reflection sources... making the approach... significantly faster."
  - [section 3.3] "This makes the original ISM-based approach... inapplicable for our purposes... we therefore opt [to] develop a modified version... using neural-acoustic fields (NAFs)."
  - [corpus] Related work "AIM" uses acoustic-inertial measurement, but relies on traditional signal processing/SLAM rather than learned acoustic fields for differentiable simulation.
- **Break condition:** If the NAF fails to capture complex environmental acoustics (e.g., dynamic obstacles), causing the simulated attack gradient to diverge from the real-world acoustic response.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Room Impulse Response (RIR)**
  - **Why needed here:** The attack is not a direct digital signal injection but a physical sound wave that must propagate through a room. Understanding RIR is necessary to model how the perturbation changes as it travels from the attacker's speaker to the drone's microphone.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the RIR change if the attacker moves their speaker to a different corner of the room?

- **Concept: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) with Constraints**
  - **Why needed here:** The core attack method. Unlike standard PGD on images, this requires projecting the optimized signal onto frequency and amplitude constraints to ensure the sound is physically realizable and stealthy.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is the perturbation modeled as a sum of sine waves $\sum \alpha_k f_k$ rather than optimizing the raw time-domain waveform directly?

- **Concept: Active Phase Modulation**
  - **Why needed here:** The defense mechanism relies on the drone actively controlling the timing of its own rotors. One must understand that this changes the temporal structure of the "clean" input without affecting the external noise.
  - **Quick check question:** If the external perturbation was also synchronized with the drone's rotors, would the "Phase Modulation Perturbation Delineation" defense still work?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Environment: Matterport3D/Replica scene -> Neural Acoustic Field (NAF) (predicts RIR)
  - Drone: Propulsion Model (Point Sources) + Mic Array + Transformer Encoder (Location Regressor)
  - Attacker: Sine Wave Generator (Optimized params) + Speaker Source
  - Signal Flow: Drone Sound + (Attacker Sound * RIR) -> Mic Array -> Regressor

- **Critical path:** The differentiable path from the Attacker's Amplitude Parameters -> NAF (RIR convolution) -> Transformer Regressor -> Loss. Without a differentiable NAF, you cannot optimize the attack via gradients.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Source Location Optimization:** Optimizing *where* the attacker places the speaker yields marginal performance gains (<1% error increase) but costs ~2-3x GPU memory and runtime (Appendix D). Recommendation: Start with fixed-source (center room) optimization.
  - **Attack Constraints:** Looser bounds (β, γ) increase error but make the sound louder and more detectable. The paper notes a saturation point around β=0.5 where attack efficacy plateaus.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Targeted Attack Failure:** Attempting to force the drone to a specific location fails if the target is in a "high-certainty" region (Supplementary B.2), resulting in error maps identical to clean performance.
  - **Defense Uncertainty:** The defense leaves a scalar uncertainty δ (value at t=0). If this value is large, it may degrade recovery, though the paper claims the effect is marginal (Section 3.4.2).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **NAF Validation:** Verify the NAF accurately reflects the environment by comparing its predicted RIR against a standard geometric simulator (like Pyroomacoustics) for a fixed source-mic pair.
  2. **Universal Attack Loop:** Implement the PGD loop optimizing only the sine wave amplitudes α_k for a fixed source in the center of the room. Plot RMS error vs. iteration.
  3. **Defense Subtraction:** Simulate a "clean" periodic drone sound and a "perturbation." Apply a simulated phase shift to the drone sound, sum them, and verify that subtracting the shifted sum from the unshifted sum isolates the perturbation (up to δ).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can the proposed adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms be effectively extended to 6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) localization scenarios?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in Section 5.2 that "Many real-world localization scenarios incorporate a 6-DoF regression problem, calling for an extension of our contributions to higher-dimension localization."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study explicitly restricts itself to 2D localization with known orientation to isolate the attack analysis.
  - **Evidence:** Successful execution of the PGD attack and perturbation delineation recovery on models regressing both position and orientation in 3D space.

- **Open Question 2:** Can the single scalar uncertainty regarding the perturbation value at t=0 be resolved by imposing correlations across different sensor locations?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 3.4.2 notes that while setting σ_p(t=0) to 0 works, "we believe this value can be retrieved... we defer the study of this possibility to future work."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current Phase Modulation Perturbation Delineation algorithm recovers the clean signal up to one unknown scalar offset.
  - **Evidence:** A modified defense algorithm that mathematically derives or constrains the initial t=0 value rather than defaulting to zero.

- **Open Question 3:** Does source location optimization provide significant benefits over fixed-source attacks in highly non-convex room geometries?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4.2 suggests the conclusion that source location optimization offers marginal benefit might change in "highly non-convex rooms," and the authors "defer exploration of this possibility to future work."
  - **Why unresolved:** In the tested environments, the optimized source tended to remain central; complex geometries might break this symmetry and alter the optimization landscape.
  - **Evidence:** A comparative study of attack success rates with and without location optimization in environments with complex, non-convex architectural features.

## Limitations
- Attack effectiveness relies heavily on white-box access assumptions and precise acoustic modeling via NAFs
- Defense mechanism assumes perfect periodicity of drone propulsion sound and effective phase modulation
- Computational costs for source location optimization are prohibitive for practical deployment
- Paper does not address black-box attack scenarios or defense against adaptive attackers

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core attack mechanism (PGD-optimized perturbations increase RMS error from 5% to 37%) and defense recovery (Phase Modulation Perturbation Delineation reduces error back to ~6%). Results are consistently replicated across environments.
- **Medium Confidence:** Attack efficacy with source location optimization (marginal gains vs. computational cost) and defense performance under varying constraint parameters.
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization to real-world dynamic environments, effectiveness of defense against adaptive or black-box attacks, and computational feasibility for deployment.

## Next Checks
1. **NAF Generalization Test:** Validate NAF predictions against real acoustic measurements in a controlled environment with the same speaker and drone configuration to ensure the attack optimization generalizes beyond simulation.
2. **Defense Robustness Test:** Evaluate the Phase Modulation Perturbation Delineation under non-ideal conditions—introduce timing jitter, imperfect periodicity, or synchronization errors between drone and perturbation to assess failure modes.
3. **Black-Box Attack Test:** Implement a transfer-based attack where the perturbation is optimized on one model (e.g., transformer-encoder) and tested against a different acoustic localization architecture to evaluate real-world feasibility.
