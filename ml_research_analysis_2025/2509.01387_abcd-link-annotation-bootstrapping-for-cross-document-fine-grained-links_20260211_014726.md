# ABCD-LINK: Annotation Bootstrapping for Cross-Document Fine-Grained Links

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.01387
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01387
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Bootstraps annotation for sentence-level cross-document links without pre-existing labeled data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently annotating sentence-level cross-document links, which are crucial for applications like fact-checking, media analysis, and peer review assessment. Manual annotation is costly and datasets are scarce, especially for subjective or ideological link types. The authors propose a framework that bootstraps annotation without requiring pre-existing labeled data. It generates and validates semi-synthetic linked document pairs using LLMs, uses these to benchmark and shortlist linking approaches, and applies the best-performing methods in large-scale human-in-the-loop annotation. Applied to peer review and news domains, the approach achieves a 73% human approval rate for suggested links, more than doubling the acceptance rate of retrieval alone. The framework enables efficient dataset creation for cross-document linking tasks while reducing annotation effort.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in three steps: First, it generates and validates semi-synthetic datasets of linked documents using LLMs to create source documents with explicit sentence-level links to target documents. Second, it uses these synthetic datasets to benchmark and shortlist linking approaches (retrievers and LLM classifiers). Third, it applies the best-performing approach in large-scale human-in-the-loop annotation, where annotators evaluate model-suggested candidate links rather than exhaustively searching for all possible links. The best configuration uses Dragon+ retriever to narrow candidates to top-k, then Qwen2.5 LLM with listwise prompting and domain-specific link descriptions to classify links.

## Key Results
- 73% human approval rate for R+LLM approach, more than doubling acceptance of strong retrievers alone
- Human annotation time reduced from ~30 to ~15 minutes per document pair while annotating 10x more links
- R+LLM achieves 0.77 recall on news and 0.59 recall on reviews at high precision
- Synthetic data enables approach benchmarking without human-labeled data in new domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semi-Synthetic Data as Evaluation Surrogate
LLM-generated linked document pairs substitute for human-labeled data when selecting linking approaches. The synthetic pairs are validated for fluency and coherence, then used to benchmark retrieval and classification methods. The relative ranking of approaches is preserved between synthetic and natural document pairs because the core linking task (identifying semantic/discourse relations) remains consistent.

### Mechanism 2: Retrieval-then-LLM Classification (R+LLM)
Combining dense retriever with LLM classification substantially outperforms retrieval alone. Retrieval narrows candidate space to top-k target sentences, filtering distractors while maintaining high recall. The LLM then performs task-aware binary classification with full document context, capturing implicit relations that similarity-based retrieval misses. Listwise prompting allows global comparison of candidates.

### Mechanism 3: Human-in-the-Loop with Pre-Filtered Candidates
Presenting annotators with model-preselected candidates dramatically reduces annotation effort while maintaining quality. Instead of exhaustive annotation, annotators evaluate only top-k candidates per source sentence with full document context visible. This approach maintains quality while reducing annotation time by 50%.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Dense vs. Sparse Retrieval
  - **Why needed here:** Framework benchmarks both types (BM25, SPLADE vs. Dragon+, SFR) to select best retriever for each domain.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a sparse model outperform dense models on technical documents with domain-specific terminology? (Hint: lexical matching)

- **Concept:** Zero-Shot Classification with LLMs
  - **Why needed here:** No labeled data exists for new domains; LLMs adapt via prompting with link descriptions and examples.
  - **Quick check question:** What's the trade-off between pairwise vs. listwise prompting for candidate classification? (Hint: context, inference cost)

- **Concept:** Inter-Annotator Agreement (Cohen's κ)
  - **Why needed here:** Validating annotation quality for subjective linking tasks; paper reports κ=0.59-0.60 as "substantial."
  - **Quick check question:** Why is high agreement harder for linking tasks than for factual extraction? (Hint: subjectivity, link definition ambiguity)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Synthetic Generator (DeepSeek-R1) → Retrieval Layer (Dragon+, SPLADE, etc.) → LLM Classifier (Qwen2.5) → Annotation Interface (INCEpTION)
- **Critical path:** Synthetic data generation → retriever benchmarking → LLM configuration (listwise + description + examples) → human annotation with R+LLM candidates
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - k cutoff: Higher k increases recall but adds annotation load (paper uses k=10 for news, k=20 for reviews)
  - Model selection: Larger LLMs (GPT-4o) slightly better on some domains; open-source (Qwen2.5) offers cost/privacy benefits
  - "Both" (intersection) strategy: Higher precision (77% acceptance) but lower recall; "R+LLM only" is more balanced
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low acceptance rate + high κ: Model candidates systematically wrong (check link definition in prompt)
  - High acceptance rate for random distractors: Annotators not discriminating (check annotation guidelines)
  - Synthetic evaluation diverges from human results: Synthetic links too easy/unnatural (increase complexity in generation prompts)
  - LLM-only underperforms retriever-only: Target document too long, LLM overwhelmed
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate synthetic data generation on your domain: prompt an LLM to generate 20-50 linked document pairs, validate coherence manually before trusting evaluation results
  2. Ablate retrieval vs. R+LLM: Measure acceptance rate difference with human review on ~10 document pairs
  3. Test prompt configurations: Compare no_guidance vs. description+examples for your specific link type; expect 5-15% F1 difference

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Multi-modal linking extension:** How to support linking involving figures and tables in scientific documents where essential information appears in non-textual elements.
- **Domain generalization:** Whether the framework generalizes to domains beyond peer reviews and news, such as legal documents, medical records, or multi-party conversation threads.
- **Hallucination detection:** Impact of LLM hallucinations on synthetic link quality and how to systematically detect and mitigate them.
- **Targeted generation strategies:** Whether prompting for individual sentence-level links or applying multi-pass generation could improve coverage and realism of synthetic linking datasets.

## Limitations

- Synthetic data transfer assumption: The framework assumes approach rankings transfer from synthetic to natural data, but this remains unproven beyond tested domains
- Domain specificity: Results are limited to peer review and news domains; effectiveness for other domains (legal, medical, social media) is untested
- Computational cost: R+LLM requires multiple LLM invocations per source sentence, which may become prohibitive for large-scale deployment

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Human-in-the-loop annotation efficiency gains (15 vs 30 minutes, 10x more links) and superiority of retrieval-then-LLM over retrieval alone are well-supported by human evaluation results (73% acceptance rate)
- **Medium Confidence:** Synthetic data benchmarking approach works well for tested domains, but generalization to new domains requires validation
- **Low Confidence:** Framework's performance on documents with very long target texts (>150 sentences) is questionable, as authors had to filter such documents

## Next Checks

1. **Synthetic-to-Natural Transfer Test:** Generate synthetic linked pairs in a new domain, benchmark retrievers and LLMs on synthetic data, then measure if the same ranking holds on 10-20 manually annotated natural pairs.

2. **Recall Distribution Analysis:** For a subset of documents, annotate exhaustively (all possible links) to verify that valid links are indeed concentrated in top-k rankings, and quantify the recall-cost trade-off at different k values.

3. **Domain Transfer Experiment:** Apply the exact framework (prompts, retrievers, k values) to a third domain without modification, measuring acceptance rate and comparing to domain-tuned configurations.
