# Pure Exploration with Feedback Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.07824
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07824
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Derives instance-specific lower bounds and introduces TaS-FG algorithm achieving asymptotic optimality for pure exploration with feedback graphs

## Executive Summary
This paper studies pure exploration with feedback graphs, where the feedback structure is represented by a directed graph that may be unknown and stochastic. The authors establish information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity and introduce TaS-FG, an algorithm that achieves asymptotic optimality in both informed and uninformed settings. A key theoretical contribution is showing that Bernoulli rewards lead to unidentifiability issues in the uninformed setting, while continuous rewards admit finite information rates.

## Method Summary
The authors derive instance-specific lower bounds on sample complexity for pure exploration with feedback graphs. They show that Bernoulli rewards cause unidentifiability in the uninformed setting, while continuous rewards allow finite information rates. The TaS-FG algorithm is introduced, combining techniques from bandit literature with feedback graph structure. The algorithm uses a two-stage approach with adaptive sampling based on confidence intervals and graph structure, achieving asymptotic optimality by matching the derived lower bounds as confidence approaches zero.

## Key Results
- Instance-specific lower bounds on sample complexity for both informed and uninformed feedback graph settings
- TaS-FG algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality, matching lower bounds as confidence approaches zero
- Demonstration that Bernoulli rewards lead to unidentifiability in uninformed settings, while continuous rewards admit finite information rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper leverages information-theoretic analysis to establish fundamental limits on sample complexity for pure exploration with feedback graphs. The key insight is that the feedback structure creates dependencies between arm pulls, allowing information about multiple arms to be gathered simultaneously. By carefully analyzing these dependencies through the lens of directed graphs and stochastic processes, the authors derive tight lower bounds that characterize the inherent difficulty of the problem. The TaS-FG algorithm exploits these structural properties by adaptively sampling arms based on both observed rewards and feedback graph structure.

## Foundational Learning

**Directed graphs and feedback structure**: Why needed - to model dependencies between arm pulls; Quick check - verify understanding of graph connectivity concepts and transitive feedback

**Information-theoretic lower bounds**: Why needed - to establish fundamental limits on sample complexity; Quick check - review Fano's inequality and its application to bandit problems

**Stochastic processes and martingales**: Why needed - to analyze adaptive sampling algorithms; Quick check - understand optional stopping theorem and concentration inequalities for martingales

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: TaS-FG -> Confidence interval calculation -> Feedback graph update -> Arm selection policy -> Sampling execution

**Critical path**: The algorithm follows a sequential decision-making process where each iteration involves updating confidence intervals, observing feedback graph structure, and selecting the next arm to sample based on the current information state.

**Design tradeoffs**: The paper balances between exploration (gathering information about all arms) and exploitation (focusing on promising arms), while accounting for the additional complexity introduced by feedback graphs. The choice between Bernoulli and continuous rewards represents a fundamental tradeoff between model simplicity and identifiability.

**Failure signatures**: Performance degradation in highly connected graphs where feedback becomes less informative; failure to identify the optimal arm when confidence thresholds are set too conservatively; increased sample complexity in graphs with poor connectivity between arms.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Compare TaS-FG against EXP3.G on simple line and star graph topologies
2. Test Bernoulli vs continuous reward performance on identical graph structures
3. Evaluate algorithm performance as graph connectivity varies from sparse to dense

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Assumes independent arms, limiting applicability to settings with structured reward dependencies
- Asymptotic optimality analysis may not reflect finite-sample performance in practice
- Unidentifiability result for Bernoulli rewards in uninformed settings restricts the class of solvable problems

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Theoretical lower bounds for both informed and uninformed settings; asymptotic optimality of TaS-FG; Bernoulli unidentifiability result

**Medium confidence**: Practical performance claims from numerical experiments; finite-sample behavior near theoretical bounds

**Low confidence**: Performance in highly connected feedback graphs; impact of feedback graph estimation errors

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate TaS-FG on feedback graphs with varying degrees and community structures to assess scalability
2. Conduct experiments measuring finite-sample performance relative to theoretical bounds for different confidence levels
3. Test robustness to feedback graph estimation errors by introducing controlled noise in the observed feedback structure
