# Text-VQA Aug: Pipelined Harnessing of Large Multimodal Models for Automated Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.02046
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02046
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Automated pipeline produces 72,490 QA pairs from 44,581 images using modular LMMs for text-VQA data synthesis

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an automated pipeline that harnesses multiple pre-trained large multimodal models to synthesize high-quality question-answer pairs for text-based visual question answering (text-VQA). The approach addresses the challenge of generating large-scale training data by combining text spotting, object grounding, captioning, and question generation modules in sequence. By processing images from OpenImages V5 and leveraging specialized models like GLASS for OCR, Kosmos-2 for grounding, LLaVA-R for captioning, and Intel Neural Chat 7B for question generation, the pipeline produces a dataset of 72,490 QA pairs with high precision. The method demonstrates scalability and reduces reliance on manual annotation while maintaining quality through algorithmic validation steps.

## Method Summary
The method employs a pipelined approach using frozen pre-trained models for each stage: text spotting with GLASS extracts OCR tokens and bounding boxes; Kosmos-2 performs object grounding to identify relevant regions; LLaVA-R generates captions for each crop with optional OCR token prompts; an algorithmic answer selection process identifies OCR groups present in the aggregated image description; Intel Neural Chat 7B generates questions based on the description and answer; and finally, the same LLM validates QA pairs for correctness. The pipeline processes images from OpenImages V5, curating 44,581 unique images into 72,490 QA pairs through sequential processing and validation filters including length constraints and hallucination detection.

## Key Results
- Successfully produced 72,490 QA pairs from 44,581 unique images
- Achieved 96.7% unique questions across the dataset
- Demonstrated scalability with approximately 1.6 questions per image
- Validated output quality through LLM-based hallucination filtering
- Showed modular approach reduces manual annotation requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Modular Decomposition with Specialized LMMs
The pipeline decomposes text-VQA synthesis into sequential specialized subtasks, where each LMM operates within its training distribution. GLASS handles OCR detection and recognition, Kosmos-2 performs zero-shot grounding, LLaVA-R generates text-aware captions, and Intel Neural Chat 7B creates questions. Structured intermediate outputs with explicit handoffs reduce compound error propagation through algorithmic validation at each stage.

### Mechanism 2: OCR-Token Alignment with Image Description for Answer Selection
The answer selection algorithm creates a boolean mask over the image description, marking tokens present in the OCR list. Consecutive masked tokens are grouped into candidate answers, filtered by substring removal and stop-word exclusion. This grounds answers in both visual-textual evidence (OCR) and semantic context (caption).

### Mechanism 3: LLM-Based Post-Processing for Hallucination Filtering
After QA synthesis, the same LLM prompts with image description, question, and answer to output binary "Right"/"Wrong" judgments. This self-consistency check removes pairs where answers are incomplete or contextually inappropriate, along with length-based filtering (5-50 tokens).

## Foundational Learning

- **Text Spotting (OCR Detection + Recognition)**: Why needed here - The pipeline's first stage requires extracting all visible text from scene images; errors here propagate to every downstream module. Quick check: Can you distinguish between text detection (localization) and text recognition (transcription), and explain why an end-to-end spotter like GLASS combines both?

- **Visual Grounding**: Why needed here - Kosmos-2 identifies object regions associated with scene text, enabling caption generation with local context rather than whole-image ambiguity. Quick check: Given an image with multiple text regions, how would a grounding model determine which bounding box corresponds to "the brand on the blue bottle"?

- **Instruction-Tuned LMMs (e.g., LLaVA-R)**: Why needed here - Caption generation must integrate visual features with explicit OCR tokens; instruction tuning improves adherence to prompts like "Focusing on the texts present in the image...". Quick check: Why might a standard vision-language model struggle to caption text-rich images compared to an instruction-tuned variant trained on text-heavy corpora?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Image Curator -> Text Spotter (GLASS) -> Grounding Module (Kosmos-2) -> Alignment Module -> Caption Generator (LLaVA-R) -> Caption Aggregator -> Answer Selector (Algorithm 1) -> Question Generator (Intel Neural Chat 7B) -> QA Validator

- **Critical path**: GLASS OCR extraction -> Kosmos-2 grounding -> alignment -> LLaVA-R captioning -> aggregation -> answer selection -> question generation -> validation. Failure at steps 2-4 starves downstream modules of context.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Local vs. global context: Cropping improves caption precision but loses scene-level relationships; concatenation is a naive aggregation strategy that may introduce redundancy
  - Training-free vs. fine-tuned: Pipeline uses frozen pre-trained models for scalability but cannot adapt to domain-specific failure modes
  - Precision vs. recall in validation: Aggressive length and correctness filtering reduces noise but may discard valid edge-case QA pairs

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low OCR token count (<3 per image) -> sparse or generic questions
  - Small background objects -> grounding misses relevant regions -> captions lack critical context
  - Unit/entity mismatches -> questions like "how far" receive answers without units
  - LLM hallucination -> plausible-but-unsupported QA pairs passing initial generation but caught (or missed) by validator

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation on grounding: Disable Kosmos-2 cropping, pass full images to LLaVA-R, measure QA pair quality and throughput
  2. Alternative aggregation strategies: Replace caption concatenation with LLM-based summarization; compare global description coherence
  3. Validator stress test: Manually annotate a subset of filtered and retained QA pairs; compute precision/recall of the LLM validator against human judgments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
To what extent does pre-training on the Text-VQA Aug synthesized dataset improve the accuracy of specialist text-VQA models on standard benchmarks compared to models trained solely on human-annotated data? The paper concludes that the dataset "can be leveraged by any text-VQA specialist model for its pre-training," but provides no experimental results validating that this synthetic data actually improves downstream model performance.

### Open Question 2
How can the pipeline be modified to robustly handle images containing sparse scene-text, where current modules fail to generate meaningful context? Section 5 states the pipeline struggles when there's very little text in images, noting that the LLM faces challenges generating QA pairs from few OCR tokens, but presents this as an observed failure mode without proposing a solution.

### Open Question 3
Can the answer selection algorithm be enhanced to handle semantic units and context (such as associating "12" with "KMs") without manual correction? Section 5 highlights a failure case where the model includes "12" in the answer but fails to associate the unit "KMs" with the question "how far," suggesting manual correction or sophisticated logic is needed.

## Limitations

- Pipeline performance on diverse text-VQA scenarios (complex layouts, low legibility, specialized terminology) remains untested
- Reliance on pre-trained models without fine-tuning limits adaptation to domain-specific challenges
- Effectiveness of LLM-based validation depends on validator accuracy, which is not quantified

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The pipeline can produce QA pairs at scale (72,490 pairs from 44,581 images) using the described modular approach
- **Medium Confidence**: OCR-token alignment with image description improves answer relevance versus random selection is plausible but lacks direct comparative evidence
- **Medium Confidence**: LLM-based post-processing reduces hallucination noise is supported by validation step inclusion but depends on validator accuracy
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that this pipeline is superior to end-to-end generation for text-VQA synthesis is weakly supported

## Next Checks

1. **Validator Performance Evaluation**: Manually annotate a stratified sample of QA pairs (including filtered-out and retained pairs) to compute precision, recall, and F1-score of the LLM validator against human judgments

2. **Ablation Study on Answer Selection**: Compare the current OCR-based answer selection algorithm against baseline methods (random selection, frequency-based selection) using metrics like answer relevance scores

3. **Cross-Scenario Robustness Test**: Evaluate the pipeline on text-VQA datasets with varying characteristics (different text layouts, languages, legibility levels) and report per-category QA pair quality and generation success rates
