# Categorical Invariants of Learning Dynamics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04376
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04376
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Networks converging via homotopic optimization paths achieve similar generalization performance (within 0.5% accuracy), while non-homotopic paths differ by over 3%.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a categorical framework for understanding neural network learning, viewing training as a structure-preserving functor between parameter and representation spaces. The framework reveals that networks converging via homotopic optimization paths achieve similar generalization performance (within 0.5% accuracy), while non-homotopic paths differ by over 3%. The author demonstrates that persistent homology of loss landscapes predicts generalization with R² = 0.82 correlation, and transfer learning emerges as a pullback construction. The categorical perspective provides both theoretical insights into why deep learning works and practical algorithms for computing homotopy classes, identifying stable minima, and implementing efficient transfer learning.

## Method Summary
The framework formalizes learning as a functor L: Param → Rep mapping parameter configurations to representations while preserving composition. Three core algorithms implement this theory: homotopy detection via linear interpolation against loss barriers, persistent homology computation of loss landscapes through sampling, and pullback transfer learning by composing domain morphisms with fine-tuning. The empirical validation trains ensembles of networks with varying hyperparameters, computes homotopy classes and persistence diagrams, then correlates these topological invariants with generalization performance across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and transfer learning tasks.

## Key Results
- Networks converging via homotopic trajectories generalize within 0.5% accuracy of each other, while non-homotopic paths differ by over 3%
- Persistent homology of loss landscapes predicts generalization gap with R² = 0.82 correlation on CIFAR-10
- Transfer learning emerges as a pullback construction, achieving >95% of standard transfer accuracy with >50% time savings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Networks converging via homotopic optimization paths achieve similar generalization (within 0.5%), while non-homotopic paths differ by over 3%
- Homotopic paths lie within the same connected basin of the loss landscape. Since generalization correlates with basin flatness, paths deformable without crossing high-loss barriers explore equivalent solution regions and thus converge to minima with similar generalization properties.
- Core assumption: Loss barriers between paths indicate qualitatively different basins; flat minima generalize better
- Evidence: MNIST experiment shows 7 homotopy classes with within-class variation <0.5% and between-class >3%
- Break condition: If loss landscape has high barriers even within single basins, or if flatness does not correlate with generalization on your task

### Mechanism 2
- Total persistence of loss landscape features correlates with generalization gap (R² = 0.82 on CIFAR-10)
- Persistent homology tracks topological features across loss thresholds. Long-lived features correspond to flat, stable basins; short-lived features indicate sharp minima. Flat basins generalize better because small parameter perturbations preserve representation structure.
- Core assumption: The sampling radius and density capture relevant topological structure; persistence computed locally generalizes to test performance
- Evidence: 50 ResNet-18 networks on CIFAR-10 show Gap = -0.034·Pers + 0.12, R² = 0.82
- Break condition: If sampling radius is too small or too large, or if architecture/dataset differs substantially

### Mechanism 3
- Learning can be formalized as a structure-preserving functor L: Param → Rep that preserves composition
- The functor maps parameter configurations to representations and optimization trajectories to representation paths, satisfying L(γ₂ ∘ γ₁) = L(γ₂) ∘ L(γ₁). This constrains how representations can evolve during training.
- Core assumption: Representation changes during training are smooth and preserve pairwise distance relationships
- Evidence: Theorem 2.6 with proof sketch for identity and composition preservation; numerical verification shows torch.norm(diff) < 1e-5
- Break condition: If representations change discontinuously during training, or if different network architectures require different representation mappings

## Foundational Learning

- **Category Theory Basics (Categories, Functors)**: The entire framework formalizes learning as a functor between categories. Without understanding objects, morphisms, and functoriality, the theoretical claims are inaccessible.
  - Quick check: Given two morphisms f: A → B and g: B → C, what is their composition g ∘ f, and what property must a functor F satisfy regarding composition?

- **Homotopy Theory**: The paper's core empirical claim rests on homotopy classes predicting generalization. You must understand when two paths are "continuously deformable" to interpret results.
  - Quick check: Two paths γ₀ and γ₁ from point A to point B are homotopic if there exists a continuous map H(s,t) satisfying what four boundary conditions?

- **Persistent Homology**: The paper uses persistence diagrams to quantify basin flatness and predict generalization. Understanding birth, death, and persistence of topological features is essential for applying this method.
  - Quick check: In a persistence diagram, what does a point far from the diagonal (large d_i - b_i) represent compared to a point near the diagonal?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: ParamCategory -> LearningFunctor -> are_homotopic -> compute_persistence_diagram -> PullbackTransfer
- **Critical path**: 1) Start with are_homotopic on saved trajectories to test homotopy-generalization on your dataset; 2) If promising, integrate compute_persistence_diagram during training for model selection; 3) For transfer tasks, use PullbackTransfer with frozen encoder
- **Design tradeoffs**: Homotopy detection is O(N²) pairwise comparisons — prohibitive for >10⁴ trajectories; persistence computation requires 5000+ loss evaluations per checkpoint; Pullback transfer saves 75% time but may lose ~2% accuracy vs. full fine-tuning
- **Failure signatures**: Homotopy detection returns false negatives when loss barrier threshold is too conservative; persistence shows no correlation with generalization → sampling radius wrong or dataset too small; Pullback transfer underperforms significantly → domain morphism poorly specified
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train 20+ networks on your dataset with varying hyperparameters; compute homotopy classes; verify within-class accuracy variance < between-class variance; 2) For each converged model, compute persistence diagram; fit linear model Gap = α·Pers + β; confirm R² > 0.5 before using persistence for model selection; 3) Compare three conditions on a transfer task — (a) from scratch, (b) standard fine-tuning, (c) pullback (frozen encoder); verify pullback achieves >95% of standard transfer accuracy with >50% time savings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the learning functor L preserve all limits, and what are the implications for multi-task learning architectures?
- Basis: Section 12.1 lists "Limit Preservation" as the first theoretical open problem
- Why unresolved: Unknown if optimal shared representations in parameter space automatically induce optimal representations in Rep space without specific regularization
- What evidence would resolve it: A mathematical proof that L preserves limits, or a counter-example demonstrating failure in specific multi-task architectures

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can generalization error be formally bounded using persistent homology features, effectively connecting topological invariants to VC dimension or Rademacher complexity?
- Basis: Section 12.1, "Persistence and VC Dimension," asks for the precise relationship between these measures
- Why unresolved: The paper currently establishes only empirical correlation (R² = 0.82) rather than a rigorous theoretical bound
- What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of a formal generalization bound dependent on the total persistence of the loss landscape

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do homotopy classes predict generalization performance at large scales (e.g., ImageNet) as effectively as observed on MNIST and CIFAR-10?
- Basis: Section 12.3 proposes a "Large-Scale Homotopy Study" to validate the framework beyond small datasets
- Why unresolved: Current experimental validation is limited to small datasets with relatively few trajectories (N=100)
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on ImageNet showing that within-class accuracy variation remains significantly lower than between-class variation

## Limitations

- The empirical claims rely heavily on specific experimental conditions that may not generalize to different architectures or optimization regimes
- The persistence-generalization correlation was demonstrated on ResNet-18/CIFAR-10 specifically, and the sampling methodology depends critically on parameter scaling assumptions that remain unspecified
- The functorial formulation assumes smooth, distance-preserving representation evolution, which may break down with certain architectures or training instabilities

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mathematical formalism of categories and functors is sound and well-established. The homotopy definition and persistence homology computations are standard techniques with clear implementations.
- **Medium Confidence**: The empirical link between homotopy classes and generalization is supported by the MNIST experiments but requires replication on diverse architectures and datasets. The persistence-generalization correlation needs validation across multiple network families.
- **Low Confidence**: The practical algorithms (homotopy detection, persistence computation, pullback transfer) depend on sensitive hyperparameters (loss thresholds, sampling radii) whose optimal values may vary substantially across tasks.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Reproduce the homotopy-generalization link on Vision Transformers and MLPs beyond the two-layer architecture tested, measuring within/between class accuracy variance.

2. **Persistence scaling study**: Systematically vary the sampling radius relative to parameter norms across multiple architectures to determine when persistence diagrams capture meaningful basin structure versus noise.

3. **Functorial consistency test**: Implement the functor verification algorithm on architectures with known representation discontinuities (e.g., batch normalization, residual connections) to identify where the functorial assumption breaks down.
