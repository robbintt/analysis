# A New Approach for Knowledge Generation Using Active Inference

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.15105
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15105
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Introduces active inference model generating declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge through perception-action loops minimizing free energy

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a unified framework for generating different types of knowledge using active inference principles. The model employs perception-driven inference for declarative knowledge, action-based minimization of expected free energy for procedural knowledge, and simultaneous operation of both loops for conditional knowledge emergence. By treating concepts as hidden variables inferred from sensory stimuli through probabilistic mathematics, the framework enables unsupervised learning and self-updating capabilities. The approach contrasts with semantic networks by integrating learning and inference into a single free energy minimization framework.

## Method Summary
The method implements a generative model where concepts are hidden variables inferred from sensory stimuli through Bayesian inference. Loop I performs passive perception-based inference to generate declarative knowledge by updating beliefs to minimize divergence between recognition density and true posterior. Loop II enables active inference where actions are selected to minimize expected free energy, altering sensory inputs to reduce surprise and generate procedural knowledge. Conditional knowledge emerges when both loops operate simultaneously, allowing context-appropriate application of knowledge. The model uses Dirichlet priors for categorical distributions and Bayesian nonparametric methods for unsupervised model expansion.

## Key Results
- Successfully generates declarative knowledge through perception-driven Bayesian inference minimizing free energy
- Produces procedural knowledge via active inference policies that minimize expected free energy through environmental action
- Emerges conditional knowledge from simultaneous operation of perception and action loops
- Demonstrates unsupervised learning capability with self-updating through novel stimulus processing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Declarative knowledge emerges from perception-driven inference that minimizes prediction error without environmental action.
- Mechanism: Loop I operates as pure Bayesian inference—prediction errors update internal beliefs (μ) by minimizing divergence between recognition density q(θ|μ) and true posterior p(θ|ϕ). This is mathematically equivalent to semantic network concept generation but formalized through free energy minimization rather than associative strength.
- Core assumption: Concepts are hidden variables that cannot be directly observed; they must be inferred probabilistically from sensory stimuli through a generative model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the perception process is used to generate declarative knowledge"
  - [section 5, p.9] "Loop I includes prediction, perception, and brain error. If the inference is passive (environment is not affected by agent), loop I is the brain's only functional process on sensory stimuli."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; related work on declarative/procedural distinctions exists (ACT-R modules paper) but doesn't validate this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If concepts can be directly observed (not hidden), the inference layer collapses and the model reduces to standard pattern matching.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Procedural knowledge is generated through active inference, where actions are selected to minimize expected free energy by altering sensory inputs.
- Mechanism: Loop II enables policy selection (π) that maximizes accuracy through action. The agent doesn't just update beliefs—it changes environmental states to reduce surprise. Expected Free Energy (G) determines policy probabilities via softmax, and actions modify stimuli to match prior beliefs. This creates learned behavioral sequences (procedures).
- Core assumption: Agents can influence their sensory environment through action; minimizing free energy through action is functionally equivalent to skill acquisition.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The proposed model is unsupervised learning that can update itself using a combination of different stimuli as a generative model"
  - [section 5, p.9-10] "Loop II is enabled which includes a predictive error, policy selection, and appropriate action... learning the concepts that under different actions, by receiving sensory stimuli, generate procedural knowledge."
  - [corpus] "Think in Games" paper notes gap between declarative and procedural knowledge in LLMs, indirectly supporting need for action-based procedural learning.
- Break condition: If the environment is fully uncontrollable or if actions don't reduce prediction error, procedural knowledge generation fails—the loop never stabilizes into reusable procedures.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Conditional knowledge emerges from simultaneous activation of both loops—applying declarative concepts while executing procedural routines.
- Mechanism: When both Loop I and Loop II operate together, the agent extracts concepts from semantic memory (declarative) while performing automatic actions (procedural). This integration enables context-appropriate application of knowledge—the "when and why" of knowledge use.
- Core assumption: Declarative and procedural systems can operate concurrently without interference, and their integration produces emergent conditional knowledge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5, p.10, Table 2] Shows conditional knowledge examples: "riding a bike" (procedural + declarative context), "using a map" (procedural skills + declarative route knowledge)
  - [section 5, p.10] "If both loops are active the agent can perform the desired actions on the environment... simultaneously with the extraction and application of concepts... it means the generation of conditional knowledge."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation for this specific integration mechanism.
- Break condition: If loops interfere (action disrupts perception, or perception stalls action), conditional knowledge fragments into isolated declarative or procedural components.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Bayesian Inference & Variational Free Energy**
  - Why needed here: The entire model frames knowledge generation as probabilistic inference. Without understanding posterior updates, KL divergence, and free energy as a bound on surprise, the mathematics are opaque.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why minimizing free energy is equivalent to minimizing prediction error under a generative model?

- Concept: **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) / Partially Observable MDPs**
  - Why needed here: The model uses hidden states (θ), transition matrices (B), observation likelihood (A), and policies (π) in a discrete-time decision framework.
  - Quick check question: Given a state transition matrix B and policy π, how would you compute the probability of reaching state θ at time τ?

- Concept: **Dirichlet Distributions & Bayesian Nonparametrics**
  - Why needed here: The model uses Dirichlet priors for categorical distributions over concepts and stimuli, and Bayesian nonparametric methods for unsupervised model expansion.
  - Quick check question: Why is a Dirichlet distribution appropriate as a conjugate prior for categorical/multinomial likelihoods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **A matrix** (m×n): Likelihood mapping from hidden concepts to observable stimuli. Binary or probabilistic—each entry p(r_j|s_i) represents stimulus generation probability.
  - **B matrix**: Transition probabilities between hidden concepts over time, conditioned on policy.
  - **D vector**: Prior distribution over initial concepts.
  - **G (Expected Free Energy)**: Policy evaluation function that balances epistemic (information-seeking) and pragmatic (goal-achieving) value.
  - **Loop I path**: Stimuli → Perception → Belief update (μ) → Concept inference → Declarative knowledge
  - **Loop II path**: Prediction error → Policy selection (π) → Action → Environment modification → Stimuli change → Procedural knowledge

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize generative model with A, B, D matrices (can start random or with priors)
  2. Receive sensory stimuli ϕ
  3. Compute prediction error: divergence between expected and actual stimuli
  4. **Branch point**: If error resolvable by belief update → Loop I only (declarative). If action required → engage Loop II (procedural/conditional).
  5. Update μ (beliefs) and/or execute action a under policy π
  6. Expand model if stimuli don't map to existing concepts (new concept generation)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Discrete vs. continuous concepts**: Paper assumes discrete (categorical), enabling Dirichlet priors but losing gradient information.
  - **Loop coupling strength**: Tightly coupled loops enable rich conditional knowledge but risk interference; loosely coupled loops are stable but may miss context.
  - **Model expansion rate**: Aggressive new-concept generation handles novelty but increases entropy H(S); conservative expansion maintains low entropy but may fail to represent environment.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Runaway entropy**: If new concepts generated faster than free energy can be minimized, H(S) grows unbounded—cognitive overload analog.
  - **Action-perception decoupling**: If Loop II actions don't meaningfully alter stimuli, policies become random and procedural knowledge doesn't form.
  - **Concept collapse**: If A matrix becomes singular (concepts map to identical stimuli), inference can't distinguish concepts.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Concept-stimulus mapping validation**: Implement binary A matrix with 5 concepts and 8 stimuli. Present stimulus combinations and verify inferred concepts match expected declarative knowledge. Measure inference accuracy and free energy at convergence.
  2. **Procedural loop activation test**: Design a simple environment where prediction error can only be reduced through action (not belief update). Verify Loop II engagement and measure policy convergence time. Compare against passive inference baseline.
  3. **Model expansion stress test**: Present novel stimulus combinations that don't match existing concepts. Measure: (a) whether new concepts are generated, (b) entropy change, (c) free energy stabilization time. Tune λ parameter to optimize exploration-exploitation balance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the proposed model effectively generate concepts using semantic or abstract stimuli in the absence of direct sensory inputs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "in the continuation of this research... semantic or abstract stimuli can also be considered in the brain, which can generate new concepts without sensory stimuli."
- Why unresolved: The current mathematical framework relies on probabilistic mappings from sensory stimuli ($R$) to concepts ($S$); the mechanism for processing non-sensory "abstract" stimuli remains undefined in the provided equations.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of the generative model equations (specifically the $A$ matrix likelihood mapping) to include abstract internal states, validated by simulations where concepts are formed without external sensory data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the active inference knowledge generation model be applied to diagnose or control cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer’s disease?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion suggests that in the context of cognitive diseases like Alzheimer’s, "it is possible to control the disease based on the process of producing semantic or procedural knowledge."
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a theoretical model of knowledge generation but does not map specific model parameters (e.g., priors, precision) to pathological states found in Alzheimer's patients.
- What evidence would resolve it: Clinical or simulation studies showing that adjusting specific free energy minimization parameters in the model correlates with improved retention of declarative or procedural knowledge in affected agents.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed active inference model compared to standard semantic networks when implemented in intelligent machines?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion lists the examination of the model's application in "specific examples, such as knowledge generation in intelligent machines" as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: While the paper theoretically contrasts the two approaches (Section 6), it does not provide empirical data or benchmarks regarding computational cost or prediction accuracy in a real or simulated machine learning environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the active inference model on a robotic platform or agent and benchmarking its unsupervised concept learning speed and error rates against traditional semantic network implementations.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks concrete algorithmic specifications for Bayesian nonparametric learning and dynamic matrix expansion when encountering novel stimuli
- No empirical validation or implementation details are provided to demonstrate practical feasibility
- The "dark room problem" where agents might minimize surprise by avoiding informative stimuli is not addressed
- The discrete concept assumption may limit scalability compared to continuous representations used in modern neural architectures

## Confidence
- **Declarative knowledge mechanism (High)**: The perception-driven inference via free energy minimization is well-established in active inference literature and mathematically coherent.
- **Procedural knowledge mechanism (Medium)**: The action-based minimization of expected free energy is theoretically sound, but practical implementation details and convergence properties are unclear.
- **Conditional knowledge emergence (Low)**: The claim that simultaneous loop operation produces conditional knowledge is largely speculative without empirical validation or clear mechanistic explanation.

## Next Checks
1. **Mathematical validation of loop interaction**: Formally prove whether concurrent operation of Loop I and Loop II produces emergent conditional knowledge or merely parallel processing of declarative and procedural components.
2. **Simulation with concrete parameters**: Implement the full model with specific A, B, D matrices and validate that Loop II actions actually reduce prediction error in environments where passive inference fails.
3. **Scalability stress test**: Measure entropy H(S) growth rate and inference accuracy when continuously presenting novel stimulus combinations to test the Bayesian nonparametric expansion mechanism under realistic conditions.
