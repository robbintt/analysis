# Evaluating Implicit Biases in LLM Reasoning through Logic Grid Puzzles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06160
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06160
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: PRIME framework reveals LLMs perform best on stereotype-aligned logic puzzles and worst on anti-stereotype variants

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PRIME, a novel logic puzzle-based framework for evaluating implicit social biases in large language model (LLM) reasoning. The framework generates stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle triplets to measure how stereotypes influence deductive inference. Across multiple model families and puzzle sizes, models consistently show bias patterns, performing best on stereotype-aligned puzzles and worst on anti-stereotype variants. The study demonstrates that implicit biases act as reasoning shortcuts, even in safety-aligned models that struggle to avoid stereotypical reasoning in structured tasks.

## Method Summary
PRIME systematically generates logic grid puzzles with controlled social bias conditions: stereotypical (bias-aligned), anti-stereotypical (bias-counter), and neutral puzzles. The framework uses edit-distance-based metrics to quantify bias concentration in stereotype-associated categories versus neutral ones. Researchers evaluate multiple model families across different puzzle sizes, comparing performance across these three conditions. Chain-of-thought prompting is tested as an intervention, while commercial safety guardrails are assessed for their ability to detect implicit bias cases. The methodology focuses on binary gender stereotypes in structured reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- Models consistently perform best on stereotype-aligned puzzles and worst on anti-stereotype variants across all model families
- Edit-distance metrics reveal bias is concentrated in stereotype-associated categories with minimal spillover to neutral ones
- Chain-of-thought prompting reliably reduces bias and improves accuracy, while safety guardrails fail to detect most implicit bias cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The PRIME framework works by isolating deductive reasoning from contextual influences, creating controlled conditions where social stereotypes can be systematically varied while maintaining identical logical structures. This allows researchers to measure how implicit biases influence reasoning performance independently of task difficulty or content complexity.

## Foundational Learning
- Logic grid puzzles (why needed: provide structured reasoning tasks with controlled variables; quick check: verify puzzle generation maintains logical consistency across bias conditions)
- Edit-distance metrics for bias quantification (why needed: measure semantic similarity between puzzle variants; quick check: confirm distance measures correlate with human judgment of stereotype alignment)
- Chain-of-thought prompting (why needed: test whether explicit reasoning reduces implicit bias; quick check: compare performance with and without intermediate reasoning steps)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Puzzle Generator -> Bias Condition Assigner -> LLM Evaluator -> Performance Analyzer
Critical path: Bias condition generation → Model inference → Performance measurement → Bias quantification
Design tradeoffs: Controlled artificial puzzles vs. real-world complexity; systematic bias measurement vs. ecological validity
Failure signatures: Performance differences across conditions indicate bias presence; minimal differences suggest lack of bias sensitivity
First experiments: 1) Generate puzzles with different stereotype categories; 2) Test across multiple model families; 3) Apply chain-of-thought prompting to measure bias reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Artificial nature of logic puzzles may not capture real-world bias complexity
- Focus on binary gender stereotypes limits exploration of intersectional or other social category biases
- Safety filter testing limited to specific commercial systems without exploring custom fine-tuning approaches

## Confidence
- Bias reduction through Chain-of-Thought prompting: High
- Safety filter effectiveness claims: Medium
- Bias acting as "reasoning shortcut" explanation: Low

## Next Checks
1. Replication with more diverse puzzle types and stereotype categories beyond gender-based scenarios
2. Comparison with human performance on identical puzzles to establish baseline expectations
3. Longitudinal testing across model versions to determine persistence of bias patterns through safety fine-tuning
