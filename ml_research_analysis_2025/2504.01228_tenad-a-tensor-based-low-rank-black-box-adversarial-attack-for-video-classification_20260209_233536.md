# TenAd: A Tensor-based Low-rank Black Box Adversarial Attack for Video Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.01228
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01228
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Tensor-based low-rank adversarial attack for videos achieves up to 99% fewer queries while maintaining high fooling rates

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TenAd, a tensor-based low-rank black-box adversarial attack method for video classification that addresses the inefficiency of existing approaches. The key innovation is representing videos as fourth-order tensors and exploiting their inherent low-rank structure to significantly reduce the search space and number of queries needed for successful attacks. By decomposing video tensors and focusing perturbations on dominant low-rank components, TenAd generates imperceptible adversarial examples while achieving higher attack success rates and query efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods like Heuristic, SVA, and VBAD. Experimental results on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets demonstrate that TenAd requires substantially fewer queries (up to 99% reduction) while maintaining high fooling rates and producing adversarial examples with superior visual similarity to clean videos.

## Method Summary
TenAd represents video data as fourth-order tensors and parameterizes adversarial perturbations using low-rank tensor factorization, specifically rank-1 tensors formed by the outer product of four vectors. The method employs zero-order optimization (ZOO) with directional finite differences to estimate gradients without requiring internal model access. Instead of optimizing a full perturbation tensor with O(WHCT) parameters, TenAd reduces this to O(W+H+C+T) parameters by decomposing the perturbation into mode vectors. The optimization iteratively updates these vectors to find the minimal perturbation that causes misclassification, using binary search to determine the perturbation magnitude. The approach can optionally initialize perturbation vectors using dominant components from the video's tensor decomposition to accelerate convergence.

## Key Results
- TenAd achieves up to 99% reduction in query count compared to existing methods while maintaining high attack success rates
- The method produces adversarial examples with superior visual similarity (higher SSIM scores) to clean videos compared to baselines
- TenAd demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, outperforming Heuristic, SVA, and VBAD across multiple metrics
- The rank-1 tensor parameterization provides a dramatic reduction in search space from O(WHCT) to O(W+H+C+T) parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Search Space Reduction via Low-Rank Tensor Factorization
TenAd represents adversarial perturbations as rank-1 tensors, reducing the optimization search space from O(WHCT) parameters to O(W+H+C+T). By parameterizing the perturbation as the outer product of four vectors, the method dramatically decreases the dimensionality that needs to be optimized in black-box settings. The core assumption is that the optimal adversarial perturbation can be effectively approximated by a low-rank tensor, capturing shared structure across spatial and temporal dimensions.

### Mechanism 2: Black-Box Gradient Estimation via Directional Finite Differences
The method approximates gradients in the low-rank parameter space using only model queries, enabling optimization without internal model access. It adapts the opt-attack framework, defining a function g(θ) that finds the minimal perturbation magnitude λ to cause misclassification, then estimates the gradient ∂g/∂θ using finite differences: (g(θ + βu) - g(θ))/(βu), where u is a random Gaussian vector and β is a smoothing parameter.

### Mechanism 3: Exploiting Video Structure via Tensor Factor Initialization
TenAd uses HOSVD or CP decomposition of the original video to initialize the low-rank perturbation vectors, accelerating convergence and attack success. By initializing perturbation direction vectors using columns from factor matrices obtained via Tucker or CP decomposition, the method targets dominant video components. This provides a warm start for optimization, focusing the attack on general video characteristics rather than fine details.

## Foundational Learning

- **Tensor Decomposition (HOSVD, Tucker, CP)**: Understanding how TenAd represents and manipulates video data requires grasping tensor factorization. The core innovation is parameterizing the perturbation as a low-rank tensor (specifically rank-1, derived from factor vectors).
  - Quick check: Given a 4th-order video tensor X ∈ ℝ^(W×H×C×T), what does a rank-1 approximation of its perturbation E look like? (Answer: E = θ^(W) ◦ θ^(H) ◦ θ^(C) ◦ θ^(T))

- **Zero-Order Optimization (ZOO)**: The method operates in a black-box setting, meaning gradients cannot be backpropagated. ZOO is the mathematical tool used to estimate gradients from model outputs (queries) alone.
  - Quick check: In the opt-attack and TenAd, how is the gradient of the decision boundary function g(θ) approximated without access to the model's internal parameters? (Answer: By using directional finite differences: (g(θ + βu) - g(θ))/(βu))

- **Black-Box Adversarial Attacks & Query Efficiency**: The entire motivation of the paper is to improve query efficiency. Understanding that query number is the primary cost in black-box settings and that video's high dimensionality makes existing methods prohibitively expensive is crucial.
  - Quick check: Why is a naive application of image-based black-box attacks to video data (like VBAD) inefficient? (Answer: It requires searching a massive space of O(WHCT) parameters, leading to an extremely high number of queries)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video Preprocessing -> Initialization Module -> Black-Box Optimization Loop (Perturbation Construction -> Query & Boundary Search -> Gradient Estimation -> Update) -> Adversarial Example Generator
- **Critical path:** The Black-Box Optimization Loop is the core. The query count is dominated by the Boundary Search and Gradient Estimation steps. The rank-1 parameterization directly reduces the dimensionality of the gradient update, which is the key efficiency gain.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Rank (l) selection uses l=1 for maximum efficiency; higher rank could find stronger perturbations but increases parameters linearly, reducing the primary benefit. HOSVD-based initialization may speed convergence but adds upfront computational cost. Loss function uses L(E) = ||E||_F^2, though other functions could influence which dimension is perturbed most.
- **Failure signatures:** High Query Count/No Convergence suggests incorrect gradient estimation or poor learning rate; Detectable Perturbation indicates λ becomes too large, failing imperceptibility; Low Success Rate suggests rank-1 assumption is too strong for the target model.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement the rank-1 TenAd attack (without HOSVD init, use random init) on C3D model with UCF-101 dataset. Compare Mean Query Number (MQ) and Fooling Rate (FR) against Heuristic or SVA baseline.
  2. Run TenAd on a small subset of videos with three initialization strategies: random Gaussian, HOSVD dominant singular vectors, and HOSVD less dominant singular vectors. Compare convergence speed.
  3. Run TenAd with rank l=1, 2, 3 on a fixed query budget. Plot Fooling Rate and MAP against rank to determine if higher rank provides statistically significant improvements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can TenAd be extended to targeted attacks while maintaining its query efficiency and low-rank properties?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state "While our approach primarily focuses on untargeted attacks, it is important to note that our framework can be extended to encompass targeted attacks."
- **Why unresolved:** Targeted attacks require finding perturbations that force specific misclassifications rather than any misclassification, which may require more complex optimization in the low-rank tensor space.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experimental results on targeted attacks showing query counts, success rates, and perturbation metrics comparable to untargeted attacks.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does TenAd perform against diverse video classification architectures beyond C3D (e.g., I3D, 3D-ResNet, Video Transformers)?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The experimental evaluation only uses C3D as the target model, limiting generalizability claims.
- **Why unresolved:** Different architectures may have different decision boundaries and vulnerabilities to low-rank perturbations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative attack success rates and query efficiency across multiple state-of-the-art video architectures on the same datasets.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What defense mechanisms effectively detect or mitigate low-rank tensor-based adversarial attacks on videos?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper demonstrates TenAd's effectiveness but does not explore adversarial robustness or defense strategies.
- **Why unresolved:** Low-rank perturbations may evade existing defenses designed for vector-based or sparse attacks, requiring new defensive approaches.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation of TenAd against existing video adversarial defenses (e.g., adversarial training, detection methods) showing which provide meaningful protection.

## Limitations
- The paper leaves critical implementation details unspecified, including learning rate α and smoothing parameter β values for the ZOO optimizer
- The HOSVD initialization procedure is described conceptually but lacks specific implementation guidance on which columns to select and how
- The convergence criteria and maximum query budget per video are undefined, making direct reproduction challenging
- The claim of "up to 99% query reduction" is particularly sensitive to these hyperparameters and stopping conditions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core mathematical framework (rank-1 tensor parameterization, finite difference gradient estimation) is sound and well-defined
- **Medium Confidence:** The experimental methodology (datasets, target model, metrics) is clearly specified, but reproducibility depends on tuning unknown hyperparameters
- **Low Confidence:** The efficiency claims and specific query numbers are difficult to verify without the missing implementation details

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically test different values of α and β to identify a stable configuration that achieves both high fooling rates and low query counts
2. **Initialization Ablation Study:** Compare TenAd's performance using random initialization versus the proposed HOSVD-based initialization to isolate the impact of this design choice
3. **Rank vs. Efficiency Trade-off:** Conduct experiments with rank l=1, 2, and 3 within a fixed query budget to empirically determine if the rank-1 assumption is optimal or if higher ranks provide significant benefits
