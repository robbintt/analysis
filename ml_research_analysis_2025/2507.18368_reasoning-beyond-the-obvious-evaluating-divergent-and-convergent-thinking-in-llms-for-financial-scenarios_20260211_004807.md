# Reasoning Beyond the Obvious: Evaluating Divergent and Convergent Thinking in LLMs for Financial Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.18368
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18368
- **Reference count:** 34
- **Primary result:** ConDiFi benchmark reveals models like GPT-4o excel at fluency but underperform on novelty and actionability in financial reasoning tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ConDiFi, a novel benchmark designed to jointly evaluate divergent and convergent thinking in large language models for financial scenarios. The benchmark includes 607 prompts for divergent reasoning (generating creative, plausible futures) and 990 multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning (logical problem-solving). Evaluated across 14 leading models, ConDiFi reveals that while models like GPT-4o perform well on fluency, they underperform on novelty and actionability—key dimensions for real-world financial decision-making. Models such as DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank highest for generating actionable, investment-relevant insights. The study highlights the limitations of existing reasoning benchmarks and provides a domain-specific, cognitively grounded framework for assessing LLM capabilities essential for safe deployment in high-stakes financial environments.

## Method Summary
ConDiFi jointly evaluates divergent and convergent thinking through two arms. The divergent arm uses 607 post-May 2025 macro-financial scenarios, where models generate branching timelines evaluated on Plausibility, Novelty, Elaboration, Actionability (via GPT-4o as judge), and Richness (graph topology). The convergent arm employs 990 multi-hop adversarial MCQs with four timelines each, generated from financial news using six adversarial pipelines and refined through two rounds. Models are evaluated via exact match accuracy (CCS) using one-shot CoT prompting. The benchmark is designed to expose trade-offs in model capabilities, revealing that fluency does not guarantee strategic utility in financial contexts.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieves high fluency (Plausibility: 8.12) but low actionability (6.02), while DeepSeek-R1 scores high on both (8.76, 8.90).
- DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top models for generating actionable, investment-relevant insights.
- Adversarial question design increases difficulty, reducing average CCS from 83.3% to 65.6% after refinement.
- Token ceiling (4096) limits Richness scores, suggesting higher budgets may boost creativity.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Model performance diverges significantly across reasoning dimensions, with fluency not guaranteeing strategic utility.
- **Mechanism**: Models trained with different objectives (e.g., general-purpose alignment vs. reasoning-focused reinforcement learning) develop uneven strengths: some excel at fluent, plausible outputs but underperform in generating novel, actionable insights, while others balance creativity with investment-relevance.
- **Core assumption**: Training methodology shapes distinct cognitive profiles, leading to trade-offs between fluency and strategic foresight.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Despite high fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating actionable insights."
  - [section] Table 3 shows GPT-4o with high Plausibility (8.12) but low Actionable (6.02), while DeepSeek-R1 scores high on both (8.76, 8.90).
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Scaffolding Creativity" discusses how LLM personas can shape creative problem-solving, aligning with the idea that training approaches influence reasoning styles. Evidence strength: Moderate (conceptual alignment, not direct).
- **Break condition**: If models achieve uniformly high scores across all five divergent thinking dimensions, the mechanism of trade-offs would not hold.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Multi-dimensional evaluation exposes hidden weaknesses in models that appear competent on single-metric or general benchmarks.
- **Mechanism**: By disaggregating reasoning into cognitively grounded dimensions (Plausibility, Novelty, Elaboration, Actionable, Richness), the benchmark reveals that models may score well on surface-level fluency while failing on deeper, domain-critical capabilities.
- **Core assumption**: Real-world financial decision-making requires balanced proficiency across multiple cognitive dimensions, not just recall or logic.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "ConDiFi reveals that while models like GPT-4o perform well on fluency, they underperform on novelty and actionability."
  - [section] "The results underscore that while prompt quality affects overall scores, model capabilities shape the floor and ceiling of performance, especially on harder prompts."
  - [corpus] S-DAT paper on automated divergent thinking assessment supports multi-dimensional evaluation but focuses on general creativity, not finance. Evidence strength: Weak (domain mismatch).
- **Break condition**: If all evaluated models show strong, uniform performance across all dimensions, the mechanism would indicate benchmark saturation or insufficient difficulty.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Adversarial question design in convergent thinking tasks enhances discrimination between high-performing models by targeting precise reasoning failures.
- **Mechanism**: Through adversarial pipelines (e.g., Historical β-Swap, Numeric Trip-Wire) and iterative refinement, questions are hardened to expose specific reasoning errors—misinterpretation, factor misweighting, causal flaws—rather than mere knowledge gaps.
- **Core assumption**: Models that pass standard benchmarks may still fail on nuanced, adversarially-constructed scenarios requiring multi-hop reasoning and logical coherence.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "990 multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning."
  - [section] "After the second round [of refinement], the difficulty increased significantly and the average CCS score further fell from 83.3% to 65.6%."
  - [corpus] DiCoRe paper uses divergent-convergent LLM reasoning for event detection, conceptually similar but not directly validating adversarial MCQ design. Evidence strength: Weak (different task).
- **Break condition**: If models consistently achieve near-perfect scores on the refined adversarial dataset, the mechanism would suggest the adversarial design is no longer challenging or that models have adapted.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Divergent vs. Convergent Thinking
- **Why needed here**: The benchmark separates idea generation (divergent) from logical problem-solving (convergent), requiring evaluators to understand both cognitive modes and their distinct evaluation criteria.
- **Quick check question**: Can a model score high on convergent MCQs but low on divergent scenario generation? Why?

### Concept: Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Metrics
- **Why needed here**: Success is not binary; models must balance Plausibility, Novelty, Elaboration, Actionable, and Richness, each tied to real-world financial utility.
- **Quick check question**: If a model scores 9/10 on Plausibility but 3/10 on Actionable, is it suitable for investment decision support?

### Concept: Adversarial Benchmark Design
- **Why needed here**: Convergent questions use adversarial pipelines to create distractors that are plausible but logically flawed, testing genuine reasoning vs. pattern matching.
- **Quick check question**: What does a "Numeric Trip-Wire" adversarial pipeline test?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Divergent: Real-world scenario → Model generates branching timeline → GPT-4o evaluates via LLM-as-judge → Compute Richness via graph statistics.
Convergent: Financial news → Factor selection → Adversarial question generation (6 pipelines) → Iterative refinement → Model answers with CoT → Score via exact match.

### Critical path
1. Ensure scenarios are post-training-cutoff (May 2025+) to avoid contamination.
2. For divergent: parse timeline JSON, compute Richness (branching factor, path depth), then judge with strict rubric.
3. For convergent: apply two refinement rounds to harden questions; use one-shot CoT prompting for evaluation.

### Design tradeoffs
- Token ceiling (4096) limits Richness scores for long timelines; early evidence suggests higher budgets may boost creativity.
- Single-shot prompting prioritizes consistency but may under-exploit model capabilities.
- LLM-as-judge (GPT-4o) introduces its own biases; human audits are noted as essential.

### Failure signatures
- **GPT-4o pattern**: High fluency/plausibility, low novelty/actionable (e.g., generic filler, missing investable theses).
- **Small model pattern**: Consistently low scores across dimensions, especially on elaboration and actionability.
- **Reasoning model pattern** (e.g., DeepSeek-R1): High novelty and actionable but may show lower richness due to different output structures.

### First 3 experiments
1. **Token budget impact**: Increase max_tokens from 4096 to 8192 for divergent tasks and measure changes in Richness scores across models.
2. **Prompting strategy**: Compare single-shot vs. few-shot prompting on convergent CCS scores, focusing on hard questions (those missed by all models).
3. **Model ensemble analysis**: Test if combining a high-novelty model (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with a high-elaboration model (e.g., Cohere Command A) produces higher overall divergent scores via output fusion or sequential refinement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does increasing the generation token budget beyond 4096 tokens significantly improve the structural complexity (Richness) of divergent financial timelines?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Limitations section states that outputs were capped at 4096 tokens and suggests "future work might look into the impact of higher token budget on the Richness dimension."
- **Why unresolved**: The study observed low variance in Richness scores, potentially caused by the token ceiling constraining the models' ability to generate deep, branching causal chains.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Re-evaluating the divergent benchmark with token limits increased to 8k or 16k and analyzing changes in graph statistics (e.g., branching factor, path length).

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can ensembles of models with distinct "reasoning fingerprints" (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 + GPT-4o) outperform single models on divergent financial foresight?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] In the Results analysis, the authors ask: "Can divergent strengths be complementary—paving the way for ensembles that reason more like expert teams than single oracles?"
- **Why unresolved**: The paper identifies models with orthogonal strengths (e.g., DeepSeek-R1's novelty vs. other models' plausibility) using Frobenius distance, but does not test if combining them yields higher-quality scenarios.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Constructing an ensemble pipeline that aggregates outputs from models with high inter-model distance and scoring the aggregated results on the ConDiFi benchmark.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: To what extent do GPT-4o's automated evaluations of "Actionability" and "Novelty" align with the judgment of professional human financial analysts?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The Limitations section notes that "LLM-as-judge... inherently inherits the model’s own biases" and that "Human audits remain essential for robustness."
- **Why unresolved**: The study relies entirely on an LLM-as-a-judge methodology, which risks conflating fluency with genuine financial utility—criticisms often leveled at automated creativity metrics.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A human expert annotation study where professional investors score a subset of timelines, followed by a correlation analysis against the model-generated scores.

## Limitations
- The benchmark is finance-specific, limiting generalizability to other domains.
- Reliance on GPT-4o as both judge and question generator introduces potential circularity and bias.
- Absence of released scenarios and questions necessitates full regeneration for replication, introducing variability.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The benchmark design (607 divergent prompts, 990 convergent MCQs, 5 divergent dimensions, adversarial question generation) is clearly specified and reproducible given the data. The observation that GPT-4o excels at fluency but underperforms on novelty and actionability is directly supported by the reported metric scores (Table 3).
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ are top performers for actionable insights is supported by the data, but the absence of statistical significance testing (e.g., confidence intervals, p-values) prevents definitive claims about relative model superiority. The mechanism that training methodology shapes distinct cognitive profiles is plausible but not directly validated; it is inferred from performance patterns.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that adversarial question design "significantly enhances discrimination" is based on the refinement process description and score drop, but lacks comparative analysis against non-adversarial benchmarks to quantify the improvement in model differentiation.

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical validation of model rankings**: Compute 95% confidence intervals for CCS scores and divergent dimension scores across all 14 models using bootstrap resampling of the 990 convergent and 607 divergent prompts. Test whether the top performers (DeepSeek-R1, Cohere Command R+) have statistically significant advantages over GPT-4o on actionable and novelty metrics.
2. **Adversarial design validation**: Re-run the convergent evaluation pipeline on a subset of 100 questions without the two refinement rounds. Compare the average CCS and score distribution to the refined dataset to quantify the impact of adversarial hardening on model discrimination.
3. **Human audit validation**: Conduct a blind human evaluation of a random sample of 50 divergent outputs (10 from each of the top 5 models) using the same 5-dimension rubric. Calculate inter-annotator agreement (e.g., Krippendorff's alpha) and compare human-assigned scores to the GPT-4o judge scores to assess the reliability of the automated evaluation.
