# Crossing Domains without Labels: Distant Supervision for Term Extraction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.06838
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06838
- **Reference count:** 11
- **Primary result:** DiSTER framework achieves up to 10 percentage point improvement in F1 score for cross-domain term extraction using distantly supervised data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of domain generalization in automatic term extraction (ATE), where current methods rely heavily on domain-specific human annotations and struggle with cross-domain transfer. To tackle this, the authors propose DiSTER, a framework that leverages distantly supervised data generated by a black-box LLM to fine-tune smaller, open-weight models for ATE. They also introduce lightweight post-hoc heuristics to improve document-level consistency. Experiments across seven diverse domains show that DiSTER outperforms both supervised sequence-labeling baselines and few-shot prompting methods, achieving up to a 10 percentage point improvement in F1 score. The approach also matches or exceeds the performance of its GPT-4o teacher model. The work demonstrates that strategic use of synthetic, domain-diverse training data can significantly enhance cross-domain robustness in ATE.

## Method Summary
DiSTER uses a teacher-student knowledge distillation approach where a large language model (GPT-4o) generates pseudo-labels for term extraction on diverse text corpora (The Pile and arXiv abstracts). These pseudo-labels are filtered to retain only term-like entities, creating the SynTerm dataset. A smaller open-weight model (Llama-3-8B-Instruct) is then fine-tuned on this dataset using standard next-token prediction loss computed only on completion tokens. The framework also employs post-hoc heuristics (Document Consistency and Corpus Consistency) to improve document-level recall by finding all exact string matches of extracted terms and promoting terms appearing in >50% of documents.

## Key Results
- DiSTER achieves up to 10 percentage point improvement in F1 score over supervised cross-domain encoder models
- Outperforms few-shot learning baselines across seven diverse domains
- Matches or exceeds the performance of its GPT-4o teacher model
- Post-hoc consistency heuristics further boost document-level F1 scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Knowledge Distillation via Sequence-Level Imitation
- **Claim:** Fine-tuning a smaller student model on pseudo-labels generated by a larger teacher model appears to transfer task-specific capabilities more effectively than in-context learning, potentially by reducing prompt sensitivity.
- **Mechanism:** The student model (e.g., Llama-3-8B) learns to mimic the exact token sequences of the teacher (GPT-4o). This converts the "skill" of term extraction from a prompting skill into a learned weight update, stabilizing the behavior.
- **Core assumption:** The teacher's pseudo-labels are of sufficient quality that the signal outweighs the noise during gradient updates.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "fine-tune the first LLMs for ATE... outperforms both supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot learning baselines."
  - [section 8.1] "sequence-level supervision encourages the student to mimic the teacher’s span predictions exactly, reducing prompt sensitivity."
  - [corpus] Related work (arXiv:2506.21222) supports the general efficacy of LLMs in ATE, though DiSTER specifically targets cross-domain robustness via distillation.

### Mechanism 2: Domain Diversity via Synthetic Aggregation
- **Claim:** Cross-domain generalization relies heavily on the diversity of the training distribution; synthetic datasets combining general corpora (The Pile) and scientific literature (arXiv) provide broader coverage than limited human-annotated benchmarks.
- **Mechanism:** By constructing `SynTerm` from diverse sources and filtering for "terms" rather than generic named entities, the model is exposed to a wider variance of linguistic contexts, reducing overfitting to specific domain idiosyncrasies.
- **Core assumption:** The filtering heuristics (manual + GPT-4o) successfully isolate "terms" from general entities with high precision.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.1] "To increase domain diversity, we synthesized labeled examples from... arXiv abstracts... Combining the two yields our final SynTerm dataset."
  - [section 8.1] "strong cross-domain performance still depends on diverse fine-tuning data."
  - [corpus] Evidence is primarily internal to the paper; corpus neighbors do not offer direct counter-evidence or support for this specific data composition strategy.

### Mechanism 3: Post-hoc Consistency Regularization
- **Claim:** Generative models often exhibit inconsistency in document-level extraction (e.g., extracting a term only once); rule-based post-processing corrects this specific failure mode.
- **Mechanism:** Two heuristics—Document Consistency (DC) and Corpus Consistency (CC)—enforce label agreement. DC finds all string matches for an extracted term, while CC promotes terms appearing in >50% of documents, effectively mimicking frequency-based termhood estimation.
- **Core assumption:** Valid terms are repetitive within a document or corpus, and exact string matching is a sufficient proxy for semantic identity.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.3] "identify all exact string matches... addressing the LLM's tendency to return only one instance."
  - [section 7] "post-hoc consistency enforcement yields further gains, boosting document-level F1 scores."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Distant Supervision**
  - **Why needed here:** The core of DiSTER is training on "noisy" labels provided by another model rather than humans. Understanding this helps distinguish why the method scales but requires filtering.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the source of labels (GPT-4o vs. Human) affect the noise profile of the training data?

- **Concept: Sequence Labeling (IOB) vs. Text Generation**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper compares traditional encoder models (XLM-R using IOB tags) with generative LLMs. The error profiles differ significantly (e.g., IOB predicts overly long spans; LLMs miss terms).
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a generative model struggle with recall (counting *all* instances) compared to a token classifier?

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation (Black-box)**
  - **Why needed here:** The student model (Llama-3-8B) learns from the outputs of the teacher (GPT-4o) without accessing the teacher's internal weights.
  - **Quick check question:** In a black-box setting, what is the "loss" calculated on? (Answer: The difference between the student's generated sequence and the teacher's text output).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Engine (GPT-4o prompts → Raw Pseudo-labels) -> Filter Node (Manual + LLM filtering → SynTerm Dataset) -> Training Node (Fine-tune Llama-3-8B on SynTerm) -> Inference Node (Generate candidate terms) -> Refinement Node (Apply DC and CC heuristics)

- **Critical path:** The **Entity Type Filtering** (Section 3.1) is the most fragile step. If non-terms (like "Location") leak into `SynTerm`, the student model learns to extract irrelevant entities. The paper notes a Cohen's kappa of 0.45 when using GPT-4o for this filtering, indicating significant noise.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Cost vs. Consistency:** Using GPT-4o for data generation is expensive upfront but yields a reusable dataset; few-shot prompting is cheap per query but inconsistent.
  - **Recall vs. Precision:** The IOB baselines suffer from low precision (long spans), while few-shot LLMs suffer from low recall (few extractions). DiSTER balances these but relies on post-hoc rules to boost recall.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Zero Extraction:** Few-shot models returning empty lists (median count = 0 for `corp` domain in Table 9).
  - **Span Bloat:** IOB models classifying entire clauses as single terms.
  - **Inconsistent Extraction:** The generative model extracting "heart failure" in paragraph 1 but missing it in paragraph 2.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Re-implement the Few-Shot (cross-domain) and IOB baselines on one domain (e.g., `wind`) to verify the performance gap exists in your environment.
  2. **Ablation on Filtering:** Train a student model on *unfiltered* pseudo-labels vs. the `SynTerm` filtered version to quantify the impact of the entity-type cleaning step.
  3. **Heuristic Stress Test:** Evaluate the fine-tuned model with and without the DC/CC heuristics on a document-heavy dataset (like `acl`) to measure the recall boost from consistency enforcement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can the document-level and corpus-level consistency heuristics be enhanced to handle semantic variants and paraphrases rather than relying solely on exact string matches?**
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section: "the post-hoc consistency heuristics are simple heuristics and do not handle paraphrases or semantic variants, which could limit precision."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current implementation (DC and CC) relies on exact string matching to enforce consistency, which fails to capture different surface forms of the same concept, potentially leaving recall gains unrealized.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** An evaluation of DiSTER using semantic similarity metrics (e.g., embedding-based clustering) for consistency enforcement compared to the current exact-match baseline.

- **Does expanding the domain diversity of the synthetic training corpus (SynTerm) improve generalization to entirely unseen or underrepresented domains?**
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note in the Limitations and Analysis that "generalization to entirely unseen or underrepresented domains cannot be guaranteed" and suggest that "expanding the diversity of synthetic data could further strengthen cross-domain robustness."
  - **Why unresolved:** While the current SynTerm dataset covers general and scientific domains, the student model still lags behind the teacher in domains with weak training data overlap, leaving the relationship between training diversity and zero-shot performance unquantified.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study where DiSTER is trained on incrementally larger and more diverse synthetic datasets and evaluated on domains completely excluded from the pseudo-labeling source (e.g., legal or financial texts).

- **Can the DiSTER framework be effectively adapted for cross-lingual or multilingual Automatic Term Extraction?**
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors list as a limitation: "Lastly, our experiments are conducted only in English."
  - **Why unresolved:** The methodology relies on English-centric sources (The Pile, arXiv) and English instruction-tuned models; it is unknown if the distillation pipeline transfers effectively to lower-resource languages or maintains performance across language pairs.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying the DiSTER pipeline to a multilingual LLM (e.g., Llama-3-Instruct with multilingual finetuning) and evaluating on a cross-lingual ATE benchmark (e.g., ACTER non-English subsets).

## Limitations

- Heavy reliance on proprietary GPT-4o for generating the entire training dataset, making full reproduction difficult without equivalent-generation capabilities
- Entity-type filtering step introduces significant noise (Cohen's kappa of 0.45), requiring the student model to learn to overcome this
- Post-hoc consistency heuristics rely on exact string matching, failing for morphologically related terms or synonyms
- Training distribution (general web text + scientific abstracts) may not generalize to highly specialized or non-scientific domains

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The experimental results showing DiSTER's superiority over both supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot learning baselines are well-supported by the seven-domain evaluation and consistent F1 improvements (up to 10 percentage points). The mechanism of knowledge distillation via sequence-level imitation is theoretically sound and empirically validated.

- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that domain diversity in synthetic data is the primary driver of cross-domain generalization is plausible but not definitively proven. While the paper shows strong performance across diverse domains, it doesn't systematically ablate different components of the training data (e.g., comparing TermPile vs. TermArXiv effectiveness).

- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that DiSTER "matches or exceeds" GPT-4o's performance is based on comparison to GPT-4o's pseudo-labels rather than direct evaluation. Without access to GPT-4o's actual extraction capabilities on the same test sets, this comparison is indirect and potentially misleading.

## Next Checks

1. **Teacher Model Dependency Test:** Evaluate DiSTER using pseudo-labels from an open-weight model (e.g., Llama-3-8B itself via few-shot prompting) versus the GPT-4o-derived `SynTerm` dataset to quantify the impact of teacher model quality on student performance.

2. **Cross-Domain Robustness Stress Test:** Apply DiSTER to domains semantically distant from both general web text and scientific abstracts (e.g., legal contracts, social media discourse, or highly technical engineering specifications) to identify the boundaries of the training distribution's coverage.

3. **Heuristic Generalization Evaluation:** Replace the exact string matching in DC and CC with a more sophisticated approach (e.g., semantic similarity via embeddings or stemming) to measure the potential recall gains from handling morphological variation and synonyms.
