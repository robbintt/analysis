# Modeling Cultural Bias in Facial Expression Recognition with Adaptive Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13557
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13557
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Agent-based model reveals asymmetric FER degradation under blur across cultural groups, with JAFFE (Asian) populations showing sharper drops at intermediate blur while KDEF (Western) degrades more uniformly

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an agent-based model to study cultural bias and robustness in facial expression recognition under perceptual degradation. Using a 5x5 lattice where agents display expressions from Western (KDEF) and Asian (JAFFE) datasets, the authors demonstrate that cultural composition and interaction structure significantly influence FER robustness under Gaussian blur. The frozen CLIP embeddings with lightweight adapters reveal clear asymmetric degradation patterns: JAFFE populations maintain higher performance at low blur but exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, while mixed populations show intermediate patterns that depend on group balance.

## Method Summary
The study uses a 5×5 toroidal lattice with agents displaying expressions from KDEF (Western) or JAFFE (Asian) datasets under progressive Gaussian blur (σ=0 to 4). Each agent employs frozen CLIP embeddings with a lightweight residual adapter trained only at σ=0 and kept frozen during testing. The simulation runs online training for 1000 ticks at σ=0 using AdamW optimization, then evaluates block-wise with 200 ticks per blur level. Agents interact via Moore neighborhoods, engaging in peer learning on high-confidence predictions and emotion-based movement to avoid negative-heavy neighborhoods.

## Key Results
- JAFFE-only populations show higher initial performance (~0.58 Macro-F1) but experience sharper degradation drops at intermediate blur levels compared to KDEF-only populations (~0.70 Macro-F1)
- Mixed populations exhibit intermediate degradation patterns, with balanced 5/5 mixtures mitigating early degradation but imbalanced 8/2 and 2/8 settings amplifying majority-group weaknesses under high blur
- Relative Macro-F1 degradation at σ=4 ranges from 0.409 to 0.536 depending on population configuration, demonstrating culture-specific robustness profiles
- Intra-cultural Macro-F1 stabilizes near 0.70-0.75 while cross-cultural performance plateaus closer to 0.50, indicating persistent cross-cultural recognition gaps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Frozen CLIP embeddings encode Western-centric representational biases that differentially affect cross-cultural FER robustness under degradation.
- **Mechanism**: CLIP's pre-training on web-scraped image–text pairs biases the embedding space toward Western facial appearances. Lightweight residual adapters trained at σ=0 learn culture-specific mappings, but cannot overcome the frozen backbone's unequal representation. Under blur, already-weakly-represented features (Asian faces) degrade faster because they had less margin in the original embedding space.
- **Core assumption**: The performance gap between KDEF and JAFFE stems partially from CLIP's training distribution, not purely from dataset properties like resolution or lighting.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section VI]: "Given that CLIP was trained on large-scale web-scraped image–text pairs biased toward Western and English-centric content, it is plausible that its embedding space better represents Western facial appearances"
  - [section V-A]: KDEF-only populations achieve ~0.70 Macro-F1 at convergence vs. ~0.58 for JAFFE-only
  - [corpus]: Related work on FER bias (paper 43609) documents racial bias in FER datasets and algorithms, supporting the premise of systematic group disparities

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Population composition shapes robustness through differential exposure and cross-cultural generalization difficulty.
- **Mechanism**: In mixed populations, agents primarily learn from within-group samples (more frequent neighbors). Cross-cultural recognition depends on generalization from limited out-group exposure, which degrades more sharply under blur because fine-grained discriminative cues are lost. Imbalanced populations amplify the majority group's characteristics while minority-group interactions become error-prone.
- **Core assumption**: The agent-based lattice with Moore neighborhoods creates realistic exposure patterns that reflect real-world cultural contact structures.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Mixed populations exhibit intermediate patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur"
  - [section V-B]: "Intra-cultural Macro-F1 stabilizes near 0.70-0.75, while cross-cultural performance plateaus closer to 0.50"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus evidence for population composition effects specifically; related FER work focuses on dataset bias rather than interaction dynamics

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Perceptual degradation interacts with culture-specific expression features to produce asymmetric blur-robustness curves.
- **Mechanism**: JAFFE expressions may rely more heavily on high-frequency facial details (e.g., subtle eye/mouth configurations) that blur eliminates early. KDEF expressions may have more robust mid/low-frequency cues. This creates the observed pattern: JAFFE performs better at σ=0 but drops sharply at intermediate blur, while KDEF degrades more uniformly.
- **Core assumption**: Dataset differences (JAFFE vs. KDEF) reflect genuine cultural variation in expressive behavior, not just imaging artifacts.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section V-A]: "JAFFE-only agents demonstrate an earlier and abrupt decrease, with Macro-F1 descending sharply after σ=1"
  - [section V-E]: JAFFE shows non-monotonic degradation trajectory with ∆σ=1 = 0.072 (improvement) vs. KDEF's steady decline
  - [corpus]: Paper 3657 notes that facial expressions are "social tools" with culture-specific display rules, supporting the premise of cultural variation in expressive cues

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Frozen feature extraction with lightweight adapters**
  - Why needed here: The entire architecture depends on understanding that CLIP provides a fixed embedding space; only the small MLP adapter is trainable. This design enables controlled study of how well frozen representations transfer across cultural groups and degradation levels.
  - Quick check question: If you needed to improve JAFFE performance specifically, would modifying the CLIP backbone or the adapter be more effective—and which is actually possible in this architecture?

- **Concept: Agent-based modeling for emergent phenomena**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses ABM specifically to capture how local interactions (Moore neighborhoods, peer learning, movement rules) shape system-level recognition dynamics. Without understanding ABM principles, the lattice and agent design appear arbitrary.
  - Quick check question: Why would a static batch evaluation (standard train/test split) fail to capture the effects the paper studies?

- **Concept: Perceptual degradation schedules**
  - Why needed here: The σ-scheduled blur is the core stress test. Understanding piecewise-constant degradation schedules is essential for interpreting the block-wise metrics and degradation curves.
  - Quick check question: What would happen to the reported findings if blur increased continuously rather than in discrete blocks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  1. Environment: 5×5 toroidal lattice, σ-scheduled Gaussian blur (σ ∈ {0,1,2,3,4})
  2. Agents: Each holds cultural identity (KDEF/JAFFE), unique person ID, expression repertoire, and independent MLP classifier
  3. Perception pipeline: Blurred image → frozen CLIP ViT encoder (D-dim embedding) → LayerNorm → Linear(D→512) → GELU → Dropout(0.1) → Linear(512→7) → Softmax
  4. Training: Online cross-entropy with label smoothing (0.05), AdamW (lr=3×10⁻⁴, weight decay=5×10⁻²), 1000 ticks at σ=0 only
  5. Interaction rules: Moore neighborhood perception, peer-learning on high-confidence predictions, emotion-based movement (avoid negative-heavy neighborhoods)

- **Critical path**: The experimental validity depends on (1) correctly freezing CLIP and adapters after training, (2) maintaining separate agents per identity, and (3) ensuring blur is applied before CLIP encoding. A bug in any of these invalidates the degradation curves.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **CLIP vs. culture-specific encoder**: CLIP provides strong generalization but encodes Western bias; a culture-specific encoder would reduce bias but lose transfer capability.
  - **Online vs. batch training**: Online training with peer learning creates realistic exposure dynamics but adds variability; batch training would be cleaner but less ecologically valid.
  - **5×5 lattice vs. larger grids**: Smaller grid forces frequent interaction, amplifying composition effects; larger grids would dilute local contact structure.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Cross-cultural accuracy remaining at chance (≈0.14 for 7 classes) suggests adapter training failed or CLIP embeddings are corrupted.
  - Identical degradation curves across all configurations suggests blur is not being applied or adapters were not frozen.
  - Monocultural JAFFE outperforming KDEF at all blur levels contradicts paper findings and suggests dataset or embedding issues.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Reproduce monocultural baselines**: Run KDEF-only and JAFFE-only populations through full training (1000 ticks) and evaluation (5 blocks × 200 ticks). Verify Macro-F1 convergence values (~0.70 vs. ~0.58) and asymmetric degradation at σ≥2.
  2. **Ablate CLIP bias hypothesis**: Replace CLIP with a culturally-balanced encoder (e.g., a CLIP variant fine-tuned on balanced Asian/Western data). If the KDEF-JAFFE gap shrinks, this confirms CLIP bias contribution.
  3. **Test population composition effects**: Systematically vary the KDEF/JAFFE ratio (10/0, 8/2, 5/5, 2/8, 0/10) and plot global Macro-F1 at each σ level. Verify the U-shaped or linear interpolation pattern and identify where minority-group degradation becomes dominant.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How can dynamic debiasing and domain-aware adaptation be implemented to enhance cross-cultural robustness and fairness in FER systems?
  - **Basis**: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly identifies dynamic debiasing and domain-aware adaptation as future work directions.
  - **Why unresolved**: The current design uses frozen adapters after the learning phase, with no mechanism for online bias correction or domain adaptation during evaluation.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Implementing and testing online adaptation methods (e.g., domain-invariant feature normalization, adversarial debiasing layers, or confidence-based reweighting) that update during the evaluation phase, measuring their impact on cross-cultural Macro-F1 gaps.

## Limitations

- The study cannot disentangle CLIP embedding bias from dataset-specific factors (JAFFE has lower resolution and reduced contrast) because both factors vary together
- The asymmetric degradation patterns and population-composition effects are only tested with Gaussian blur and two specific cultural groups (Western and Japanese), limiting generalizability
- No ablation experiments isolate the contribution of the peer-learning mechanism to the observed performance patterns or bias propagation

## Confidence

- CLIP bias hypothesis: Medium confidence - performance gap documented but direct attribution requires validation with debiased encoders
- Population composition effects: Low confidence - theoretical grounding limited by weak corpus evidence for ABM-based interaction dynamics in FER
- Asymmetric degradation curves: Medium confidence - patterns could partly reflect dataset artifacts rather than genuine cultural differences in expression features

## Next Checks

1. Replace CLIP with a culturally-balanced vision encoder and verify whether the KDEF-JAFFE performance gap diminishes
2. Implement controlled exposure experiments where agents have balanced access to all cultural groups regardless of population composition
3. Test alternative degradation types (noise, occlusion) to determine if the asymmetric blur-robustness patterns persist across perturbation modalities
