# Defining ethically sourced code generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.19743
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19743
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces ES-CodeGen framework with 11 ethical dimensions for code generation models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the growing ethical concerns in AI-driven code generation by introducing the concept of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen). Through a comprehensive two-phase literature review of 803 papers and a survey of 32 practitioners (including 6 impacted users who opted out of the Stack dataset), the authors identified 11 key dimensions defining ES-CodeGen: Subject Rights, Equity, Access, Accountability, Intellectual Property Rights, Integrity, Code Quality, Social Responsibility, Social Acceptability, Labor Rights, and Environmental Sustainability. The study reveals that all stages and artifacts in the code generation supply chain are relevant to these dimensions. The most concerning consequences of unethically sourced code generation include lawsuit issues (90.6% for users, 87.5% for developers), security/privacy risks (87.5%), and exploitation of developers (15.6%). The findings highlight a significant gap between current practices and ethical requirements, with 68.8% of participants believing no existing code generation model fully aligns with ES-CodeGen standards.

## Method Summary
The research employed a two-phase methodology combining literature review and practitioner survey. The literature review involved searching 803 candidate papers using specific keyword combinations across IEEE, ACM, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, followed by thematic analysis by two coders to identify ethical dimensions. The survey phase targeted 32 participants, including 6 "impacted users" identified through GitHub opt-out issues and 26 researchers/practitioners. The survey consisted of 6 sections using Likert scales and open-ended questions to validate and refine the identified dimensions. Inter-rater reliability was measured using Cohen's Kappa (>0.90) and Jaccard Index (>0.80). The "Code Quality" dimension emerged from survey responses, expanding the initial 10 dimensions identified through literature review.

## Key Results
- Identified 11 dimensions defining Ethically Sourced Code Generation: Subject Rights, Equity, Access, Accountability, Intellectual Property Rights, Integrity, Code Quality, Social Responsibility, Social Acceptability, Labor Rights, and Environmental Sustainability
- All stages and artifacts in the code generation supply chain were deemed relevant to these ethical dimensions
- Most concerning consequences: lawsuit issues (90.6% for users, 87.5% for developers), security/privacy risks (87.5%), and exploitation of developers (15.6%)
- 68.8% of participants believe no existing code generation model fully aligns with ES-CodeGen standards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ES-CodeGen framework works by providing a comprehensive taxonomy that captures the multifaceted ethical concerns in code generation. By systematically identifying 11 distinct dimensions through rigorous literature review and practitioner validation, the framework creates a structured approach to evaluating and improving code generation models. The mechanism operates through explicit definition of ethical boundaries across the entire supply chain, from data sourcing to model deployment. The high inter-rater reliability (Cohen's Kappa > 0.90) ensures that the dimensions are consistently understood and applied. The inclusion of practitioner perspectives, particularly impacted users, grounds the framework in real-world concerns rather than purely theoretical considerations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Thematic Analysis:** A qualitative research method for identifying patterns across large text corpora; needed to systematically extract ethical dimensions from 803 papers; quick check: can you code 10 random papers and achieve >0.80 inter-rater agreement?
- **Snowballing Literature Review:** Forward and backward citation tracking from seed papers; needed to capture domain-specific ethical concerns beyond general searches; quick check: can you identify at least 20% additional relevant papers through citation tracking?
- **Opt-in vs Opt-out Ethics:** Different approaches to user consent in data collection; needed to understand the conflict between current practices and ethical requirements; quick check: can you explain why opt-in is preferred but practically challenging at scale?
- **Inter-rater Reliability Metrics:** Statistical measures (Cohen's Kappa, Jaccard Index) to ensure consistent coding; needed to validate the objectivity of dimension identification; quick check: can you calculate Kappa for two coders on a 10-item coding task?
- **Supply Chain Ethics:** Extending ethical considerations beyond the final product to all contributing stages; needed to capture the full scope of ethical concerns in code generation; quick check: can you map ethical concerns to at least 5 distinct stages in a typical code generation pipeline?
- **Black Box Model Limitations:** The inability of current LLM architectures to trace and disclose code provenance; needed to understand why transparency is a critical gap; quick check: can you identify the provenance of a randomly generated code snippet from a current model?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Literature Review (DB Search + Snowballing) -> Thematic Analysis -> Initial 10 Dimensions -> Survey (6 sections) -> Dimension Refinement -> ES-CodeGen Framework

**Critical Path:** The essential sequence is the two-phase validation: literature-derived dimensions must be tested against practitioner perspectives through the survey. The survey's ability to recruit the specific "impacted users" (12% response rate) is the most vulnerable point in this path.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes comprehensiveness (11 dimensions) over simplicity, accepting that implementation will be complex. The choice to include impacted users provides authenticity but severely limits sample size (n=6). The reliance on self-reported Likert scales balances quantitative rigor with qualitative depth.

**Failure Signatures:** Low inter-rater reliability (<0.80 Kappa) indicates ambiguous dimension definitions. Poor survey response rates (<10%) suggest either participant fatigue or lack of perceived relevance. If practitioners consistently rate certain dimensions as "not relevant," the framework may be over-engineered.

**First Experiments:**
1. **Dimension Mapping Test:** Apply the 11 ES-CodeGen dimensions to a specific code generation incident (e.g., GitHub Copilot lawsuit) and document which dimensions are violated and how.
2. **Inter-rater Replication:** Have two new coders independently apply the codebook to 20 randomly selected papers from the original 803 and calculate Cohen's Kappa.
3. **Model Alignment Assessment:** Evaluate a popular code generation model (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer) against each of the 11 dimensions and document specific alignment gaps.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How can practical mechanisms be designed to obtain large-scale opt-in consent from developers for code generation training data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Discussion that "a worthwhile future research direction is to design practical yet ethical approaches to obtain large-scale opt-in consent from developers."
- Why unresolved: Current models rely on scraping millions of repositories where owners are often unreachable, making the preferred "opt-in" standard (noted by impacted users) currently impractical compared to the standard "opt-out" mechanisms.
- What evidence would resolve it: A novel protocol or technical framework that successfully secures verifiable consent from a large corpus of developers without rendering the dataset too small for training.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What techniques can effectively balance the trade-off between model accuracy and ethical restrictions, specifically regarding data contamination?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion notes that "removing data contamination may result in less data that may in turn lead to accuracy loss," and calls for research to balance this, as participants found accuracy loss largely unacceptable (most accepting only <10% loss).
- Why unresolved: There is a direct conflict between the need to remove contaminated or unlicensed data to satisfy IP/Integrity dimensions and the need to maintain the high accuracy required by the "Code Quality" dimension.
- What evidence would resolve it: Algorithms or filtering techniques that minimize the reduction in model performance (accuracy) while strictly enforcing the removal of contaminated or unlicensed code.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What practical techniques can effectively retrofit or build code generation models to align with the "transparency" and "source acknowledgement" dimensions of ES-CodeGen?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states that "practical techniques to improve transparency" are needed, and the Discussion highlights that practitioners believe current models only partially align or fail to align with ES-CodeGen, specifically needing improvement in transparency.
- Why unresolved: Current model architectures (e.g., LLMs) generally function as "black boxes" and lack inherent mechanisms to trace and disclose the specific provenance or license of generated code snippets to the end user.
- What evidence would resolve it: New model architectures or explainability tools that can verifiably output the source attribution and licensing information for generated code blocks in real-time.

## Limitations
- The survey instrument and codebook definitions were not fully disclosed, with artifacts promised post-acceptance, creating uncertainty about exact methodology.
- Participant recruitment strategy lacks complete transparency, particularly regarding how the 6 "impacted users" were identified and approached.
- The relatively small sample size (n=32) and potential selection bias may limit generalizability of findings.
- The framework prioritizes comprehensiveness over simplicity, potentially making implementation challenging in practice.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The identification of 11 distinct ethical dimensions based on the literature review methodology described.
- **Medium Confidence:** The survey findings regarding practitioner concerns and the claim that no existing model fully aligns with ES-CodeGen standards.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific weight or relative importance of each dimension in practice, as the survey asked about relevance but didn't establish priority or implementation guidance.

## Next Checks
1. **Codebook Validation:** Obtain and test the inter-rater codebook used for thematic analysis against a subset of papers to verify the reported Kappa > 0.90 can be reproduced.
2. **Participant Recruitment Replication:** Attempt to recruit a comparable sample (6 impacted users + 26 practitioners) using the described approach to verify the 12% response rate is achievable and representative.
3. **Dimensionality Confirmation:** Conduct an independent thematic analysis on a random sample of 50 papers from the original 803 candidates to verify the 11 dimensions emerge consistently without prior knowledge of the codebook.
