# Asking Clarifying Questions for Preference Elicitation With Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12015
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12015
- Reference count: 34
- The paper proposes a diffusion-inspired method for LLMs to ask sequential clarifying questions for preference elicitation in conversational recommendation systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of effectively eliciting user preferences in conversational recommendation systems using Large Language Models. The authors propose a novel approach inspired by diffusion models that involves a two-stage process: corrupting user profiles by removing information to generate questions, and then fine-tuning an LLM to ask effective clarifying questions that reconstruct the profile. The method employs a funnel questioning strategy, starting with general concepts and gradually becoming more specific. Experiments on the MovieLens dataset demonstrate significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE scores compared to non-fine-tuned models, showing the effectiveness of this approach in generating sequential, context-appropriate questions for preference elicitation.

## Method Summary
The proposed method leverages diffusion model principles to train LLMs for preference elicitation. It operates through a forward process that corrupts user profiles by systematically removing information and generating corresponding questions about the missing elements. The reverse process then fine-tunes the LLM to ask effective clarifying questions that help reconstruct the corrupted profile. This training approach encourages the model to ask funnel questions, beginning with broad, general concepts before narrowing down to more specific aspects. The sequential nature of questioning allows for contextual adaptation based on previous user responses, making the elicitation process more natural and effective in conversational recommendation scenarios.

## Key Results
- Significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE scores compared to non-fine-tuned models
- Demonstrated effectiveness in generating sequential, context-appropriate clarifying questions
- Successful application of diffusion-inspired techniques to preference elicitation in conversational recommendation systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The diffusion-inspired approach works by leveraging the natural structure of preference spaces and the generative capabilities of LLMs. By training on corrupted profiles and their corresponding questions, the model learns to identify information gaps and formulate questions that progressively narrow down user preferences. The funnel questioning strategy mimics human-like information gathering, starting broad to establish context before drilling down into specifics. This hierarchical questioning approach reduces cognitive load on users while efficiently traversing the preference space. The sequential nature allows for dynamic adaptation based on user responses, creating a more natural conversational flow that can handle the inherent uncertainty and variability in how users express preferences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion models for preference elicitation** - why needed: To systematically corrupt and reconstruct preference profiles, enabling structured learning of question generation; quick check: Verify that the corruption process preserves meaningful information patterns while creating challenging reconstruction scenarios.
- **Funnel questioning strategy** - why needed: To reduce cognitive load and efficiently traverse preference spaces through hierarchical information gathering; quick check: Ensure questions progress logically from general to specific without skipping conceptual levels.
- **Sequential context modeling** - why needed: To maintain conversational coherence and adapt questions based on previous user responses; quick check: Validate that the model correctly conditions on conversation history when generating new questions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
User Profile -> Corruption Module -> Question Generator -> LLM Fine-tuning -> Clarified Profile

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from the initial user profile through the corruption process, question generation, and finally through the fine-tuned LLM that asks clarifying questions to reconstruct the profile. The quality of corruption directly impacts the difficulty and diversity of questions generated, which in turn affects the LLM's ability to learn effective questioning strategies.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The funnel approach balances question specificity against user cognitive load, sacrificing some efficiency for improved user experience and more accurate preference capture. The diffusion-inspired corruption introduces controlled noise that helps the model generalize to diverse user preferences but may occasionally create unrealistic scenarios. The sequential questioning approach provides better context but increases conversation length compared to single-question approaches.

**Failure Signatures**
- Questions that are too specific too early, causing user confusion or abandonment
- Repetitive questioning that indicates poor context tracking
- Questions that fail to progressively narrow the preference space
- Inability to handle contradictory or ambiguous user responses
- Overfitting to MovieLens domain characteristics when applied elsewhere

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Ablation study comparing funnel vs. random question ordering on preference elicitation accuracy
2. Stress test with increasingly corrupted profiles to measure question quality degradation
3. Cross-domain validation on datasets with different attribute structures (e.g., music, books)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on automated metrics (BLEU and ROUGE) that may not accurately reflect real-world effectiveness in eliciting meaningful user preferences
- No user study or human evaluation to validate whether generated questions actually help users articulate preferences better
- Assumes corrupted profiles can be effectively reconstructed through clarifying questions, which may not hold for complex preference spaces
- Experimental setup using MovieLens dataset may not generalize well to other domains with more nuanced preference structures

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Technical implementation of diffusion-inspired approach and general framework for sequential question generation

**Medium Confidence:**
- Claimed improvements in BLEU and ROUGE scores over non-fine-tuned models

**Low Confidence:**
- Real-world effectiveness of approach in actual conversational recommendation scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a user study comparing the funnel questioning approach against baseline methods, measuring both objective metrics (recommendation accuracy) and subjective metrics (user satisfaction, perceived helpfulness of questions).

2. Test the approach across multiple domains beyond MovieLens, particularly in areas with more complex preference structures or where item attributes are less clearly defined.

3. Implement an ablation study removing the funnel structure to determine whether the sequential questioning approach itself contributes more to performance than the specific funnel design.
