# Extra Clients at No Extra Cost: Overcome Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning with Filter Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.08652
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08652
- Authors: Wei Chen; Qiang Qiu
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: Filter decomposition improves FedDyn accuracy from 81.74% to 83.3% on CIFAR-10 (100,5)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of data heterogeneity in federated learning by proposing a novel filter decomposition technique. The authors decompose convolutional filters into a linear combination of filter atoms and atom coefficients, which naturally generates numerous cross-terms that emulate additional latent clients. This approach significantly reduces model variance during aggregation, leading to faster convergence and improved accuracy. The method is compatible with various federated learning algorithms and offers flexibility for personalized training schemes.

## Method Summary
The core innovation involves decomposing convolutional filters into a linear combination of filter atoms and their corresponding coefficients. This decomposition transforms the global filter aggregation problem into aggregating filter atoms and coefficients separately. The cross-terms generated by this decomposition effectively create additional virtual clients without requiring extra data or computational resources. The method supports different training schemes for atoms and coefficients, enabling personalized federated learning while maintaining communication efficiency through a fast/slow protocol that prioritizes atom transmission.

## Key Results
- FedDyn with filter decomposition achieves 83.3% accuracy on CIFAR-10 (100,5) versus 81.74% without decomposition
- Substantial accuracy improvements when integrated with FedAvg, FedProx, and FedDyn across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet
- Faster convergence and reduced communication costs through prioritized filter atom transmission
- Theoretical analysis confirms variance reduction leads to tighter convergence bounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The filter decomposition technique works by breaking down convolutional filters into fundamental components (atoms) and their combination coefficients. When filters are aggregated across heterogeneous clients, the cross-terms generated from different atom combinations create virtual client representations that smooth out the aggregation process. This effectively increases the diversity of aggregated samples without requiring additional real clients. The separation of atoms and coefficients allows for flexible training strategies, where atoms can capture global patterns while coefficients adapt to local data characteristics, naturally supporting personalization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Federated Learning Basics**: Understanding the client-server architecture where local models train on private data and aggregate to a global model. Needed to grasp the data heterogeneity problem being addressed.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Knowledge of how convolutional filters work in image classification tasks. Quick check: Can you explain how a convolutional layer transforms input images?
- **Data Heterogeneity in FL**: Understanding how non-IID data distribution across clients affects model convergence and accuracy. Quick check: What happens when clients have completely different data distributions?
- **Model Aggregation Techniques**: Familiarity with methods like FedAvg and their limitations with heterogeneous data. Quick check: How does FedAvg compute the global model from client updates?
- **Filter Decomposition Concept**: Understanding how complex filters can be represented as combinations of simpler atomic components. Quick check: Can you decompose a 3x3 filter into basis components?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Data -> Filter Decomposition -> Local Training -> Aggregation -> Global Model

Critical Path: The essential workflow begins with filter decomposition at initialization, followed by local training on client devices where atoms and coefficients are updated separately, then aggregation where atoms and coefficients are combined across clients, and finally reconstruction of the global model filters from aggregated components.

Design Tradeoffs: The method trades increased model complexity (maintaining separate atoms and coefficients) for improved convergence and accuracy. While this adds computational overhead, the fast/slow communication protocol mitigates bandwidth concerns by prioritizing atom transmission.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance may occur if the filter decomposition is too aggressive (losing important filter information) or too conservative (failing to generate sufficient cross-terms). Communication bottlenecks may arise if the fast/slow protocol is not properly tuned for network conditions.

First Experiments:
1. Implement filter decomposition on a simple CNN and verify that the decomposed representation can reconstruct original filters accurately.
2. Test the method on a small federated learning setup with synthetically created heterogeneous data to observe variance reduction effects.
3. Compare convergence speed between standard FedAvg and FedAvg with filter decomposition on a controlled dataset with known heterogeneity levels.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Method effectiveness on non-image domains like medical imaging or NLP remains untested
- Theoretical analysis relies on client similarity assumptions that may not hold in highly heterogeneous scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method's performance on non-image datasets (e.g., text classification or time-series data) to assess cross-domain applicability.

2. Conduct extensive ablation studies to quantify the computational overhead introduced by maintaining separate filter atoms and coefficients.

3. Perform large-scale testing with more than 100 clients to validate the scalability of the approach and its impact on convergence speed in extremely heterogeneous settings.
