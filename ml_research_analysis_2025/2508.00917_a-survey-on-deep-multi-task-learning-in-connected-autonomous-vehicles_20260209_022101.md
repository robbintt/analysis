# A Survey on Deep Multi-Task Learning in Connected Autonomous Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00917
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00917
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of deep multi-task learning (MTL) in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), addressing the need for efficient integration of perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent collaboration tasks.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines deep multi-task learning (MTL) applications in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), where multiple perception, prediction, planning, control, and V2X communication tasks must be performed efficiently. The paper categorizes MTL approaches into CNN-based, Transformer-based, and vision-language model (VLM)-based methods, and evaluates their applications across CAV modules. It identifies three key advantages of MTL in CAVs: improved computational efficiency, enhanced task synergy, and scalability for multi-agent systems. The survey also highlights major research gaps including the lack of standardized benchmarks, limited real-world evaluation, and challenges in handling heterogeneous data sources and communication constraints in V2X-based cooperative driving.

## Method Summary
The survey categorizes MTL approaches for CAVs into three paradigms: hard-parameter sharing (shared backbone with task-specific heads), soft-parameter sharing (cross-stitch/cross-fusion modules), and hybrid approaches (shared encoder with task decoders and cross-task attention). The optimization framework uses weighted loss functions L = Σ α_i L_i across tasks, with strategies like uncertainty-based weighting, GradNorm, and gradient conflict mitigation techniques (PCGrad, CAGrad). For V2X applications, the survey examines feature fusion approaches including spatial alignment of multi-agent data and trust models to handle communication impairments. The minimum viable reproduction involves implementing a baseline MTL model (e.g., YOLOP or UniAD), preparing multi-task datasets with perception and prediction annotations, and training with combined losses using gradient conflict mitigation.

## Key Results
- MTL reduces computational costs and memory usage in CAVs through parameter sharing, enabling real-time processing (>30 FPS)
- Cross-task interaction mechanisms mitigate negative transfer and improve task synergy in CAV systems
- MTL enhances V2X cooperative perception by fusing heterogeneous data and addressing communication constraints across multiple agents

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Shared representations in MTL reduce computational overhead in resource-constrained CAVs.
- Mechanism: A single shared backbone encoder extracts features, which are then distributed to task-specific decoders. This avoids the redundant computations of running separate models for perception, prediction, planning, and control.
- Core assumption: The tasks share underlying features that can be effectively encoded by a common architecture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] MTL enables joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model, offering improved efficiency and resource utilization.
  - [section III-D-1] MTL reduces computational costs, memory usage, and energy consumption through sharing parameters across tasks. This is critical for resource-constrained edge devices and enables real-time processing (FPS over 30).
  - [corpus] Corpus papers on CAV security do not provide direct evidence for MTL efficiency. One neighbor, "FAST-IDS," mentions model compression for resource-constrained environments, but this is a single-task IDS context.
- Break condition: The shared representation fails to capture task-specific nuances, leading to significant performance degradation (negative transfer), making separate models more efficient.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-task interaction mitigates negative transfer and improves task synergy.
- Mechanism: Hybrid-parameter sharing uses cross-task attention modules to allow task-specific decoders to exchange information, dynamically filtering conflicting or complementary features.
- Core assumption: Not all tasks are equally related; selective information sharing is beneficial.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] MTL offers improved task synergy.
  - [section III-B-3] Hybrid-parameter sharing combines shared backbones with task-specific decoders and cross-talk mechanisms to enable selective information exchange.
  - [corpus] Corpus papers focus on security and anomaly detection in CAVs, not specifically on MTL task interaction mechanisms. Evidence is absent.
- Break condition: The cross-talk mechanism introduces excessive noise or computational overhead, negating performance gains.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MTL enhances V2X cooperative perception by fusing heterogeneous data and addressing communication constraints.
- Mechanism: Features from multiple agents (vehicles and infrastructure) are spatially aligned and fused (e.g., using BEV features) before being processed by MTL heads for tasks like detection and prediction.
- Core assumption: V2X communication provides reliable, synchronized data, and the spatial alignment is accurate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] V2X communication enables cooperative driving, mitigating occlusions and improving perception.
  - [section IV-D] MTL is applied after fusing multi-agent information in V2X settings. Studies like Yan et al. [127] propose multi-task collaborative perception for 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation, using a trust model to handle impaired communication.
  - [corpus] The paper "UNCAP" discusses uncertainty-guided planning using natural language communication for cooperative CAVs, indirectly supporting the need for robust inter-agent communication in complex tasks.
- Break condition: Communication latency or loss disrupts feature alignment, leading to fusion errors and degraded MTL performance.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Paradigms (Hard, Soft, Hybrid Parameter Sharing)
- Why needed here: Understanding how parameters are shared is crucial for designing an MTL architecture that balances efficiency and task performance. The paper explicitly categorizes approaches based on these paradigms.
- Quick check question: Which sharing paradigm is most prone to task conflict, and which offers the most flexibility at the cost of scalability?

### Concept: V2X Communication Protocols (DSRC vs. C-V2X)
- Why needed here: The paper highlights V2X as a key enabler for cooperative driving. Knowing the trade-offs between DSRC and C-V2X (range, latency, reliability) is essential for understanding the deployment context.
- Quick check question: Which protocol offers lower latency and better reliability in congested environments, making it more suitable for complex urban scenarios?

### Concept: CAV Software Pipeline (Perception → Prediction → Planning → Control)
- Why needed here: The survey organizes MTL applications by these modules. A new engineer must understand this sequential flow to identify where MTL can be applied to reduce error accumulation.
- Quick check question: In a modular pipeline, what is the primary role of the Prediction module, and how does MTL help in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Shared Backbone (CNN/Transformer) → Feature Fusion Module (FPN, BEV fusion for V2X) → Task-Specific Decoders (Heads for detection, segmentation, prediction, etc.) → Optimization Layer (Loss weighting, gradient conflict mitigation)

### Critical path
Accurate feature extraction by the backbone → Successful fusion of multi-modal or multi-agent data → Balanced multi-task optimization to prevent negative transfer

### Design tradeoffs
Hard-parameter sharing (high efficiency, high task conflict) vs. Soft-parameter sharing (low task conflict, high computational cost) vs. Hybrid (balanced). Real-time performance vs. accuracy (e.g., lightweight backbones vs. large Transformers)

### Failure signatures
Negative transfer (performance drops on some tasks), Seesaw phenomenon (improving one task hurts another), Fusion errors in V2X due to misalignment or latency

### First 3 experiments
1. Implement a baseline perception-only MTL model (e.g., YOLOP) for object detection and semantic segmentation using a hard-parameter sharing architecture to establish a performance-efficiency baseline.
2. Integrate a simple cross-task attention module (hybrid-sharing) to the baseline model and measure its impact on reducing negative transfer between detection and segmentation tasks.
3. Extend the model to a V2X scenario by simulating a two-agent setup and fusing their BEV features before the task heads, evaluating its robustness to simulated communication delays.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the research community establish a standardized benchmark that provides a unified metric to assess joint task performance and quantifies negative transfer in MTL for CAVs?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify the "Lack of benchmarks and evaluation standards," noting that current studies evaluate tasks independently and lack a unified metric to assess joint performance or quantify negative transfer.
- **Why unresolved:** Current evaluations use inconsistent real-time performance assessments (e.g., varying use of acceleration tools like TensorRT), making fair comparisons between MTL models difficult.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The adoption of a benchmark suite that defines consistent hardware metrics and a composite score balancing individual task accuracy against computational efficiency and transfer costs.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can unified MTL models be designed to robustly handle inter-agent data heterogeneity and unstable communication conditions in V2X-based cooperative driving?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper highlights "Limited exploration of MTL for V2X-based cooperation," specifically pointing to challenges with "heterogeneous data sources and communication constraints" that cause data inconsistency and misalignment.
- **Why unresolved:** Most existing MTL models are developed for single-agent systems and struggle with the data inconsistencies and intermittent connectivity inherent in multi-agent V2X environments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of an MTL architecture that maintains stable object detection and prediction accuracy when fusing data from diverse sensors (e.g., different cameras/LiDARs) under simulated packet loss or bandwidth throttling.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What methodologies are required to effectively transition MTL models from simulation or lab settings to robust real-world deployment in safety-critical CAV systems?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors point out a "Lack of real-world evaluation," stating that most current studies evaluate models only in lab settings, which fail to capture the challenges of dynamic real-world environments.
- **Why unresolved:** Real-world deployment introduces dynamic variables and safety constraints not fully represented in training data, creating a gap between theoretical performance and practical reliability.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comprehensive on-board evaluation results demonstrating that an MTL model maintains safety and robustness in diverse, uncontrolled traffic scenarios compared to traditional modular pipelines.

## Limitations
- Limited real-world validation: The survey primarily reviews simulated and benchmarked results rather than extensive real-world deployments, leaving questions about MTL robustness under variable weather, sensor noise, and communication disruptions in CAVs.
- Heterogeneous data challenges: While V2X cooperative perception is highlighted, the paper acknowledges but does not deeply explore the technical complexities of fusing heterogeneous data sources across multiple agents with varying sensing capabilities and communication reliability.
- Scalability to dynamic task sets: The survey does not address how MTL architectures would adapt when CAVs need to dynamically learn or drop tasks based on changing environmental conditions or mission requirements.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The systematic categorization of MTL approaches (CNN-based, Transformer-based, VLM-based) and their application to CAV modules is well-supported by the surveyed literature and clearly articulated.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency gains and task synergy are logically sound but primarily based on benchmark comparisons rather than comprehensive real-world validation across diverse CAV scenarios.
- **Low Confidence**: The paper's assertions about V2X-based cooperative perception robustness and scalability in complex urban environments are mostly theoretical, with limited empirical evidence from large-scale field tests.

## Next Checks
1. **Real-world performance validation**: Conduct field tests comparing MTL-based CAV systems against modular baselines in diverse environmental conditions (day/night, weather variations) to verify claimed efficiency and synergy benefits beyond benchmark settings.
2. **Communication constraint evaluation**: Implement controlled experiments introducing variable latency and packet loss in V2X communication to assess MTL system robustness and identify failure thresholds for cooperative perception tasks.
3. **Dynamic task adaptation testing**: Develop and test MTL architectures capable of dynamically adjusting task priorities or temporarily dropping less critical tasks when computational resources are constrained or environmental conditions change rapidly.
