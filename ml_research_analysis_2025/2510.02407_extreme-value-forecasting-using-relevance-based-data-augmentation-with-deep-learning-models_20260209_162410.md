# Extreme value forecasting using relevance-based data augmentation with deep learning models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02407
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02407
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SMOTE-R-bin data augmentation with Conv-LSTM or BD-LSTM architectures outperforms standard methods for forecasting rare extreme values in time series.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of forecasting rare extreme values in time series data by integrating relevance-based data augmentation with deep learning models. The framework uses a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial (PCHIP) to construct a relevance function, identifying extreme samples based on predefined thresholds. Data augmentation strategies, including SMOTE-R variants and GANs, are employed to balance the scarcity of extreme values. Two deep learning models—Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM—are evaluated for multi-step ahead prediction. Experimental results across diverse datasets (e.g., Lorenz, Sunspot, Cyclone, and Bike) demonstrate that SMOTE-R-bin consistently outperforms other methods, especially under strict relevance thresholds. Conv-LSTM excels in periodic datasets, while BD-LSTM is better suited for chaotic or non-stationary sequences. The relevance-based framework enhances forecasting accuracy, particularly for rare events, and highlights the importance of aligning model architecture, data augmentation, and temporal characteristics for optimal performance.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a relevance-based data augmentation approach for extreme value forecasting in time series. It uses a PCHIP function to map samples to relevance scores based on boxplot statistics, with thresholds identifying extreme events. Data augmentation via SMOTE-R variants (including temporal binning) and GANs balances the minority extreme class. Two deep learning architectures—Conv-LSTM (for periodic data) and BD-LSTM (for chaotic data)—are trained on augmented datasets. The system uses Taken's embedding for feature creation, MinMax scaling for normalization, and evaluates performance using both RMSE and Squared Error-Relevance (SER) metrics. The approach is tested across five diverse datasets with varying temporal characteristics.

## Key Results
- SMOTE-R-bin consistently outperforms other augmentation methods, especially under strict relevance thresholds.
- Conv-LSTM excels in periodic datasets like Sunspot, while BD-LSTM performs better in chaotic sequences like Lorenz.
- Relevance-based framework improves forecasting accuracy for rare extreme events across diverse datasets.
- GAN-based augmentation showed high variance and instability compared to SMOTE-R variants.
- Temporal binning in SMOTE-R-bin preserves local dynamics better than global interpolation methods.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Relevance-based sample identification isolates rare events so the loss function cannot ignore them.
- **Mechanism:** Standard regression losses (e.g., MSE) weight errors by sample frequency; rare extremes contribute negligible signal during gradient descent. The framework uses a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) constructed from boxplot statistics to map every sample to a relevance score $\phi(x) \in [0,1]$. By setting a relevance threshold $R_T$, the system explicitly partitions the dataset into "extreme" and "common" subsets, allowing targeted augmentation to alter the effective sample distribution before training.
- **Core assumption:** The PCHIP relevance function accurately reflects domain-specific importance (i.e., statistical percentiles align with semantic "extremeness").
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The framework uses a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial (PCHIP) to construct a relevance function, identifying extreme samples based on predefined thresholds."
  - [Section 3.2] "We define a relevance function $\phi: \mathcal{X} \to [0,1]$... The relevance scores that are closer to 1 indicate the sample is more extreme."
  - [corpus] Corpus signals focus on "extreme class imbalance" generally but do not specifically validate PCHIP over other weighting schemes.
- **Break condition:** If the relevance threshold is set too low, the "extreme" class encompasses common values, diluting the augmentation signal; if set too high, too few samples exist for effective interpolation.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Temporal binning in augmentation (SMOTE-R-bin) preserves local dynamics better than global interpolation.
- **Mechanism:** Standard SMOTE interpolates between any two minority samples, potentially linking points from different time regimes (concept drift), which generates physically invalid synthetic data. SMOTE-R-bin partitions the time series into bins of consecutive observations. It restricts synthetic sample generation to neighbors within the same bin, preserving short-term temporal dependencies and preventing the distortion of long-term distributional shifts.
- **Core assumption:** Extremes exhibit similar local temporal dynamics to their immediate neighbors, even if their magnitude is statistically distinct.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 3] "SMOTE-R-bin partitions numeric time series data into bins of consecutive rare or common observations... [ensuring] interpolation can only take place between samples that are within the temporal vicinity."
  - [Section 4.4] "SMOTER-bin... performs well on periodic datasets such as Sunspot... likely due to its ability to enrich extreme samples."
  - [corpus] Weak support; related works mention "time series dataset balancing" but do not explicitly compare binning vs. global interpolation.
- **Break condition:** In highly volatile chaotic systems where local dynamics shift rapidly, fixed binning might still merge incompatible regimes if the bin window is too wide.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Architecture choice must match data stationarity; Conv-LSTM captures periodicity while BD-LSTM handles non-stationary chaos.
- **Mechanism:** Conv-LSTM uses convolutional structures within recurrent units to capture spatially correlated features, which aligns with stable, periodic waveforms (e.g., Sunspots). BD-LSTM processes sequences bidirectionally, capturing future context that helps disambiguate noisy, chaotic transitions (e.g., Lorenz, Cyclones) where unidirectional assumptions fail.
- **Core assumption:** The underlying physical process generating the time series is deterministic enough to be modeled by the respective inductive biases (spatial correlation vs. bidirectional context).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.4] "Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary sequences."
  - [Table 3] Shows BD-LSTM outperforming Conv-LSTM on the chaotic Lorenz dataset, while Conv-LSTM wins on the periodic Sunspot dataset.
  - [corpus] General support for deep learning in extreme forecasting (UniExtreme, Credit Risk), but no specific architectural comparisons for stationarity.
- **Break condition:** If the sequence is purely stochastic (random walk) rather than chaotic/deterministic, the bidirectional signal may simply overfit noise.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Relevance Functions in Utility-Based Regression**
  - **Why needed here:** Unlike classification (where classes are discrete), regression extremes exist on a continuum. You must learn to define "what counts as extreme" mathematically via utility/relevance scores rather than simple labels.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) differ from a simple percentile threshold in defining extremes?

- **Concept:** **Concept Drift in Time Series**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper identifies that standard augmentation fails because it ignores *when* data occurs. You need to understand how distributional shifts over time invalidate synthetic samples created from distant time points.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might interpolating between two extreme cyclone intensities from different decades produce a physically impossible synthetic sample?

- **Concept:** **SER (Squared Error-Relevance)**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard RMSE is dominated by frequent "common" values. You must learn to evaluate performance using SER, which weights errors by their relevance score, to properly measure if the model actually learned the extremes.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model predicts common values perfectly but misses all extremes, will RMSE or SER reflect the failure more accurately?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input -> MinMax scaling -> Takens' embedding -> Relevance Module (PCHIP) -> Augmentation (SMOTE-R-bin/GANs) -> Forecasting Model (Conv-LSTM/BD-LSTM) -> Evaluation (SER)
- **Critical path:** The **Relevance Module** is the most brittle component. The paper notes that the definition of "extreme" is dataset-dependent and usually requires expert knowledge. If the PCHIP function or the threshold $\tau$ is misconfigured, the subsequent augmentation will amplify noise or the wrong signal.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **SMOTE-R-bin vs. GANs:** The paper found **SMOTE-R-bin** consistently superior. GANs (1D-GAN, 1D-Conv-GAN) offered flexibility but suffered from training instability and high variance, failing to generalize in chaotic regimes.
  - **Strictness vs. Stability:** Strict relevance thresholds ($\tau=0.9$) make the problem harder but highlight the superiority of SMOTE-based resampling; loose thresholds ($\tau=0.7$) allow "noisier" extremes where GANs are slightly more competitive but less reliable.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **GAN Instability:** High variance in RMSE/SER and mode collapse (generating identical extremes).
  - **Augmenting Noise:** In high-variance datasets like *Bike*, aggressive resampling (SMOTE-R-bin) amplified noise, causing the "No-Resampling" baseline to outperform it.
  - **Architectural Mismatch:** Using Conv-LSTM on chaotic data (Lorenz) results in lower performance compared to BD-LSTM.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Sanity Check:** Run BD-LSTM on the *Lorenz* dataset with "No-Resampling" vs. "SMOTE-R-bin" at $\tau=0.9$. Verify that SER improves with augmentation.
  2. **Architecture Ablation:** Test Conv-LSTM vs. BD-LSTM on the *Sunspot* (periodic) vs. *Lorenz* (chaotic) datasets. Confirm Conv-LSTM wins on Sunspot and BD-LSTM wins on Lorenz.
  3. **Augmentation Stress Test:** On the *Bike* dataset, compare SMOTE-R-bin vs. SMOTE-R-regular (no binning). Check if binning actually helps preserve concept drift or if it degrades performance due to data sparsity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can advanced generative models, such as diffusion models or transformer-based frameworks, overcome the instability and performance limitations observed in standard 1D-GANs for extreme value data augmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion states that the potential for data augmentation using generative models "remains largely unexplored," specifically noting that "novel GANs, diffusion models, and transformer-based generative frameworks can be explored in future work" to address the poor performance of the GANs tested.
- Why unresolved: The study found that 1D-GAN and 1D-Conv-GAN exhibited unstable behavior and high variability, but did not test newer generative architectures better suited for tabular or sequential data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments implementing diffusion or transformer-based augmentation on the datasets used in the paper (e.g., Lorenz, Cyclone), showing improved stability and lower Squared Error-Relevance (SER) compared to the SMOTE-R baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the integration of adaptive thresholding or dynamic relevance functions improve the identification and forecasting of extremes in non-stationary time series compared to the static PCHIP method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify the definition of extremes as a key limitation, noting that "Future work could explore adaptive thresholding or more sophisticated relevance functions to capture extremes under dynamic or non-stationary conditions better."
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies on static, discrete thresholds ($\tau \in \{0.7, 0.8, 0.9\}$) and a fixed PCHIP interpolation, which may not capture extremes accurately as data distributions shift over time (concept drift).
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing that a model utilizing a dynamic relevance function maintains higher forecasting accuracy (lower SER) under simulated concept drift conditions than the static PCHIP approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can an ensemble framework combining Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM architectures adaptively adjust to data characteristics to outperform individual models in extreme value forecasting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion proposes that "A particularly promising direction is the use of ensemble-based frameworks, where different architectures... are combined to harness their complementary strengths."
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes that Conv-LSTM excels with periodic data while BD-LSTM performs better with chaotic data, but it did not test whether combining them could yield a universally robust model.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of a weighted ensemble model that demonstrates lower variance and superior SER scores across both periodic (Sunspot) and chaotic (Lorenz) datasets compared to the best single-model baselines.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can embedding Bayesian structures into SMOTE variants to dynamically adjust sampling intensity based on posterior uncertainty improve robustness for rare event forecasting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that "embedding Bayesian structures into SMOTER variants so that sampling intensity adapts dynamically to posterior uncertainty or tail-risk estimates" is a critical frontier for future research.
- Why unresolved: Current SMOTE strategies use fixed resampling ratios which may amplify noise in sparse regions; utilizing uncertainty estimates to guide augmentation is proposed but untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: A Bayesian-SMOTE implementation that correlates sampling intensity with prediction uncertainty, resulting in reduced error in the tail regions (extreme values) compared to standard SMOTE-R-bin.

## Limitations
- The exact percentile-to-relevance mapping pairs used in the PCHIP function are not specified, creating potential reproducibility gaps.
- Critical training parameters (batch size, epochs, learning rate) for Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM are omitted, which could significantly impact performance.
- The optimal relevance threshold $\tau$ is highly dataset-specific, with no universal guidance provided for parameter selection.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The superiority of SMOTE-R-bin over GANs for augmentation, and the complementary strengths of Conv-LSTM vs. BD-LSTM based on data stationarity.

**Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of the relevance-based framework in improving extreme value forecasting, given the strong empirical results across diverse datasets.

**Low Confidence:** The precise mathematical formulation of the PCHIP relevance function and its optimal parameterization.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study:** Systematically vary the relevance threshold $\tau$ (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) on the Lorenz dataset to quantify sensitivity and identify optimal settings.

2. **Temporal Dynamics Test:** Apply SMOTE-R-bin vs. standard SMOTE-R to the Cyclone-SPO dataset to directly measure the impact of temporal binning on concept drift and synthetic sample validity.

3. **Hyperparameter Sweep:** Train BD-LSTM on the Sunspot dataset with varying batch sizes (32, 64, 128) and learning rates (0.001, 0.0001) to establish stable training conditions and verify performance consistency.
