# Biological Pathway Guided Gene Selection Through Collaborative Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24155
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24155
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves AUC scores up to 0.97 in breast cancer classification using pathway-guided MARL framework

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BioMARL, a two-stage framework that integrates statistical feature selection with biological pathway knowledge using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for gene selection in high-dimensional genomic data. The approach first applies pathway-guided statistical pre-filtering to create a biologically relevant reduced gene set, then employs a MARL framework where each gene acts as an agent optimizing both predictive power and biological relevance. Extensive experiments on multiple TCGA datasets show BioMARL significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving AUC scores up to 0.97 in breast cancer classification. The framework demonstrates improved biological interpretability through pathway coverage and gene centrality measures, validated by Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and survival prediction. The approach effectively bridges the gap between statistical rigor and biological context in gene selection.

## Method Summary
BioMARL operates in two stages: (1) pathway-guided pre-filtering using chi-squared, random forest importance, and SVM-based ranking combined with KEGG pathway performance scores to create a reduced gene set, and (2) MARL-based refined selection where each gene functions as a DQN agent optimizing both predictive power and biological relevance. The framework uses a GNN state encoder over a hybrid correlation-pathway similarity graph, centralized critic for global value estimation, and a multi-component reward balancing prediction performance with biological interpretability through pathway coverage and gene centrality measures.

## Key Results
- Achieves AUC scores up to 0.97 in breast cancer classification (BRCA(ER) subtype)
- Outperforms traditional methods on 5/6 tested datasets (BRCA subtypes, LUAD, OV)
- Demonstrates improved biological interpretability through GO enrichment (44-90 terms vs <35 for baselines)
- Maintains competitive performance even when pathway information is removed (ablation study shows AUC drop from 0.9706 to 0.9598)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Pathway-guided pre-filtering reduces search space while preserving biologically relevant genes. Combines three statistical methods (chi-squared, random forest importance, SVM-based ranking) with KEGG pathway performance scores. For each gene, computes a weighted meta-score: $\hat{s}_g = m_g \cdot (1 + \beta \cdot \log(1 + \bar{S}_p(g)))$, where pathway scores boost genes in high-performing pathways. Retains genes with scores above $\mu + 2\sigma$. Core assumption: Genes in pathways with strong classification performance are more likely to be biologically relevant for the downstream task.

### Mechanism 2
Modeling genes as collaborative agents captures inter-gene dependencies better than independent feature selection. Each gene operates as a DQN agent with binary action space (select/discard). State representation uses GNN over a hybrid graph: $E_{ij} = \rho \cdot C_{ij} + (1-\rho) \cdot J_{ij}$, combining correlation and Jaccard pathway similarity. Shared memory maintains synergy matrix $M$ tracking pairwise feature success; centralized critic $V(s)$ provides global value estimates to balance local and collective optimization. Core assumption: Genes function through regulatory pathways where collective behavior matters; optimal selection requires coordination, not independent ranking.

### Mechanism 3
Multi-component reward balances statistical performance with biological interpretability. Final reward $r_i = \omega \cdot r_{base} + \xi \cdot \Delta\phi_i + \zeta \cdot \Delta\psi_i$ combines: (1) personal performance impact via ensemble meta-learner, (2) gene centrality capturing cross-pathway connectivity, (3) pathway coverage ensuring diverse biological process representation. Weights (0.5, 0.25, 0.25) prioritize prediction while maintaining biological relevance. Core assumption: Optimizing for pathway coverage and centrality alongside prediction produces more interpretable and generalizable gene signatures.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE)
  - Why needed here: Each gene (agent) must learn selection policy considering others' actions; centralized critic enables coordination during training while agents act independently at inference
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a centralized critic reduces variance compared to independent Q-learning when agents have interdependent rewards?

- **Concept**: Graph Neural Networks for biological state representation
  - Why needed here: Captures gene-gene relationships via message passing over pathway-aware adjacency; provides structured state for RL agents
  - Quick check question: How does the hybrid edge construction $E_{ij} = \rho \cdot C_{ij} + (1-\rho) \cdot J_{ij}$ differ from using correlation-only graphs?

- **Concept**: Credit Assignment in cooperative MARL
  - Why needed here: Global reward (prediction improvement) must be attributed to individual gene agents; the personal performance impact estimator and differential centrality/coverage measures decompose credit
  - Quick check question: Why is the credit assignment problem harder in gene selection than in single-agent RL?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input: Gene expression matrix (samples × 20,530 genes) → Stage 1: Pre-filtering (3 statistical methods + KEGG pathway scores) → G_pre (~hundreds of genes) → Stage 2: MARL Loop (GNN State Encoder, N Agent DQNs, Shared Memory, Centralized Critic, Personalized Reward Module) → Output: Ranked gene list → top-k selection

- **Critical path**: Pre-filtering quality → GNN state representation fidelity → reward decomposition accuracy. If Stage 1 removes relevant genes, Stage 2 cannot recover them.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Pre-filtering threshold ($\mu + 2\sigma$): Aggressive filtering speeds training but risks false negatives
  - Reward weights ($\omega, \xi, \zeta$): Higher $\omega$ improves prediction; higher $\xi, \zeta$ improves interpretability at potential prediction cost
  - Agent count: More agents = richer selection but slower convergence; paper uses post-filtered set (size not specified, typically 100-500)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low variance in agent Q-values → exploration collapse (increase epsilon or reduce decay rate)
  - Selected genes cluster in few pathways → coverage weight $\zeta$ too low
  - AUC plateaus below baseline → pre-filtering removed critical genes (lower threshold)
  - Training instability → reduce learning rate or increase target network update frequency

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run ablation with only $r_{base}$ reward on a small dataset to verify MARL framework converges without pathway components
  2. Test different pre-filtering thresholds ($\mu + 1\sigma$ vs $\mu + 2\sigma$) to measure sensitivity on BRCA(ER) subset
  3. Visualize synergy matrix evolution during training to confirm agents learn non-trivial collaborations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the hard-threshold pre-filtering stage inadvertently exclude genes with weak individual signals but high cooperative synergistic potential? The two-stage separation assumes genes must be statistically significant individually to be useful, potentially ignoring genes that are only predictive in combination with others.

### Open Question 2
How does the framework's performance and interpretability change when substituting the KEGG database with alternative biological networks like Reactome or Gene Ontology? Different knowledge bases have varying topological structures and gene coverage; the model's reliance on KEGG may bias results toward specific well-characterized pathways.

### Open Question 3
Is the fixed reward weighting between prediction performance, centrality, and coverage universally optimal, or does it require dynamic adjustment per dataset? The relative importance of statistical accuracy versus biological relevance likely varies across heterogeneous cancer types (e.g., BRCA vs. OV), suggesting a static balance may be suboptimal.

## Limitations

- Hard-threshold pre-filtering ($\mu + 2\sigma$) may exclude genes with weak individual signals but high cooperative potential
- Computational complexity scales poorly with gene count - framework becomes intractable for >1000 agents
- Limited validation on non-cancer datasets; framework assumes strong pathway-disease associations that may not hold for other conditions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Core MARL framework implementation, baseline comparisons, primary AUC metrics (0.97 for BRCA(ER))
- **Medium confidence**: Pathway-guided pre-filtering mechanism, biological interpretability claims (GO enrichment, centrality measures)
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to new datasets, robustness to different pathway databases, optimal hyperparameter settings

## Next Checks

1. Perform sensitivity analysis on pre-filtering threshold (μ + 1σ to μ + 3σ) across all datasets to identify optimal cutoff
2. Test framework on non-cancer datasets (e.g., autoimmune diseases) to assess generalizability beyond pathway-rich cancer contexts
3. Implement ablation study comparing different pathway databases (Reactome, GO vs KEGG) to quantify annotation dependency
