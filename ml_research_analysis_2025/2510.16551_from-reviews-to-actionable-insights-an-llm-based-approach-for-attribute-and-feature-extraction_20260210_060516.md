# From Reviews to Actionable Insights: An LLM-Based Approach for Attribute and Feature Extraction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.16551
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16551
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: LLM approach extracts attributes/features from reviews with high agreement (α = 0.75/0.66) and predicts ratings (R² = 0.74/0.68), processing 6-min human reviews in <2 sec

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a systematic large language model (LLM) approach to extract product and service attributes, features, and sentiments from customer reviews. The method distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features and uses guided prompts to process reviews sentence-by-sentence, assigning each to predefined attributes and features while evaluating sentiment. Evaluated on 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores, the approach achieved high agreement with human annotations and strong predictive validity for customer ratings. The analysis revealed that customer service and coffee/beverage attributes dominate review mentions, with sentiment closely tied to overall ratings. Simulations indicated that improving sentiment for key service features could yield 1–2% average revenue gains per store.

## Method Summary
The approach processes customer reviews sentence-by-sentence using an LLM with guided prompts that assign each sentence to predefined attributes and features while evaluating sentiment. The method distinguishes between perceptual attributes (e.g., coffee quality, ambiance) and actionable features (e.g., staff friendliness, seating comfort). The system creates structured review data that can power marketing dashboards for tracking sentiment over time, benchmarking store performance, and identifying high-leverage features for targeted interventions. The approach was validated against human annotations and tested on its ability to predict customer ratings.

## Key Results
- Achieved Krippendorff's alpha of 0.75 for attribute assignment and 0.66 for feature assignment when compared to human annotations
- Strong predictive validity for customer ratings (R² = 0.74 for attributes, R² = 0.68 for features)
- Human coders required a median of six minutes per review, while the LLM processed each in under two seconds
- Simulations indicated 1–2% average revenue gains per store from improving sentiment for key service features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the LLM's ability to understand context and nuance in natural language while following structured prompts that guide the extraction process. By processing reviews sentence-by-sentence rather than as whole documents, the system can more accurately attribute sentiments to specific aspects of the customer experience. The distinction between perceptual attributes and actionable features enables businesses to move from understanding what customers think to identifying what they can actually change. The structured output creates a foundation for quantitative analysis that connects customer perceptions to business outcomes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Attribute vs Feature Distinction**: Attributes are broad perceptual categories (e.g., coffee quality), while features are specific, actionable elements (e.g., temperature, flavor). This distinction is needed to bridge customer feedback and operational improvements. Quick check: Review sample outputs to verify proper classification.

- **Sentence-by-Sentence Processing**: Breaking reviews into sentences improves accuracy by isolating specific sentiments and their targets. This is needed because reviews often mix multiple topics and sentiments. Quick check: Compare accuracy rates between sentence-level and whole-review processing.

- **Guided Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts ensure consistent attribute/feature assignment and sentiment scoring. This is needed to maintain reliability across diverse review content. Quick check: Test prompt variations on a validation set.

- **Krippendorff's Alpha for Reliability**: This statistic measures inter-rater agreement while accounting for chance agreement. This is needed for robust evaluation of annotation consistency. Quick check: Calculate alpha across multiple annotators.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Reviews -> Sentence Tokenizer -> LLM Processor -> Attribute/Feature Assigner -> Sentiment Evaluator -> Structured Output Database

**Critical Path**: Review ingestion → Sentence segmentation → LLM prompt processing → Structured data output

**Design Tradeoffs**: Predefined attribute lists ensure consistency but may miss emerging topics; sentence-level processing increases accuracy but requires more computational steps; structured output enables analysis but may oversimplify nuanced feedback.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor attribute/feature assignment when reviews use novel terminology; sentiment misclassification for sarcasm or mixed sentiments; performance degradation with highly technical or domain-specific language.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test the system on reviews from multiple industries to evaluate generalizability
2. Vary the granularity of attribute/feature lists to find optimal balance between coverage and specificity
3. Compare performance using different LLM models to identify optimal architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach relies on predefined attribute and feature lists, which may not capture all relevant aspects of customer experience and could introduce bias
- Revenue simulation models assume linear relationships between sentiment improvements and financial outcomes, potentially oversimplifying consumer behavior
- The focus on Starbucks locations may limit generalizability to other industries or service contexts
- The human annotation process was performed by a single coder per review, limiting assessment of inter-rater reliability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The relative processing speed comparison between human coders and the LLM approach, as well as the basic sentiment extraction and assignment methodology
- **Medium confidence**: The reliability metrics (Krippendorff's alpha values) and predictive validity for customer ratings, though the single-coder limitation affects overall confidence
- **Low confidence**: The revenue simulation results and broader business impact claims, which require additional validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-rater reliability testing with multiple human coders across a random sample of reviews to establish more robust baseline agreement metrics
2. Test the approach on reviews from multiple industries and service contexts to evaluate generalizability and identify potential domain-specific limitations
3. Implement a longitudinal field test comparing actual revenue changes in stores that implement sentiment-driven interventions versus control stores to validate the simulation model's predictions
