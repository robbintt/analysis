# Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) Dataset Generator Framework for IoT Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.12305
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12305
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Framework generates >10,000 realistic MLaaS service instances for IoT, improving service selection accuracy by 15-25% and composition quality by 10% versus benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the MLaaS Dataset Generator (MDG), a framework that simulates realistic Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) behavior for IoT environments by training diverse models on real-world datasets and capturing detailed functional attributes and quality of service metrics. MDG enables systematic evaluation of MLaaS selection and composition by generating more than ten thousand service instances and supporting reproducible experimentation under varied data distribution conditions. The framework includes a built-in composition mechanism that models cross-service interactions and composability under IoT-specific constraints. Experiments show that datasets generated by MDG improve service selection accuracy by 15-25% and composition quality by 10% compared to existing benchmarks.

## Method Summary
MDG generates synthetic MLaaS datasets by training diverse model families (CNN, LSTM, Random Forest, etc.) on 7 real-world datasets under varied data distribution strategies (IID, non-IID/Dirichlet). The framework supports three input modes: Wizard (interactive), Generate (CLI), and Autogen (randomized). It captures fine-grained functional attributes and QoS metrics (accuracy, latency, resource usage) in a structured SQLite backend. A utility-driven composability filter (DUM, MUM, SM, HQS, SRS) reduces combinatorial explosion before aggregation. Results are exported in SQLite, CSV, and JSON formats for reproducibility.

## Key Results
- Generates >10,000 service instances across model families and data distributions
- Improves service selection accuracy by 15-25% versus QWS and incomplete MLaaS baselines
- Achieves 10% higher composition quality with utility-driven filtering approach
- Supports both parametric (weighted averaging) and non-parametric (ensemble) aggregation strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Synthetic Diversity Enabling Robust Selection
If a dataset captures fine-grained functional attributes and resource usage under varied distribution conditions, service selection algorithms can achieve higher satisfaction rates than on static metadata. MDG generates >10,000 service instances by combining diverse model families with different data distribution strategies, creating a dense feature space where selection algorithms have sufficient signal to distinguish between services based on accuracy, latency, and resource constraints.

### Mechanism 2: Utility-Driven Composability Filtering
If services are pre-filtered using utility-driven indicators (Data/Model Utility, Reliability) before aggregation, the resulting compositions maintain higher stability and quality. MDG reduces combinatorial explosion by calculating composability indicators derived from prior studies, discarding low-utility candidates before expensive aggregation.

### Mechanism 3: Structured Traceability for Reproducibility
If execution details are hierarchically logged (runs → rounds → clients) and exported in structured formats, researchers can reliably isolate performance variables. The framework decouples configuration from execution, storing specific hyperparameters and data splits in the runs table and mapping them to specific QoS outcomes in the qos table.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Non-IID Data (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed)**
  - Why needed: MDG simulates IoT conditions where data is not evenly distributed (e.g., "quantity-skew" or "Dirichlet" sampling).
  - Quick check: How does accuracy of a model trained on balanced dataset compare to one trained on quantity-skewed dataset in an IoT network?

- **Concept: Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Aggregation**
  - Why needed: The composition mechanism treats neural networks (parametric) differently from Random Forests (non-parametric).
  - Quick check: Can you directly average the weights of a Random Forest model? If not, what strategy does MDG suggest?

- **Concept: QoS (Quality of Service) in ML Systems**
  - Why needed: The framework evaluates services not just on "accuracy" but on latency, memory usage, and communication bytes—critical constraints for edge/IoT devices.
  - Quick check: If a service has 99% accuracy but takes 5 seconds to inference and 1GB of RAM, is it viable for real-time IoT sensor node?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Config → Dataset Partitioning (Non-IID logic) → Model Training → QoS Logging → Composition Filtering → Final Benchmark Export
- **Critical path:** The QoS Logging step is the primary value-add differentiating this from standard ML training pipelines.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Uses real training runs for realistic loss/accuracy curves (computationally expensive but ensures physical validity) vs. purely statistical simulation; supports 3 input modes and 7+ datasets (increases code complexity but allows broader coverage).
- **Failure signatures:** Client Starvation (extreme Dirichlet alpha causing 0 samples), Composition Collapse (utility thresholds too high returning 0 valid compositions), Version Drift (results varying across library versions despite fixed seeds).
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Run "Hello World" in Wizard Mode (train CNN on MNIST, verify qos table populates), 2) Run comparison of data skew (IID vs Dirichlet alpha=0.1, compare accuracy drops), 3) Execute composition scenario (combine 5 services, check Average Solution Quality score).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Generalization to real-world MLaaS APIs:** How does MDG-generated dataset performance generalize to real-world MLaaS APIs (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, OpenAI) versus simulated service instances? The framework simulates MLaaS behavior through local model training but does not validate against actual commercial API responses.

- **Computational scalability of composability filtering:** What is the computational scalability of composability filtering indicators when service instances exceed current 10,432 scale by orders of magnitude? The paper notes manual evaluation is computationally expensive but evaluates at modest scale on single machine.

- **Sequential pipeline compositions:** Can the current composition mechanism handle sequential pipeline compositions common in IoT workflows, beyond parallel aggregation strategies? The composition mechanism focuses on weighted parameter averaging and ensemble aggregation but not explicitly addressing task-dependency chains.

## Limitations

- Utility-driven composability filtering relies on unspecified thresholds and weighting schemes for composability indicators, making it difficult to assess robustness across different IoT scenarios.
- Claim of 15-25% improvement in selection accuracy and 10% improvement in composition quality lacks detailed baseline definitions and statistical significance testing.
- Computational overhead of generating >10,000 service instances through actual training runs may limit practical scalability for large-scale IoT deployments.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The framework's architecture for capturing fine-grained functional attributes and QoS metrics is well-specified and technically sound.
- **Medium Confidence:** The reported improvements in selection accuracy and composition quality are plausible given synthetic diversity, but lack rigorous statistical validation and baseline definitions.
- **Low Confidence:** The transferability of generated datasets to real-world IoT environments is uncertain, particularly if underlying real-world datasets don't adequately represent target IoT domain complexity.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct statistical significance testing on reported 15-25% improvement in selection accuracy and 10% improvement in composition quality compared to QWS and incomplete MLaaS baselines.
2. Evaluate framework's performance on real-world IoT dataset (e.g., sensor data from smart cities) to assess transferability beyond synthetic benchmarks.
3. Benchmark computational overhead of generating >10,000 service instances through actual training runs versus statistical simulation, and assess scalability for large-scale IoT deployments.
