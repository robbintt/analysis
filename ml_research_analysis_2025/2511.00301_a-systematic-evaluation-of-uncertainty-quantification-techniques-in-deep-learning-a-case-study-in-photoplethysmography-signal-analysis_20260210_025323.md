# A systematic evaluation of uncertainty quantification techniques in deep learning: a case study in photoplethysmography signal analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.00301
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00301
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** No single UQ technique universally outperforms others; optimal performance depends on the chosen expression of uncertainty, evaluation metric, and scale of reliability assessment.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates eight uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques for deep learning models applied to photoplethysmography (PPG) signal analysis, specifically for atrial fibrillation (AF) classification and blood pressure (BP) regression tasks. The research implements and compares intrinsic methods (Maximum a Posteriori estimation, Monte Carlo Dropout, Quantile Regression), post-hoc ensemble techniques (Deep Ensembles), and post-hoc recalibration approaches (Temperature Scaling, Conformal Prediction, Isotonic Regression). A comprehensive evaluation framework is developed to assess uncertainty reliability across global, local, and adaptive scales, considering both calibration and sharpness metrics. Results reveal that no single UQ technique universally outperforms others; optimal performance depends on the chosen expression of uncertainty, evaluation metric, and scale of reliability assessment. The study emphasizes the importance of evaluating UQ techniques in realistic clinical contexts, where individual reliability and adaptivity are critical for trustworthy decision-making, and highlights the need for improved methods that better handle class imbalance and provide individual-level uncertainty estimates.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates eight UQ techniques across two clinical tasks using PPG signals: AF classification and BP regression. Eight techniques are implemented: Maximum a Posteriori (MAP), Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Deep Ensembles (DE), Quantile Regression (QR), Temperature Scaling (TS), Isotonic Regression (IR), and Conformal Prediction (CP). The evaluation uses 1D CNN architectures (xresnet1d50 and AlexNet1D) trained on the DeepBeat dataset for AF and VitalDB/PulseDB for BP. A comprehensive evaluation framework assesses reliability at global (NLL, CRPS), local (ENCE, ECE), and adaptive (per-class metrics) scales. Post-hoc methods are applied using dedicated calibration sets, and all techniques are evaluated on disjoint test sets. The study emphasizes realistic clinical deployment by analyzing performance across different reliability scales and highlighting the trade-offs between global and adaptive reliability.

## Key Results
- No single UQ technique universally outperforms others across all evaluation metrics and reliability scales
- Post-hoc recalibration methods (TS, IR, CP) improve global calibration but degrade adaptive reliability, especially for minority classes like AF
- Local and adaptive reliability metrics reveal critical patterns obscured by global metrics, particularly for clinical deployment where individual predictions matter

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Bayesian-inspired intrinsic methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles) can capture epistemic uncertainty by approximating a posterior distribution over model parameters, providing a more complete reliability profile than point estimates.
- **Mechanism:** Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) activates dropout during inference, performing multiple stochastic forward passes. Deep Ensembles (DE) train multiple independent model instances. Both methods generate a distribution of predictions where the variance reflects model uncertainty.
- **Core Assumption:** The training dropout (MCD) or varied initialization (DE) sufficiently samples the space of plausible model configurations, approximating a Bayesian posterior.
- **Evidence Anchors:**
  - [abstract] The paper implements "intrinsic methods (Maximum a Posteriori estimation, Monte Carlo Dropout, Quantile Regression)" and "post-hoc ensemble techniques (Deep Ensembles)".
  - [section] Section 2.1 and Table 2 describe MCD as "Approximate Variational Learning" capturing epistemic uncertainty via the "Law of Total Variance" and DE as a "Heuristic ensemble" with a Bayesian interpretation.
  - [corpus] Related work like "Torch-Uncertainty" provides frameworks for these Bayesian deep learning methods.
- **Break Condition:** The approximation fails if the dropout rate is too low or the ensemble size is too small, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates that don't reflect true model uncertainty.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Post-hoc recalibration techniques (e.g., Temperature Scaling, Isotonic Regression) improve global calibration metrics but can degrade adaptive/local reliability, especially for minority classes or challenging data regimes.
- **Mechanism:** These methods learn a transformation (scalar or monotonic function) on a held-out calibration set to map uncalibrated confidence scores or prediction intervals to better match observed frequencies of outcomes, optimizing for global metrics like Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL).
- **Core Assumption:** The calibration set is representative of the test distribution (exchangeability), and the transformation required is simple or monotonic.
- **Evidence Anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Results reveal that no single UQ technique universally outperforms others; optimal performance depends on the chosen expression of uncertainty, evaluation metric, and scale of reliability assessment."
  - [section] Section 3.1.2 (AF task) states, "While the global calibration metrics suggest the models produced well-calibrated uncertainties, the adaptive metrics... show that reliability for each class is comparatively worse... The post-hoc methods... exhibit poor reliability for both non-AF and AF cases".
  - [corpus] The "Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning in Healthcare" survey likely discusses these clinical trade-offs.
- **Break Condition:** The mechanism fails when the calibration and test distributions diverge (violating exchangeability) or when the chosen transformation cannot capture complex, non-monotonic miscalibration patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Local and adaptive reliability metrics (e.g., ENCE, per-class ECE) reveal reliability patterns that global metrics (e.g., NLL, CRPS) obscure, which is critical for clinical deployment where individual predictions matter.
- **Mechanism:** Global metrics average error over the entire test set, masking poor performance on subgroups. Local metrics bin predictions by uncertainty magnitude, while adaptive metrics stratify by features like ground truth class, exposing over/under-confidence in specific regions of the prediction space.
- **Core Assumption:** The chosen binning strategy or stratification variable is relevant to the model's failure modes.
- **Evidence Anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We find that assessing local calibration and adaptivity provides practically relevant insights about model behaviour that otherwise cannot be acquired using more commonly implemented global reliability metrics."
  - [section] Section 3.3 (General observations) states, "Our qualitative assessment of uncertainty reliability at smaller scales through binning-based reliability diagrams revealed these biases in uncertainty reliability, emphasising the practical utility of this approach."
  - [corpus] "Scenario-aware Uncertainty Quantification" paper aligns with the need for context-adaptive reliability, though in a different domain.
- **Break Condition:** Binning with too few samples per bin leads to high variance in metric estimation, or the chosen stratification may not align with true conditional failure modes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Aleatoric vs. Epistemic Uncertainty**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper evaluates methods that model these different sources. Aleatoric is irreducible data noise; epistemic is reducible model uncertainty. Knowing which is which helps diagnose if more data is needed or if the task itself is inherently noisy.
  - **Quick check question:** A model's uncertainty on a blurry image is aleatoric. What type of uncertainty would it have on an image from a completely new species not seen during training? (Answer: Epistemic).

- **Concept: Calibration**
  - **Why needed here:** A core goal is to produce "reliable" uncertainties. A model is calibrated if its predicted probabilities match the true observed frequencies (e.g., when it says "90% confident," it is correct 90% of the time).
  - **Quick check question:** A weather model forecasts rain with 80% confidence for 10 days. It rains on 8 of those days. Is the model calibrated for these predictions? (Answer: Yes).

- **Concept: Proper Scoring Rules (e.g., NLL, CRPS)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses these as global metrics. They uniquely assess both calibration and sharpness (concentration of predictions). A model can be calibrated but unsharp (uninformative).
  - **Quick check question:** A model gives a uniform 50% probability for a binary classification task that has a true 50/50 distribution. Is it calibrated? Is it sharp? (Answer: It is calibrated, but not sharp).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Data (PPG signals) -> 1D CNN (ResNet or AlexNet) -> UQ Head (MAP/MCD/DE/QR) -> Post-processing (TS/IR/CP) -> Reliability Metrics (Global/Local/Adaptive)

- **Critical path:**
  1.  **Data Splitting:** Ensure `train`, `validation`, `calibration`, and `test` sets are disjoint, especially at the subject/patient level to avoid data leakage.
  2.  **Training:** Train base model with chosen UQ-specific loss (e.g., Gaussian NLL for MAP/MCD/DE, Pinball Loss for QR).
  3.  **Post-hoc Calibration:** Apply TS/IR or CP using the dedicated `calibration` set. Do NOT use the `test` set.
  4.  **Evaluation:** Run inference on the `test` set. Compute metrics across all scales (global, local, adaptive). Use reliability diagrams for qualitative checks.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **MCD vs. DE:** MCD is computationally cheaper (single model) but its performance is highly sensitive to the dropout rate. DE is more robust and often higher performance but requires training and storing multiple models (5x cost in this paper).
  - **Post-hoc vs. Intrinsic:** Post-hoc (TS, IR, CP) is cheap and effective for global calibration but, as the paper shows, can harm adaptive reliability. Intrinsic methods (MCD, DE, QR) may be better for local reliability but are harder to tune.
  - **Global vs. Local Metrics:** Optimizing for global metrics (like NLL) can mask poor performance on minority classes or rare but critical cases. Prioritize local/adaptive metrics for clinical trust.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Post-hoc CP/Recalibration failure on `calibfree` dataset:** The paper notes a "decrease in PICP" and suggests a potential violation of exchangeability (distribution shift) between calibration and test sets. If global coverage guarantees fail, check for dataset drift.
  - **Poor Adaptive Reliability:** If global metrics look good but per-class metrics (e.g., for AF) are poor, the model is overconfident on the minority class. This indicates a need for class-balanced training or UQ techniques sensitive to imbalance.
  - **QR Underestimation at High Errors:** The paper mentions QR may underestimate uncertainties at high prediction errors due to the Gaussian assumption failing for outliers. Check distribution of residuals.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1.  **Implement MAP and MCD Baselines:** Train a 1D ResNet on the provided BP (`calib`) dataset using Gaussian NLL loss. Implement MCD with a low dropout rate (e.g., 5-10%). Compare their predictive performance (MAE) and global reliability (CRPS, NLL). This validates the data pipeline and basic training.
  2.  **Analyze Local vs. Global Reliability:** Using the models from experiment 1, compute ENCE (local) and CRPS (global). Generate bivariate histograms of prediction error vs. predicted uncertainty. Verify if the models are well-calibrated locally or only globally, identifying any over/under-confidence patterns.
  3.  **Implement Post-hoc Calibration and Test Adaptivity:** Apply Temperature Scaling (TS) and Isotonic Regression (IR) to the outputs of the models from experiment 1 using a held-out calibration set. Evaluate the effect on both global metrics (CRPS) and adaptive metrics (per-class ECE for AF, or binned ENCE for BP). Observe the trade-off where global calibration may improve while local/adaptive reliability worsens.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can robust quantitative metrics be developed to assess individual-level uncertainty reliability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "future work should consider ways to develop... quantitative individual reliability metrics."
- Why unresolved: Current metrics assess reliability over populations (global/local), failing to validate the trustworthiness of single predictions used in clinical diagnosis.
- What evidence would resolve it: A metric that quantifies reliability for single samples distinct from aggregate binning methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can UQ techniques be designed to maintain high adaptivity across different classes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper calls for "UQ techniques that encourage adaptivity" and notes current methods "bias to the dominant class."
- Why unresolved: Post-hoc methods optimized for global reliability fail for minority classes (e.g., AF), resulting in poor adaptive reliability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method achieving comparable calibration errors for both majority and minority classes without per-class tuning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can reliable confidence thresholds be established for keeping or rejecting model estimates?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion lists "confidence thresholds for keeping/rejecting an estimate" as a necessary development.
- Why unresolved: While uncertainties are quantified, no mechanism exists to convert them into actionable decisions for filtering low-quality predictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework linking specific uncertainty magnitudes to validated error rates or risk thresholds.

## Limitations

- The intrinsic methods (MCD, DE) rely on approximations to Bayesian inference with performance sensitive to hyperparameters like dropout rate and ensemble size
- Post-hoc recalibration methods improve global calibration but degrade local/adaptive reliability, particularly for minority classes like AF
- The evaluation framework is computationally intensive and may not scale easily to larger models or datasets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The observation that no single UQ technique universally outperforms others, and that optimal performance depends on the evaluation metric and scale of reliability assessment.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that local and adaptive reliability metrics reveal critical patterns obscured by global metrics, particularly for clinical deployment.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific performance rankings of UQ methods on the 'CalibFree' dataset, due to potential distribution shifts and the sensitivity of post-hoc methods to calibration-test set exchangeability.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Distribution Shift:** Evaluate the sensitivity of post-hoc methods (TS, IR) to calibration-test set mismatch by artificially introducing controlled covariate shifts in the test set and measuring performance degradation.
2. **Scalability Assessment:** Benchmark the computational cost and memory footprint of MCD vs. DE on larger 1D CNN architectures (e.g., deeper ResNet variants) to confirm the trade-off between performance and resource requirements.
3. **Generalization to Other Modalities:** Apply the evaluated UQ techniques to a different medical time-series dataset (e.g., ECG or EEG) to test the transferability of the observed reliability patterns and method rankings.
