# LLM-ODDR: A Large Language Model Framework for Joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.22695
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22695
- Reference count: 40
- First framework using LLMs for joint order dispatching and driver repositioning in ride-hailing services

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LLM-ODDR, the first framework using large language models (LLMs) for joint order dispatching and driver repositioning in ride-hailing services. The framework addresses the limitations of traditional approaches by integrating multi-objective evaluation, fairness-aware dispatching, and spatiotemporal demand-aware repositioning through LLMs. Key innovations include a multi-objective-guided order value refinement mechanism that iteratively improves order valuations, a fairness-aware dispatching module that balances platform revenue with driver income equity, and a spatiotemporal demand-aware repositioning component that optimizes idle vehicle placement based on historical patterns and projected supply. The authors also develop JointDR-GPT, a fine-tuned LLM specialized for ODDR tasks.

## Method Summary
The LLM-ODDR framework combines three core components: (1) a multi-objective-guided order value refinement mechanism that iteratively refines order valuations by considering distance, duration, revenue, and fairness metrics; (2) a fairness-aware dispatching module that balances platform revenue maximization with driver income equity through fairness-aware matching; and (3) a spatiotemporal demand-aware repositioning component that optimizes idle vehicle placement using historical demand patterns and projected supply-demand gaps. The framework leverages a fine-tuned LLM called JointDR-GPT specifically designed for ODDR tasks, trained on historical order dispatching and driver repositioning data to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns and optimize decisions.

## Key Results
- LLM-ODDR achieves 4.61-45.44% improvements in GMV (gross merchandise volume) compared to traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches
- The framework demonstrates superior adaptability to surge demand events while promoting driver income fairness
- Experiments on real-world Manhattan taxi data validate the effectiveness of the multi-objective-guided order value refinement mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to integrate multiple objectives simultaneously through LLM reasoning capabilities. The iterative refinement mechanism allows the system to learn complex value assessments that balance platform revenue with driver welfare. The fairness-aware dispatching ensures sustainable platform growth by maintaining driver satisfaction while optimizing economic outcomes. The spatiotemporal demand-aware repositioning leverages LLMs' pattern recognition capabilities to predict and respond to demand fluctuations proactively.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-objective optimization: Balances competing goals (revenue vs. fairness) - why needed: real-world systems require trade-offs between different stakeholder interests - quick check: verify Pareto optimality in trade-off curves
- Spatiotemporal pattern recognition: Identifies demand-supply dynamics over space and time - why needed: ride-hailing demand is inherently spatiotemporal - quick check: validate pattern recognition accuracy on held-out data
- Fairness metrics in resource allocation: Quantifies equity in driver income distribution - why needed: ensures sustainable platform operation and driver retention - quick check: measure Gini coefficient changes in driver earnings

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** JointDR-GPT -> Multi-objective Refinement -> Fairness-aware Dispatching -> Spatiotemporal Repositioning

**Critical Path:** Order arrival → JointDR-GPT valuation → Multi-objective refinement → Fairness-aware matching → Driver assignment → Spatiotemporal repositioning recommendation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational complexity for improved decision quality and fairness. Using LLMs introduces latency but enables more sophisticated reasoning compared to traditional rule-based systems.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation may occur during extreme demand surges beyond historical patterns, or when the fine-tuned LLM encounters distribution shifts in order characteristics or driver behavior patterns.

**First Experiments:** 1) Validate GMV improvements against baseline methods on held-out test data; 2) Measure fairness improvements using income distribution metrics; 3) Test adaptability to simulated surge demand scenarios.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on historical Manhattan taxi data which may not capture modern ride-hailing dynamics with surge pricing and multi-modal options
- Framework performance with heterogeneous vehicle types and different regulatory constraints remains untested
- Computational overhead for fine-tuning and real-time inference at scale is not thoroughly characterized

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Framework's ability to outperform traditional methods on Manhattan dataset, effectiveness of multi-objective refinement mechanism, validity of fairness-aware dispatching approach.

**Medium Confidence:** Claims about superior surge demand adaptability and generalizability to other cities/platforms require further validation.

**Low Confidence:** Assertion of being first LLM-based framework for ODDR lacks comprehensive literature review; scalability analysis for real-time deployment is insufficient.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LLM-ODDR on ride-hailing datasets from multiple cities with varying demand patterns, vehicle types, and regulatory environments
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of fairness-aware dispatching and spatiotemporal repositioning modules
3. Measure computational latency and resource requirements for fine-tuning and real-time dispatching scenarios
