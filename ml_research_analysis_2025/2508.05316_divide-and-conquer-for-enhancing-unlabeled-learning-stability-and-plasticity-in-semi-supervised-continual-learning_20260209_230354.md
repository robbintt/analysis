# Divide-and-Conquer for Enhancing Unlabeled Learning, Stability, and Plasticity in Semi-supervised Continual Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.05316
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05316
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Up to 5.94% improvement in last task accuracy over state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) where models must learn from both labeled and unlabeled data in sequential tasks while balancing plasticity and stability. The authors propose USP, a divide-and-conquer framework with three components: Feature Space Reservation (FSR) using equiangular tight frames, Divide-and-Conquer Pseudo-labeling (DCP) that combines classifier and nearest-class-mean methods, and Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD). The framework demonstrates superior performance in both average and final task accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
The proposed USP framework tackles SSCL through a divide-and-conquer approach with three key components. Feature Space Reservation (FSR) uses equiangular tight frames to reserve feature space for future classes, addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. Divide-and-Conquer Pseudo-labeling (DCP) employs both classifier-based and nearest-class-mean methods to generate reliable pseudo-labels across different confidence levels. Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) anchors unlabeled data to class means for knowledge distillation, improving unlabeled learning. The framework is evaluated on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-100, and CUB datasets, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

## Key Results
- USP achieves up to 5.94% improvement in last task accuracy over state-of-the-art methods
- Demonstrates superior performance in both average and final task accuracy across multiple datasets
- Effective balance between plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving old knowledge)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by systematically addressing the three core challenges in SSCL: unlabeled learning, stability, and plasticity. FSR reserves feature space to maintain stability for previously learned classes while allowing plasticity for new classes. DCP generates reliable pseudo-labels by combining two complementary methods, enabling effective use of unlabeled data. CUD anchors unlabeled samples to class means, providing a stable reference for knowledge distillation. The divide-and-conquer approach allows each component to specialize in addressing specific challenges while working synergistically.

## Foundational Learning
- **Equiangular Tight Frames**: Orthogonal basis vectors used for feature space reservation; needed to ensure orthogonality between feature spaces of different tasks; quick check: verify orthogonality properties hold after each task
- **Pseudo-labeling in Semi-supervised Learning**: Using model predictions as labels for unlabeled data; needed to leverage unlabeled data in SSCL; quick check: examine pseudo-label accuracy over time
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring knowledge from teacher to student models; needed for CUD to effectively use class means; quick check: compare student performance with and without distillation
- **Continual Learning Stability-Plasticity Trade-off**: Balancing learning new tasks while preserving old knowledge; needed to prevent catastrophic forgetting; quick check: measure forgetting on previous tasks
- **Nearest-Class-Mean Classification**: Classification based on proximity to class centroids; needed for DCP's complementary pseudo-labeling; quick check: compare with model-based predictions
- **Feature Space Decomposition**: Separating feature representations for different tasks; needed for FSR's space reservation; quick check: visualize feature space before and after decomposition

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: FSR -> DCP -> CUD (sequential processing with interdependencies)
- **Critical Path**: Data input → FSR (space reservation) → DCP (pseudo-label generation) → CUD (knowledge distillation) → model update
- **Design Tradeoffs**: FSR requires prior knowledge of class counts vs. provides stability; DCP combines two methods for robustness vs. increased complexity; CUD uses class means as anchors vs. may struggle with multimodal distributions
- **Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when pseudo-labels become unreliable; catastrophic forgetting of old tasks; reduced effectiveness when class means are multimodal or distributions shift significantly
- **First 3 Experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing each component to measure individual contributions, 2) Stress test with increasing class distribution shifts between tasks, 3) Scalability test on larger datasets with longer task sequences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on equiangular tight frames assumes prior knowledge of class counts, which may not always be available in real-world scenarios
- Pseudo-labeling component inherits common limitations where incorrect pseudo-labels can propagate errors and degrade performance over time
- Class-mean anchoring strategy may struggle with datasets containing significant intra-class variation or multimodal class distributions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The framework's overall architecture and its three core components (FSR, DCP, CUD) are technically sound and well-justified
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific numerical improvements (e.g., 5.94% gain) are credible but may vary with different hyperparameter settings
- **Low Confidence**: The long-term stability of the approach in extremely long task sequences (>10 tasks) remains untested

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies to quantify the individual contribution of each component (FSR, DCP, CUD) and test their necessity in various data regimes
2. Evaluate performance when class means are multimodal or when class distributions shift significantly between tasks to test the robustness of the class-mean anchoring approach
3. Test the framework on larger-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1k) and with longer task sequences to assess computational efficiency and performance degradation over time
