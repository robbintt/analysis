- This paper introduces a two-tier optimization framework for agentic AI task offloading in Internet of Agents (IoA), addressing the challenge of resource-constrained Wireless Agents (WAs) offloading compute-intensive tasks to nearby servers.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a two-tier optimization framework for agentic AI task offloading in Internet of Agents (IoA). The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game where Mobile Agents (MAs) and Fixed Agents (FAs) act as leaders setting resource prices while WAs act as followers determining task offloading ratios. When FAs become overloaded, the second tier implements a Double Dutch Auction (DDA) model where overloaded FAs act as buyers requesting resources from Aerial Agents (AAs) serving as sellers. The authors develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to solve the complex DDA problem. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of this proposed scheme in facilitating efficient task offloading compared to traditional methods.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework combines Stackelberg game theory with Double Dutch Auction mechanisms, solved using diffusion-based DRL. The first tier optimizes resource prices between infrastructure providers (MAs/FAs) and task generators (WAs), while the second tier dynamically allocates excess resources from AAs to overloaded FAs. The diffusion-based DRL learns optimal auction clock adjustment policies to maximize social welfare and transaction efficiency. The method is validated through numerical simulations comparing performance against traditional optimization approaches.

## Key Results
- Stackelberg game achieves equilibrium prices and offloading ratios through iterative best-response algorithms
- DDA mechanism satisfies Individual Rationality, Incentive Compatibility, and Strong Budget Balance properties
- Diffusion-based DRL achieves ~40% higher average episode reward and better social welfare compared to PPO baseline
- The two-tier framework effectively handles task offloading in resource-constrained IoA environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Stackelberg Game for Primary Offloading Market
- Claim: The hierarchical pricing structure enables resource providers (MAs, FAs) to anticipate follower (WA) offloading responses, leading to equilibrium prices that balance supply and demand.
- Mechanism: Leaders (MAs, FAs) set resource prices strategically; WAs respond by computing optimal offloading ratios via convex optimization (utility function is strictly concave in offloading ratio). Backward induction yields Stackelberg Equilibrium where no agent benefits from unilateral deviation.
- Core assumption: WAs have perfect information about prices and can compute optimal offloading ratios instantaneously; communication delays between price setting and response are negligible.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game where MAs and FAs act as leaders setting resource prices while WAs act as followers determining task offloading ratios."
  - [Section IV-C]: Demonstrates utility function concavity (∂²U_n/∂o²_{n,i} < 0) guaranteeing convex optimization solvable via bisection search.
  - [corpus]: "LLM-Empowered Agentic MAC Protocols: A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Approach" validates Stackelberg games for agentic resource allocation; "SPRIG" demonstrates game-theoretic RL integration.
- Break condition: If WAs cannot reliably estimate channel conditions or if price information is stale due to high mobility, the equilibrium may not be reachable before network topology changes.

### Mechanism 2: Double Dutch Auction for Secondary Resource Market
- Claim: The DDA mechanism provides truthful bidding incentives while efficiently matching overloaded FAs with available AAs through dual converging clock prices.
- Mechanism: Buyer clock descends from maximum bid; seller clock ascends from minimum ask. Participants accept when their valuations match clock values. Market clears when clocks intersect. The mechanism satisfies Individual Rationality (non-negative utility), Incentive Compatibility (truthful bidding is optimal), and Strong Budget Balance.
- Core assumption: FAs can accurately assess their workload valuation and penalty costs; AAs know their energy costs and processing capacity; auctioneer is trusted and operates without latency constraints.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The second tier implements a Double Dutch Auction (DDA) model where overloaded FAs act as buyers requesting resources from Aerial Agents (AAs) serving as sellers."
  - [Section IV-D, Theorem 1]: "The proposed DDA meets the IR and IC requirements and maintains a strong budget balance."
  - [Figure 8]: Numerical validation showing buyer utility peaks at truthful bid value (41) and seller utility peaks at truthful ask value (9).
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus evidence for DDA in agentic systems; "Topology Generation of UAV Covert Communication Networks" discusses incentive mechanisms for UAV networks but uses different auction formats.
- Break condition: If the auction round duration exceeds the task deadline, or if the number of participants is insufficient to form a competitive market, the clearing price may not reflect true resource value.

### Mechanism 3: Diffusion-Based DRL for Auction Clock Adjustment
- Claim: The diffusion model enables more effective exploration of the high-dimensional action space (clock adjustment steps) compared to conventional DRL methods, achieving near-optimal social welfare with lower communication overhead.
- Mechanism: Forward diffusion adds Gaussian noise to action samples over T steps; reverse diffusion denoises using learned mean/variance functions conditioned on state and time. The denoised output is transformed to action probabilities via softmax. Dual critic networks with target networks stabilize training.
- Core assumption: The auction environment can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process; sufficient training data/episodes are available for diffusion model to learn the action distribution; the state representation captures all relevant auction dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to solve the complex DDA problem."
  - [Section V-B, Eq. 40-44]: Forward/reverse diffusion process formulations and actor-critic update rules.
  - [Figure 5]: Diffusion-based DRL achieves ~40% higher average episode reward compared to PPO and converges within ~150 epochs.
  - [Figure 6]: Social welfare approaches theoretical DDA optimum more closely than PPO, greedy, or random baselines.
  - [corpus]: Corpus evidence for diffusion-based DRL in agentic/auction contexts is weak; most related papers use standard DRL without diffusion models.
- Break condition: If state transitions are non-Markovian (e.g., auction history significantly affects participant behavior), or if the action space dimensionality exceeds the diffusion model's capacity, performance may degrade to PPO-level or worse.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Stackelberg Game Theory**
  - Why needed here: The primary offloading market operates on leader-follower dynamics where infrastructure pricing precedes user response. Understanding backward induction and equilibrium concepts is essential for implementing Algorithm 2.
  - Quick check question: Given a leader setting price p and a follower's utility function U(o,p), can you derive the follower's best response o*(p) and explain why the leader's optimization uses o*(p) rather than o directly?

- Concept: **Auction Mechanism Design (Double Auction Properties)**
  - Why needed here: The secondary market relies on IR, IC, and budget balance properties to ensure truthful participation. Without understanding these, you cannot verify whether the DDA implementation is correctly incentivizing behavior.
  - Quick check question: If a buyer's utility is u_j = c_j - r* (where c_j is accepted clock value and r* is clearing price), prove that submitting a bid b_j ≠ v_j (true valuation) cannot improve u_j when the mechanism satisfies IC.

- Concept: **Diffusion Models for Sequential Decision-Making**
  - Why needed here: The auctioneer's clock adjustment policy is learned via diffusion-based DRL. Understanding the forward/reverse process and how denoising generates action samples is critical for debugging training instability or poor convergence.
  - Quick check question: In the reverse diffusion process, what is the role of the learned mean function μ_θ(x_t, t), and why does conditioning on both noisy sample x_t and time step t matter for action generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - WA Layer: Task generation, channel estimation, offloading ratio computation (Eq. 24, 28, 32)
  - MA/FA Layer: Price optimization (Algorithm 1), task reception, local computation
  - FA-AA Interface: Valuation computation (Eq. 33-34), auction participation
  - Auctioneer (DRL Agent): State observation {Ψ_t, t, C_b^t, C_s^t, |J_b^t|, |K_s^t|}, clock adjustment via diffusion model (Algorithm 3)
  - AA Layer: Task execution, result return

- Critical path:
  1. WA generates task → estimates channel conditions
  2. MA/FA broadcast prices p_i, p_j (via iterative best-response, Algorithm 2)
  3. WA computes optimal o*_{n,i} and offloads
  4. If FA overloaded → trigger DDA (Algorithm 3 determines clock steps)
  5. FA-AA matching → computation → result return to WA
  - Latency budget: End-to-end must satisfy t_tot^n < ϵ_n (max tolerable delay)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Price update frequency vs. convergence speed**: Algorithm 2 converges in ~5-8 iterations (Figure 4), but frequent re-optimization increases signaling overhead.
  - **Auction clock granularity vs. communication cost**: Finer clock steps (smaller ϱ) improve clearing precision but increase broadcast frequency. Diffusion-based DRL reduces this tradeoff by learning adaptive step sizes.
  - **Diffusion model complexity vs. inference latency**: More diffusion steps H improve action quality but delay clock adjustment decisions. Paper uses H iterations per episode without specifying real-time constraints.

- Failure signatures:
  - Stackelberg non-convergence: Prices oscillate or diverge across iterations. Check: utility function concavity, price bounds [0, p̄_i], and information staleness.
  - DDA deadweight loss: Clocks cross but few/no transactions occur. Check: valuation model parameters (θ_j, θ_k), initial clock values (C_b^0 = p_j·w_k, C_s^0 = ξ_k·E_com + γ_k·E_hov).
  - Diffusion training instability: Reward plateaus or collapses. Check: learning rate ϖ, temperature β, target network update rate τ, and replay buffer diversity.
  - Deadline violation: t_tot^n exceeds ϵ_n. Check: offloading ratio allocation, FA load estimation, AA availability.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Stackelberg Equilibrium Validation**: Fix MA/FA parameters (processing capacity μ_i, μ_j; power coefficients σ_i, σ_j). Run Algorithm 2 with varying initial prices. Verify convergence to same equilibrium prices and offloading ratios. Plot p_i^*, p_j^*, o*_{n,i} vs. iteration (baseline: Figure 4).
  2. **DDA Mechanism Properties Test**: Set fixed market (5 FAs, 3 AAs). For each FA, vary bid b_j around true valuation v_j. For each AA, vary ask around true valuation v_k. Plot utility vs. bid/ask deviation. Confirm IC (utility maximum at truthful reporting) and IR (non-negative utilities) as in Figure 8.
  3. **Diffusion vs. PPO Baseline Comparison**: Train diffusion-based DRL (Algorithm 3) and PPO on identical auction MDP for 500 episodes. Compare: (a) convergence speed (episodes to 95% of optimal reward), (b) final social welfare, (c) exchange cost (communication overhead). Reproduce Figures 5-7 with confidence intervals across 5 random seeds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: How can the proposed framework be adapted to incorporate robust security protections against malicious agents? (explicit in conclusion)
- **Open Question 2**: Can the proposed diffusion-based DRL algorithm maintain its superiority in large-scale, real-world deployments? (explicit in conclusion)
- **Open Question 3**: How do complex non-linear energy consumption models impact the convergence and equilibrium of the two-tier optimization framework? (inferred from Section IV.A.1 assumptions)

## Limitations
- Stackelberg game convergence stability under dynamic channel conditions and task arrival patterns is not fully characterized
- DDA mechanism robustness under high-variance valuations, low liquidity, or auctioneer latency is unexplored
- Diffusion-based DRL generalization to unseen market states and sensitivity to hyperparameters is unclear

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Stackelberg game formulation, WA utility function concavity, DDA mechanism properties (IR, IC, budget balance)
- **Medium Confidence**: Diffusion-based DRL training procedure and convergence claims; numerical results for DDA social welfare
- **Low Confidence**: Real-time performance under dynamic mobility; auction clearing latency; generalization of diffusion model to unseen market states

## Next Checks
1. **Mobility Stress Test**: Run Stackelberg game with time-varying channel gains and task arrivals (e.g., Rayleigh fading, Poisson arrivals). Measure price convergence rate, offloading ratio stability, and QoE degradation compared to static baseline.
2. **Auction Liquidity Sensitivity**: Vary FA/AA ratios (e.g., 5FAs with 1, 3, 5, 10 AAs) and bid/ask value spreads. Record transaction count, clearing price variance, and social welfare to assess DDA performance in thin vs. thick markets.
3. **Diffusion Hyperparameter Ablation**: Train diffusion-based DRL with varying diffusion steps (H=50, 100, 200), hidden layer widths (128, 256, 512), and reward weights (b,c,d permutations). Compare convergence speed, final social welfare, and robustness to state noise against PPO and greedy baselines.
