# Measuring the Unspoken: A Disentanglement Model and Benchmark for Psychological Analysis in the Wild

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.04728
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04728
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces MIND model with Status Judgment module to suppress visual speech noise; achieves +86.95% gain in micro-expression detection over prior SOTA on PRISM evaluation framework.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generative psychological analysis in unconstrained video conversations, specifically tackling the Articulatory-Affective Ambiguity problem where speech-related facial movements are misinterpreted as emotional expressions. The authors propose MIND (Multi-level Interpretative Neural Disentanglement), a hierarchical visual encoder that explicitly suppresses ambiguous lip features based on temporal variance through a Status Judgment module. The work introduces ConvoInsight-DB, a large-scale dataset with expert annotations for micro/macro-expressions and psychological states, and PRISM, an automated evaluation framework using expert-guided LLM to assess multidimensional performance across expression detection, psychological insight, and detail richness.

## Method Summary
MIND processes raw video through face detection and alignment, then decomposes visual features into independent streams (head pose, eye dynamics, emotion, lip movements) using a Fan Encoder. The Status Judgment module applies a heuristic threshold to lip feature variance to suppress articulatory noise. A dedicated MicroExpressionEncoder processes localized temporal segments identified by MELDAE, while a MultiLevelExpressionEncoder fuses micro features with purified emotion, eye, and head features through parallel attention and linear paths. The fused representation is projected into LLM embedding space via a linear projector and fine-tuned on Qwen3-8B with LoRA. The entire system is trained on ConvoInsight-DB and evaluated using PRISM, which employs GPT-4o prompted with expert rubrics to score outputs across four psychological analysis dimensions.

## Key Results
- MIND achieves +86.95% gain in micro-expression detection over prior SOTA on PRISM evaluation.
- Ablation studies confirm the Status Judgment module is the most critical component for performance.
- PRISM framework successfully differentiates between grounded psychological analysis and plausible hallucinations, with baseline models scoring near-zero on micro-expression detection despite generating coherent-sounding text.
- The model demonstrates strong performance in resolving articulatory-affective ambiguity, particularly in scenarios where speech-related facial movements would otherwise be misinterpreted as emotional signals.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Articulatory-Affective Disentanglement
The Status Judgment module applies a Temporal Contrastive Test to the lip feature stream, calculating temporal variance and adjacent differences. If the combined score exceeds a threshold, the signal is classified as "articulation" and gated to zero. This assumes articulation manifests as continuous, high-amplitude temporal variance, while non-speech emotional expressions are comparatively static. The mechanism may fail if subjects speak with minimal lip movement or exhibit rapid non-speech facial tics.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Signal Isolation (Transient Path)
The MicroExpressionEncoder acts as a transient path, taking temporally localized segments identified by MELDAE and processing them independently of the main fusion path. This preserves faint micro-expression signals that would be averaged out in standard holistic encoders. The assumption is that micro-expressions contain distinct signal characteristics lost when processed alongside dominant macro-expressions. The mechanism fails if MELDAE timestamps are inaccurate, causing the encoder to receive garbage input.

### Mechanism 3: Expert-Guided Evaluation (PRISM)
PRISM uses GPT-4o prompted with expert-designed rubrics to score output across four dimensions: micro/macro-expression accuracy, psychological insight, and detail richness. This enforces verifiable assessment rather than semantic similarity. The assumption is that the judge LLM possesses sufficient psychological domain knowledge to distinguish between plausible hallucinations and grounded analysis. The mechanism is compromised if the model generates semantically impressive but factually incorrect analysis that deceives the judge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Articulatory-Affective Ambiguity**
  - *Why needed here:* This is the core problem the paper solves. Without understanding that speech and emotion share the same facial muscles, the logic behind the "Status Judgment" module is unintelligible.
  - *Quick check question:* Why would a standard VLM misinterpret the mouth shape for the phoneme "O" during speech as an emotional signal of "surprise"?

- **Concept: Disentangled Representation**
  - *Why needed here:* The model relies on separating head pose, eye dynamics, emotion, and lip movement into independent streams before fusion. Understanding this separation is crucial for debugging the encoder.
  - *Quick check question:* In the MIND architecture, are the $E_{head}$ and $E_{emo}$ features processed by the same weights, or are they separated prior to the Status Judgment?

- **Concept: Heuristic-based Gating**
  - *Why needed here:* The Status Judgment module uses a specific formula rather than a learned network to filter noise. Engineers need to distinguish this hard-coded logic from learned weights.
  - *Quick check question:* If a person is chewing gum (high variance, non-speech), how would the current heuristic likely classify them (Speech vs. Non-Speech), and what would be the consequence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Video -> Face Detection/Align -> FanEncoder (E_head, E_eye, E_emo, E_lip) -> Status Judgment (Gating E_lip) -> MicroExpressionEncoder + MultiLevelExpressionEncoder -> Projector (W_p) -> LLM Backbone

- **Critical path:** $E_{lip}$ extraction -> **Status Judgment** -> Micro/Multi Encoders -> LLM. If the Status Judgment fails, the "noise" propagates directly to the fusion encoder.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Visual-only vs. Multimodal: The model is "deaf" by design to focus on visual disentanglement, sacrificing audio cues for architectural purity.
  - Heuristic vs. Learned Gating: The Status Judgment is a simple threshold function. This is interpretable and cheap but brittle to edge cases, compared to a learned classifier.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Over-suppression: Chewing or rapid head movements are silenced (False Positive "Speech" detection), potentially removing valid expression data.
  - Under-suppression: Silent articulation or "mouthing" words is treated as emotion (False Negative), leading to hallucinated emotional shifts.
  - Context loss: If the MELDAE module timestamps are inaccurate, the MicroExpressionEncoder receives garbage input.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Heuristic Sensitivity Analysis:** Vary $\tau$ (threshold) on a small validation set. Plot the False Positive Rate against the False Negative Rate to find the optimal operating point.
  2. **Module Ablation (Visual Grounding):** Run inference on the "w/o Status Judgment" variant. Qualitatively inspect outputs where the model attributes emotion to a visibly speaking subject to confirm the "Articulatory-Affective Ambiguity" hypothesis.
  3. **PRISM Consistency Check:** Compare PRISM scores (GPT-4o based) against human expert ratings on a 50-sample subset to validate if the automated metric correlates with human judgment of "Psychological Insight."

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** To what extent does integrating audio modalities (e.g., pitch, tone, energy) resolve deep ambiguities—such as distinguishing a held breath from a speech pause—that the current visual-only MIND architecture cannot?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states, "Future work will explore integrating audio modalities for a more holistic understanding," and the limitations section notes the model is "deaf" by design.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study deliberately relies exclusively on vision to push the boundary of visual inference, leaving the synergistic effects of audio-visual integration untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study evaluating MIND against an audio-visual variant on specific ambiguous test cases (e.g., silent vs. vocalized surprise).

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can an end-to-end learnable disentanglement module outperform the heuristic Status Judgment module, particularly in suppressing false positives for "expressive non-speakers" (e.g., facial tics)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the Discussion: "A more robust, end-to-end learned disentanglement module is a promising direction for future work" to address the limitations of the fixed heuristic formula.
- **Why unresolved:** The current Status Judgment module uses a rigid threshold based on temporal variance ($\tau$), which the authors admit may falter in edge cases where non-speech movements mimic speech variance.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies comparing the current heuristic against a trainable attention-based disentanglement mechanism on datasets labeled with non-speech facial dynamics.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the model's performance and "psychological insight" generalize across diverse cultural and demographic groups given the non-universality of emotional expressions?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Broader Impact section notes, "Expressions of 'sadness' or 'confidence' are not universal," and explicitly calls for "future work... to include rigorous auditing for fairness [and] bias."
- **Why unresolved:** While the dataset ConvoInsight-DB is large, the paper does not provide a demographic or cultural breakdown of performance, leaving the robustness of the psychological inference across different populations unverified.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Stratified evaluation results on PRISM across specific cultural subsets of the data to identify performance disparities in micro-expression detection.

## Limitations
- **Dataset dependency:** The model's performance hinges entirely on ConvoInsight-DB quality and access; no ablation on alternative datasets is provided.
- **Threshold brittleness:** The Status Judgment module uses fixed hyperparameters without learned adaptation, making it vulnerable to domain shifts (e.g., silent speech, chewing).
- **PRISM reliability:** Automated evaluation via GPT-4o assumes consistent psychological reasoning capability; no human validation study is reported.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The articulatory-affective ambiguity problem is well-documented; the hierarchical architecture and PRISM framework are clearly specified.
- **Medium confidence:** The +86.95% gain in micro-expression detection is impressive but relies on a proprietary dataset and automated evaluation without human cross-validation.
- **Low confidence:** The heuristic-based Status Judgment module's robustness to edge cases (e.g., chewing, minimal lip movement) is not empirically tested.

## Next Checks
1. **PRISM Human Validation:** Compare PRISM scores (GPT-4o-based) against human expert ratings on a 50-sample subset to validate if the automated metric correlates with human judgment of "Psychological Insight."
2. **Status Judgment Robustness:** Vary α, β, τ thresholds systematically on a small validation set; plot False Positive vs. False Negative rates to find optimal operating point and assess brittleness.
3. **Multi-Modal Ablation:** Test a variant that includes audio features; compare micro-expression detection and psychological insight scores to quantify the cost of the visual-only constraint.
