# Hybrid Topological and Deep Feature Fusion for Accurate MRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Severity Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.00956
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00956
- Authors: Faisal Ahmed
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 99.93% accuracy and 100% AUC for classifying Alzheimer's disease severity stages using hybrid TDA+DenseNet121 framework

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel hybrid deep learning framework that combines Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with DenseNet121 for accurate classification of Alzheimer's disease severity from structural MRI data. The approach captures global topological characteristics of brain structures through persistent homology while learning hierarchical spatial features from MRI slices, then fuses these complementary representations to enhance class separability across four AD stages. Experiments on the OASIS-1 Kaggle MRI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 99.93% accuracy and 100% AUC, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a dual-branch architecture where TDA captures global structural patterns through cubical sublevel filtration and Betti curve computation, while DenseNet121 learns hierarchical spatial features from 2D MRI slices. TDA features are extracted by computing persistence diagrams from filtered brain intensity values, converting them to 100-bin Betti curves per homology dimension, then processing through an MLP to create 128-dimensional embeddings. DenseNet121, initialized with ImageNet weights, processes grayscale MRI slices (projected to 3 channels) through its backbone to generate 64-dimensional embeddings. These complementary features are concatenated and passed through fully connected layers with dropout for final classification. The model is trained end-to-end using Adam optimization and categorical cross-entropy loss on the OASIS-1 dataset with a 90:10 train-test split.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.93% classification accuracy across four Alzheimer's disease severity stages
- Attains 100% multi-class ROC-AUC (one-vs-rest) performance
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with substantial margins in all metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Topological descriptors capture global structural patterns in brain MRI that complement intensity-based CNN features.
- Mechanism: Cubical sublevel filtration thresholds pixel intensities progressively, generating persistence diagrams that encode birth/death of connected components (Betti-0) and loops (Betti-1). These are discretized into 100-bin Betti curves per homology dimension, producing a 200-dimensional topological feature vector invariant to translation and rotation.
- Core assumption: Disease-related structural changes (atrophy, ventricular enlargement) manifest as detectable shifts in topological feature distributions across severity stages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TDA is employed to capture complementary topological characteristics of brain structures that are often overlooked by conventional neural networks."
  - [section 3.1] Detailed filtration construction and Betti curve computation methodology.
  - [corpus] Related work "3D-TDA" (FMR=0.43) validates topological feature extraction for AD classification, supporting the mechanism's plausibility.
- Break condition: If MRI preprocessing introduces artifacts that alter pixel intensity distributions non-uniformly, the filtration-derived topological signatures may not reflect true anatomical structure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DenseNet121's dense connectivity enables efficient hierarchical feature learning with parameter efficiency suited to limited neuroimaging datasets.
- Mechanism: Grayscale MRI (248×248×1) is projected to 3-channel representation via initial convolution, then processed through DenseNet121 backbone. Feature reuse through dense connections allows gradient flow across 121 layers while maintaining 64-dimensional pooled embedding after global average pooling.
- Core assumption: Pretrained ImageNet weights transfer meaningful low-level edge/texture detectors despite domain shift to medical imaging.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DenseNet121 efficiently learns hierarchical spatial features from MRI slices."
  - [section 3.2] Architecture details confirm ImageNet initialization and 64-unit dense projection.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation of DenseNet121 specifically for AD; assumption remains unverified across independent cohorts.
- Break condition: If grayscale MRI lacks RGB-like channel diversity, the 1→3 channel projection may introduce redundant representations that don't benefit from color-based pretrained features.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Late fusion of topological (128-dim) and deep (64-dim) embeddings creates a unified 192-dim representation with enhanced class separability.
- Mechanism: Concatenated features pass through two fully connected layers (256→128) with ReLU and 0.2 dropout, followed by softmax classification. The fusion enables modeling of interactions between global structural topology and local texture patterns.
- Core assumption: Topological and CNN features encode orthogonal information; concatenation preserves discriminative power without requiring complex attention mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The extracted deep and topological features are fused to enhance class separability across the four AD stages."
  - [table 3] Ablation study shows TDA-only achieves 97.99% accuracy, DenseNet-only achieves 97.78%, but fusion achieves 99.93%—suggesting complementary information.
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence for this specific fusion strategy; no comparable hybrid TDA-CNN architectures found.
- Break condition: If TDA and CNN features are highly correlated for certain classes, fusion provides marginal gain while increasing overfitting risk on limited data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Persistent Homology and Betti Numbers
  - Why needed here: Core mathematical foundation for TDA feature extraction. Understanding how filtration thresholds generate birth/death events is essential for interpreting topological embeddings.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Betti-0 counts connected components while Betti-1 counts loops, and how sublevel filtration creates these features from grayscale intensities?

- Concept: DenseNet Architecture and Feature Reuse
  - Why needed here: DenseNet121's dense connections differ fundamentally from ResNet skip connections. Understanding feature concatenation vs. addition affects debugging gradient flow issues.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between DenseNet's dense block connectivity and ResNet's residual connections in terms of feature aggregation?

- Concept: Multi-Class Classification with Class Imbalance
  - Why needed here: Dataset has 5000 non-demented, 5000 very mild, 5002 mild, but only 488 moderate dementia samples. Understanding how imbalance affects softmax probabilities and whether categorical cross-entropy is appropriate.
  - Quick check question: How does severe class imbalance (10:1 ratio for moderate dementia) affect model calibration, and what metrics beyond accuracy should be monitored?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input Pipeline: MRI slice (248×248×1) → normalization [0,1] → channel expansion (1→3)
  - TDA Branch: Cubical filtration → persistence diagrams → Betti curves (200-dim) → MLP (200→800→256→128)
  - CNN Branch: DenseNet121 backbone (ImageNet weights, no head) → GAP → dense (64-dim)
  - Fusion: Concatenate (128+64=192) → FC (256→128) → dropout (0.2) → softmax (4 classes)

- Critical path: TDA feature extraction is computationally lightweight (runs on M1 laptop) but requires understanding filtration thresholds. The MLP processing Betti vectors (800→256→128) has more parameters than the CNN embedding path—verify this is intentional.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - 2D slices vs. 3D volumes: Paper uses 2D slices, losing volumetric context. Related "3D-TDA" paper (corpus) addresses this limitation directly.
  - No data augmentation: Authors claim topological invariance eliminates augmentation need—verify this holds across different MRI acquisition protocols.
  - Single dataset validation: OASIS-1 only; no cross-dataset generalization tested (acknowledged by authors).

- Failure signatures:
  - If accuracy plateaus below 95%, check: (1) Betti curve binning resolution, (2) train/test split random seed sensitivity (seed=3), (3) moderate dementia class being ignored by model.
  - If AUC significantly lower than accuracy, investigate per-class ROC curves for systematic confusion between adjacent stages (very mild vs. mild).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline: Train TDA-only and DenseNet-only models separately, verify ablation results match table 3 (97.99% and 97.78% accuracy respectively).
  2. Sensitivity analysis: Vary Betti curve bin count (50, 100, 200) and measure impact on TDA branch performance to validate 100-bin design choice.
  3. Cross-dataset probe: Apply trained model to OASIS-3 or ADNI samples (if available) to assess whether 99.93% accuracy generalizes or indicates dataset-specific overfitting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the proposed TDA+DenseNet121 framework maintain its high classification performance when validated on independent, multi-scanner neuroimaging cohorts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that "experiments were conducted using a single dataset (OASIS-1)" and explicitly list "validating the proposed framework across multiple independent datasets" as necessary future work.
- Why unresolved: While the model achieves near-perfect accuracy on OASIS-1, its robustness to domain shifts caused by different scanner protocols or population demographics (e.g., the ADNI dataset) remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Reproducing the 99.93% accuracy on external datasets like ADNI or AIBL without extensive retraining or domain adaptation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can this topology-aware framework effectively track disease progression using longitudinal patient data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly proposes "extending the topology-aware deep learning paradigm to longitudinal analysis" as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current study utilizes cross-sectional slices, which capture disease severity at a single time point but do not model the temporal evolution of structural brain changes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the model to time-series MRI data to accurately predict the conversion rate between stages (e.g., from Mild to Moderate Dementia).

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does incorporating multimodal data (e.g., PET, clinical scores) with topological features yield significant improvements over the MRI-only approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion suggests extending the method to "multimodal neuroimaging data" to further enhance diagnosis.
- Why unresolved: The current framework relies solely on structural MRI; it is undetermined whether the topological descriptors complement or conflict with features from functional or metabolic modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies showing performance gains when TDA-MRI features are fused with PET scans or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.

## Limitations
- Near-perfect performance (99.93% accuracy, 100% AUC) raises concerns about potential overfitting or dataset-specific artifacts without cross-dataset validation.
- Critical methodological details remain underspecified, including slice selection strategy from 3D volumes and exact filtration threshold parameters for TDA computation.
- Severe class imbalance (10:1 ratio for moderate dementia) is not explicitly addressed through weighting or sampling strategies.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Basic architectural design combining TDA with DenseNet121 is technically sound and follows established practices in medical imaging.
- **Medium confidence**: TDA feature extraction methodology is well-specified, but effectiveness depends on unspecified implementation details (filtration thresholds, slice selection).
- **Low confidence**: Generalization claims are not supported by external validation; reported metrics may reflect dataset-specific overfitting rather than true clinical utility.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Apply the trained model to OASIS-3 or ADNI datasets to verify whether 99.93% accuracy holds on independent cohorts.
2. **Ablation of TDA parameters**: Systematically vary Betti curve bin counts (50, 100, 200) and measure impact on classification performance to validate the 100-bin design choice.
3. **Moderate class sensitivity analysis**: Analyze per-class ROC curves and confusion matrices specifically for the minority moderate dementia class to verify balanced performance despite 10:1 class imbalance.
