# HyperLoad: A Cross-Modality Enhanced Large Language Model-Based Framework for Green Data Center Cooling Load Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.19114
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19114
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Primary result:** HyperLoad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both data sufficient and data scarce settings, with significant reductions in mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) for green data center cooling load prediction.

## Executive Summary
HyperLoad addresses the challenge of cooling load prediction in green data centers by integrating cross-modality knowledge alignment with multi-scale feature modeling. The framework leverages large language models (LLMs) to overcome data scarcity and multi-source data fragmentation through a Knowledge-Aligned Representation Integration (KARI) strategy that aligns textual priors with time-series data, and an Adaptive Domain-specific Prefix Tuning (ADPT) strategy that injects domain knowledge into LLMs. The Enhanced Global Interaction Attention (EGIA) mechanism captures cross-device temporal dependencies, enabling accurate predictions even with limited training data.

## Method Summary
HyperLoad uses a two-phase training approach. Phase 1 (KARI) applies reversible instance normalization to time-series data, constructs Context-Aware Temporal Synthesis Templates combining domain knowledge and trend/statistics text, and trains time-series and text encoders with contrastive loss to align modalities, then freezes the text encoder. Phase 2 (ADPT+EGIA) encodes the text template as prefix vectors, applies EGIA attention over variables to capture cross-device interactions, concatenates these features, and feeds them to a frozen LLaMA-7B backbone, training only the output projection head with MSE loss. The method is evaluated on the DCData dataset using MSE and MAE metrics across multiple prediction lengths.

## Key Results
- HyperLoad achieves lower MSE and MAE than state-of-the-art baselines in both data sufficient and data scarce settings
- Ablation studies show KARI, ADPT, and EGIA each contribute measurable performance gains
- The framework demonstrates effectiveness for sustainable green data center management through improved prediction accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Modality Knowledge Alignment (KARI)
Aligning text priors with time-series data in a shared latent space improves prediction under data scarcity by enabling LLMs to leverage domain knowledge encoded in text. KARI uses contrastive learning with temperature-scaled cosine similarity loss to minimize distance between text and time-series features while maximizing distance to non-matching samples. This projects both modalities into a unified embedding space where textual priors can guide temporal reasoning. The assumption is that textual descriptions of data center operations contain structurally useful priors that share latent structure with numerical load patterns. Evidence shows this alignment ensures features become distributionally compatible with time-series load data. Break condition: If text and time-series modalities have no meaningful correlation, KARI will introduce noise rather than signal.

### Mechanism 2: Adaptive Domain-specific Prefix Tuning (ADPT)
Encoding domain knowledge as learnable prefix vectors enables rapid task adaptation without full LLM fine-tuning, preserving pre-trained reasoning while injecting data center context. ADPT encodes the Context-Aware Temporal Synthesis Template as prefix vectors, concatenates them with EGIA-processed time-series features, and feeds them to the frozen LLaMA backbone. Only the projection head is trainable. The assumption is that LLMs pre-trained on diverse text corpora have transferable sequence-pattern recognition and contextual reasoning applicable to numerical forecasting. Evidence shows prefix tuning enables rapid scenario adaptation and ablation results demonstrate performance degradation without ADPT. Break condition: If the pre-trained LLM's representations are too text-specific to generalize to numerical sequences, prefix tuning will fail to transfer useful priors.

### Mechanism 3: Enhanced Global Interaction Attention (EGIA)
Explicitly modeling cross-variable coupling through attention improves robustness by capturing nonlinear device dependencies that single-variable models miss. EGIA embeds each device-level variable as independent tokens, projects them into Q, K, H representations, and computes attention weights that amplify correlated variables. This allows the model to learn which device interactions most influence predictions. The assumption is that green data center variables exhibit time-evolving, nonlinear coupling that standard temporal attention doesn't capture. Evidence shows this mechanism captures cross-device temporal dependencies and ablation results demonstrate performance degradation without EGIA. Break condition: If device variables are approximately independent or if coupling is better modeled by simple aggregation, EGIA adds unnecessary complexity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning for Cross-Modal Alignment**
  - Why needed here: KARI uses CLIP-style contrastive loss to align text and time-series modalities; understanding how negative samples and temperature scaling affect embedding quality is essential for debugging alignment failures.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the temperature parameter τ=0.05 in Equation 6 affects the hardness of negative samples?

- **Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (Prefix Tuning / LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: HyperLoad freezes LLaMA-7B weights and only trains prefix vectors and projection head; understanding the tradeoff between adaptation capacity and catastrophic forgetting is critical.
  - Quick check question: What happens to pre-trained knowledge if you unfreeze the LLM backbone and train on small data?

- **Concept: Multi-Head Attention for Variable Interactions**
  - Why needed here: EGIA treats each variable as a token and learns cross-variable attention; distinguishing this from temporal self-attention helps understand what patterns the model captures.
  - Quick check question: If EGIA attention weights for variable A → variable B are consistently near zero, what does that imply about their relationship?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer: Reversible instance normalization → Time-series encoder (F_TS) + Text encoder (E) → Alignment Phase: KARI contrastive loss trains both encoders; text encoder then frozen → Feature Phase: ADPT generates prefix V_T from text; EGIA generates V_E from variable embeddings → Backbone: Frozen LLaMA-7B receives [V_T, V_E] → Output: Trainable projection head → Inverse normalization → Predictions

- **Critical path:** KARI must converge before ADPT can use the aligned text encoder; EGIA variable embeddings must be initialized with correct dimensionality; Prefix-position alignment: V_T must be concatenated before V_E in sequence

- **Design tradeoffs:** LLaMA-7B vs. smaller backbones: Table 3 shows BERT/GPT-2 are faster but less accurate; Freezing backbone: Preserves pre-trained reasoning but limits domain adaptation; Input length 96 vs. longer: Longer inputs capture more history but increase memory

- **Failure signatures:** KARI loss plateauing early: Text templates may lack informative content; EGIA attention collapse (uniform weights): Variables may be insufficiently differentiated; Prediction lag: Common in autoregressive settings; Catastrophic degradation at 25% data: Model overfitting to prefix

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Ablate KARI by training with random text embeddings: If performance matches full model, alignment isn't contributing; 2) Visualize EGIA attention weights on test samples: Identify which device pairs receive highest attention; 3) Test on DCData with shuffled variable order: If EGIA is learning true coupling, performance should be similar with different variable orderings after retraining

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does HyperLoad generalize to data centers in significantly different climatic regions or seasonal periods? The paper validates exclusively on the DCData dataset from a single data center in Dongguan over a three-month span, raising concerns about universal applicability across diverse climates and full-year operational data.

### Open Question 2
Can the framework meet real-time sub-minute control requirements given the computational overhead of the LLaMA-7B backbone? While the paper reports per-iteration runtime, it lacks comprehensive latency analysis suitable for real-time edge deployment with constrained resources.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is the model's performance to the specific phrasing and content structure of the Context-Aware Temporal Synthesis Template? The framework relies on manually constructed templates to encode domain knowledge, but the paper doesn't validate the marginal utility of specific textual semantic features through fine-grained ablation studies.

## Limitations
- Single-dataset evaluation limits generalizability across different data center configurations and climate zones
- Knowledge alignment mechanism lacks theoretical grounding for why textual descriptions should correlate with numerical load patterns
- Computational overhead claims are insufficiently quantified for real-time edge deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence (Experimental Claims):** Reported MSE and MAE improvements over baselines are well-supported by DCData experiments with internally consistent ablation results
- **Medium Confidence (Generalizability):** Framework shows promise for specific DCData domain but claims about broad applicability exceed demonstrated evidence from single-dataset evaluation
- **Low Confidence (Knowledge Transfer Mechanism):** Contrastive alignment between text and time-series modalities lacks empirical validation of meaningful knowledge transfer versus coincidental embedding proximity

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Dataset Generalization Test:** Evaluate HyperLoad on cooling load data from at least two additional data centers with different geographic locations, equipment configurations, and operational practices to measure domain transfer capabilities.

2. **Knowledge Alignment Validation:** Conduct ablation studies where textual templates are replaced with semantically unrelated content while maintaining KARI training procedure to determine if alignment mechanism captures spurious correlations versus genuine domain knowledge.

3. **Operational Robustness Analysis:** Test HyperLoad under realistic failure modes including missing data patterns, temporal resolution changes, and concept drift scenarios to report prediction stability and retraining requirements.
