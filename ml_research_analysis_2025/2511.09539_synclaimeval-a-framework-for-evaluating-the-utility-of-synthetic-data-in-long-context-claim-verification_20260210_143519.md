# SynClaimEval: A Framework for Evaluating the Utility of Synthetic Data in Long-Context Claim Verification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.09539
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09539
- **Authors:** Mohamed Elaraby; Jyoti Prakash Maheswari
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** Structured synthetic data (context-graph, argument-graph) improves long-context claim verification for base models, with longer contexts (16k) showing consistent gains.

## Executive Summary
SynClaimEval introduces a framework for evaluating synthetic data's utility in long-context claim verification. The study synthesizes claims from compressed document summaries using three strategies (unstructured, context-graph, argument-graph) and three error types (unverifiable, contradictory, diverse). Fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models with QLoRA on this synthetic data shows that longer training contexts (16k) and structured synthesis improve verification accuracy, particularly for base models. The framework also introduces automated pairwise ranking for explanation quality assessment.

## Method Summary
The framework synthesizes 4k balanced claims (2k verified, 2k negative) from 900 documents truncated to 4k/8k/16k tokens. GPT-4o generates claims from ≤1000-word summaries using three synthesis strategies: unstructured (direct prompting), context-graph (entity triples with k=3 hops), and argument-graph (claim-premise relations). Models are fine-tuned with QLoRA (4-bit, rank=16, α=32, 2 epochs) on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B. Evaluation uses SynClaimEval test set, UniSummEval (long subset), and FinDVer-test-mini, with explanation quality assessed via GPT-4o pairwise ranking.

## Key Results
- Longer context training (16k) consistently improves F1 scores across benchmarks for both LLaMA and Qwen models.
- Structured synthesis (argument-graph) achieves highest F1 for LLaMA (0.82 on SynClaimEval) and produces better explanations.
- Diverse error types outperform unverifiable-only errors across benchmarks, except for Qwen on SynClaimEval.
- Argument-graph explanations rank highest in pairwise supportiveness assessments.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Context Length Scaling
Longer training contexts (4k → 8k → 16k) improve long-context claim verification by helping models learn attention maintenance over extended sequences. This transfers to full-length evaluation documents without truncation. Evidence shows consistent F1 improvements for LLaMA and Qwen as context length increases. The mechanism breaks when training context exceeds the model's effective context window or creates unrealistic training signals through artificial truncation.

### Mechanism 2: Structured Synthesis for Multi-hop Reasoning
Structured synthesis (context-graph, argument-graph) outperforms unstructured synthesis by inducing multi-hop reasoning patterns through entity relations or argument structures. This creates training examples mirroring complex verification scenarios. Evidence shows argument-graph synthesis achieving highest F1 for LLaMA and ranking highest in explanation supportiveness. The mechanism fails when target tasks require only surface-level matching or when extraction errors in graphs propagate to noisy claims.

### Mechanism 3: Diverse Error Type Exposure
Training with diverse error types (hallucinated + contradictory errors) improves robustness compared to unverifiable-only errors by encouraging learning of discriminative features rather than surface shortcuts. Evidence shows diverse errors outperform unverified-only errors across benchmarks for both LLaMA and Qwen. The mechanism breaks when models cannot distinguish between subtle error categories or when error distributions mismatch evaluation benchmarks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Long-Context LLMs and Position Extrapolation
  - Why needed here: SynClaimEval targets models with >120k token capacity; understanding positional embedding extension explains why context scaling matters.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why training on 16k contexts might not directly transfer to 100k inference without specific positional interpolation techniques?

- **Concept:** Claim Verification as NLI over Long Documents
  - Why needed here: The task frames verification as entailment (supported/unsupported) over multi-section documents; grounding in NLI helps understand label semantics.
  - Quick check question: How does long-context claim verification differ from short-context NLI tasks like SNLI or ANLI?

- **Concept:** Synthetic Data Fidelity vs. Diversity Tradeoffs
  - Why needed here: SynClaimEval explicitly varies claim complexity and error types; understanding this tradeoff is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Why might synthetic claims with higher complexity (argument-graph) produce better explanations even if verification accuracy gains are modest?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Document Sources → Truncation (4k/8k/16k) → Compression (summarization) → Structure Extraction (entities/arguments) → Claim Synthesis (3 types × 3 strategies) → QLoRA Fine-tuning (LLaMA/Qwen) → Evaluation (SynClaimEval/UniSummEval/FinDver) + Explanation Ranking

- **Critical path:**
  1. Document preparation: Truncate → summarize with domain-specific prompts.
  2. Structure extraction: Extract entity triples or argument graphs for structured synthesis.
  3. Claim generation: Generate verified claims, then corrupt to unverifiable/contradictory variants.
  4. Training data assembly: Balance error types, mix strategies, optionally augment with ANLI.
  5. Fine-tuning: QLoRA (4-bit, rank=16, α=32), 2 epochs, 85/15 train/val split.
  6. Evaluation: Binary verification + explanation generation → pairwise ranking for explanation quality.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Compression fidelity vs. cost: Summaries ≤1000 words reduce synthesis cost but may lose details needed for multi-hop claims.
  - Structure complexity vs. extraction noise: Argument-graph yields richer claims but depends on accurate argument mining.
  - Error diversity vs. label balance: Diverse errors improve robustness but require careful balancing to avoid class imbalance.
  - Synthetic-only vs. hybrid augmentation: ANLI + synthetic mix yields best results but increases dataset size and training time.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - No improvement from longer contexts: Model may have effective context window < training length.
  - Structured synthesis underperforms: Extraction errors in graphs/arguments.
  - Explanation quality degrades: Overfitting to synthetic patterns.
  - Poor OOD generalization (FinDver): Domain mismatch between training sources and financial documents.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline context scaling: Fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B on unstructured synthesis at 4k/8k/16k; evaluate on SynClaimEval.
  2. Ablate error types: Compare unverified-only vs. diverse-error training for context-graph synthesis on UniSummEval.
  3. Explanation quality check: Generate explanations from argument-graph vs. unstructured models; perform pairwise ranking on 50 samples.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Do alternative tuning paradigms, such as reinforcement learning or full-parameter tuning, reveal different trade-offs between generalization and explanation quality compared to the parameter-efficient SFT used in this study?
  - Basis in paper: Authors restricted training to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and suggest exploring reinforcement learning or domain-adaptive pretraining.
  - Why unresolved: The study limited methodology to QLoRA-based SFT, leaving efficacy of other training regimes unknown.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking results from full-parameter fine-tuning or RLHF comparing generalization and explanation scores.

- **Open Question 2:** How does synthetic data utility vary when applied to highly specialized domains (e.g., legal or scientific texts) where pretraining data overlap is minimized?
  - Basis in paper: Authors suggest incorporating more diverse and domain-specific sources to probe generalization and reduce contamination effects.
  - Why unresolved: Study relied on public datasets risking overlap with models' pretraining corpora.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on strictly held-out, niche domain corpora showing performance retention without pretraining contamination.

- **Open Question 3:** Do human annotators confirm the improvements in explanation supportiveness observed via LLM-based pairwise ranking?
  - Basis in paper: Explanation-quality assessment relied on LLM-based judges, which may introduce biases; complementing with human evaluation remains important.
  - Why unresolved: Improvement in explanation quality measured automatically; unclear if aligns with human standards of evidence support.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Human annotation studies correlating with automated pairwise ranking scores to validate the "supportiveness" metric.

## Limitations
- Data provenance ambiguity: Exact sampling methodology for selecting 900 documents remains unspecified.
- Inference configuration gaps: BeSpoke/MiniCheck prompt template used for evaluation is referenced but not included.
- Training hyperparameter omissions: Critical training hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size are not documented.

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in: Longer context training (16k) improving long-context claim verification for base models, supported by consistent F1 improvements across benchmarks.
- **Medium confidence** in: Structured synthesis outperforming unstructured synthesis, as results are benchmark-dependent and show mixed performance between LLaMA and Qwen models.
- **Low confidence** in: Generalizability of error diversity benefits across all model types, given Qwen shows minimal improvement while LLaMA demonstrates clear gains.

## Next Checks
1. Test whether models trained on 16k contexts maintain performance improvements when evaluated on documents exceeding 100k tokens to examine positional embedding extrapolation limits.
2. Manually validate the accuracy of entity triples and argument structures on a sample of 50 documents to quantify noise propagation into synthesized claims.
3. Evaluate models trained on PubMed/GovReports/MeetingBank on a held-out subset of SQuality or completely different domain (e.g., legal documents) to assess true out-of-distribution robustness.
