# Improving OCR for Historical Texts of Multiple Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.10356
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10356
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Kraken model achieved 0.447 Levenshtein distance ratio on historical Hebrew OCR, outperforming TrOCR.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents three deep learning approaches to OCR and document layout analysis tasks across historical and modern datasets. For historical Hebrew text, the Kraken model with synthetic data augmentation outperformed TrOCR, achieving a Levenshtein distance ratio of 0.447. In document layout analysis, DeepLabV3+ with self-supervised learning improved multi-class prediction from 0.5892 to 0.6506 mIoU on 16th-18th century Dutch resolutions. For modern English handwriting, a CRNN achieved 19.9% character error rate and 52.8% word error rate on the IAM dataset. The work demonstrates that simpler architectures can perform well under data constraints and highlights the importance of data augmentation and self-supervised learning for limited datasets.

## Method Summary
The research tackles three distinct OCR tasks using specialized deep learning approaches. For historical Hebrew OCR, synthetic data was generated by compositing Hebrew characters onto canvases with Perlin noise, then used to fine-tune both Kraken (CNN+BiLSTM+CTC) and TrOCR models. Document layout analysis employed DeepLabV3+ with ResNet50 encoder on 16th-18th century Dutch resolutions, using a self-supervised learning loop with confidence threshold filtering. Modern English handwriting recognition used a CRNN architecture with ResNet34 encoder and CTC loss on the IAM dataset. All models were trained with standard optimization techniques, with specific hyperparameters detailed for each task.

## Key Results
- Kraken achieved 0.447 Levenshtein distance ratio on historical Hebrew OCR, outperforming TrOCR's 0.339
- DeepLabV3+ achieved 0.8439 mean IoU for semantic segmentation and 0.6506 for multi-class prediction after self-supervised learning
- CRNN achieved 19.9% character error rate and 52.8% word error rate on IAM dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Iterative pseudo-labeling of unlabeled data appears to improve multi-class segmentation performance when labeled data is scarce.
- **Mechanism:** A segmentation model is trained on limited labeled data and used to infer labels for unlabeled data. High-confidence predictions (threshold $\geq$ 0.70) are treated as ground truth and added to the training set. This expands the training distribution and regularizes the model against overfitting to the small original set.
- **Core assumption:** The initial model generates predictions with sufficient precision that the confidence threshold effectively filters out noise, preventing error accumulation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.4] Describes the methodology of integrating high-confidence pseudo-labels into the training set.
  - [Section 6.2] Reports a performance gain from 0.5892 to 0.6506 mIoU for multi-class prediction using self-supervised learning.
  - [Corpus] *OCR Error Post-Correction with LLMs* notes the difficulty of handling noise in historical documents, implying the need for robust data augmentation strategies like pseudo-labeling when clean data is missing.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Specialized OCR architectures (CNN+RNN) may outperform general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on historical scripts when the VLM's pre-training data distribution diverges significantly from the target domain.
- **Mechanism:** TrOCR relies on pre-trained language models (e.g., RoBERTa) which are biased toward English. When applied to historical Hebrew with synthetic augmentation, this linguistic bias conflicts with the visual input. Kraken, utilizing a CNN+BiLSTM architecture with CTC loss, relies less on generative language pre-training and more on visual feature extraction, making it potentially more robust to out-of-distribution synthetic data.
- **Core assumption:** The synthetic augmentation used for fine-tuning captures visual features adequately but fails to align with the linguistic priors of the large transformer model.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 2.1] Notes TrOCR relies on English language models, presenting a challenge for different scripts.
  - [Section 6.1] Shows Kraken outperforming TrOCR (0.447 vs 0.339 Levenshtein distance ratio) on historical Hebrew.
  - [Corpus] *CHURRO: Making History Readable...* highlights that standard VLMs struggle with diverse historical scripts and degradations, supporting the difficulty of applying general transformers to this domain.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Synthetic data generation via image composition effectively bridges data gaps for low-resource historical scripts.
- **Mechanism:** By compositing character images onto canvases with Perlin noise (simulating texture/background) and applying geometric variations, the model learns to recognize character shapes independent of specific manuscript degradation patterns.
- **Core assumption:** The simulated noise and texture (Perlin noise) are sufficient proxies for the actual physical degradation of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.1.1] Details the "Image Composition" technique involving character insertion and Perlin noise.
  - [Section 8.1] Concludes that despite functionality, synthetic images "lacked the authenticity necessary for robust generalization," acknowledging the mechanism's limits.
  - [Corpus] *600k-ks-ocr* validates the utility of large-scale synthetic datasets for low-resource script OCR, serving as an external anchor for this approach.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)**
  - **Why needed here:** CTC is the loss function used in both the winning Hebrew model (Kraken) and the English handwriting model (Task 3). It allows the network to output a sequence of characters without requiring precise pre-segmented alignment between the image pixels and the text labels.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does CTC require a "blank" token in its output vocabulary?

- **Concept: Semantic Segmentation vs. Object Detection**
  - **Why needed here:** Task 2 utilizes DeepLabV3+ for semantic segmentation (pixel-wise classification) rather than object detection (bounding boxes). Understanding this distinction is critical to interpreting the Mean IoU metric and the preprocessing of mask files.
  - **Quick check question:** In the context of document layout, does semantic segmentation classify the *pixels* of a paragraph, or the *bounding box* surrounding it?

- **Concept: Self-Supervised Learning (Pseudo-labeling)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the specific technique used to boost performance in Task 2. It involves using a model's own predictions as supervision for unlabeled data.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the primary risk of setting the confidence threshold too low when generating pseudo-labels?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - **Task 1 (Historical Hebrew):** External Text Sources → **Image Composer** (Perlin Noise + Character Insertion) → **Kraken** (CNN + BiLSTM + CTC).
  - **Task 2 (Layout Analysis):** **Flood-fill Preprocessor** (Page Splitting) → **DeepLabV3+** (ResNet50 Encoder) → **Pseudo-labeling Loop** (Threshold 0.70).
  - **Task 3 (English Handwriting):** **Image Normalizer** (Pad + Blackout) → **ResNet34** (Feature Extraction) → **BiLSTM** (Sequence) → **CTC Loss**.

- **Critical path:**
  The **Image Composition pipeline (Task 1)** and the **Confidence Threshold (Task 2)**. In Task 1, the authenticity of the Perlin noise determines the domain gap. In Task 2, the 0.70 confidence threshold is the gatekeeper for data quality in the self-supervised loop.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **TrOCR vs. Kraken:** The paper suggests choosing Kraken (complexity/specialization) over TrOCR (capacity/generality) when data is synthetic or limited and the language script differs from the model's pre-training.
  - **Segmentation Strategy:** The authors initially aimed for a two-stage pipeline (segmentation then classification) but reverted to multi-class segmentation, suggesting that end-to-end pixel classification may be more robust than modular pipelines for this specific layout task.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High WER, Low CER (Task 3):** The CRNN achieved 19.9% CER but 52.8% WER. This indicates the model recognizes individual characters but struggles with word formation, likely due to the absence of a language model or lexicon constraint during decoding.
  - **Transformer Underperformance (Task 1):** TrOCR showed significant improvement from pre-training but lagged behind Kraken, signaling that generic pre-trained weights may be a liability rather than an asset in highly specific historical domains.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate Synthetic Domain Gap:** Train the Kraken model on the synthetic Hebrew data *without* the Perlin noise augmentation to quantify exactly how much the texture simulation contributes to the Levenshtein ratio.
  2. **Calibrate Pseudo-label Threshold:** In Task 2, run ablations on the confidence threshold (e.g., 0.5, 0.70, 0.90) to find the optimal balance between adding new training data and introducing label noise.
  3. **Language Model Integration:** For Task 3, integrate a simple beam search decoder with a character-level language model on top of the CRNN output to verify if the WER drops closer to the CER.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can refined synthetic data generation techniques capture the authentic texture of historical manuscripts sufficiently to improve OCR generalization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state their synthetic images "lacked the authenticity necessary for robust generalization" and emphasize the necessity for "continued refinement of our methodologies and datasets to enhance the authenticity."
- Why unresolved: The current image composition method failed to fully replicate the unique material decay and texture of the Dead Sea Scrolls, limiting the robustness of the training data despite functional performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing that models trained on refined synthetic data (with advanced noise/perlin noise modeling) achieve a higher Levenshtein distance ratio on real test fragments than models trained on the current synthetic set.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does a modular pipeline of binary segmentation followed by a classification head yield higher accuracy than a direct multi-class segmentation approach for historical documents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that implementing a classification head after binary segmentation was a "notable missed opportunity" and suggest a "comparative analysis with a multi-class model developed from scratch in future work."
- Why unresolved: Time constraints and incomplete research forced the authors to abandon the modular design for a multi-class approach, leaving the potential performance benefits of the intended two-stage architecture unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment training both the proposed two-stage pipeline and the single-stage DeepLabV3+ model on the Staten of Overijssel dataset to compare mean IoU and multi-class prediction scores.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent can integrating pre-trained embeddings or a post-correction language model reduce the high word error rate in CRNNs for handwriting recognition?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest "future implementations" should explore a "post-correction module," "pre-trained embeddings," or "subword level" models to address the observed 50% word error rate.
- Why unresolved: The current CRNN model relied primarily on visual feature extraction without linguistic post-processing, resulting in a word error rate (52.8%) significantly higher than the character error rate (19.9%).
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the baseline CRNN against modified versions incorporating word2vec embeddings or a language model decoder, tracking the reduction in WER on the IAM dataset.

## Limitations
- Synthetic data domain gap: Generated Hebrew images lack authentic texture of Dead Sea Scrolls, limiting real-world performance
- Confidence threshold sensitivity: Self-supervised learning relies on fixed 0.70 threshold without ablation study
- Architecture simplicity tradeoffs: CRNN achieves 19.9% CER but 52.8% WER without language model integration

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Specialized architectures (CNN+BiLSTM) outperform general-purpose VLMs on highly specific, out-of-distribution historical scripts
- **Medium Confidence:** Self-supervised learning improves multi-class document layout segmentation when labeled data is scarce
- **Low Confidence:** Absolute performance metrics for OCR tasks due to synthetic data domain gap and lack of language model

## Next Checks
1. **Validate Synthetic Domain Gap:** Evaluate Kraken model on real Dead Sea Scroll fragments to quantify performance drop from synthetic training
2. **Calibrate Pseudo-label Threshold:** Run ablation study on confidence threshold (0.5, 0.70, 0.90) to find optimal balance between data volume and label quality
3. **Language Model Integration:** Add beam search decoder with lexicon constraint to CRNN output and measure impact on WER reduction
