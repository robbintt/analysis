# Diffusion-Based Imitation Learning for Social Pose Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.10869
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10869
- **Reference count:** 24
- **Primary result:** Pre-processed pose keypoint images reduce Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) by up to 54.19% compared to raw 360° images in diffusion-based social pose generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a diffusion-based imitation learning approach for generating facilitator behaviors in social interactions using only pose data. The method adapts a diffusion behavior cloning model to learn from facilitator movements in group discussions, evaluating two pose representation techniques: raw 360-degree images and pre-processed pose keypoint images. The primary result shows that the pre-processed pose images significantly improve pose prediction accuracy, reducing Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) by up to 54.19% compared to raw images. However, this improvement comes with an 8-19% increase in processing time per frame. The approach demonstrates that diffusion models can effectively generate realistic social behaviors for facilitators, with reasonable trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The method employs diffusion-based behavior cloning to generate facilitator poses for social interactions. It uses a Transformer-based denoising network trained on the FUMI-MPF dataset containing 360° camera footage of group discussions. The model predicts joint position deltas (Δx, Δy) between consecutive frames rather than absolute positions. Two observation representations are evaluated: raw equirectangular images resized to 128×128, and pre-processed pose keypoint images plotted on white backgrounds. The Diffusion-X sampling algorithm with T=50 denoising steps and M=8 refinement steps generates predictions. The approach is trained on NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU with an 80-20 train-eval split.

## Key Results
- Pre-processed pose keypoint images reduce MPJPE by up to 54.19% compared to raw images
- Accuracy improvements vary by facilitator type: 9.82% (Teacher), 54.19% (Musician), 36.83% (Music Teacher)
- Processing time increases by 8-19% with pre-processed images (530-927 ms/frame)
- Neither implementation achieves real-time performance requirements for 30fps video

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Pre-processed pose keypoint images reduce prediction error compared to raw 360° images.
- **Mechanism:** Extracting pose keypoints and plotting them on a white background removes visual noise (background clutter, lighting variations, irrelevant scene details) that distracts the denoising network from the relevant social pose features. The model receives a sparse, task-relevant signal rather than a dense, high-entropy image.
- **Core assumption:** Pose keypoints alone contain sufficient information to predict facilitator movements without scene context (furniture positions, gaze objects, etc.).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The primary result shows that the pre-processed pose images significantly improve pose prediction accuracy, reducing Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) by up to 54.19% compared to raw images."
  - [section IV] "This improvement may stem from the pre-processing done to the image that extracts the necessary pose features and removes much of the noise that the normal image contains."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support for this specific preprocessing mechanism; related work (MIMIC-D, Temporally Coherent Imitation Learning) focuses on multi-agent coordination and flow matching rather than observation preprocessing comparisons.
- **Break condition:** If pose keypoints lose critical social context (e.g., eye gaze direction, object interactions), the mechanism may degrade or fail entirely.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Diffusion-based behavior cloning captures multi-modal action distributions better than deterministic BC approaches.
- **Mechanism:** The reverse diffusion process (Algorithm 1, Diffusion-X sampling) iteratively denoises an initial random latent variable conditioned on observations, allowing the model to sample from a learned action distribution rather than output a single deterministic action. This enables modeling diverse but valid social behaviors.
- **Core assumption:** Social facilitator behavior is inherently multi-modal (multiple valid responses to same social context) and benefits from probabilistic modeling.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Diffusion models can effectively generate realistic social behaviors for facilitators"
  - [section I] "Diffusion models have become widely recognized for their ability to adapt to various tasks... These models use a probabilistic approach to handle complex and diverse data"
  - [corpus] MIMIC-D (arXiv:2509.14159) supports multi-agent coordination via diffusion policies; DIVER (arXiv:2507.04049) notes imitation learning from single experts leads to "conservative and homogeneous behaviors," motivating diffusion's multi-modal capacity.
- **Break condition:** If the denoising network fails to learn meaningful conditional distributions (e.g., insufficient data, poor architecture choice), the model generates unrealistic or inconsistent poses.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Predicting joint position deltas (Δx, Δy) rather than absolute positions improves temporal coherence.
- **Mechanism:** The model learns to predict the change in joint coordinates between consecutive frames rather than absolute positions. This frames the problem as velocity/trajectory prediction, which may be more stable and generalizable across different body positions and scales.
- **Core assumption:** Joint deltas are a more learnable representation than absolute positions for social pose sequences.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section II.B] "We calculated the differences between each consecutive frame of the x, y coordinates of each of the facilitator's joints. We fed these Δx and Δy values into the model as actions (a)."
  - [corpus] Temporally Coherent Imitation Learning (arXiv:2601.23087) emphasizes "temporally coherent" action modeling via flow matching, suggesting temporal representations matter.
  - [corpus] Direct evidence for delta vs. absolute representation is not explicitly tested in this paper's comparisons.
- **Break condition:** If delta accumulation over long sequences causes drift or error compounding, the mechanism degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire architecture depends on understanding how forward diffusion adds noise and reverse diffusion denoises, including the role of schedule coefficients (ατ, ᾱτ) and noise variance (στ).
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why Algorithm 1 samples noise z ~ N(0,I) in most steps but sets z=0 in the final refinement steps?

- **Concept: Behavior Cloning as Supervised Learning**
  - **Why needed here:** This work frames imitation learning as mapping observations to actions via supervised learning, with diffusion models replacing deterministic networks to handle multi-modality.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the key limitation of traditional behavior cloning that diffusion models address in this paper?

- **Concept: Transformer Architectures for Sequence Modeling**
  - **Why needed here:** The denoising network uses a transformer-based architecture, selected over MLP variants for superior accuracy.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might transformers outperform MLPs for modeling pose sequences in social interactions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** 360° Camera -> Pose Keypoint Extraction -> Raw Image Resize (128×128) OR Keypoint Plotting -> Transformer Denoiser -> Diffusion-X Sampling -> Predicted Joint Deltas
- **Critical path:** Pose keypoint extraction quality directly impacts observation conditioning effectiveness; Transformer denoising network training convergence determines action distribution quality; Sampling step count (T=50, M=8) determines inference latency vs. prediction quality tradeoff
- **Design tradeoffs:** Accuracy vs. latency: Pre-processed images reduce MPJPE by 9.82%-54.19% but increase processing time by 8%-19% (Table III). Current latency (~530-927 ms/frame) is NOT real-time viable for 30fps video. Raw vs. plotted observations: Raw images work better for large, exaggerated movements (Teacher facilitator); plotted images excel for subtle movements (Musician, Music Teacher).
- **Failure signatures:** High MPJPE on subtle movements when using raw images (Musician: 0.0406 raw vs. 0.0186 plotted); Inconsistent processing times potentially caused by GPU background processes (noted for Teacher session); No real-time viability at current latency levels
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline reproduction: Train on raw images vs. plotted keypoints for a single facilitator type; verify MPJPE reduction magnitude matches paper (target: ~10-54% improvement). 2) Ablation on denoising steps: Reduce T from 50 to 25 and 10; measure MPJPE degradation and latency improvement to find optimal operating point. 3) Real-time feasibility test: Profile the full pipeline (pose extraction + image preprocessing + diffusion inference) to identify the primary latency bottleneck; test if reducing image resolution from 128×128 to 64×64 maintains acceptable MPJPE while improving speed.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can human evaluators reliably distinguish diffusion-generated facilitator poses from human ground truth in a virtual agent or robot deployment?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Future work explicitly states plans for "evaluating the results using human evaluators using a virtual agent or robot as a facilitator."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current evaluation relies solely on MPJPE, a positional error metric that does not capture social appropriateness, naturalness, or contextual suitability of generated behaviors.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** User studies where human participants rate generated vs. real facilitator behaviors in controlled HRI scenarios, using metrics like perceived naturalness and social appropriateness.

- **Open Question 2:** Can the model generalize to diverse social interaction types beyond the three facilitator personas (teacher, musician, music teacher) tested?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state "The results of this paper suggest that we need to test on more diverse social interactions" and plan to expand to "larger, more diverse participant groups."
  - **Why unresolved:** Training data included only three facilitator types in seated group discussions; performance varied significantly across types (9.82%–54.19% MPJPE improvement), suggesting sensitivity to behavioral characteristics.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation across additional social contexts (e.g., standing interactions, different group sizes, cultural variations) showing consistent MPJPE improvements with pre-processed pose conditioning.

- **Open Question 3:** Can the system achieve real-time inference rates (≥30 FPS) through architectural optimization while maintaining pose accuracy?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors report 530–927 ms/frame processing time and conclude "neither implementation is ready for real-time implementation," then explicitly commit to "optimizing the feature extraction and the diffusion model architecture."
  - **Why unresolved:** Pre-processed pose images improved accuracy but increased processing time by 8–19%, creating a trade-off between accuracy and speed that current architecture cannot reconcile.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstrated inference times below 33 ms/frame with comparable or better MPJPE than current pre-processed pose image results.

## Limitations

- The core limitation is inference latency (530-927 ms/frame), which is orders of magnitude above real-time requirements for 30fps video (33 ms/frame)
- The reliance on 360° camera input and full-frame image processing may be unnecessary for pose generation tasks
- The paper lacks ablation studies testing whether absolute positions or alternative temporal representations would perform better than joint deltas
- No quantification of model size, memory usage, or inference optimization potential

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The diffusion-based imitation learning framework and pose representation comparison are technically sound and well-documented. The MPJPE improvements from pre-processed images are clearly demonstrated across all facilitator types.
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that diffusion models better capture multi-modal social behaviors is supported by the probabilistic framework but lacks direct empirical comparison to deterministic BC baselines in this specific context.
- **Low confidence:** The inference latency measurements appear noisy (Teacher session variation) and lack comprehensive profiling to identify optimization opportunities. The real-time feasibility conclusions are premature without systematic latency reduction experiments.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture scaling test:** Measure how inference time scales with denoising steps (T=10, 25, 50) and determine the optimal T that balances MPJPE degradation against latency requirements for real-time applications.

2. **Model optimization profile:** Profile the complete pipeline to identify whether pose extraction, image preprocessing, or diffusion inference dominates latency. Test if reducing image resolution from 128×128 to 64×64 maintains acceptable accuracy while improving speed.

3. **Multi-modal capability validation:** Compare diffusion-based BC against a deterministic BC baseline on the same dataset to empirically validate whether the probabilistic approach produces more diverse and natural social behaviors, particularly for the Music Teacher and Musician facilitators showing larger accuracy improvements with pre-processed images.
