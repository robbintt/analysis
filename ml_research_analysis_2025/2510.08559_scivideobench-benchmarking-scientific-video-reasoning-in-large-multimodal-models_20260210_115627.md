# SciVideoBench: Benchmarking Scientific Video Reasoning in Large Multimodal Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.08559
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08559
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Current LMMs achieve near-random performance (15.80% accuracy) on scientific video reasoning tasks requiring domain knowledge, precise perception, and multi-step reasoning

## Executive Summary
SciVideoBench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate advanced video reasoning in scientific contexts. Unlike existing video benchmarks that focus on general scenarios with relatively simple reasoning, SciVideoBench features 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos across 25 specialized academic subjects. Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning. The benchmark challenges state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source large multimodal models, revealing significant performance deficits and highlighting the need for advancement in video reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The benchmark was created using a multi-agent pipeline involving video collection from JoVE (Journal of Visualized Experiments), automatic QA generation with Gemini 2.5 Pro, visual grounding verification, and human expert refinement. The evaluation framework tests models with specific frame sampling strategies (e.g., 768 frames for Qwen, 1 FPS for Gemini) and includes blind baseline tests, proprietary model evaluations, and open-source model comparisons across three reasoning types: quantitative, hypothetical, and conceptual.

## Key Results
- Proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro achieve only 15.80% overall accuracy, barely above random guess
- Quantitative reasoning consistently emerges as the most challenging category across all models
- Chain-of-thought prompting improves quantitative reasoning by ~22% on average but can hurt conceptual reasoning for open-source models due to hallucination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Demand Integration Stress-Testing
- Claim: SciVideoBench exposes model failures by requiring simultaneous domain knowledge, precise visual perception, and multi-step reasoning
- Mechanism: Questions are constructed so that removing any one component makes the problem unsolvable
- Evidence: Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning
- Break condition: If questions can be answered via text-only shortcuts

### Mechanism 2: Visual Grounding Enforcement via Question Design
- Claim: Questions are explicitly rewritten to replace descriptive phrases with neutral timestamp references
- Mechanism: A refiner agent replaces generic descriptions with phrases like "the operation shown at [timestamp]"
- Evidence: The Refiner refines the QA pairs by replacing generic or descriptive terms with explicit references to visual segments
- Break condition: If timestamps or question phrasing inadvertently leak information

### Mechanism 3: Reasoning-Type Differentiated Evaluation
- Claim: Categorizing questions into quantitative, hypothetical, and conceptual types reveals performance gaps
- Mechanism: Quantitative questions require extracting numeric values, performing calculations, and comparing results
- Evidence: Quantitative reasoning consistently emerges as the most challenging category across models
- Break condition: If quantitative questions inadvertently require domain knowledge not shown in video

## Foundational Learning

- **Spatiotemporal grounding in video understanding**
  - Why needed: Questions reference specific timestamps, and models must localize events in both time and space
  - Quick check: Given a video where a chemical is added at 01:15–01:20 and a color change occurs at 01:45, can your model identify which step caused the change?

- **Chain-of-thought prompting for multimodal reasoning**
  - Why needed: CoT improves quantitative reasoning by ~22% on average but can hurt conceptual reasoning for open-source models
  - Quick check: Does explicitly asking a model to "think step-by-step" improve its accuracy on a multi-step calculation task?

- **Domain knowledge integration with visual perception**
  - Why needed: Many questions require recognizing a substance visually and recalling its chemical function
  - Quick check: Can your model identify a piece of lab equipment from video and explain its purpose?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Video collection -> Annotation pipeline (multi-agent system) -> Question types (quantitative, hypothetical, conceptual) -> Evaluation framework (blind baselines, proprietary models, open-source models)

- **Critical path**: 1. Video + manuscript + transcript → QA generation (Gemini 2.5 Pro) 2. Initial QA → Visual grounding check (timestamp alignment) 3. Refined QA → Human expert verification (domain knowledge check) 4. Final QA → Model evaluation (multiple LMMs with standardized sampling)

- **Design tradeoffs**: Video duration vs. evaluation cost (average 484s videos require more frames → higher compute); Question specificity vs. generalization (timestamp references enforce grounding but may overfit); Distractor plausibility vs. fairness (scientifically plausible distractors increase difficulty but require expert validation)

- **Failure signatures**: Blind baseline performance (>25% accuracy indicates insufficient visual grounding); Quantitative reasoning floor (<30% on quantitative questions indicates missing visible information); CoT regression (decreased accuracy on conceptual questions indicates hallucination tendencies)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Blind baseline test: Run GPT-4o or Qwen2.5 on questions without video input; verify accuracy is near random (10–20%) 2. Frame sampling ablation: Compare model performance with 32 vs. 256 vs. 768 frames to identify perception bottlenecks 3. Error type analysis: Manually classify 50 wrong predictions into "visual perception failure," "reasoning error," or "knowledge gap"

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific training objectives or architectural modifications are required to improve quantitative reasoning in LMMs?
- Basis: Section 3.10 states that the correlation between backbone size and quantitative reasoning is weak (ρ=0.64)
- Why unresolved: Current scaling laws do not effectively transfer to tasks requiring precise numerical perception
- What evidence would resolve it: A study showing that a specific architectural change improves quantitative scores independent of LLM parameter count

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can Chain-of-Thought prompting be adapted for open-source models to prevent performance degradation in conceptual reasoning?
- Basis: Section 3.8 notes that CoT often hurts open-source models on conceptual tasks by amplifying hallucinations
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the symptom but does not propose a solution to align CoT reasoning with visual evidence
- What evidence would resolve it: A new prompting strategy that yields positive CoT gains for open-source models on Conceptual and Hypothetical subsets

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can LMMs be trained to better balance reliance on memorized expert knowledge versus strict visual grounding?
- Basis: Section 3.12 identifies "Incorrect Visual Perception" (70.68%) and "Lack of Domain Knowledge" (49.40%) as primary failure modes
- Why unresolved: Models often rely on generic domain priors or fail to connect visual evidence to known scientific principles
- What evidence would resolve it: A model architecture that dynamically weights visual tokens against knowledge retrieval, reducing hallucination errors

## Limitations

- The benchmark relies on a single video source (JoVE), limiting generalizability across diverse scientific video styles
- The multi-agent annotation pipeline introduces potential human bias through the four PhD student annotators
- The timestamp-based grounding mechanism may inadvertently leak information through question phrasing

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The claim that current LMMs struggle with integrated scientific video reasoning is well-supported by blind baseline results showing near-random performance
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism claim that SciVideoBench uniquely stresses multi-demand integration is partially supported but requires further validation
- **Low confidence**: The specific mechanism that question design prevents text-only shortcuts is based primarily on internal validation

## Next Checks

1. **External validation on diverse video sources**: Test model performance on scientific videos from sources other than JoVE to assess generalizability of the benchmark's difficulty
2. **Information leakage audit**: Conduct systematic analysis of whether timestamp references or question phrasing inadvertently provide answer clues
3. **Comparative benchmark analysis**: Design controlled experiments comparing model performance on SciVideoBench versus equivalent questions from other video reasoning benchmarks, isolating the contribution of each reasoning component
