# SC4ANM: Identifying Optimal Section Combinations for Automated Novelty Prediction in Academic Papers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.16330
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16330
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Primary result:** Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections yield highest accuracy (0.682) for novelty prediction using fine-tuned PLMs.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of automating novelty assessment in academic papers by systematically evaluating which section combinations best predict novelty scores. The authors employ deep learning models and LLMs to identify section structures, then fine-tune pre-trained language models (PLMs) with different section combinations as inputs. Their findings reveal that using Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections achieves the highest accuracy (0.682) for novelty prediction, outperforming both full-text analysis and title/abstract alone. The study also highlights limitations of LLMs in this task, demonstrating that fine-tuned PLMs are more effective for this specific application.

## Method Summary
The researchers first parsed academic papers using GROBID/S2ORC to extract text, then employed a hybrid section classifier (fine-tuned SciBERT + Llama3 verification) to identify IMRaD sections. They created three-class labels (Basic, Moderate, High Novelty) from ICLR reviewer scores, filtering out papers with high disagreement (variance > 1). The optimal configuration involved fine-tuning SciBERT (Longformer version) using concatenated Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections as input, with hyperparameters including learning rate of 1e-4, 10 epochs, and early stopping (patience=3).

## Key Results
- Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections yield highest accuracy (0.682) for novelty prediction
- Full-text analysis does not significantly improve results compared to IRD combination
- Fine-tuned PLMs significantly outperform LLMs in zero-shot novelty prediction settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Differential Section Utility (Signal Localization)
The combination of Introduction, Results, and Discussion yields higher predictive accuracy because novelty signals are localized in argumentative sections rather than procedural ones. Authors articulate contributions and gaps in the Introduction and validate them in Results and Discussion, while Methods sections often contain standard protocols that dilute the novelty signal.

### Mechanism 2: Fine-Tuning vs. Zero-Shot Alignment
Fine-tuned PLMs outperform LLMs in zero-shot settings because LLMs exhibit "favorability bias" and lack calibration to specific human reviewer distributions. PLMs learn the specific boundary between moderate and high novelty from ground-truth scores, while zero-shot LLMs tend to generate overly satisfactory assessments.

### Mechanism 3: Noise Reduction via Omission
Using full text degrades performance because the Methods section introduces noise or exceeds the model's effective context utilization. The IRD combination acts as a hard attention mask, focusing the model on high-signal claim/validation segments.

## Foundational Learning

- **IMRaD Structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion)**: Essential for understanding the ablation study; needed to interpret why IRD > IMRD. Quick check: If a paper describes a new chemical compound, which section would describe what it is vs. how it was tested?

- **Ground Truth Label Processing (Aggregation & Filtering)**: Understanding how reviewer scores are aggregated and filtered (removing papers with variance > 1) is crucial for interpreting dataset boundaries. Quick check: Why would a paper with reviewer scores [1, 4] be removed before training?

- **Correlation vs. Accuracy in Ordinal Regression**: The task is classification but evaluated with Pearson/Spearman correlation; understanding this helps appreciate LLM results. Quick check: If Model A predicts [1, 2, 3] and Model B predicts [0, 1, 2] for ground truth [0, 1, 2], which has higher accuracy and which has higher correlation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** PDF Ingestion (GROBID/S2ORC) -> Section Classifier (Fine-tuned SciBERT + Llama3) -> Combiner (Concatenate specific sections) -> Encoder (Long-sequence Transformer) -> Head (MLP Classifier)

- **Critical path:** The Section Classifier. If it mislabels Introduction as Discussion, the IRD hypothesis cannot be tested. The paper uses a conservative threshold (0.8) and LLM verification to ensure high precision.

- **Design tradeoffs:** PLMs (SciBERT) are cheaper and more accurate than GPT-4o but require labeled training data; filtering papers with reviewer disagreement improves label quality but reduces dataset size (8183 → 3500).

- **Failure signatures:** "Polite Robot" Effect (LLM output skewed toward high scores); Context Dilution (if IMRD accuracy equals IRD, long-context model may not utilize full context).

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Sanity Check: Reproduce IRD vs. IMRD comparison to verify Pearson correlation improvement; 2) Baseline Validation: Test Title + Abstract input to confirm it performs worse than Introduction alone; 3) Ablation: Train on Methods-only to verify it performs near random.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Do the optimal section combinations (Introduction, Results, Discussion) for novelty prediction transfer effectively to academic disciplines outside of computer science? The authors plan to collect data from wider disciplines to assess generalizability.

- Can fine-tuning or advanced prompt engineering strategies correct the tendency of LLMs to provide "favorable" novelty scores and improve their prediction accuracy? The authors propose developing strategies to unlock LLM potential.

- Does the inclusion of non-textual content (tables, figures, and charts) significantly enhance the accuracy of automated novelty prediction? The study did not account for impact of visual content, acknowledging these as crucial components.

## Limitations
- Reliance on ICLR conference papers may not generalize to other domains or publication venues
- Filtering papers with high reviewer disagreement potentially biases dataset toward consensus-driven evaluations
- Performance gap between PLMs and LLMs may narrow with few-shot prompting or task-specific fine-tuning

## Confidence

- **High:** IRD combination outperforming IMRD and title/abstract alone (supported by ablation results and qualitative reasoning)
- **Medium:** Claim that Methods sections introduce noise (lacks direct empirical ablation, relies on correlation patterns)
- **Medium:** "Polite robot" failure mode of LLMs (supported by results but not systematically tested with different prompting strategies)

## Next Checks

1. Cross-domain validation: Test IRD hypothesis on papers from other conferences (NeurIPS, CVPR) or disciplines (biology, physics) to assess generalizability.

2. Few-shot LLM evaluation: Replicate LLM experiments with in-context examples to determine if zero-shot failure is inherent or prompt-dependent.

3. Methods-only ablation: Train and evaluate a model using only Methods section to empirically verify whether it performs near random, validating noise-reduction hypothesis.
