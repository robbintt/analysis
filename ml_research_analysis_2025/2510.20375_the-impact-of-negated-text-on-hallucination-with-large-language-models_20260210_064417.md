# The Impact of Negated Text on Hallucination with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20375
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20375
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text, misclassifying negated factual statements as hallucinations due to treating negation as a lexical modifier rather than a logical transformation.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how negated text affects hallucination detection in large language models. The authors construct the NegHalu dataset by applying negation to existing hallucination detection benchmarks and observe that LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations effectively in negated text, often misclassifying negated factual statements as hallucinations. Through lens observation, they find that models do not meaningfully distinguish between pre- and post-negated inputs internally, treating negation as a lexical modifier rather than a logical transformation. Experiments with in-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and knowledge editing show limited improvements, revealing that negation-induced hallucinations are deeply embedded in model representations. The findings highlight the challenges of negation processing in LLMs and suggest the need for deeper architectural refinements.

## Method Summary
The study constructs the NegHalu dataset by applying negation transformations to three existing hallucination detection benchmarks (HaluEval, BamBoo, SelfCheckGPT-WikiBio) using GPT-4o with two-round verification. The dataset contains 1,950 pre- and post-negated example pairs across QA, dialogue, summarization, and completion tasks. Four models (Llama-2-7B, Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen3-4B) are evaluated on binary hallucination classification using greedy decoding. The study employs Logit Lens to observe internal representations across layers and tests three mitigation strategies: in-context learning (0/2/4-shot), chain-of-thought reasoning, and AlphaEdit knowledge editing. Performance is measured using accuracy for HaluEval, F1 for BamBoo, and sentence-level accuracy for SelfCheckGPT.

## Key Results
- Post-negated inputs show 21-206% increase in "hallucinated" predictions compared to pre-negated examples across all models and tasks.
- Logit Lens curves for pre- and post-negated inputs overlap significantly with minimal internal differentiation, supporting the lexical-modifier interpretation.
- Chain-of-thought improves pre-negated detection in some cases but not post-negated, while knowledge editing produces inconsistent results.
- The performance gap persists across QA, dialogue, summarization, and completion tasks, indicating a fundamental processing limitation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs process negation as a lexical modifier rather than a logical transformation, causing systematic misclassification of negated factual statements as hallucinations.
- Mechanism: Negation markers (e.g., "not," "never") are treated as individual token features rather than operators that fundamentally alter semantic truth conditions. This leads to overgeneralized hallucination judgments regardless of whether the negated statement is factually accurate.
- Core assumption: The model's internal representations do not encode negation scope or logical truth-value inversions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "models do not meaningfully distinguish between pre- and post-negated inputs internally, treating negation as a lexical modifier rather than a logical transformation"
  - [section A2]: "negation functions more as a single token rather than as a logical operator"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus support; related work on negation processing in LLMs (Truong et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023) confirms negation causes performance drops but does not establish the specific lexical-vs-logical mechanism.
- Break condition: If models were shown to exhibit distinct activation patterns for logically-equivalent negated and affirmative statements, this mechanism would be weakened.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Negated inputs amplify hallucination bias by increasing model confidence in incorrect predictions without corresponding internal differentiation.
- Mechanism: Post-negated examples exhibit stronger decision confidence (probability shifts near final layers) while showing reduced distinction between correct and incorrect classifications in internal representations, mimicking patterns observed in hallucination-inducing cases.
- Core assumption: Confidence calibration degrades specifically for negated inputs; the effect is not uniform across all input perturbations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section A2]: "models exhibit stronger confidence in incorrect predictions compared to correct ones" for post-negated examples
  - [section A2]: "post-negated examples generally exhibit greater confidence in their decisions or show significant fluctuations near the final layers"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence on negation-confidence coupling; hallucination detection via attention maps (arXiv:2502.17598) explores different features.
- Break condition: If confidence were uniformly high for both correct and incorrect negated predictions without the asymmetry described, the bias-amplification claim would need revision.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Negation-induced hallucination patterns are embedded in model representations and resist mitigation through surface-level interventions.
- Mechanism: Because negation processing failures originate in how representations are formed across layers (not just in retrieved knowledge), interventions like in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and knowledge editing produce inconsistent or limited gains.
- Core assumption: The failure is architectural/representational rather than purely knowledge-access or prompting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "negation-induced hallucinations are deeply embedded in model representations"
  - [section A3]: "negation errors are deeply embedded within the model's internal representations rather than merely arising from incorrect factual knowledge"
  - [corpus]: Related work (arXiv:2506.17088) suggests CoT can obscure hallucination cues, aligning with limited intervention efficacy.
- Break condition: If a targeted parameter intervention (e.g., layer-specific fine-tuning on negated examples) consistently closed the pre/post-negation performance gap, the deep-embedding claim would be weakened.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Negation Scope and Logical Form**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core claim rests on LLMs failing to treat negation as a scope-bearing logical operator. Understanding how negation attaches to predicates, noun phrases, and quantifiers is prerequisite to interpreting the lexical-modifier vs. logical-transformation distinction.
  - Quick check question: Given "The model did not classify the negated input correctly," what is the scope of negation, and how would flipping it change truth conditions?

- Concept: **Logit Lens and Layer-wise Interpretability**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses logit lens to trace probability shifts across layers as evidence for internal processing failures. Understanding how hidden states are projected to vocabulary space at each layer is essential to interpret Figure 2 and Figure 4.
  - Quick check question: At which layer range do the strongest probability fluctuations occur for negated inputs, and what does this suggest about where negation processing fails?

- Concept: **Hallucination Taxonomy (Factual vs. Faithfulness)**
  - Why needed here: The NegHalu dataset flips hallucination labels based on whether negated statements contradict world knowledge (factual) or context (faithfulness). Distinguishing these is necessary to understand label reassignment.
  - Quick check question: If a model claims "Paris is not the capital of France" in a dialogue, is this a factual hallucination, a faithfulness violation, or both?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - NegHalu dataset pipeline: Source datasets (HaluEval, BamBoo, SelfCheckGPT-WikiBio) → GPT-4o negation transformation (Round 1) → Multi-temperature verification (Round 2) → Human review → Final balanced pre/post pairs.
  - Lens observation: Logit Lens applied to final input token and first output token; tracks probability shifts across 32 layers (Llama2/3, Mistral).
  - Intervention modules: In-context learning (0/2/4-shot), CoT prompting, AlphaEdit knowledge editing targeting layers 4-8 (Llama3).

- Critical path:
  1. Load pre/post-negated example pairs with ground-truth labels.
  2. Run binary hallucination classification under identical prompting conditions.
  3. Apply Logit Lens to extract per-layer token probabilities for comparison.
  4. If testing interventions, apply ICL/CoT/KE before classification and compare pre/post gaps.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dataset size vs. quality: Strict verification (unanimous Pass) reduces NegHalu to 1,950 samples but ensures label reliability.
  - Intervention intrusiveness: AlphaEdit preserves existing knowledge via null-space constraints but may still degrade pre-negated performance (observed in SelfCheckGPT).
  - Generalization: Results limited to 7B-8B models; scaling behavior unknown.

- Failure signatures:
  - Post-negated inputs show 21-206% increase in "hallucinated" predictions vs. pre-negated (Table 5).
  - Logit Lens curves for pre/post negated inputs overlap significantly with minimal differentiation (Figure 2).
  - CoT improves pre-negated detection in some cases but not post-negated (Table 8).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the pre/post-negated classification gap on a held-out subset of NegHalu to confirm the degradation signal.
  2. Run Logit Lens on a single example pair to visualize layer-wise probability divergence; verify that middle and final layers show the described fluctuations.
  3. Test a minimal intervention (2-shot ICL with balanced pre/post examples) and measure whether the post-negation bias shifts; expect inconsistent gains per Table 7.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can specific architectural refinements enable LLMs to process negation as a logical operator rather than a lexical modifier?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that "future work... emphasize[s] the need for deeper architectural refinements" because current models treat negation as a lexical modifier.
- Why unresolved: Current mitigation strategies (CoT, knowledge editing) failed to resolve the issue, and lens observation showed models lack internal distinction for negation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new model architecture or attention mechanism that creates distinct latent representations for pre- and post-negated texts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does increasing model scale allow for better internal differentiation between negated and affirmative contexts in hallucination detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge they were "unable to compare larger models" due to computational constraints.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested models up to 8B parameters (Llama3, Mistral), and it is unknown if scaling resolves the observed internal state similarities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of larger parameter models (e.g., 70B+) on the NegHalu dataset showing significant performance recovery in post-negation scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does training on diverse forms of negation (implicit, morphological) impact the robustness of hallucination detection compared to training on explicit negation only?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study notes that NegHalu+ (including implicit/morphological negation) exposes distinct failure profiles, but experiments were limited to evaluation rather than remediation.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies vulnerability to diverse negation types but does not propose or test a training regimen to fix these specific weaknesses.
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-tuning experiments utilizing NegHalu+ that result in consistent accuracy gains across explicit, implicit, and morphological negation types.

## Limitations

- The study only tests models up to 8B parameters, leaving unknown whether larger models would show different negation processing capabilities.
- The NegHalu dataset, while carefully constructed, may not capture the full diversity of negation types (scope ambiguity, negative concord) that could affect model behavior differently.
- The interventions tested (ICL, CoT, knowledge editing) may be insufficient proxies for architectural solutions that could address the underlying representation issues.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The empirical observation that negated text significantly degrades hallucination detection performance (21-206% increase in false positive classifications) is well-supported by the comparative analysis across four model families and three task domains. The logit lens evidence showing minimal internal distinction between pre/post-negated inputs at corresponding layers is methodologically sound and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence:** The interpretation that negation processing failures are "deeply embedded in model representations" rather than knowledge-access issues is plausible but not definitively proven. The intervention results showing inconsistent improvements could reflect either representation-level limitations or suboptimal intervention parameters. The lexical-modifier vs logical-transformation distinction, while theoretically grounded, relies on behavioral inference rather than direct mechanistic analysis.

**Low Confidence:** The claim that these findings reveal a fundamental architectural deficiency requiring "deeper refinements" overstates what the current evidence supports. The paper demonstrates a robust performance gap but does not establish that this gap is unfixable through better prompting, fine-tuning strategies, or architectural modifications not tested here.

## Next Checks

1. **Layer-specific intervention validation:** Apply targeted fine-tuning on negated examples to specific transformer layers (not just layers 4-8 as in AlphaEdit) and measure whether pre/post-negation performance gaps can be closed. This would test whether the embedding hypothesis is correct by attempting to modify the representations directly.

2. **Negation type ablation study:** Construct a controlled subset of NegHalu that isolates different negation constructions (sentence negation vs predicate negation, scope ambiguity cases) and test whether performance degradation varies systematically by negation type. This would validate whether the lexical-modifier mechanism applies uniformly or selectively.

3. **Cross-modal generalization test:** Apply the same pre/post-negation methodology to vision-language models on tasks involving negated visual descriptions. If similar performance degradation occurs, this would strengthen the claim of a fundamental representation issue rather than text-specific phenomena.
