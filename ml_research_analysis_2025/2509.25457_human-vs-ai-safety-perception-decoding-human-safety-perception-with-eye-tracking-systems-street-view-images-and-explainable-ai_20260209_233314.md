- This study proposes a computational framework integrating eye-tracking systems, street view images, and eXplainable AI (XAI) to better understand how humans perceive urban safety.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses limitations in prior safety perception research that relied solely on street view images and computer vision techniques, which often overlooked the specific visual environmental factors that draw human attention. To bridge this gap, the authors propose a computational framework integrating eye-tracking systems, street view images, and eXplainable AI (XAI). The eye-tracking system captures participants' gaze patterns while viewing street view images of Helsingborg, Sweden, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of which urban features influence safety perceptions.

The study identifies key urban infrastructure and public space features that attract human attention when perceiving safe environments, while finding that open elements like the sky are less relevant. Importantly, the study compares human attention heatmaps with those generated by XAI models, revealing that XGradCAM and EigenCAM most closely align with human safety perceptual patterns, validating their reliability for future urban planning applications.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a computational framework that integrates eye-tracking technology with street view imagery and explainable AI models. Participants viewed street view images of Helsingborg, Sweden while their gaze patterns were recorded using eye-tracking systems. The eye-tracking data generated heatmaps showing which urban features captured human attention when perceiving safety. These human attention patterns were then compared with attention heatmaps generated by various XAI models, including GradCAM, XGradCAM, EigenCAM, and RISE. The comparison revealed which XAI models best align with human safety perception patterns.

## Key Results
- Identified key urban infrastructure and public space features that attract human attention when perceiving safe environments
- Found that open elements like the sky are less relevant to safety perception
- Revealed that XGradCAM and EigenCAM most closely align with human safety perceptual patterns among tested XAI models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by directly capturing human visual attention through eye-tracking technology while participants view street images, providing empirical data on what features humans actually focus on when assessing safety. By comparing these human attention patterns with AI-generated attention maps, the study can validate which explainable AI techniques best replicate human perceptual processes. This approach bridges the gap between computational safety assessments and actual human perceptual mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning
**Eye-Tracking Systems** - Why needed: To capture real-time human gaze patterns and attention focus when viewing urban environments. Quick check: Verify eye-tracker calibration accuracy and sampling rate.
**eXplainable AI (XAI)** - Why needed: To generate interpretable attention maps that can be compared with human attention data. Quick check: Ensure XAI models produce consistent attention heatmaps across similar inputs.
**Attention Heatmaps** - Why needed: To visualize and quantify which areas of urban scenes attract human attention. Quick check: Validate heatmap resolution and accuracy against ground truth gaze data.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Eye-Tracking System -> Street View Image Processing -> Human Attention Heatmap Generation -> XAI Model Application -> XAI Attention Heatmap Generation -> Comparison Analysis
**Critical Path:** Eye-tracking data collection -> Heatmap generation -> XAI model application -> Comparative analysis
**Design Tradeoffs:** The study prioritizes accuracy of human attention capture over sample size, using 20 participants with eye-tracking rather than larger surveys. This provides precise gaze data but may limit generalizability.
**Failure Signatures:** Mismatched attention patterns between human and AI heatmaps indicate model inadequacy; missing key safety-relevant features in either heatmap suggests important perceptual elements are overlooked.
**First Experiments:** 1) Validate eye-tracker calibration across participants, 2) Test consistency of human attention patterns across repeated viewings, 3) Compare baseline XAI models against simple saliency methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Geographic scope limited to Helsingborg, Sweden, potentially limiting generalizability to other urban contexts
- Sample size of 20 participants may not capture full diversity of human attention patterns across demographics
- Does not account for temporal variations in safety perception (day vs. night, seasonal changes)
- Relies on static street view images rather than dynamic, real-world environments

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** Identification of key urban infrastructure features that attract human attention when perceiving safe environments
**Medium Confidence:** Comparative analysis showing XGradCAM and EigenCAM most closely align with human safety perceptual patterns
**Medium Confidence:** Assertion that open elements like the sky are less relevant to safety perception

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study across multiple cities with diverse architectural styles, cultural contexts, and socioeconomic conditions to test generalizability
2. Conduct a longitudinal study incorporating temporal variations (different times of day, seasons) and dynamic street environments
3. Expand the participant pool to include diverse demographic groups (age, gender, cultural background, prior experiences) to determine whether attention patterns vary across populations
