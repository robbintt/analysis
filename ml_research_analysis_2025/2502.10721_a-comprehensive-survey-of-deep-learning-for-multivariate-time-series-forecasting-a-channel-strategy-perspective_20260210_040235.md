# A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Learning for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: A Channel Strategy Perspective

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.10721
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10721
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** First comprehensive survey organizing deep learning MTSF methods through a three-level taxonomy based on channel strategies (Independence, Dependence, Partiality)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of deep learning methods for multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) from a channel strategy perspective. The authors propose a novel three-level taxonomy organizing existing methods into Strategy (Channel Independence, Dependence, Partiality), Mechanism (transformer-based, CNN-based, GNN-based, etc.), and Characteristic (asymmetry, lagginess, group-wise). The survey systematically reviews state-of-the-art methods, analyzes their strengths and limitations, and provides insights for future research directions. A key finding is that Channel Partiality strategies often achieve superior performance by effectively balancing inter-channel dependencies and independence. The work includes an up-to-date GitHub repository (CS4TS) with all surveyed papers and their categorizations.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a systematic literature review approach to survey deep learning methods for MTSF, organizing them through a novel three-level taxonomy based on channel strategy. The authors identify and categorize existing methods according to their approach to handling inter-channel dependencies, distinguishing between strategies that treat channels independently, as a whole, or with partial consideration of dependencies. For each category, they analyze the underlying mechanisms (such as transformer architectures, convolutional networks, graph neural networks) and key characteristics (including asymmetry in channel relationships, temporal lagginess, and group-wise processing patterns). The survey synthesizes insights from 13 references to establish the proposed taxonomy and identify research gaps.

## Key Results
- Introduces the first comprehensive taxonomy for deep learning MTSF methods organized by channel strategy
- Identifies three primary strategy levels: Channel Independence, Channel Dependence, and Channel Partiality
- Proposes that Channel Partiality strategies often achieve the best performance by balancing inter-channel dependencies
- Creates CS4TS GitHub repository containing all surveyed papers and their categorizations
- Highlights that most existing methods fall into the Channel Dependence category, suggesting opportunities for Channel Partiality approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey reveals that the effectiveness of deep learning MTSF methods fundamentally depends on how they handle inter-channel dependencies in multivariate time series data. Channel Independence strategies work well when channels are largely uncorrelated but fail to capture important cross-channel relationships. Channel Dependence strategies capture all dependencies but may introduce noise and computational inefficiency. Channel Partiality strategies achieve optimal performance by selectively modeling relevant dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The mechanism works because real-world multivariate time series often exhibit structured dependencies where only certain channels influence others, and these dependencies may vary across time horizons.

## Foundational Learning

**Channel Strategy Concepts:**
*Why needed:* Understanding how methods handle inter-channel dependencies is crucial for effective MTSF.
*Quick check:* Can you identify whether a method treats channels independently, as a whole, or with partial consideration?

**Time Series Forecasting Fundamentals:**
*Why needed:* Core concepts like temporal dependencies, forecasting horizons, and error metrics are essential context.
*Quick check:* Can you explain the difference between short-term and long-term forecasting challenges?

**Deep Learning Mechanisms:**
*Why needed:* Knowledge of transformers, CNNs, and GNNs is necessary to understand method implementations.
*Quick check:* Can you describe how attention mechanisms differ from convolutional approaches in capturing temporal patterns?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Strategy Selection -> Mechanism Choice -> Characteristic Implementation -> Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves selecting an appropriate channel strategy, implementing the corresponding mechanism, and optimizing the key characteristics for the specific MTSF task. The strategy selection drives all downstream architectural decisions.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Independence offers computational efficiency but misses dependencies; Dependence captures all relationships but may overfit and be computationally expensive; Partiality balances accuracy and efficiency but requires careful dependency modeling. Mechanism choices involve tradeoffs between global context (transformers) and local patterns (CNNs), while characteristic choices affect model flexibility versus complexity.

**Failure Signatures:**
Over-reliance on Channel Independence leads to missed cross-channel patterns; excessive Channel Dependence causes overfitting and computational inefficiency; poorly designed Channel Partiality strategies may miss critical dependencies. Mechanism failures include transformer overfitting on short sequences or CNN inability to capture long-range dependencies.

**First Experiments:**
1. Apply taxonomy to classify 5-10 representative MTSF papers and assess classification consistency
2. Implement simple versions of Independence, Dependence, and Partiality strategies on a benchmark dataset
3. Compare computational complexity and forecasting accuracy across the three strategy types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Lacks extensive empirical validation comparing different channel strategies across diverse benchmark datasets
- Channel strategy definitions may have ambiguous boundaries leading to classification inconsistencies
- Temporal scope limitation as a survey paper may miss very recent advances in the rapidly evolving MTSF field

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The taxonomy structure (Strategy → Mechanism → Characteristic) is methodologically sound and provides a useful framework for organizing MTSF literature
- **Medium Confidence:** The characterization of each strategy's strengths and limitations is reasonable but would benefit from systematic empirical validation
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim about Channel Partiality achieving "best performance" is plausible but requires quantitative validation across standardized benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic experiments comparing Channel Independence, Dependence, and Partiality strategies on standardized MTSF benchmark datasets (e.g., ETT, Exchange, Traffic) across multiple forecasting horizons and error metrics
2. Apply the taxonomy to a subset of surveyed methods with multiple reviewers to assess inter-rater reliability and identify ambiguous cases requiring refinement
3. Validate the completeness and accuracy of the CS4TS repository by cross-checking against original papers and ensuring correct categorization according to the proposed taxonomy
