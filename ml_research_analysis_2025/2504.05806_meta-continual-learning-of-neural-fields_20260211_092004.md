# Meta-Continual Learning of Neural Fields

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.05806
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05806
- **Authors**: Seungyoon Woo; Junhyeog Yun; Gunhee Kim
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Combines modular architecture with meta-learning to prevent catastrophic forgetting while achieving rapid adaptation in neural field reconstruction.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Meta-Continual Learning of Neural Fields (MCL-NF), a framework that addresses catastrophic forgetting and slow convergence in continual learning of neural fields. The approach combines modular architecture with optimization-based meta-learning and introduces Fisher Information Maximization loss (FIM-NeRF) for sample prioritization. Experiments demonstrate superior reconstruction quality and speed across image, audio, video, and NeRF datasets, with particular effectiveness in resource-constrained environments like city-scale NeRF rendering.

## Method Summary
MCL-NF employs a modular architecture where each task gets its own sub-module initialized from a shared set of parameters. The framework uses MAML-style meta-learning where an outer loop optimizes the shared initialization across task distributions, while inner loops adapt individual modules to specific tasks. The FIM-NeRF loss modifies standard MSE by re-weighting samples based on Fisher Information Matrix, prioritizing informative data points. During meta-testing, new tasks are learned by initializing from the meta-learned parameters and adapting with FIM-NeRF, without further meta-updates.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates significantly improved learning speed while maintaining high-quality reconstruction
- Achieves rapid adaptation for city-scale NeRF rendering with reduced parameter requirements
- Outperforms existing methods across diverse datasets including image, audio, video, and NeRF modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spatial and Temporal Modularization
Modularization prevents catastrophic forgetting by isolating task-specific parameters while shared initialization enables knowledge transfer. Each task gets a separate sub-module with no parameter sharing during adaptation, but all modules are initialized from shared parameters optimized during meta-learning.

### Mechanism 2: Optimization-Based Meta-Learning for Rapid Adaptation
Meta-learning on task distributions produces an initialization that allows rapid convergence to new tasks with few gradient steps. The bi-level optimization learns initial weights that are "easy to learn from" across the task distribution.

### Mechanism 3: Fisher Information Maximization (FIM) Loss
Sample re-weighting based on Fisher Information guides the model to prioritize more informative data points. The FIM loss up-weights samples where gradients are large relative to parameter uncertainty, focusing learning on sensitive parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: The central problem MCL-NF solves - sequential training causes models to lose knowledge of previous tasks. Quick check: What happens to reconstruction quality of earlier tasks when sequentially training on new ones?

- **Meta-Learning / Learning-to-Learn**: The "Meta" in MCL-NF - learning an initialization that can be quickly adapted to new tasks. Quick check: What is being optimized in the outer loop - final weights for specific tasks or initial weights for any task?

- **Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)**: Core of FIM-Loss - measures curvature of loss landscape and information content of parameters/samples. Quick check: Does FIM penalize all parameters equally or re-weight individual data samples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: `θ_shared` (meta-learned shared initialization) → `f_θ_i` (task-specific sub-module) → `F(θ)` (Fisher Information Matrix) → `LFIM` (FIM loss function)

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Meta-Training: Iterate episodes of tasks, initialize modules from `θ_shared`, train with FIM, meta-update `θ_shared`
  2. Meta-Testing: Initialize new modules from learned `θ_shared`, adapt with FIM-NeRF
