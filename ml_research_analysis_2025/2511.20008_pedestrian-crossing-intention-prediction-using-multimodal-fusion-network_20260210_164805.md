# Pedestrian Crossing Intention Prediction Using Multimodal Fusion Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20008
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20008
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Multimodal fusion network (P-MFNet) achieves 70% accuracy on JAADbeh and 89% accuracy on JAADall datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multimodal fusion network (P-MFNet) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions using seven visual and motion modalities. The approach leverages Transformer-based feature extraction with depth-guided attention mechanisms and modality/temporal attention modules to integrate complementary cues across different modalities. P-MFNet significantly outperforms 12 baseline methods on both JAADbeh and JAADall datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining visual features (RGB, depth, semantic maps) with motion features (pose, bounding box, speed) for pedestrian intention prediction.

## Method Summary
P-MFNet processes seven modalities (local/global RGB, local/global depth, local/global semantic maps, pose keypoints, bounding box, ego-vehicle speed) across 16-frame observation windows. Visual features are extracted using ViT-Base, while motion features use a Transformer encoder. Depth-guided attention (DGA) enhances cross-modal spatial features through channel and spatial attention derived from depth information. Modality attention fusion (MAF) dynamically weights visual and motion features, and temporal attention fusion (TAF) uses Transformer self-attention to emphasize informative time steps. The fused features are passed through an MLP for binary classification of crossing intention.

## Key Results
- P-MFNet achieves 70% accuracy on JAADbeh and 89% accuracy on JAADall datasets
- Ablation study shows depth-guided attention and learned modality weighting each contribute 2% accuracy improvement
- Visual modalities contribute more than motion modalities, but both are complementary (visual-only drops 4%, motion-only drops 7-8%)
- Later frames (12-16) receive more attention weight, validating the importance of recent motion cues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Depth-Guided Attention for Cross-Modal Spatial Enhancement
Depth maps provide explicit distance priors that guide attention toward pedestrian-relevant regions in RGB and semantic features. By using channel and spatial attention derived from depth, the model highlights areas where pedestrians are likely located, improving region selection for actionable cues.

### Mechanism 2: Learned Modality Weighting via Attention
Dynamically weighting modalities per time step captures context-dependent importance through the Modality Attention Fusion module. This allows the model to emphasize pose information for ambiguous postures or global context for traffic-heavy scenes, rather than using fixed fusion weights.

### Mechanism 3: Temporal Attention Captures Late-Frame Importance
The Temporal Attention Fusion module uses multi-head self-attention over the 16-frame sequence, learning that later frames carry disproportionately more information about imminent crossing intention. This late-frame bias aligns with the observation that crossing intentions manifest more strongly in recent motion cues.

## Foundational Learning

- **Vision Transformer (ViT) basics**
  - Why needed: P-MFNet uses ViT-Base pretrained on ImageNet for all visual modalities
  - Quick check: Can you explain how ViT processes a 224×224 image into a sequence of tokens?

- **Attention mechanisms (self-attention, cross-attention, scaled dot-product)**
  - Why needed: DGA, MAF, and TAF all rely on attention mechanisms for feature fusion
  - Quick check: Given query, key, value matrices, write the scaled dot-product attention formula and explain why scaling by √d_k matters.

- **Multimodal fusion paradigms (early vs. late fusion, attention-based fusion)**
  - Why needed: P-MFNet fuses seven modalities with attention at multiple stages
  - Quick check: What are the trade-offs between early fusion (concatenating raw inputs) vs. late fusion (merging high-level features)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input (7 modalities, 16 frames) -> Visual Branch (ViT-Base) + Motion Branch (Transformer) -> DGA (pairwise fusion) -> MAF (modality weighting) -> TAF (temporal attention) -> MLP -> Binary classification

- **Critical path:**
  1. Ensure all 7 modalities are correctly preprocessed and co-registered
  2. DGA module requires aligned depth-RGB pairs for attention guidance
  3. MAF output feeds TAF; modality attention weights must be learned properly

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - ViT vs. CNN backbone: ViT improves accuracy by 4-5% but increases compute
  - Transformer vs. GRU for motion: Transformer yields 1-3% gain but adds overhead
  - Number of modalities: Visual-only drops 4%, motion-only drops 7-8%; both needed

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Uniform modality attention weights: May indicate insufficient training diversity
  - Temporal attention flat across frames: May suggest sequence too short or learning rate too low
  - Drops with missing depth input: Confirms depth is critical for attention guidance

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run P-MFNet on single sample; visualize DGA attention maps to confirm depth highlights pedestrian regions
  2. Replicate ablation (V3/V4) on held-out split to verify complementary information claim
  3. Extract temporal attention weights; verify late-frame bias or inspect learning rate if not present

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can P-MFNet be optimized for real-time inference on resource-constrained embedded systems without significantly degrading prediction accuracy?
- How does depth-guided attention perform when depth estimation fails or produces noisy outputs in adverse environmental conditions?
- Does the multimodal fusion strategy generalize to different cultural traffic contexts and pedestrian behaviors found in other standard datasets?

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to JAAD dataset; no cross-dataset generalization tests performed
- No sensitivity analysis for depth quality or robustness to missing/degraded modalities
- Unspecified batch size and epoch count may affect reproducibility

## Confidence
- High: Accuracy gains over baselines are well-supported by quantitative results
- Medium: Depth-guided attention and temporal late-frame focus are plausible but not uniquely validated
- Low: No error analysis for failure cases or robustness checks for challenging conditions

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset test**: Evaluate P-MFNet on PIE or Waymo Open Dataset to assess generalization beyond JAAD
2. **Depth robustness test**: Train with synthetic depth noise or occlusions to verify depth-guided attention degrades gracefully
3. **Ablation of late-frame bias**: Shuffle frame order in 16-frame sequence to test whether temporal attention exploits order or intensity patterns
