# ASTIF: Adaptive Semantic-Temporal Integration for Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.18661
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18661
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** Dual-channel semantic-temporal integration with confidence-aware meta-learning achieves 7.2% to 59.0% MAE reduction versus leading deep learning and Transformer baselines across cryptocurrency and technology stock datasets.

## Executive Summary
ASTIF addresses cryptocurrency price forecasting by integrating semantic market understanding with temporal pattern recognition through a confidence-based meta-learning framework. The method combines a dual-channel Small Language Model that processes numerical price sequences and semantic market indices, a hybrid LSTM-RF temporal predictor, and a confidence-aware meta-learner that dynamically weights predictions based on real-time uncertainty. Experimental evaluation on AI-focused cryptocurrencies and technology stocks from 2020-2024 shows ASTIF outperforms leading deep learning and Transformer baselines, achieving MAE reductions of 7.2% to 59.0% across assets. Ablation studies confirm the critical importance of semantic processing and temporal modeling, with their removal causing 653% and 596% increases in prediction error respectively. The framework demonstrates superior performance particularly in volatile cryptocurrency markets where traditional static architectures fail.

## Method Summary
ASTIF integrates semantic market understanding with temporal pattern recognition through a dual-channel Small Language Model (SLM) and hybrid LSTM-RF temporal predictor, coordinated by a confidence-aware meta-learner. The SLM processes numerical price sequences (w=8, 6-decimal precision) and semantic market indices (panic, sentiment, GEPU) through structured prompts, producing confidence-weighted predictions across K=3 overlapping windows. A 3-layer LSTM (64→32→16) and Random Forest (100 trees, depth 20) jointly model temporal patterns, with their outputs combined as 0.7×LSTM + 0.3×RF. The meta-learner, a Random Forest classifier (20 estimators, depth 5), dynamically selects between semantic and temporal channels based on confidence, uncertainty, and market context features. All predictions are constrained to [0,1] with maximum single-step changes limited to 0.5.

## Key Results
- ASTIF achieves 7.2% to 59.0% MAE reduction versus leading deep learning and Transformer baselines across AI-focused cryptocurrencies and technology stocks
- Ablation studies show 653% and 596% error increases when removing semantic processing and temporal modeling respectively
- Confidence-aware meta-learning successfully mitigates risk by shifting reliance between channels during market turbulence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Channel Semantic-Temporal Decomposition
Processing numerical price sequences and semantic market indices through separate computational pathways preserves contextual information that feature concatenation destroys. The MirrorPrompt architecture encodes price sequences via a numeric channel N(p_t-w:t) with 6-decimal precision while a semantic channel S(c_t) transforms market indices into natural language narratives. The SLM processes both through structured prompts, enabling it to reason about "rising panic index amid regulatory concerns" rather than treating sentiment as a scalar feature. Predictions from K=3 overlapping windows are aggregated via confidence-weighted averaging.

### Mechanism 2: Confidence-Calibrated Meta-Learning for Dynamic Model Selection
A meta-learner trained on prediction confidence, uncertainty, and market context can adaptively arbitrate between semantic and temporal predictors, reducing error during regime transitions where static architectures fail. A Random Forest classifier receives a 12-dimensional feature vector comprising confidences, uncertainties, inter-model disagreement, volatility, trend strength, recent accuracies, and price momentum. The meta-learner outputs P(SLM|z_t) and applies regime-dependent calibration that caps confidence at 0.85.

### Mechanism 3: Uncertainty Quantification via Model Disagreement
Inter-model disagreement provides a reliable proxy for prediction uncertainty, enabling conservative forecasting during ambiguous market conditions. Uncertainty is derived from two sources: SLM self-reported confidence and ML disagreement, with inter-channel disagreement feeding into meta-features. High disagreement triggers either model switching or conservative prediction capping via sanity checks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sequence Modeling with LSTM Networks**
  - **Why needed here:** The temporal predictor uses a 3-layer LSTM (64→32→16) to capture long-range dependencies in price movements. Understanding cell dynamics is essential for debugging temporal feature extraction.
  - **Quick check question:** Given input sequence length L=10 and feature dimension d, what shape does the hidden state ht have at each layer?

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering for Numerical Reasoning**
  - **Why needed here:** MirrorPrompt converts numerical data into structured text that the SLM can reason about. The quality of this transformation directly affects semantic channel performance.
  - **Quick check question:** If price p_t = 0.4523 (MinMax-scaled) and you need 6-decimal precision, how should this be represented in the numeric channel prompt to preserve microstructure information?

- **Concept: Meta-Learning for Model Selection**
  - **Why needed here:** The meta-learner must learn to select predictors based on confidence features rather than fixed rules. Understanding how ground-truth labels are generated clarifies what the meta-learner optimizes for.
  - **Quick check question:** If at timestep t, MAE_SLM(t) < MAE_ML(t), what label should be assigned to the meta-learner's training example for z_t?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Critical path:** Feature engineering → MinMax scaling → parallel processing through SLM and LSTM-RF → confidence/uncertainty computation → meta-learner feature vector construction → predictor selection → sanity validation → output

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - SLM vs larger LLM: Gemma-3-1b-it chosen for computational efficiency; Assumption: smaller model with structured prompts sufficient for financial reasoning
  - Window size w=8: Balances context depth vs overfitting; w=12 degrades performance 42-47%
  - Conservative meta-learner (depth=5): Prevents overfitting at cost of selection granularity
  - Fixed LSTM-RF weights (0.7/0.3): Based on experimental validation; could be adaptive

- **Failure signatures:**
  - SLM timeout (>30s): Check prompt length, API connectivity
  - Predictions outside [0,1]: MinMax scaling violation, check input normalization
  - Meta-learner accuracy < 60%: Insufficient training episodes (need |E| ≥ 50), feature drift
  - High channel disagreement with low error reduction: Both predictors may be wrong in same direction
  - Ablation shows >500% MAE increase when removing single component: Check for cascading failures

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Train LSTM-RF temporal predictor alone on single asset (e.g., FET) with given hyperparameters. Verify MAE ≈ 0.034. This validates data pipeline and temporal modeling.
  2. **Ablation probe:** Remove SLM semantic channel and measure MAE increase. Expect ~545-758% degradation per Table 3. This confirms semantic channel contribution.
  3. **Meta-learner sanity check:** Force meta-learner to always select SLM vs always select ML on held-out test period. Compare to adaptive selection to verify meta-learner adds value beyond either fixed choice.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Automated Prompt Optimization:** Can reinforcement learning or other automated methods replace manual prompt engineering in the MirrorPrompt framework while maintaining forecasting accuracy? (Current framework relies on template-driven text generation requiring expert-crafted prompts)
- **Multi-Step Forecasting:** Can ASTIF be extended to multi-step forecasting horizons while preserving its adaptive confidence-weighting advantages? (Current framework only produces single-step forecasts)
- **Cross-Domain Generalizability:** How does ASTIF performance transfer to emerging cryptocurrency tokens with limited historical data or alternative asset classes such as commodities and forex? (Evaluation focuses on specific cryptocurrency and equity assets, limiting generalizability)

## Limitations

- **Template Dependency:** The MirrorPrompt approach depends critically on prompt engineering quality, yet the paper provides no examples of the actual prompts used
- **Meta-learner Ground Truth:** The paper states that meta-learner training uses "retrospective comparison" of MAE values but doesn't specify the temporal window for this comparison
- **Cross-Asset Generalizability:** Strong performance across 7 assets (5 cryptocurrencies + 2 stocks) limits claims about universal applicability to truly out-of-distribution markets

## Confidence

**High Confidence (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)**
- Dual-channel processing structure improves over single-channel approaches (59.0% MAE reduction in ablation)
- Meta-learner provides meaningful improvement over fixed predictor selection (285% error increase when removed)
- Uncertainty quantification through model disagreement is valuable (327% error increase when removed)

**Medium Confidence (⭐⭐⭐⭐)**
- Specific performance numbers on the 7 assets tested (depends on exact data preprocessing and prompt templates)
- Optimal hyperparameter choices (window sizes, network depths, ensemble weights)
- Calibration accuracy claims (requires exact implementation of regime-dependent calibration)

**Low Confidence (⭐⭐)**
- Claims about computational efficiency advantages over larger LLMs (no runtime comparison provided)
- Generalizability to non-technology markets (only 7 technology-focused assets tested)
- Real-time deployment viability (no latency analysis beyond LLM timeout threshold)

## Next Checks

**Check 1: Prompt Template Validation**
Implement and test multiple MirrorPrompt templates with the Gemma-3-1b-it model. Measure how template variations affect semantic channel MAE. Start with a basic template converting price sequences to narrative and market indices to sentiment. Compare performance to the claimed 59.0% improvement baseline.

**Check 2: Meta-Learner Label Generation**
Experiment with different retrospective windows for computing MAE-based labels. Test immediate next-step comparison vs 3-day vs 7-day rolling windows. Measure how label generation strategy affects meta-learner accuracy and overall framework performance.

**Check 3: Out-of-Distribution Asset Testing**
Apply the trained ASTIF framework to a portfolio of non-technology assets (commodities, traditional equities, forex pairs). Measure performance degradation and identify whether the semantic channel's market index interpretation generalizes beyond technology markets.
