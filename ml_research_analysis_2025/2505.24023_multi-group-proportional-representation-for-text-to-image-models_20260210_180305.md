# Multi-Group Proportional Representation for Text-to-Image Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24023
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24023
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces MPR framework to measure and mitigate representational harms in text-to-image models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR) as a theoretically grounded framework for measuring and mitigating representational harms in text-to-image generative models. MPR evaluates the worst-case deviation of representation statistics across intersectional demographic groups, allowing flexible measurement based on user requirements and context-specific reference distributions. The authors develop an algorithm to optimize text-to-image models using MPR as a training objective, demonstrating that MPR-based fine-tuning achieves more balanced demographic representation across multiple attributes compared to existing debiasing methods while maintaining image quality.

## Method Summary
The MPR framework measures representational fairness by computing the worst-case deviation between generated image demographics and reference distributions across intersectional groups. The method uses CLIP embeddings with trained linear classifiers to detect gender, age, and race attributes from generated images. For optimization, the authors implement an algorithm that combines the MPR objective with image quality preservation using LoRA fine-tuning on text encoders. The approach includes FIFO buffers to store generated images and critical functions for efficient computation during training, with experiments demonstrating effectiveness across multiple diffusion models and prompt types.

## Key Results
- MPR-based fine-tuning achieves more balanced demographic representation across gender, age, and race compared to FairDiffusion, UCE, and ITI-GEN baselines
- CLIP scores remain above 0.3 across all concepts, indicating preserved image quality during MPR optimization
- The framework successfully quantifies representational disparities in professions, traits, and disability portrayal while scaling to complex intersectional groups

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MPR works by optimizing the worst-case deviation between generated image demographics and reference distributions across intersectional groups. The framework uses CLIP embeddings with trained linear classifiers to detect demographic attributes, then computes the supremum over a function class C to identify the most underrepresented group. By fine-tuning text-to-image models to minimize this worst-case deviation while preserving image quality through CLIP and DINO similarity objectives, MPR ensures balanced representation without sacrificing generation quality.

## Foundational Learning
**CLIP Embeddings**: Pre-trained vision-language embeddings that map images to a shared semantic space with text. Why needed: Provides a common representation space for attribute classification and image quality preservation. Quick check: Verify cosine similarity between CLIP embeddings of generated and reference images.

**Linear Classifiers on CLIP Space**: Trained probes that detect demographic attributes from CLIP embeddings. Why needed: Enables attribute detection without retraining on image data. Quick check: Evaluate classification accuracy on held-out FairFace test set.

**Function Class C**: Set of bounded linear functions or binary decision trees used to identify critical demographic subgroups. Why needed: Defines the space over which the supremum (worst-case) is computed. Quick check: Verify function class covers all possible demographic attribute combinations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text prompts → SD model → CLIP embeddings → Attribute classifiers → MPR computation → LoRA fine-tuning → Improved SD model

**Critical Path**: Prompt generation → Image synthesis → Face detection → Attribute classification → MPR calculation → Gradient update → Model fine-tuning

**Design Tradeoffs**: The paper balances representational fairness (MPR optimization) against image quality preservation (CLIP/DINO objectives), using λ=0.5 to weight these competing goals. Function class depth (1-3) trades computational complexity against representational granularity.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Gradient instability during optimization indicates problematic function class selection
- Image quality degradation suggests excessive focus on MPR objective
- Face detection failures create systematic bias in attribute estimation

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Train attribute classifiers on FairFace CLIP embeddings and evaluate accuracy
2. Generate baseline images with vanilla SD and compute initial MPR values
3. Implement Algorithm 1 with small buffer sizes to verify gradient computation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: How can demographic attribute estimation be improved to avoid perpetuating harmful categorization practices while maintaining the reliability needed for MPR computation? The paper acknowledges that binary classification of complex social identities oversimplifies human diversity and risks reinforcing problematic societal categorizations.

**Open Question 2**: What systematic methods can determine context-appropriate reference distributions for different social and historical contexts? The paper uses FairFace as a default balanced reference and manually constructs contextual references, but provides no systematic methodology for reference selection.

**Open Question 3**: How does MPR-based debiasing affect model performance across intersectional groups that were not explicitly included in the fine-tuning objective? The paper demonstrates optimization for specific attributes but doesn't evaluate generalization to unseen intersectional combinations.

## Limitations
- Limited practical implementation details for critical components, particularly gradient computation through supremum operation
- Heavy dependence on choice of function class C and reference distribution with limited guidance for selection
- Face detection with Dlib may introduce bias if detection rates vary across demographic groups, but detection rates are not reported

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical formulation of MPR as worst-case deviation metric is sound
- **Medium confidence**: MPR-based fine-tuning achieves more balanced representation, but evaluation methodology has gaps
- **Low confidence**: Scalability claims to complex intersectional groups lack quantitative evidence

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test gradient computation through supremum operation in Algorithm 1, comparing against reference technique [59]
2. Run ablation studies varying function class depth and buffer sizes to determine impact on optimization stability
3. Conduct face detection rate analysis across demographic groups using Dlib to quantify potential detection bias
