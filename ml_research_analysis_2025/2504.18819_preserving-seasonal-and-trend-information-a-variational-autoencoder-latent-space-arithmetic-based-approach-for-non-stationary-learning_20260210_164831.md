# Preserving Seasonal and Trend Information: A Variational Autoencoder-Latent Space Arithmetic Based Approach for Non-stationary Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.18819
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18819
- Reference count: 0
- Best RMSE achieved: 0.9721 (BLSTM model on DJIA dataset)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of applying AI models to non-stationary time series data while preserving critical trend and seasonal information. Traditional approaches that remove non-stationarity often lose valuable temporal patterns, degrading predictive performance. The proposed method uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Latent Space Arithmetic (LSA) to enforce stationarity within the latent space while maintaining trend and seasonal components through embedding storage and reconstruction.

The approach combines time-series decomposition, differencing, and LSA to store seasonal patterns as embeddings and reconstruct complete time series with controlled trend and seasonal contributions. When evaluated on DJIA and Nifty-50 datasets using RMSE as the performance metric, the method achieved competitive results compared to state-of-the-art techniques, with the best model (BLSTM) achieving an RMSE of 0.9721. The approach successfully stationarized latent representations while maintaining temporal dependencies, demonstrating improved predictive performance when trend and seasonal information were preserved.

## Method Summary
The proposed two-phase approach first decomposes the data using time-series decomposition (assumed STL with additive model) to extract the seasonal component. A VAE is trained exclusively on the seasonal component to capture periodic patterns, storing one period of seasonal embeddings (Sne). In Phase 2, a second VAE is trained on the full non-stationary data. For each sample, the latent representation z is decomposed, and the seasonal component is refined by matching to the nearest Sne embedding via distance calculation. Differencing is applied to obtain stationary latent codes, and reconstruction is performed via LSA: zstr = zstationary + φ·zsn + γ·ztr. The resulting stationary latent features are used to train prediction models (DNN, LSTM, BLSTM, GRU), with BLSTM achieving the best performance (RMSE = 0.9721).

## Key Results
- Best model (BLSTM) achieved RMSE of 0.9721 on DJIA dataset
- Method successfully stationarized latent representations while preserving temporal dependencies
- Competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques on both DJIA and Nifty-50 datasets
- ADF test used to verify stationarity of latent representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Storing seasonal patterns as embeddings from a single period enables accurate seasonal component recovery after stationarization.
- **Mechanism:** Phase 1 trains VAE exclusively on the seasonal component (not the full series), capturing periodic patterns as latent embeddings. These embeddings serve as a codebook that can be referenced during reconstruction, allowing the model to recover the seasonal component even after the latent space has been stationarized through differencing.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Latent Space Arithmetic (LSA) enables controlled reconstruction of non-stationary time series from stationary latent representations.
- **Mechanism:** The LSA formula zstr = zstationary + φ·zsn + γ·ztr allows the model to add back trend and seasonal components to the stationary latent code. The coefficients φ and γ control the contribution of each component, enabling the model to balance stationarity enforcement with information preservation.

## Foundational Learning

### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- **Why needed:** VAEs learn compressed latent representations while enforcing a prior distribution (typically Gaussian), which helps in extracting meaningful features from complex time series data.
- **Quick check:** Verify the VAE architecture includes convolutional layers and produces a latent space of appropriate dimension (k=4 in this case).

### Time-Series Decomposition
- **Why needed:** Decomposing time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components allows separate treatment of each component, preserving seasonal patterns while stationarizing the rest.
- **Quick check:** Confirm the decomposition method (STL) and additive model assumption are appropriate for the financial datasets used.

### Latent Space Arithmetic (LSA)
- **Why needed:** LSA provides a mechanism to reconstruct non-stationary time series from stationary latent representations by adding back trend and seasonal components with controlled coefficients.
- **Quick check:** Verify the LSA formula implementation correctly combines stationary, seasonal, and trend components with appropriate scaling factors.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
- Data -> Time-Series Decomposition -> Phase 1 VAE (Seasonal Training) -> Seasonal Embeddings (Sne)
- Data -> Phase 2 VAE (Full Training) -> Latent Encoding -> Seasonal Matching -> Differencing -> LSA Reconstruction -> Stationary Latent Features
- Stationary Latent Features -> Prediction Model (DNN/LSTM/BLSTM/GRU) -> RMSE Evaluation

### Critical Path
1. Time-series decomposition to extract seasonal component
2. Phase 1 VAE training on seasonal component only
3. Phase 2 VAE training on full non-stationary data
4. Seasonal component matching and differencing in latent space
5. LSA reconstruction to obtain stationary latent features
6. Training prediction model on stationary latent features

### Design Tradeoffs
- Latent dimension (k=4) vs. information preservation: Smaller dimensions may lose temporal dependencies, while larger ones may fail to achieve stationarity
- Manual vs. learned φ and γ coefficients: Fixed values simplify implementation but may not be optimal across datasets
- Single vs. multiple seasonal embeddings: The approach assumes unimodal seasonality, which may not capture complex seasonal patterns

### Failure Signatures
- Non-stationary latent vectors after Phase 2 (diagnosed via ADF test p-values > 0.05)
- Poor reconstruction or high RMSE (may indicate incorrect seasonal period identification or inappropriate φ/γ scaling)
- Information loss during differencing (diagnosed by comparing latent representations before and after stationarization)

### 3 First Experiments
1. Train Phase 1 VAE on seasonal component only and verify that Sne captures one full seasonal period
2. Apply Phase 2 VAE to full data and check that differencing produces stationary latent vectors (ADF test)
3. Train BLSTM predictor on stationary latent features and evaluate RMSE on test set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the proposed VAE-LSA method generalize to non-financial time series domains with different seasonal characteristics?
- **Basis in paper:** The evaluation is limited to two financial datasets (DJIA and Nifty-50 stock market data), both exhibiting similar price-based seasonal patterns.
- **Why unresolved:** Financial time series have domain-specific seasonality (e.g., quarterly earnings cycles, trading calendar effects) that may not represent patterns in meteorological, medical, or industrial IoT data where the method could be applied.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmark the method on diverse non-stationary datasets (e.g., electricity consumption, weather data, physiological signals) and report whether competitive RMSE is maintained across domains.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What is the optimal latent space dimension (k) for balancing stationarity enforcement with information preservation?
- **Basis in paper:** The latent dimension is fixed at k=4 without ablation study or justification for this choice.
- **Why unresolved:** A smaller latent space may lose critical temporal dependencies, while a larger one may fail to achieve stationarity. The optimal dimension likely depends on dataset complexity and the number of underlying seasonal frequencies.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Conduct systematic ablation experiments varying k (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) and analyze trade-offs between ADF test p-values, reconstruction error, and downstream prediction RMSE.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the seasonal (φ) and trend (γ) coefficients be learned adaptively rather than manually specified?
- **Basis in paper:** Tables VI and VII show that predictive performance varies with different φ and γ values, yet the paper uses fixed values (1.0, 1.0) without exploring optimization strategies.
- **Why unresolved:** The optimal contribution of trend and seasonal components may vary across datasets, prediction horizons, or even change over time within the same non-stationary series.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Implement learnable φ and γ parameters (e.g., via gradient-based optimization or attention mechanisms) and compare performance against grid-searched fixed values.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does the method perform on time series with multiple overlapping seasonal patterns at different frequencies?
- **Basis in paper:** The approach extracts a single seasonal period T and stores embeddings for one repeated pattern, assuming unimodal seasonality.
- **Why unresolved:** Many real-world series exhibit hierarchical seasonality (e.g., hourly, daily, and weekly cycles in energy demand). A single seasonal embedding may inadequately capture such multi-scale patterns.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Test on datasets with known multiple seasonal periods (e.g., electricity load, traffic flow) and extend the method to extract and store multiple seasonal embeddings at different frequencies.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two financial datasets, limiting generalizability to other non-stationary time series domains
- Critical implementation details unspecified (time-series decomposition parameters, seasonal matching method, differencing implementation)
- Assumes unimodal seasonality without addressing multi-scale seasonal patterns common in real-world data
- Fixed latent dimension (k=4) and manual φ/γ coefficients without ablation studies or adaptive optimization

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** The core mechanism of using VAE to stationarize latent representations while preserving trend and seasonal information through embedding storage and reconstruction is well-founded and logically sound. The RMSE improvement over baseline methods is clearly demonstrated.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that preserving trend and seasonal information improves predictive performance assumes that these components contain meaningful signal rather than noise, which may not hold for all non-stationary time series. The ADF test results for stationarity verification are mentioned but specific p-values are not provided.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the approach to non-financial time series with different seasonal patterns, noise characteristics, or periodicity lengths is uncertain given the limited evaluation scope.

## Next Checks
1. Apply the methodology to non-financial time series (e.g., weather data, energy consumption) with varying seasonal patterns and periodicity lengths to assess robustness across domains.

2. Systematically remove trend preservation, seasonal preservation, or both to quantify the exact contribution of each component to predictive performance and determine if the improvements are additive or interactive.

3. Visualize and quantify information loss during differencing operations by comparing latent representations before and after stationarization, and test whether long-term dependencies are preserved in the stationary latent space.
