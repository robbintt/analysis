# Hybrid Voting-Based Task Assignment in Role-Playing Games

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.18690
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18690
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** VBTA is a framework that integrates structured task descriptions with voting-based agent allocation and LLM-driven semantic reasoning to improve task assignment in RPGs.

## Executive Summary
VBTA is a framework that integrates structured task descriptions with voting-based agent allocation and LLM-driven semantic reasoning to improve task assignment in RPGs. It assigns capability profiles to agents and task descriptions to tasks, generating a suitability matrix to quantify alignment. Six voting methods and conflict-based search (CBS) guide task allocation and path planning. The framework enhances immersion by automating dynamic narrative, dialogue, and combat scenarios. Preliminary use cases in Dungeons & Dragons and Baldur's Gate 3 show promise for procedural generation and replayability, though quantitative metrics are not yet reported.

## Method Summary
VBTA constructs a suitability matrix that quantitatively evaluates the compatibility between agents and tasks by comparing capability profiles with task descriptions. Six voting methods and three allocation strategies resolve conflicts when multiple agents are suited to multiple tasks. An LLM provides semantic reasoning for ambiguous pairings. CBS handles path and action planning after assignment. The framework is designed to improve dynamic task allocation in RPGs for better immersion and replayability.

## Key Results
- VBTA integrates structured profiles, voting-based allocation, LLM semantic reasoning, and CBS path planning for RPG task assignment
- Preliminary use cases in Dungeons & Dragons and Baldur's Gate 3 demonstrate potential for procedural generation
- No quantitative metrics reported; current focus is on simulation-based evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Suitability Matrix with Multi-Voting Allocation
- Claim: The suitability matrix combined with multiple voting methods may reduce misallocation of agents to tasks by quantitatively comparing capabilities against requirements and resolving conflicts through aggregated preferences.
- Mechanism: Capability profiles for each agent and task descriptions for each task are compared. A suitability matrix scores alignment. When top candidates compete for multiple tasks, six voting methods and three allocation strategies aggregate preferences to resolve conflicts and distribute assignments.
- Core assumption: Agent capability profiles and task descriptions can be encoded with sufficient fidelity to enable meaningful quantitative comparison.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "VBTA assigns capability profiles to agents and task descriptions to tasks, generating a suitability matrix to quantify alignment. Six voting methods... guide task allocation."
  - [section III] "VBTA constructs a suitability matrix that quantitatively evaluates the compatibility between agents and tasks... employs a robust voting and allocation mechanism... leveraging six distinct voting methods along with three allocation strategies."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related work on multi-agent reasoning (MARSHAL, LERO) discusses credit assignment but does not validate voting-based allocation in RPG contexts.
- Break condition: If capability profile attributes are incomplete or tasks require emergent skills not captured in profiles, the matrix scores become unreliable.

### Mechanism 2: LLM-Based Semantic Resolution for Ambiguous Assignments
- Claim: An LLM can resolve ambiguous agent-task pairings where structured profiles lack clear compatibility signals by inferring semantic connections.
- Mechanism: When voting alone cannot determine assignment, a pre-trained LLM is prompted with the task description and agent profile. The LLM uses semantic reasoning to infer whether the agent can satisfactorily complete the task despite unclear compatibility in structured attributes.
- Core assumption: The LLM's world knowledge and semantic understanding generalize sufficiently to the game domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLM-driven semantic reasoning to improve task assignment... resolving uncertainties by inferring deeper semantic connections."
  - [section III] "The LLM utilizes its semantic understanding to interpret subtle nuances in both the task descriptions and agent profiles, thereby refining the suitability assessment."
  - [corpus] Weak; corpus neighbors do not directly validate LLM semantic resolution for RPG task assignment.
- Break condition: If LLM prompts are poorly constructed or domain-specific jargon is misunderstood, semantic resolution may produce incorrect inferences.

### Mechanism 3: Conflict-Based Search for Path and Action Planning
- Claim: CBS integration may improve agent coordination by computing conflict-free paths or action sequences after task assignment.
- Mechanism: Once tasks are assigned, CBS plans optimal paths (spatial routes or abstract action sequences) while avoiding conflicts between agents. This extends beyond physical movement to strategic plans in combat, dialogue, or trade scenarios.
- Core assumption: Game states can be represented as search spaces with well-defined constraints and conflict conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Conflict-based search (CBS) guide task allocation and path planning."
  - [section III] "VBTA simulates the agents' path planning to their designated tasks using CBS... facilitates efficient route planning for task execution but also demonstrates the framework's potential to handle more complex scenarios."
  - [corpus] Weak; CBS is a known multi-agent pathfinding algorithm but application to abstract game-state planning in RPGs is not validated in corpus.
- Break condition: If game state spaces are large, partially observable, or dynamically changing faster than CBS can replan, performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Suitability Matrix Construction
  - Why needed here: This is the core representation comparing agents to tasks. Understanding how to construct, normalize, and aggregate these scores is prerequisite to implementing VBTA.
  - Quick check question: Given three agents with capability vectors and two tasks with requirement vectors, can you compute a 3x2 suitability matrix using a defined similarity function?

- Concept: Multi-Voting Aggregation Methods
  - Why needed here: When agents are suited to multiple tasks, voting methods determine final allocation. Understanding plurality, Borda count, or other social choice mechanisms is necessary.
  - Quick check question: If Agent A is ranked first for Task 1 by 4 voting methods and second for Task 2 by 5 voting methods, which task should Agent A receive under a Borda-style aggregation?

- Concept: Conflict-Based Search (CBS)
  - Why needed here: CBS computes collision-free paths for multiple agents. Understanding constraint trees, conflict detection, and replanning is needed to integrate CBS with VBTA.
  - Quick check question: For two agents navigating a 2D grid with a single shared corridor, how does CBS detect and resolve a conflict when both agents need to occupy the same cell at the same timestep?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Profile Encoder -> Suitability Matrix Generator -> Voting/Allocation Engine -> (if ambiguous) LLM Semantic Resolver -> CBS Planner -> Game State Interface
- Critical path: Profile Encoding → Suitability Matrix → Voting/Allocation → (if ambiguous) LLM Resolution → CBS Planning → Game State Update
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity of capability profiles: More attributes increase matrix accuracy but raise encoding cost and LLM prompt complexity.
  - Voting method selection: Different methods favor different allocation outcomes; combining all six may smooth bias but increases compute.
  - LLM integration point: Resolving only ambiguous cases reduces API cost but may miss edge cases; using LLM for all assignments increases consistency but is expensive.
- Failure signatures:
  - Agent consistently assigned to tasks outside its competence: Indicates profile encoding mismatch or voting aggregation bias.
  - CBS timeout or no path found: Suggests conflicting constraints or unreachable goal states; check game state representation.
  - LLM responses do not address prompt focus: Prompt construction may be too vague or contain ambiguous references.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Unit test suitability matrix generation with synthetic agents and tasks of known compatibility; verify scoring aligns with expected rankings.
  2. Run voting allocation on a scenario with 5 agents and 5 tasks where the top 2 agents are best suited for all tasks; observe how voting methods distribute assignments.
  3. Integrate CBS on a simple 2D grid map with 3 agents and 3 target locations; verify conflict-free paths and measure planning time.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What quantitative metrics best capture VBTA's effectiveness at task assignment and player immersion in RPGs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Abstract states "quantitative metrics are not yet reported"; Conclusion notes "Current work is focused on evaluating VBTA's performance in simulation."
- Why unresolved: The authors present only preliminary use cases with Dungeons & Dragons and Baldur's Gate 3, without formal evaluation methodology or baseline comparisons.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments measuring task assignment accuracy, player immersion scores, narrative coherence ratings, and comparison against existing PCG methods like SceneCraft or Calypso.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the six voting methods compare in performance across different RPG scenarios (combat, dialogue, exploration)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions "six distinct voting methods" and "three allocation strategies" but provides no analysis of when each method is optimal or how they differ in outcomes.
- Why unresolved: No ablation studies or comparative analysis of voting methods are presented; the framework treats them as interchangeable without justification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation experiments isolating each voting method across standardized scenarios, reporting assignment quality and computational cost.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can VBTA scale to game environments with hundreds of concurrent agents and tasks without unacceptable latency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The suitability matrix requires computing scores for every agent-task pair, and CBS path planning has known computational complexity; neither scalability nor real-time performance is addressed.
- Why unresolved: Use cases involve small-scale scenarios; no complexity analysis or large-scale testing is reported.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks measuring assignment latency and path planning time as agent/task counts increase, with defined acceptable thresholds for real-time gameplay.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does LLM selection (model size, architecture, prompting strategy) affect VBTA's semantic resolution quality and consistency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper references "a pre-trained LLM" and "ChatGPT" but does not specify which model is used, how prompts are optimized, or whether model choice impacts narrative coherence.
- Why unresolved: LLM behavior is known to vary significantly across models and prompt formulations; this sensitivity is unexamined.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative tests across multiple LLMs with standardized prompts, measuring semantic resolution accuracy and narrative consistency.

## Limitations
- Six specific voting methods and three allocation strategies are not named or described, preventing exact replication
- Suitability matrix scoring formula is not specified, making it unclear how to quantify alignment between profiles and tasks
- No quantitative performance metrics are reported, making efficacy claims hard to verify
- LLM integration point and prompt design are underspecified

## Confidence
- **High**: The conceptual framework of combining structured profiles, suitability matrices, voting-based allocation, and CBS is coherent and methodologically sound.
- **Medium**: Preliminary use cases in D&D and Baldur's Gate 3 demonstrate potential, but lack quantitative evidence.
- **Low**: LLM semantic resolution and CBS path planning in abstract RPG scenarios are speculative without detailed validation.

## Next Checks
1. Implement and benchmark all six voting methods and three allocation strategies on synthetic scenarios; compare assignment consistency and fairness.
2. Conduct ablation studies: compare allocations with and without LLM semantic resolution to measure impact on ambiguous cases.
3. Validate CBS in a simulated RPG environment with dynamic obstacles and multi-agent coordination; measure planning time and success rate.
