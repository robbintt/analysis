# Toward General Digraph Contrastive Learning: A Dual Spatial Perspective

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.16311
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16311
- **Authors**: Daohan Su; Yang Zhang; Xunkai Li; Rong-Hua Li; Guoren Wang
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: S2-DiGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on directed graph contrastive learning, improving node classification accuracy by 4.41% and link prediction accuracy by 4.34% compared to existing methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces S2-DiGCL, a novel contrastive learning framework specifically designed for directed graphs (digraphs). Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on undirected graphs, S2-DiGCL addresses the unique challenges of directed graph data through a dual spatial perspective. The framework combines magnetic Laplacian perturbations in the complex domain with path-based augmentations in the real domain to capture both global directional patterns and local directional dependencies. The approach demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple real-world directed graph datasets.

## Method Summary
S2-DiGCL employs a dual augmentation strategy that operates in both complex and real domains. The personalized magnetic Laplacian applies adaptive edge phase modulation based on node topology, while the path-based augmentation captures local directional dependencies through adaptive random walks. This dual perspective allows the model to effectively learn representations that preserve the inherent asymmetries of directed graphs. The framework is trained using contrastive learning objectives that maximize agreement between augmented views of the same graph while minimizing agreement with different graphs.

## Key Results
- Achieves 4.41% improvement in node classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Delivers 4.34% improvement in link prediction accuracy across benchmark datasets
- Demonstrates effectiveness on 7 real-world directed graph datasets spanning various domains
- Successfully captures both global directional patterns and fine-grained local asymmetries in directed graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual spatial perspective works because it addresses two fundamental aspects of directed graphs: global flow patterns and local directional dependencies. The magnetic Laplacian perturbations introduce phase shifts that encode directional information in the complex domain, while path-based augmentations preserve local structural relationships through random walks that respect edge directions. By combining these complementary approaches, S2-DiGCL can learn representations that capture the full spectrum of directional information in directed graphs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Magnetic Laplacian**: Mathematical operator that incorporates phase factors into graph Laplacians, enabling directional encoding
  - *Why needed*: Standard Laplacians lose directional information crucial for digraphs
  - *Quick check*: Verify phase factors correctly encode edge directionality

- **Contrastive Learning**: Self-supervised learning framework that learns representations by comparing augmented views
  - *Why needed*: Enables learning without labeled data while preserving directional patterns
  - *Quick check*: Ensure positive pairs share similar directional characteristics

- **Personalized Random Walks**: Adaptive random walk strategies that consider node-specific properties
  - *Why needed*: Captures local directional dependencies that vary across different graph regions
  - *Quick check*: Validate walk distributions reflect true graph topology

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Graph -> Magnetic Laplacian Perturbation -> Path-based Augmentation -> Encoder Network -> Contrastive Loss

**Critical Path**: Graph Augmentation (magnetic + path) -> Representation Learning -> Contrastive Objective -> Parameter Updates

**Design Tradeoffs**: The dual augmentation approach increases computational complexity but provides more comprehensive directional information capture compared to single-augmentation methods.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate inadequate phase factor calibration in magnetic perturbations or insufficient walk length in path-based augmentations.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test magnetic Laplacian perturbation effectiveness on synthetic directed graphs with known directional patterns
2. Validate path-based augmentation captures local directional dependencies on small benchmark digraphs
3. Verify contrastive loss properly distinguishes between positive and negative pairs in directed graph context

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on magnetic Laplacian perturbations introduces hyperparameter sensitivity that isn't fully explored
- Theoretical guarantees about the complementarity of the two augmentation strategies are lacking
- Experimental validation focuses on specific tasks without exploring broader graph-level applications

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Experimental methodology and dataset selection | High |
| Architectural design choices and justification | Medium |
| Capturing both global and local directional patterns | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies isolating contributions of magnetic Laplacian perturbations versus path-based augmentations across different graph sizes and densities

2. Test framework robustness to hyperparameter variations through systematic sensitivity analysis across the full range of graph datasets

3. Evaluate performance on graph-level tasks such as community detection and anomaly detection to verify broader applicability
