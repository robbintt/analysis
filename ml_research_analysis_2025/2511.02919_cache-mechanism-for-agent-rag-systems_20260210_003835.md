## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ARC, an annotation-free caching framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems used by LLM agents. ARC dynamically maintains small, high-value corpora by leveraging two key innovations: (1) a distance-rank frequency score that weights passages based on both their retrieval rank and semantic similarity to queries, and (2) a hubness score that identifies semantically central passages using the intrinsic geometry of the embedding space. Evaluated on three retrieval datasets with over 6.4 million documents, ARC significantly reduces storage requirements while maintaining high retrieval effectiveness.

## Method Summary
ARC employs a dual-score mechanism to dynamically maintain a small, high-value corpus for RAG systems. The distance-rank frequency score weights passages based on their retrieval rank and semantic similarity to queries, prioritizing passages that are both highly relevant and frequently retrieved. The hubness score identifies semantically central passages by analyzing the intrinsic geometry of the embedding space, capturing passages that serve as semantic bridges across the corpus. These scores work together to select and maintain a cache that maximizes retrieval effectiveness while minimizing storage requirements, all without requiring human annotation.

## Key Results
- Reduces storage requirements to 0.015% of the original corpus
- Achieves 79.8% has-answer rate on retrieval tasks
- Reduces average retrieval latency by 80% compared to baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ARC works by combining two complementary approaches to cache selection. The distance-rank frequency score captures passages that are both highly relevant (based on retrieval rank) and semantically similar to queries (based on embedding distance), ensuring the cache contains passages that are likely to be useful. The hubness score identifies passages that occupy central positions in the semantic space, which serve as bridges connecting different semantic regions and are therefore valuable for diverse queries. By maintaining passages that score highly on either metric, ARC creates a cache that is both compact and effective across a wide range of queries.

## Foundational Learning

**Distance-rank frequency scoring**: Weights passages based on both retrieval rank and semantic similarity; needed to prioritize passages that are both highly relevant and frequently retrieved; quick check: verify that high-scoring passages appear in top retrieval results for relevant queries.

**Hubness detection**: Identifies semantically central passages using embedding space geometry; needed to capture passages that serve as semantic bridges across diverse query types; quick check: confirm that hub passages connect disparate semantic regions in embedding visualizations.

**Annotation-free caching**: Eliminates need for human-curated relevance judgments; needed to scale cache maintenance to large, dynamic corpora; quick check: validate that cache effectiveness remains stable as corpus grows without manual intervention.

**Dynamic cache maintenance**: Continuously updates cache based on query patterns; needed to adapt to changing query distributions over time; quick check: measure cache stability and adaptation speed under continuous query streams.

**Retrieval effectiveness metrics**: Uses has-answer rate and latency as primary evaluation criteria; needed to quantify both quality and efficiency of cached retrieval; quick check: verify that improved metrics translate to better downstream task performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Query processor -> Distance-rank frequency scorer -> Hubness detector -> Cache selector -> Retrieval engine

**Critical path**: Query arrives → passages retrieved from full corpus → scores computed → cache updated → subsequent queries served from cache

**Design tradeoffs**: Annotation-free approach trades potential precision gains from human judgments for scalability and automation; cache size reduction trades completeness for efficiency; dynamic maintenance trades stability for adaptability.

**Failure signatures**: Cache miss rate increases when query distribution shifts rapidly; hubness detection fails on non-stationary embedding spaces; distance-rank scoring degrades when semantic similarity measures become unreliable.

**First experiments**: 1) Measure has-answer rate and latency on established retrieval benchmarks; 2) Analyze cache composition and evolution under different query patterns; 3) Test cache effectiveness across multiple domains and corpus types.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on retrieval metrics without comprehensive downstream task performance assessment
- 0.015% storage reduction may not generalize to different corpus characteristics
- Hubness mechanism assumes static embedding spaces, which may not hold for dynamic corpora
- Annotation-free approach trades precision gains from human-curated relevance judgments

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Technical novelty of combining distance-rank frequency scoring with hubness detection is well-demonstrated; experimental methodology and comparative baseline analysis are sound; storage efficiency and latency reduction claims are supported by quantitative evidence.

**Medium confidence**: Generalization of results across different domains and corpus types remains uncertain; trade-off between storage savings and retrieval effectiveness may vary significantly based on corpus characteristics not fully explored.

**Low confidence**: Long-term behavior of dynamic cache maintenance under continuous query streams has not been evaluated; impact on complex reasoning tasks that rely on ARC-maintained caches is unclear.

## Next Checks

1. **Downstream Task Performance**: Evaluate ARC's impact on end-to-end task completion rates and generation quality across multiple LLM applications rather than focusing solely on retrieval metrics.

2. **Dynamic Corpus Adaptation**: Test ARC's performance under continuous corpus updates and query distribution shifts to assess cache maintenance stability and adaptation speed in production scenarios.

3. **Hubness Robustness Analysis**: Systematically evaluate hubness detection accuracy across different embedding models and corpus types to establish the generalizability of this geometric approach to cache selection.
