# Learning Physics-Grounded 4D Dynamics with Neural Gaussian Force Fields

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.00148
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00148
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: Neural Gaussian Force Field (NGFF) integrates 3D Gaussian perception with physics-based dynamics to generate interactive, physically realistic 4D videos from multi-view RGB inputs, demonstrating strong generalization and achieving two orders of magnitude faster inference than traditional physics simulators.

## Executive Summary
Neural Gaussian Force Field (NGFF) presents a unified framework that combines 3D Gaussian perception with physics-based dynamics to generate physically realistic 4D videos from multi-view RGB inputs. The system encodes scenes into object-aware 3D Gaussians, predicts force fields via neural operators on relational graphs, and integrates them through ODE solvers to simulate dynamics. NGFF outperforms state-of-the-art video generation models like Veo3 and NVIDIA Cosmos in physical accuracy while achieving significantly faster inference speeds compared to traditional physics simulators.

## Method Summary
The NGFF framework integrates 3D Gaussian representation with physics-based dynamics by encoding multi-view RGB inputs into object-aware 3D Gaussians that capture spatial and temporal features. It employs neural operators on relational graphs to predict force fields based on learned physical interactions between objects. These force fields are then integrated using ODE solvers to generate realistic 4D video sequences. The approach demonstrates strong generalization across different scene configurations and achieves two orders of magnitude faster inference compared to conventional physics simulators while maintaining physical accuracy.

## Key Results
- Outperforms Veo3 and NVIDIA Cosmos in physical accuracy for 4D video generation
- Achieves two orders of magnitude faster inference than traditional physics simulators
- Demonstrates strong spatial, temporal, and compositional generalization on comprehensive 4D dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NGFF works by leveraging 3D Gaussians as a flexible representation that can capture complex scene geometry while maintaining computational efficiency. The neural operator architecture enables learning of complex physical interactions from data without requiring explicit physical modeling. By combining perception and dynamics in a unified framework, NGFF can generate physically plausible motion directly from visual inputs. The ODE solver integration ensures temporal coherence while the relational graph structure captures object-object interactions essential for realistic physics simulation.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Multi-View RGB Input -> 3D Gaussian Encoder -> Object-Aware Gaussian Representation -> Neural Operator on Relational Graph -> Force Field Prediction -> ODE Solver -> 4D Video Output

Critical Path:
The critical path flows from 3D Gaussian encoding through neural operator prediction to ODE integration, as these components directly determine the physical realism and temporal coherence of the generated videos.

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework trades some physical accuracy precision for significant computational speed gains, achieving two orders of magnitude faster inference than traditional physics simulators. The use of learned neural operators instead of explicit physical models enables better generalization but may struggle with highly complex or unseen physical interactions.

Failure Signatures:
The system may accumulate numerical errors in ODE integration over longer time horizons, leading to degraded physical accuracy. Complex or unseen physical interactions may produce unrealistic force field predictions, and real-world generalization may be limited by the synthetic nature of training data.

First Experiments:
1. Test physical accuracy degradation over extended video sequences (100+ frames)
2. Evaluate performance on real-world datasets with diverse materials and lighting conditions
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of individual physical force components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Physical realism depends heavily on accurate force field predictions, with limited analysis of failure modes for complex or unseen interactions
- Real-world generalization remains uncertain due to evaluation focus on synthetic datasets with limited environmental complexity
- ODE integration may accumulate numerical errors over longer time horizons, potentially degrading physical accuracy in extended sequences

## Confidence
- Core architectural innovations: High confidence based on clear methodology and quantitative comparisons
- Generalization claims: Medium confidence due to focus on controlled synthetic scenarios
- Physical accuracy superiority: Medium confidence without detailed ablation studies on force component contributions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive real-world testing on diverse datasets with varying object properties, environmental conditions, and occlusion scenarios
2. Perform systematic ablation studies isolating contributions of individual physical force components
3. Benchmark long-term stability by generating extended video sequences and measuring physical accuracy degradation over time through quantitative physics-based metrics
