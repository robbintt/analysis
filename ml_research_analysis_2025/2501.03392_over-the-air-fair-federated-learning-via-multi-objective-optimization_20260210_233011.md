# Over-the-Air Fair Federated Learning via Multi-Objective Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.03392
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03392
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: OTA-FFL achieves significantly fairer models and improved average accuracy in federated learning with heterogeneous data distributions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of achieving fairness in federated learning when clients have heterogeneous data distributions, which can lead to unsatisfactory performance for some clients. The authors propose OTA-FFL, an over-the-air fair federated learning algorithm that leverages over-the-air computation to train fair FL models. The core method formulates FL as a multi-objective minimization problem and introduces a modified Chebyshev approach to compute adaptive weighting coefficients for gradient aggregation in each communication round. To enable efficient aggregation over the multiple access channel, the authors derive analytical solutions for the optimal transmit scalars at the clients and the de-noising scalar at the parameter server. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of OTA-FFL in achieving fairness and robust performance compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
The authors propose OTA-FFL, an over-the-air fair federated learning algorithm that addresses the challenge of fairness in FL with heterogeneous data distributions. The method formulates FL as a multi-objective minimization problem and introduces a modified Chebyshev approach to compute adaptive weighting coefficients for gradient aggregation in each communication round. Analytical solutions are derived for the optimal transmit scalars at the clients and the de-noising scalar at the parameter server to enable efficient aggregation over the multiple access channel. The algorithm dynamically balances client contributions and fosters robust optimization in heterogeneous settings, leading to significantly fairer models across various datasets.

## Key Results
- OTA-FFL consistently trains significantly fairer models across various datasets compared to existing methods.
- The algorithm achieves improved average accuracy in some cases due to its ability to dynamically balance client contributions.
- OTA-FFL fosters robust optimization in heterogeneous settings, leading to superior fairness and performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed OTA-FFL algorithm works by formulating federated learning as a multi-objective minimization problem and introducing a modified Chebyshev approach to compute adaptive weighting coefficients for gradient aggregation. This allows the algorithm to dynamically balance client contributions based on their data distributions, leading to fairer models. The analytical solutions for optimal transmit scalars and de-noising scalars enable efficient aggregation over the multiple access channel, reducing communication overhead and improving scalability. By leveraging over-the-air computation, OTA-FFL can train fair FL models while addressing the challenges of heterogeneous data distributions and communication efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Federated Learning (FL)**: A machine learning approach where multiple clients collaborate to train a shared model without sharing their local data. FL is needed to preserve data privacy and enable collaborative learning across distributed devices.
   - Quick check: Verify that the proposed algorithm maintains data privacy and achieves comparable performance to centralized learning.

2. **Over-the-Air Computation**: A technique that allows multiple clients to simultaneously transmit their gradients over the same wireless channel, reducing communication overhead and improving scalability in FL.
   - Quick check: Assess the impact of channel noise and interference on the accuracy of gradient aggregation in OTA-FFL.

3. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: An optimization approach that considers multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously, allowing for the derivation of Pareto-optimal solutions that balance trade-offs between objectives.
   - Quick check: Evaluate the effectiveness of the modified Chebyshev approach in computing adaptive weighting coefficients for gradient aggregation.

4. **Chebyshev Approximation**: A mathematical technique used to approximate complex functions by minimizing the maximum deviation between the approximation and the original function.
   - Quick check: Analyze the convergence properties and computational complexity of the modified Chebyshev approach in OTA-FFL.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Clients -> Wireless Channel -> Parameter Server -> Clients

**Critical Path**: 
1. Clients compute local gradients based on their data distributions
2. Clients transmit gradients to the parameter server using over-the-air computation
3. Parameter server aggregates gradients using the modified Chebyshev approach
4. Parameter server updates the global model and broadcasts it back to clients
5. Clients update their local models using the global model

**Design Tradeoffs**:
- Communication efficiency vs. model accuracy: OTA-FFL leverages over-the-air computation to reduce communication overhead but may introduce additional noise and interference.
- Fairness vs. overall performance: The algorithm aims to achieve fairness by dynamically balancing client contributions, which may lead to a trade-off with overall model accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor convergence or divergence of the global model due to inaccurate gradient aggregation
- Significant performance degradation for certain clients due to unfair weighting of their gradients
- Communication bottlenecks or synchronization issues in large-scale deployments

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate the convergence and accuracy of OTA-FFL on a simple federated learning task with synthetic data and varying levels of data heterogeneity.
2. Compare the fairness and overall performance of OTA-FFL with existing FL algorithms on benchmark datasets with known data distributions.
3. Assess the communication efficiency and scalability of OTA-FFL in a simulated large-scale FL setting with varying numbers of clients and communication constraints.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The paper does not address potential communication bottlenecks in over-the-air computation, particularly in large-scale deployments with many clients.
- The fairness metric used is not explicitly defined, which could affect the reproducibility of results.
- The impact of channel noise on the proposed analytical solutions for transmit scalars and de-noising is not thoroughly evaluated under varying channel conditions.

## Confidence
- High confidence in the theoretical formulation and analytical solutions for optimal transmit scalars and de-noising.
- Medium confidence in the experimental results, given the lack of detailed fairness metrics and potential communication challenges.
- Low confidence in the scalability of OTA-FFL for large-scale deployments without addressing communication bottlenecks.

## Next Checks
1. **Fairness Metric Definition**: Clearly define the fairness metric used in the experiments to ensure reproducibility and transparency.
2. **Communication Efficiency**: Evaluate the communication efficiency of OTA-FFL in large-scale scenarios with varying numbers of clients to assess scalability.
3. **Channel Noise Robustness**: Test the robustness of the proposed analytical solutions under different levels of channel noise to validate their practical applicability.
