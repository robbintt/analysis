# Robust Decentralized Multi-armed Bandits: From Corruption-Resilience to Byzantine-Resilience

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10344
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10344
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: DeMABAR achieves sublinear regret under adversarial corruption and Byzantine attacks with O(V ln(VT)) communication cost.

## Executive Summary
This paper studies decentralized cooperative multi-armed bandits (DeCMA2B) under adversarial corruption and Byzantine attacks. The authors propose DeMABAR, a robust algorithm that uses a novel filtering mechanism to mitigate adversarial influence. For adversarial corruption, DeMABAR achieves individual regret bounds of O(1/(1-2α) · (∑ ∆k>0 ln²(VT)/(vᵢ∆k) + K ln(VT) ln(1/∆)/(vmin∆))) when β ≤ α, and an additional additive term O(C/((1-2α)vmin)) when β > α. For Byzantine settings, it achieves regret O(1/(1-2α) · (∑ ∆k>0 ln²(VT)/(vᵢ∆k) + K ln(1/∆)/(vmin∆))). The algorithm requires only O(V ln(VT)) communication cost. Experiments show DeMABAR significantly outperforms baselines including IND-BARBAR, IND-FTRL, Resilient Decentralized UCB, and DRAA under both attack models.

## Method Summary
DeMABAR operates in synchronized epochs with instance-independent lengths, enabling O(V ln(VT)) communication cost. Each agent pulls arms based on estimated gaps and shares statistics with neighbors via w-round flooding. A novel filtering mechanism removes extreme values before computing reward estimates, eliminating adversarial influence when α > β (corruption) or β < α (Byzantine). The algorithm achieves Θ(1/vᵢ) per-agent regret scaling through neighborhood-level load balancing. For corruption attacks, an additive regret term appears when β > α. The method requires knowledge of α (Byzantine tolerance) and operates under the assumption that at most α fraction of any agent's neighbors are Byzantine/corrupted, where α ∈ [0, 0.5).

## Key Results
- DeMABAR achieves sublinear regret O(1/(1-2α) · (∑ ∆k>0 ln²(VT)/(vᵢ∆k) + K ln(VT) ln(1/∆)/(vmin∆))) under adversarial corruption when β ≤ α
- For Byzantine settings, DeMABAR achieves regret O(1/(1-2α) · (∑ ∆k>0 ln²(VT)/(vᵢ∆k) + K ln(1/∆)/(vmin∆))) with w=1
- The algorithm requires only O(V ln(VT)) communication cost through epoch-based synchronization
- Experiments show DeMABAR significantly outperforms baselines (IND-BARBAR, IND-FTRL, Resilient Decentralized UCB, DRAA) under both attack models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The filtering mechanism eliminates adversarial influence by removing extreme values before computing reward estimates.
- **Mechanism:** Two-stage filtering per arm k: (1) Remove agents j from available set A^m_{i,k} if their pull count \tilde{n}^m_{j,k} falls below threshold n^m_{i,k}; (2) Compute trimmed average by sorting S^m_{j,k}/\tilde{n}^m_{j,k} across remaining agents and removing the f largest and f smallest values, where f = ⌊(|B^m_{i,k}| - (1-2α)|N^w(i)|)/2⌋. This bounds corrupted contributions between honest ones.
- **Core assumption:** At most α fraction of any agent's neighbors are Byzantine/corrupted, where α ∈ [0, 0.5).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "proposes DeMABAR, a robust algorithm that uses a novel filtering mechanism to mitigate adversarial influence"
  - [section]: Algorithm 2 (Filter) and proof sketch on page 4: "removing the f largest and f smallest values ensures that any artificially inflated or deflated contributions from corrupted agents are eliminated"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct support; arxiv:2601.11924 addresses corruption in cooperative bandits but uses verification, not trimmed means
- **Break condition:** If β > α (more than α fraction corrupted), the filtering cannot fully eliminate corruption; regret gains an additive O(C/((1-2α)v^w_min)) term.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Instance-independent epoch lengths enable synchronized coordination with only O(V ln(VT)) communication cost.
- **Mechanism:** All agents use epoch length N^m = ⌈Kλ2^{2(m-1)}/((1-2α)v^w_min)⌉, which depends only on epoch index m, not problem instance parameters like ∆_k. Agents communicate only at epoch boundaries via w-round flooding to w-neighborhood.
- **Core assumption:** Agents synchronize epoch starts and w-hop communication completes within w rounds.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The algorithm requires only O(V ln(VT)) communication cost"
  - [section]: Page 2: "DeMABAR algorithm uses an instance-independent epoch length, ensuring that all agents have the same epoch length... allows agents to share information with their neighbors only at the beginning and the end of each epoch"
  - [corpus]: Weak; arxiv:2502.07514 discusses BARBAR variants but not decentralized epoch coordination
- **Break condition:** Asynchronous agents or network delays > w rounds cause stale data aggregation.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Collaborative sampling distributes exploration burden, achieving Θ(1/v_i) per-agent regret scaling through neighborhood-level load balancing.
- **Mechanism:** Each agent i pulls arm k approximately n^m_{i,k} = λ(∆^{m-1}_{i,k})^{-2}/((1-2α)|N^w(i)|) times per epoch. The actual pulls \tilde{n}^m_{i,k} are inflated to satisfy all agents in i's w-neighborhood: \tilde{n}^m_{i,k} = min{λ2^{2(m-1)}/((1-2α)v^w_i), 16λ(∆^{m-1}_{i,k})^{-2}/((1-2α)v^w_i)}.
- **Core assumption:** Connected graph where each agent has sufficient honest neighbors (v^w_i > 0).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: Regret bounds include Σ_{∆_k>0} ln²(VT)/(v^w_i ∆_k), showing collaboration benefit
  - [section]: Theorem 1 and 2; Lemma 2 guarantees N^m ≥ Σ_k n^m_{i,k}
  - [corpus]: Weak direct support; arxiv:2502.16128 studies heterogeneous rewards, not identical-reward collaboration
- **Break condition:** Disconnected graph or agents with tiny neighborhoods (v_min → 0) break the 1/v_i scaling guarantee.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Stochastic Bandit Regret**
  - Why needed here: The paper bounds individual pseudo-regret R_i(T) = Σ_k ∆_k E[n^i_{k,T}]; understanding this metric is essential to interpret near-optimality claims.
  - Quick check question: Why is O(ln²(T)/∆) "near-optimal" when standard UCB achieves O(ln(T)/∆)?

- **Concept: Byzantine Fault Tolerance Threshold**
  - Why needed here: The α < 0.5 constraint mirrors classical Byzantine consensus; the 1/(1-2α) regret multiplier derives from this.
  - Quick check question: If each honest node has 40% Byzantine neighbors, what's the minimum robust α setting and resulting regret penalty factor?

- **Concept: Graph Neighborhoods (w-hop)**
  - Why needed here: The notation N^w(i), v^w_i, v^w_min determines collaboration scope, communication latency, and regret scaling.
  - Quick check question: On a line graph with 10 nodes, what is N^2(3) and v^2_3?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Epoch scheduler: Computes N^m, tracks T^m, coordinates phase transitions
  2. Sampling controller: Computes \tilde{n}^m_{i,k} from ∆^{m-1}_{i,k}, maintains arm probabilities p^m_i(k)
  3. Communication module: Broadcasts {(i, {S^m_{i,k}}, {\tilde{n}^m_{i,k}})} to N^w(i) over w rounds
  4. Filter module (Algorithm 2): Implements trimmed-mean aggregation with Byzantine resilience
  5. Gap estimator: Computes r^m_{i,k} and updates ∆^m_{i,k} = max{2^{-m}, r^m_{i,*} - r^m_{i,k}}

- **Critical path:**
  Initialize (∆^0_{i,k} = 1) → Loop over epochs m:
  1. Compute sampling allocation {\tilde{n}^m_{i,k}} from ∆^{m-1}
  2. Pull arms for N^m rounds (line 9-13)
  3. Broadcast and receive for w rounds (line 15-19)
  4. Filter received statistics → compute {r^m_{i,k}} (line 20)
  5. Update gap estimates ∆^m_{i,k} for next epoch

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **w (collaboration distance):** Higher w = more collaboration benefit but increased latency and Byzantine exposure. Paper sets w=1 for Byzantine setting.
  - **α (robustness parameter):** Higher α tolerates more Byzantines but worsens regret by factor 1/(1-2α). Must satisfy α < 0.5.
  - **λ (confidence scaling):** Higher λ = more exploration, stronger concentration guarantees, but larger regret constants.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Linear regret growth:** Likely β > α or attack model mismatch; verify actual Byzantine fraction vs. α setting
  - **No 1/v_i scaling observed:** Network disconnected or w too small to reach collaborating agents
  - **Communication deadlock:** w-round propagation incomplete; check graph diameter vs. w setting

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline corruption test:** K=10 arms, T=50000, V=10 agents (centralized), C=1500 corruption targeting non-target arms; compare DeMABAR vs. IND-BARBAR and DRAA. Expected: DeMABAR achieves ~3-5x lower regret.
  2. **Byzantine attack robustness:** Use network from Fig 2, α=1/3, 2 Byzantine agents with adaptive attack (report inverted rewards); verify filtering maintains sublinear regret while Resilient Decentralized UCB degrades.
  3. **Network topology sensitivity:** Test ring graph vs. complete graph with same V; measure actual regret scaling with v_min to confirm theoretical 1/v_min dependence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the gap between the lower bound Ω(∑_{∆k>0} ln(T)/((1-2α)|N¹(i)|∆k)) and the upper bound O(1/(1-2α) · (∑_{∆k>0} ln²(VT)/(vᵢ∆k) + K ln(1/∆)/(vmin∆))) in the Byzantine setting be closed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Remark 4 states: "There remains a gap between this lower bound and our upper bound. Closing this gap or determining if it is unavoidable is an interesting open question for future work."
- Why unresolved: The upper bound has additional logarithmic factors and different denominator terms (vᵢ vs |N¹(i)|) compared to the lower bound, and it remains unclear whether this gap is fundamental or an artifact of the analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Either a refined analysis showing the upper bound can match the lower bound up to constants, or a stronger lower bound construction that matches the current upper bound.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can DeMABAR be made adaptive to unknown α, eliminating the requirement that the robustness parameter must be specified in advance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper explicitly assumes "α is known to the algorithm" (Page 3), but in practice the fraction of Byzantine neighbors is typically unknown.
- Why unresolved: The filtering mechanism (Algorithm 2) requires α to determine how many agents to filter (f = ⌊(|B^m_{i,k}| - (1-2α)|N^w(i)|)/2⌋). Misestimating α could lead to either insufficient robustness or overly conservative filtering.
- What evidence would resolve it: An adaptive algorithm that achieves similar regret bounds while learning α online, or a negative result showing knowledge of α is information-theoretically necessary.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the additive O(C/((1-2α)vmin)) corruption term in the β > α regime be improved, or is it information-theoretically optimal?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Theorem 1 shows this additive term appears when β > α, but the paper does not establish lower bounds for the corruption-dependent term in the decentralized setting.
- Why unresolved: While prior work (Lykouris et al., 2018) established linear C-dependence is unavoidable in single-agent settings, the collaborative setting may allow improved dependence through information aggregation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A lower bound construction for DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption showing the C/(vmin) dependence is unavoidable, or an improved algorithm achieving better corruption resilience.

## Limitations

- **Graph structure ambiguity**: The exact topology from Figure 2 is not provided, making it difficult to precisely replicate network-dependent results.
- **Filter mechanism bounds**: While the theoretical f-threshold ensures Byzantine resilience when α > β, the practical effectiveness depends on the distribution of corruptions across neighbors.
- **Communication cost accounting**: The O(V ln(VT)) communication bound assumes synchronized epoch transitions and perfect w-round flooding, which may not hold in realistic network conditions.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Individual regret bounds under β ≤ α (adversarial corruption), Byzantine filtering mechanism (when α > β), O(V ln(VT)) communication complexity (under ideal conditions)
- **Medium Confidence**: Regret bounds under β > α (additive corruption term), overall near-optimality claim, practical filtering performance in heterogeneous network conditions
- **Low Confidence**: Exact empirical scaling with v_min (due to unknown graph topology), cross-comparison with all baseline implementations (some details not fully specified)

## Next Checks

1. **Graph structure reconstruction**: Reconstruct the collaboration graph from Figure 2 and verify the 1/v_i scaling holds across different network topologies (line, ring, complete graphs).

2. **Filter robustness testing**: Systematically vary β (corruption fraction) and α (Byzantine tolerance) to identify the exact threshold where filtering fails, confirming the β ≤ α requirement.

3. **Communication delay analysis**: Introduce artificial network delays and measure actual communication rounds required for information propagation, testing the O(V ln(VT)) claim under realistic conditions.
