# Guidelines For The Choice Of The Baseline in XAI Attribution Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.19813
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19813
- Reference count: 40
- The Informed Baseline Search (IBS) algorithm provides a systematic method for selecting optimal baselines in gradient-based XAI attribution methods, ensuring accurate and interpretable attribution maps.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in eXplainable AI (XAI): selecting appropriate baseline signals for gradient-based attribution methods like Integrated Gradients. The authors demonstrate that different baseline choices can produce vastly different attribution maps, potentially leading to misleading interpretations, especially in critical domains like biomedicine. To solve this, they propose the Informed Baseline Search (IBS) algorithm, which identifies the optimal baseline by sampling the decision boundary within the data distribution. The method is validated against two state-of-the-art decision boundary detection algorithms on synthetic datasets with varying complexity, showing superior performance in locating decision boundaries and producing attribution maps with correct directionality.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes the Informed Baseline Search (IBS) algorithm for selecting optimal baselines in gradient-based XAI attribution methods. IBS operates by systematically sampling the decision boundary within the data distribution to identify a baseline that is neutral to the network and closest to the sample under analysis. The algorithm works by iteratively refining baseline candidates through gradient-based optimization, ensuring that the selected baseline represents a true neutral point in feature space. This approach contrasts with arbitrary baseline selection (such as zero vectors or mean values) by grounding the baseline choice in the actual decision boundary structure learned by the network. The method is specifically designed to work with Integrated Gradients but can be adapted to other gradient-based attribution methods.

## Key Results
- IBS consistently locates decision boundaries more accurately than SplineCAM and DeepView across synthetic datasets of varying complexity
- Attribution maps generated using IBS-selected baselines show only positive values, correctly reflecting the influence of features on network decisions
- The method successfully handles synthetic brain image data, demonstrating potential applicability to biomedical imaging scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of IBS stems from its principled approach to baseline selection. By sampling the decision boundary within the data distribution, IBS ensures that the baseline represents a true neutral point that the network has actually encountered during training. This grounding in the network's learned decision structure means that attribution calculations start from a genuinely neutral reference, rather than an arbitrary point that may not reflect the network's understanding of feature absence. The iterative refinement process allows IBS to converge on a baseline that balances proximity to the sample under analysis with neutrality to the network's predictions, resulting in attribution maps that accurately capture feature influence directions.

## Foundational Learning

**Integrated Gradients**: A gradient-based attribution method that requires a baseline input to compute feature importance. Why needed: Forms the foundation for understanding the baseline selection problem. Quick check: Verify understanding of how IG accumulates gradients from baseline to input.

**Decision Boundary**: The surface in feature space where the network's output probability transitions between classes. Why needed: IBS explicitly targets the decision boundary for baseline selection. Quick check: Can you identify decision boundaries in simple 2D classification problems?

**Attribution Maps**: Visual representations of feature importance showing how each input feature contributes to the network's output. Why needed: The ultimate goal is to produce accurate and interpretable attribution maps. Quick check: Compare attribution maps from different baseline choices on a simple example.

**Gradient-Based Optimization**: The use of gradient information to iteratively improve solutions. Why needed: IBS uses gradient-based methods to refine baseline candidates. Quick check: Understand how gradients guide the search for optimal baselines.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input samples -> Baseline sampling module -> Gradient-based optimization -> Decision boundary detection -> Baseline validation -> Attribution map generation

**Critical Path**: The algorithm's critical path involves iterative sampling and validation steps where each candidate baseline is evaluated based on its neutrality and proximity to the target sample. This process continues until convergence criteria are met.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational efficiency for accuracy in baseline selection. While simpler methods might use fixed baselines, IBS invests computational resources in finding optimal baselines that produce more interpretable results. This tradeoff is particularly important in high-stakes applications where attribution accuracy is paramount.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor baseline selection manifests as attribution maps with incorrect directionality (containing negative values when all features should be positively contributing) or inconsistent attribution patterns across similar samples. These failures indicate that the baseline does not represent a true neutral reference point for the network.

**First Experiments**:
1. Apply IBS to a simple binary classification problem with known decision boundaries to verify correct baseline identification
2. Compare attribution maps from IBS with those from arbitrary baselines on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate improved interpretability
3. Test IBS on a multi-class classification problem to verify scalability beyond binary scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- **Domain Generalization**: Performance on real-world biomedical datasets remains unverified, as current validation is limited to synthetic data
- **Computational Efficiency**: The paper does not provide runtime comparisons, and IBS may be computationally more expensive than simpler baseline selection approaches
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Lacks formal proofs of convergence across all network architectures and data distributions

## Confidence

- IBS consistently finds optimal baselines that produce interpretable attribution maps: High confidence
- IBS outperforms SplineCAM and DeepView in locating decision boundaries: High confidence
- The method provides reliable guidelines for baseline selection in XAI: Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world Validation**: Apply IBS to actual biomedical datasets (MRI scans or histopathology images) and compare attribution maps against clinical ground truth or expert interpretation to verify practical effectiveness.

2. **Computational Benchmarking**: Conduct runtime analysis comparing IBS with baseline selection methods across networks of varying sizes to assess scalability and identify potential bottlenecks for deployment.

3. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate IBS's performance under adversarial conditions such as noisy labels, out-of-distribution samples, or networks with non-linear decision boundaries to determine reliability in less controlled environments.
