# medicX-KG: A Knowledge Graph for Pharmacists' Drug Information Needs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.17959
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17959
- Reference count: 21
- 9,747 products, 5,085 active ingredients, and 1.39M drug-drug interactions

## Executive Summary
medicX-KG is a pharmacist-centric Knowledge Graph that integrates Malta Medicines Authority regulatory data with British National Formulary clinical data and DrugBank chemical information. The system addresses the need for unified drug information by resolving semantic conflicts between heterogeneous pharmaceutical datasets through a rule-based entity resolution pipeline. The KG supports queries on drug availability, interactions, adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes, validated through pharmacist interviews and competency question evaluation.

## Method Summary
The system constructs medicX-KG by integrating three data sources: Malta Medicines Authority (9,746 products), British National Formulary (1,600+ entries), and DrugBank (14,315 drugs). A 4-stage rule-based mapping pipeline resolves semantic conflicts through direct matching, synonym resolution via DrugBank, combination product decomposition, and PubChem fallback. The resulting RDF triples are stored in GraphDB and accessed through a Django/React portal. Validation uses 7 Competency Questions executed as SPARQL queries and qualitative analysis of interviews with 6 pharmacists from different roles.

## Key Results
- Successfully mapped 9,747 products, 5,085 active ingredients, and 1.39M drug-drug interactions
- Competency Questions for availability, interactions, and adverse reactions scored "Fully Met"
- Dosage-related queries scored "Not Met" due to missing SmPC posology integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Tiered Rule-Based Entity Resolution
The 4-stage mapping pipeline (Direct → Synonym → Decomposition → PubChem) resolves semantic conflicts between heterogeneous pharmaceutical datasets. This handles naming variations like "Adrenaline vs. Epinephrine" and combination products like "Co-amoxiclav." The approach explicitly addresses domain-specific idiosyncrasies that generic matchers fail to handle.

### Mechanism 2: Ontology-Driven Requirement Elicitation
The Knowledge Graph schema is derived directly from qualitative analysis of pharmacist interviews (N=6), ensuring the resulting ontology satisfies local workflow needs. Classes like `MarketingAuthorisation` and `ActiveIngredient` reflect identified pain points such as "local availability" and "product equivalence" rather than generic biomedical entities.

### Mechanism 3: Regulatory-Clinical Semantic Linkage
The graph separates abstract `ActiveIngredient` from specific `Product` (linked to `MarketingAuthorisation`), enabling queries that filter scientific evidence by local market availability. This allows pharmacists to find interactions for Drug X constrained by products authorized in Malta, supporting regulatory-compliant clinical decision support.

## Foundational Learning

**RDF Triples & SPARQL**: The system uses Resource Description Framework (RDF) with subject-predicate-object triples. Understanding this is required to translate Competency Questions into SPARQL queries for evaluation. Quick check: Can you write a SPARQL query to find all products containing a specific active ingredient?

**Entity Resolution (Record Linkage)**: The primary technical challenge is matching "Augmentin" in one database to "Co-amoxiclav" in another. Understanding this concept is essential to grasp the data integration pipeline. Quick check: How would you normalize "Esomeprazole Magnesium" to match "Esomeprazole"?

**Competency Questions (CQ)**: This validation method uses natural language questions (e.g., "Can drug X be used in pregnancy?") converted into formal queries to test ontology adequacy. Quick check: If a CQ returns "Not Met" (e.g., dosage), does it mean the query failed or the data is missing?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: MMA/BNF/DrugBank data sources → Custom RDFizer ingestion → Rule-based mapping layer → GraphDB storage → medicX Portal (Django/React)

**Critical path**: Harvesting MMA data → Cleaning → Mapping to BNF/DrugBank IDs → URI generation → Loading to GraphDB

**Design tradeoffs**: Static vs. Real-time (chose static for reliability/auditing), Rule-based vs. LLM Matching (chose explicit rules for interpretability and clinical safety)

**Failure signatures**: High unmatched count (852 products failed to match BNF), CQ "Not Met" (Dosage queries fail without SmPC posology)

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Run a Mapping Audit: Take random samples of 10 "Direct Match" and 10 "Decomposition" products to verify semantic logic
2. Execute CQs: Run the SPARQL queries against sample dataset to reproduce "Fully Met" vs "Not Met" results
3. Stress Test Regulatory Linkage: Query a drug authorized in EU but not Malta to verify regulatory filtering

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can the medicX-KG ontology modules be generalized to allow regulators in other small EU markets to instantiate their own national views via mapping files? The authors plan to generalize ontology modules for jurisdictional constraints so regulators can supply mapping files and instantiate national views.

**Open Question 2**: Can graph-based transformers effectively generate both accurate risk scores and mechanistic narrative traces for predicted drug-drug interactions? Future work involves extending the framework to allow graph-based transformers over typed paths to output risk scores and mechanistic explanations.

**Open Question 3**: Does deployment in operational pharmacy settings significantly reduce task-completion time and error rates compared to fragmented resources? The authors plan pilot installations to measure task-completion time, error rate, and System Usability Scale scores.

## Limitations

The system uses a static dataset snapshot, risking information staleness as regulatory authorizations and drug information change over time. The entity resolution heavily relies on DrugBank's synonym coverage, creating a single point of failure for local drug names not represented in global databases. The study's geographic constraint to Malta raises questions about generalizability to other regulatory environments.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Pharmacist interview methodology and thematic analysis approach - well-documented and reproducible process.

**Medium Confidence**: Mapping pipeline effectiveness - rule-based approach is sound but exact implementation details (string matching thresholds, normalization rules) are not fully specified.

**Low Confidence**: Real-world clinical impact and adoption - validates against CQs but lacks longitudinal studies of actual pharmacist usage in clinical workflows.

## Next Checks

1. **Mapping Pipeline Audit**: Take 20 randomly selected products from each mapping category and manually verify the semantic correctness of URI assignment logic.

2. **Regulatory Coverage Test**: Query the KG for 10 drugs that are EU-authorized but specifically not Malta-authorized to verify regulatory filtering mechanism correctly excludes them.

3. **CQ1 Data Gap Analysis**: Systematically catalog which dosage-related CQs fail and identify whether this represents missing data or fundamental limitation of current schema design.
