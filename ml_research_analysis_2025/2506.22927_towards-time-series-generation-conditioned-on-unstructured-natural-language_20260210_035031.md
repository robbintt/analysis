# Towards Time Series Generation Conditioned on Unstructured Natural Language

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.22927
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22927
- Authors: Jaeyun Woo; Jiseok Lee; Brian Kenji Iwana
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: First method for generating time series from natural language using temporal diffusion models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first approach for generating time series conditioned on unstructured natural language descriptions. The authors propose a temporal diffusion model that combines a denoising U-Net with a BERT language model via cross-attention. Using a novel dataset of 63,010 time series-description pairs collected from stock data, UCR archive, and synthetic sources, the model successfully generates time series matching various text prompts. The method demonstrates capability across different description types including short, medium, long, creative, and resemblance descriptions, establishing a new foundation for text-to-time-series generation.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a temporal denoising diffusion model that generates time series from natural language descriptions. The model architecture consists of a BERT language model that processes text descriptions and a denoising U-Net that generates time series through iterative noise removal. Cross-attention layers connect these components, allowing the language model to condition the time series generation process. The training data combines real-world stock market data, publicly available UCR time series archive, and synthetically generated series with GPT-4o-generated descriptions. All time series are standardized to 100 timesteps through interpolation before training.

## Key Results
- The model generates time series matching text prompts with Euclidean distance of 30.76 and DTW of 14.41 across the full test set
- Successfully handles various description types: short, medium, long, creative, and resemblance descriptions
- Demonstrates practical utility across multiple domains including financial and synthetic time series data
- First demonstrated capability for text-conditioned time series generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The temporal diffusion model works by learning to denoise corrupted time series representations while being conditioned on language embeddings. The BERT model extracts semantic features from natural language descriptions, which are then integrated into the denoising U-Net through cross-attention mechanisms. During generation, the model starts with pure noise and iteratively removes noise while maintaining fidelity to the textual description. This approach leverages the denoising diffusion framework's proven effectiveness in image generation while adapting it to the temporal domain through 1D convolutions and specialized conditioning mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning
- **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models**: Why needed - Provides the generative framework that enables high-quality time series synthesis; Quick check - Verify that the model can denoise corrupted versions of known time series
- **Cross-Attention Mechanisms**: Why needed - Enables effective conditioning of the time series generation on language embeddings; Quick check - Confirm that removing cross-attention significantly degrades generation quality
- **Temporal U-Net Architecture**: Why needed - Specialized architecture for processing sequential data in the denoising process; Quick check - Validate that the model maintains temporal coherence in generated sequences
- **BERT Language Embeddings**: Why needed - Provides semantic understanding of natural language descriptions; Quick check - Test that semantically similar descriptions produce similar conditioning vectors
- **Time Series Interpolation**: Why needed - Standardizes variable-length sequences to fixed length for model training; Quick check - Ensure interpolation doesn't distort essential temporal patterns
- **Euclidean Distance and DTW Metrics**: Why needed - Quantitative measures for evaluating similarity between generated and target time series; Quick check - Verify these metrics correlate with human perceptual similarity

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Text Description -> BERT Embeddings -> Cross-Attention -> Temporal U-Net -> Denoising Process -> Generated Time Series

Critical Path: The critical path flows from the natural language input through BERT to extract semantic features, which are then integrated into the denoising U-Net via cross-attention layers. The U-Net iteratively denoises a random noise input while being conditioned on the language embeddings, ultimately producing a time series that matches the description.

Design Tradeoffs: The model uses fixed-length (100-step) outputs for training stability, requiring interpolation of all input series. This simplifies the architecture but limits flexibility in output length. The BERT model provides rich language understanding but adds computational overhead. Cross-attention enables effective conditioning but increases model complexity and training time.

Failure Signatures: Model failures typically manifest as either (1) time series that don't match the semantic content of descriptions, indicating poor cross-attention integration, or (2) temporal patterns that are incoherent, suggesting issues with the U-Net's temporal processing. Abstract or highly unconventional prompts often result in generic outputs, revealing limitations in the language understanding or training data coverage.

First Experiments:
1. Test generation with simple, unambiguous descriptions (e.g., "increasing linear trend") to establish baseline functionality
2. Evaluate generation quality across different description lengths to assess the model's handling of varying textual complexity
3. Perform ablation studies removing cross-attention to quantify its contribution to generation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does manual curation or alignment of the ground truth descriptions impact the accuracy and fidelity of the generated time series?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 ("Quality of the Descriptions") and the Limitations section state that descriptions generated by GPT-4o can be "too generic or sometimes misleading," and propose future work in "cleaning the dataset" or "manually editing the labels."
- Why unresolved: The current dataset relies entirely on synthetic, automated labeling which introduces noise (e.g., ambiguous descriptions), making it difficult to isolate model architectural limitations from data quality limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation showing performance differences between the current model and a model trained on a human-curated, high-quality subset of the dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed temporal denoising U-Net be modified to handle variable-length time series generation without fixed interpolation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section identifies "generating time series of different lengths from the same model" as a specific outstanding issue and current constraint of the method.
- Why unresolved: The architecture currently enforces a fixed 100-step output via specific 1D convolutional and transposed convolutional layers, requiring all other data to be resampled or interpolated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful generation of time series matching input text descriptions at varying lengths (e.g., 50, 200, 500 steps) using a single trained model instance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between the semantic novelty of a prompt and the model's ability to generate structurally accurate time series?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section notes "limitations on the prompts," and Figure 7 demonstrates a failure case where a prompt ("cat's ear") was "too far outside what could be found in the dataset."
- Why unresolved: It is undetermined whether failure on abstract or novel prompts is due to the lack of specific training examples or fundamental limitations in the BERT embeddings' ability to map novel linguistic concepts to temporal features.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study testing generation quality on out-of-distribution abstract prompts as the diversity of the training set's "Creative" and "Resembles" categories is systematically increased.

## Limitations
- Struggles with highly unconventional prompts, indicating restricted generalization beyond training distribution
- Quality of generated time series depends heavily on specificity and clarity of input descriptions
- Fixed 100-step output length requires interpolation, limiting flexibility in handling variable-length time series
- Some descriptions in the dataset are ambiguous, potentially affecting evaluation reliability

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The model architecture (temporal diffusion with cross-attention) is technically sound and the basic functionality of generating time series from descriptions is demonstrated

**Medium confidence**: The quantitative evaluation metrics are valid but may not fully capture the quality and appropriateness of generated time series relative to descriptions

**Medium confidence**: The dataset creation methodology appears reasonable, though the potential ambiguity in descriptions could affect both training and evaluation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct qualitative human evaluation studies where domain experts assess whether generated time series meaningfully match their corresponding text descriptions across all description types (short, medium, long, creative, resemblance)

2. Test the model's generalization capabilities on truly out-of-distribution prompts by evaluating on descriptions that contain novel combinations of attributes not present in the training data

3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of the language model component versus the denoising U-Net alone in achieving the reported performance metrics
