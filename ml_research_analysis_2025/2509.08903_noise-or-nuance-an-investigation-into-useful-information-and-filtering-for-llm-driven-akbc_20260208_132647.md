# Noise or Nuance: An Investigation Into Useful Information and Filtering For LLM Driven AKBC

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.08903
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08903
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: LLM-generated entity facts improve initial generation but harm re-generation quality

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates improving LLM-driven knowledge base completion under constrained settings where techniques like RAG and fine-tuning are not allowed. The authors address three key challenges: generating candidate tail entities, filtering poor-quality triples, and parsing LLM responses. Their approach uses Qwen3-8B with three main components: initial generation with examples, re-generation with previous attempts, and filtration. The work demonstrates that even under strict constraints, strategic use of LLM capabilities can meaningfully improve knowledge base completion quality.

## Method Summary
The method employs a three-stage pipeline using Qwen3-8B via the transformers library. Initial generation uses relation-specific guide sentences and examples from a validation set, with entity facts added to improve performance. Re-generation incorporates previous attempts (up to 3 iterations) with optional additional information. Filtration uses judge-based scoring (0-100, averaged over three calls, accept if mean ≥50), translation-based checking, or consensus approaches. Parsing employs regex extraction for capitalized proper nouns with LLM fallback.

## Key Results
- Adding LLM-generated entity facts during initial generation improves F1 from 0.148 to 0.151, but hurts re-generation quality (drops to 0.136)
- Judge-based filtration achieves highest precision (.438) without ground truth access, with F1 of 0.360
- Regex extraction outperforms LLM-based parsing despite reduced flexibility, with F1 of 0.283 vs 0.133

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-generated entity facts improve initial generation but harm re-generation quality.
- Mechanism: Additional context acts as grounding when paired with correct examples (simulating RAG-like conditions), but introduces noise when combined with incorrect previous attempts during re-generation—the model conflates failed candidates with valid signal.
- Core assumption: The informational value of context depends on the quality of accompanying examples; incorrect examples create interference patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "additional information improves generation quality"
  - [section 4.1] Table 1 shows F1 improves from .148 to .151 for initial generation but drops to .136 for re-generation with added information
  - [corpus] Related work on noise in NLP (Revisiting Noise in NLP for CSS) suggests noise effects are task-context dependent
- Break condition: If examples provided are unrelated to the target relation type, additional facts may not improve generation regardless of correctness.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Judge-based filtration achieves highest precision without ground truth access.
- Mechanism: The LLM scores candidate triples (0-100) across three calls; averaging reduces variance from nonsensical responses. The judge's internal knowledge serves as a proxy for external verification, filtering candidates that violate semantic plausibility.
- Core assumption: The LLM's parametric knowledge contains sufficient signal to distinguish plausible from implausible triples for the tested relations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs can be effective at filtering poor quality triples"
  - [section 4.2] Table 4 shows Judge achieves F1 .360, Precision .438 vs base F1 .152
  - [corpus] Improved Evidence Extraction paper suggests LLM-based filtering benefits from consistency mechanisms
- Break condition: If the target entities or relations fall outside the LLM's training distribution, judge scores become unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Regex extraction outperforms LLM-based parsing despite reduced flexibility.
- Mechanism: Qwen3-8B produces consistent phrasing/punctuation patterns across generations. Regex reliably extracts capitalized sequences (proper nouns) while LLM fallback introduces inconsistent entity boundaries and hallucinated candidates.
- Core assumption: The target entities follow predictable formatting patterns (capitalized proper nouns) that regex can capture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] Table 5 shows Regex-only F1 .283 vs Regex+LLM fallback F1 .152 vs LLM-only F1 .133
  - [section 4.3] "the phrasing, punctuation, and capitalization was often consistent each time it was generated"
  - [corpus] Corpus lacks direct evidence on regex vs LLM parsing tradeoffs for entity extraction
- Break condition: If entities include non-standard naming (lowercase, special characters, multi-word phrases without clear boundaries), regex will fail silently.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Triple Completion (head, relation, tail)
  - Why needed here: The task requires predicting tail entities given head entity and relation; understanding this structure is essential for designing prompts and filters.
  - Quick check question: Given (Paris, capitalOf, ?), what type of entity should the model return?

- Concept: LLM-as-Judge paradigm
  - Why needed here: Without ground truth or external knowledge bases, the only quality signal comes from the LLM evaluating its own outputs—understanding scoring calibration is critical.
  - Quick check question: Why might averaging multiple judge scores at different temperatures reduce quality compared to consistent temperature?

- Concept: Precision-Recall tradeoff in filtering
  - Why needed here: Judge filtration maximizes precision (.438) but consensus maximizes recall (.341); choosing the right filter depends on downstream requirements.
  - Quick check question: If false positives are costly but missing valid triples is acceptable, which filter should you use?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Initial Generation -> Re-generation (optional) -> Filtration -> Parsing -> Output

- Critical path: Initial generation with relation-specific guides → Judge filtration → Regex-only parsing. This path achieved best reported F1 (.360 with judge filtration on judge-processed candidates).

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Custom entity/relation examples vs relation-generic: Custom improves F1 (.162 vs .152) but requires validation set access and similarity computation
  - Judge vs Consensus: Judge for precision-critical applications; Consensus for recall-critical applications requiring semantic deduplication
  - Regex vs LLM parsing: Regex for structured outputs with consistent formatting; LLM parsing only when semantic equivalence matching (e.g., "NYC" = "New York City") is required

- Failure signatures:
  - Re-generation with facts + incorrect examples: F1 drops below baseline (.136 vs .148)
  - LLM-based parsing: Introduces spurious entities, F1 .133 vs regex .283
  - Translation filter: Two-step process propagates errors, lowest recall (.290)
  - Multi-temperature judge: Non-numeric responses reduce reliability (F1 .290 vs .360 for consistent temperature)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Table 3: Compare relation-specific examples vs custom entity/relation examples vs relation guide on a 50-sample subset. Measure F1, precision, recall per relation type.
  2. Ablate filtration methods: Run identical candidate sets through Judge, Consensus, and Translate filters. Track rejected candidates and analyze failure modes for each.
  3. Parsing boundary test: Create synthetic responses with edge-case entities (hyphenated names, non-English characters, lowercase proper nouns). Compare regex vs LLM extraction accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the observed benefits of LLM-generated grounding and judge-based filtration generalize across different model architectures and parameter sizes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state in the conclusion that "exploration of whether these findings are consistent across different model types and sizes could prove beneficial in future work."
- Why unresolved: The experimental scope was restricted to a single model (Qwen3-8B) due to the constraints of the 2025 LM-KBC challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the three-component pipeline (generation, re-generation, filtration) using diverse model families (e.g., Llama, Mistral) and scales.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent can optimized prompt structures improve the utilization of grounding information compared to the "promptless" baseline used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes that "variations in prompt structure could yield better use of the information, as opposed to our usage which maintained a 'promptless' approach."
- Why unresolved: The authors intentionally minimized prompt engineering to isolate the impact of the information content itself.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of the current baseline against structured prompting strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) using the same generated facts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: In which specific data conditions does the flexibility of LLM-based consensus outweigh the consistency of deterministic regex extraction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude that "the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with LLM response parsing is setting dependent," finding regex superior for extraction but LLMs superior for consensus.
- Why unresolved: The study identified a split in performance (regex for extraction, LLM for consolidation) but did not define the boundary conditions where one approach definitively outperforms the other.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies on datasets with high semantic variance or formatting noise to identify the "tipping point" where regex fails and LLM flexibility becomes necessary.

## Limitations

- Experimental setup relies on proprietary LM-KBC 2025 challenge dataset with limited public details about relation distributions and entity characteristics
- Generation parameters (temperature, max tokens), exact prompt templates, and regex patterns are referenced but not fully detailed in the paper
- Study focuses on Qwen3-8B specifically, raising questions about generalizability to other LLM architectures or scales

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (mechanism supported by clear empirical evidence):
- Judge-based filtration achieves highest precision (.438) with statistically significant improvement over baseline
- Regex extraction outperforms LLM-based parsing (.283 vs .133 F1) with consistent performance across tested samples
- Custom entity/relation examples improve generation quality over relation-generic approaches (.162 vs .152 F1)

**Medium Confidence** (mechanism plausible but limited evidence):
- LLM-generated entity facts improve initial generation but harm re-generation quality—based on single comparative experiment
- Consensus filtering maximizes recall (.341) through semantic deduplication—tradeoff requires domain-specific validation
- Relation-specific guides improve performance over generic prompts—effect size modest and context-dependent

**Low Confidence** (mechanism speculative or insufficiently tested):
- Re-generation with previous attempts provides meaningful quality gains—no ablation study comparing with/without re-generation
- Judge averaging across multiple calls reduces variance—only tested with 3 calls, alternative aggregation methods unexamined
- LLM knowledge serves as reliable quality proxy—assumes training data coverage matches target domain

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Apply the complete pipeline to an open-source knowledge base completion dataset (e.g., FB15k-237 or WN18RR) and compare performance against published baselines. Measure whether judge-based filtration maintains precision advantages across different relation types and entity distributions.

2. **Prompt Engineering Ablation**: Systematically vary generation prompt structures (remove relation guides, remove examples, remove entity facts) while holding LLM architecture constant. Quantify the marginal contribution of each prompt component to F1 and identify failure modes when components are absent.

3. **Cross-Architecture Validation**: Replicate the filtration and parsing experiments using different LLM architectures (Llama-3, GPT-3.5) at comparable parameter counts. Test whether judge-based filtration maintains precision advantages and whether regex parsing remains superior when LLM-generated outputs follow different formatting conventions.
