# MM-Verify: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought Verification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.13383
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13383
- **Authors**: Linzhuang Sun; Hao Liang; Jingxuan Wei; Bihui Yu; Tianpeng Li; Fan Yang; Zenan Zhou; Wentao Zhang
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Key outcome**: MM-Verifier outperforms all larger models on MathCheck, MathVista, and MathVerse benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MM-Verify, a framework for enhancing multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification. The authors address the lack of strong multimodal verifiers and insufficient long CoT reasoning data in the multimodal domain. They propose a two-step MM verification data synthesis method combining simulation-based tree search with verification and rejection sampling to generate high-quality CoT data. This data is used to fine-tune the MM-Verifier model. Additionally, they present a method to synthesize MMCOT data by bridging the gap between text-based and multimodal reasoning, which is used to train the MM-Reasoner. The MM-Verifier outperforms all larger models on MathCheck, MathVista, and MathVerse benchmarks. The MM-Reasoner demonstrates strong effectiveness and scalability, with performance improving as data size increases. The combined approach achieves an accuracy of 65.3 on MathVista, surpassing GPT-4o (63.8) with 12 rollouts.

## Method Summary
The MM-Verify framework employs a two-step data synthesis methodology to address the scarcity of multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning data. First, simulation-based tree search with verification and rejection sampling generates high-quality CoT data for training the MM-Verifier model. Second, a method bridges the gap between text-based and multimodal reasoning to synthesize MMCOT data for training the MM-Reasoner. The framework combines these components to verify and improve multimodal reasoning outputs through iterative refinement, achieving superior performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to larger models including GPT-4o.

## Key Results
- MM-Verifier outperforms all larger models on MathCheck, MathVista, and MathVerse benchmarks
- MM-Reasoner demonstrates strong effectiveness and scalability with performance improving as data size increases
- Combined approach achieves 65.3 accuracy on MathVista, surpassing GPT-4o (63.8) with 12 rollouts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MM-Verify works by addressing the fundamental challenge of verifying multimodal reasoning chains through specialized synthetic data generation. The two-step approach creates high-quality training data that captures the complexity of multimodal reasoning tasks, allowing the verifier to learn robust validation patterns. By bridging the gap between text-based and multimodal reasoning, the framework can leverage existing reasoning capabilities while adapting them to multimodal contexts. The iterative verification process enables the model to identify and correct reasoning errors that would otherwise propagate through the solution chain.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal reasoning**: Understanding how models process and integrate information from multiple input modalities (why needed: core capability being enhanced; quick check: can the model answer questions requiring visual and textual information)
- **Chain-of-Thought verification**: The process of validating intermediate reasoning steps in a solution chain (why needed: ensures accuracy of complex reasoning; quick check: can the model identify errors in its own reasoning process)
- **Simulation-based tree search**: Algorithmic approach for exploring solution spaces through simulated reasoning paths (why needed: generates synthetic training data; quick check: does the search cover relevant reasoning patterns)
- **Rejection sampling**: Statistical method for selecting high-quality samples from a larger pool (why needed: improves data quality for training; quick check: what percentage of generated samples are rejected)
- **Cross-modal knowledge transfer**: Adapting reasoning capabilities from text-only to multimodal contexts (why needed: leverages existing reasoning strengths; quick check: performance improvement when transitioning between modalities)
- **Iterative refinement**: Repeatedly verifying and improving reasoning outputs (why needed: catches and corrects errors; quick check: does accuracy improve with multiple verification passes)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: MM-Reasoner -> MM-Verifier -> Output refinement -> Final answer

**Critical path**: Input data → MM-Reasoner generates reasoning chain → MM-Verifier validates chain → Rejection/revision → Output

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency for accuracy by implementing multiple verification passes. The synthetic data generation approach prioritizes quality over quantity, potentially limiting the diversity of training examples. The focus on mathematical domains may restrict generalization to other multimodal reasoning tasks.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Over-reliance on synthetic data may lead to overfitting to generated patterns
- Performance degradation on non-mathematical multimodal tasks
- Computational overhead from multiple verification passes
- Potential bias in tree search exploration favoring certain solution types

**First experiments**:
1. Test MM-Verifier on held-out mathematical problems not seen during training
2. Evaluate reasoning chain quality using human annotators on sample problems
3. Compare performance with varying numbers of verification rollouts (1, 5, 12, 20)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on synthetic data generation with no explicit validation of realism
- Reported gains over GPT-4o are modest (65.3 vs 63.8 on MathVista)
- Limited evidence of generalization beyond mathematical domains
- 12 rollouts specification lacks justification for this particular choice

## Confidence
- **MM-Verifier superiority claims**: High confidence based on benchmark results, but tempered by unknown synthetic data quality
- **MM-Reasoner effectiveness and scalability**: Medium confidence due to correlation between data size and performance, but causal mechanism unclear
- **Two-step data synthesis methodology**: Medium confidence as innovative approach, but practical limitations and biases not thoroughly explored

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MM-Verify on non-mathematical multimodal reasoning tasks to assess domain generalization beyond MathCheck, MathVista, and MathVerse benchmarks

2. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of rollouts and the quality of synthetic data to determine optimal parameters and identify potential overfitting to synthetic training distribution

3. Compare MM-Verify's reasoning transparency and error patterns against human-annotated reasoning chains on the same problems to validate interpretability and reliability of Chain-of-Thought verification process
