# SeC: Advancing Complex Video Object Segmentation via Progressive Concept Construction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.15852
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15852
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces SeC framework achieving 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS benchmark

## Executive Summary
Video Object Segmentation (VOS) remains challenging for current methods due to their reliance on appearance matching, which struggles with visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. SeC addresses these limitations by shifting from conventional feature matching to a concept-driven approach that constructs and utilizes high-level, object-centric representations. The framework leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across frames and build robust conceptual priors for segmentation tasks.

The proposed SeC framework introduces a progressive concept construction mechanism that forms comprehensive semantic representations of targets, enabling robust segmentation across challenging scenarios. By adaptively balancing LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, SeC dynamically adjusts computational efforts based on scene complexity. The introduction of the SeCVOS benchmark, comprising 160 manually annotated videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations, provides a rigorous evaluation framework for assessing concept-aware video object segmentation methods.

## Method Summary
SeC is a concept-driven video object segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. The framework employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, enabling robust segmentation of subsequent frames. The method adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity.

## Key Results
- SeC achieves 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on the newly introduced SeCVOS benchmark
- Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches including SAM 2 and its advanced variants on both SeCVOS and standard VOS benchmarks
- Demonstrates robust segmentation capabilities in scenarios requiring high-level conceptual reasoning and semantic understanding
- Introduces SeCVOS benchmark with 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SeC works by shifting the VOS paradigm from appearance-based matching to concept-driven reasoning. By leveraging LVLMs for semantic understanding, the framework can maintain object identity across drastic visual changes that would confuse traditional appearance-based methods. The progressive concept construction allows the model to build increasingly robust representations as more frames are processed, while the adaptive balancing mechanism ensures computational efficiency by allocating resources based on scene complexity rather than applying uniform processing to all frames.

## Foundational Learning
**Video Object Segmentation (VOS)**: The task of tracking and segmenting target objects across video frames. Why needed: Forms the foundational problem that SeC aims to solve with improved semantic understanding. Quick check: Can the model maintain object identity across occlusions and appearance changes?

**Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)**: AI models that integrate visual and textual information to provide semantic understanding. Why needed: Enables concept-driven reasoning beyond pure visual features, crucial for handling complex scene transformations. Quick check: Does LVLM integration improve segmentation consistency across drastic appearance changes?

**Concept-Driven Representation**: High-level, object-centric representations that capture semantic meaning rather than just visual features. Why needed: Allows models to maintain object identity despite significant visual variations, mimicking human-like understanding. Quick check: Can the model recognize the same object when it undergoes substantial appearance changes?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Frames -> LVLM Processing -> Concept Construction -> Semantic Representation -> Adaptive Balancing -> Feature Matching -> Segmentation Output

**Critical Path**: The core workflow involves processing frames through LVLMs to construct conceptual priors, forming semantic representations, then applying adaptive balancing between semantic reasoning and feature matching for final segmentation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: SeC trades computational overhead from LVLM integration for improved semantic understanding and robustness to visual variations. The adaptive balancing mechanism optimizes resource allocation but may require careful tuning for different video domains.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include incorrect LVLM outputs leading to faulty conceptual priors, computational bottlenecks when processing complex scenes, and suboptimal balancing between semantic reasoning and feature matching in scenarios where the adaptive mechanism misjudges scene complexity.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate SeC against SAM 2.1 on standard VOS benchmarks to establish performance improvements
2. SeCVOS validation: Test SeC on the newly introduced benchmark to demonstrate concept-aware segmentation capabilities
3. Ablation study: Assess the contribution of individual components (LVLM integration, adaptive balancing) to overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on LVLMs introduces computational overhead and dependency on LVLM output quality
- Performance gains need validation on broader real-world scenarios beyond the curated SeCVOS benchmark
- Adaptive balancing mechanism effectiveness across diverse domains requires further validation
