# Town Hall Debate Prompting: Enhancing Logical Reasoning in LLMs through Multi-Persona Interaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15725
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: Town Hall Debate Prompting (THDP) with 5 personas improved logical reasoning accuracy by up to 13% in GPT-4o and 9% in Claude 3.5 Sonnet on grid-based reasoning tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Town Hall Debate Prompting (THDP), a novel approach that enhances logical reasoning in large language models by simulating a structured multi-persona debate. The method divides a single LLM into multiple debating personas that engage in three rounds of structured argumentation, followed by a voting mechanism to reach a conclusion. Tested on the ZebraLogic benchmark—a grid-based logical reasoning task—THDP demonstrates significant improvements over traditional one-shot chain-of-thought prompting, particularly in models with stronger reasoning capabilities like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

The approach leverages the natural strengths of LLMs in perspective-taking and argumentation to improve problem-solving performance without requiring multiple agents or models. By creating a structured debate environment, THDP allows diverse reasoning strategies to compete and converge on optimal solutions. The method shows that larger models benefit more substantially from this approach, suggesting that THDP amplifies existing reasoning capabilities rather than compensating for fundamental limitations in smaller models.

## Method Summary
Town Hall Debate Prompting works by splitting a single LLM into multiple distinct personas that debate a reasoning problem across three structured rounds. Each persona presents initial arguments, responds to counterarguments, and provides rebuttals in sequence. After the debate concludes, a voting mechanism determines the most convincing solution. The method was specifically tested on ZebraLogic, a benchmark consisting of grid-based logical puzzles where agents must deduce relationships between entities based on given clues. The personas are carefully engineered to represent diverse perspectives and reasoning approaches, creating a simulated town hall environment where different problem-solving strategies compete and converge.

## Key Results
- THDP with 5 personas achieved up to 13% improvement in per-cell accuracy for GPT-4o compared to one-shot chain-of-thought prompting
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed 9% improvement in puzzle accuracy with THDP on ZebraLogic benchmark
- Hard puzzle accuracy improved from 10-15% baseline to higher levels with THDP implementation
- Larger models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet benefited more than smaller models such as GPT-4o Mini

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging the LLM's ability to simulate multiple perspectives and engage in structured reasoning. By creating distinct personas with different reasoning approaches, THDP forces the model to examine problems from multiple angles simultaneously. The three-round debate structure allows initial ideas to be challenged, refined, and defended, mimicking the cognitive benefits of collaborative problem-solving. The voting mechanism serves as a meta-reasoning layer that helps converge on the most robust solution by aggregating the strengths of different reasoning strategies. This approach essentially creates an internal jury deliberation process that can identify and reinforce the strongest logical arguments while filtering out weaker ones.

## Foundational Learning

**Grid-based logical reasoning**: The ZebraLogic benchmark uses constraint satisfaction problems where entities must be placed on a grid based on logical clues. This requires systematic deduction and elimination strategies. Why needed: Provides a standardized way to measure reasoning improvements. Quick check: Verify that THDP improvements transfer to other reasoning domains.

**Chain-of-thought prompting**: Traditional approach where models generate reasoning steps sequentially. Why needed: Serves as the baseline comparison for THDP. Quick check: Ensure baseline CoT performance is properly established before testing THDP.

**Multi-persona simulation**: Technique of having a single model adopt different roles or perspectives. Why needed: Enables debate dynamics without multiple agents. Quick check: Confirm that personas remain distinct and don't merge into similar reasoning patterns.

**Structured debate mechanics**: Three-round format with initial arguments, counterarguments, and rebuttals. Why needed: Provides framework for systematic reasoning improvement. Quick check: Test whether fewer or more debate rounds affect performance.

**Voting-based consensus**: Meta-reasoning mechanism to select best solution from debate outcomes. Why needed: Creates final decision-making process that aggregates diverse perspectives. Quick check: Analyze voting patterns to understand which reasoning strategies dominate.

Critical path: The debate rounds represent the critical path where reasoning quality is developed. Each round must complete before the next begins, and the quality of initial arguments directly impacts the effectiveness of subsequent counterarguments and rebuttals.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades computational efficiency for reasoning quality, as multi-round debates require more processing than single-shot approaches. There's also a tradeoff between the number of personas (more diversity vs. increased complexity and potential for conflict) and the depth of each debate round (more thorough reasoning vs. longer processing time).

Failure signatures: Common failure modes include persona convergence where all voices become similar, circular arguments that don't progress toward solutions, and voting deadlocks where no clear consensus emerges. These typically manifest as repetitive or contradictory outputs that don't improve upon baseline performance.

First experiments: 1) Test THDP with varying numbers of personas (2-10) to find optimal debate size. 2) Compare different debate structures (2 rounds vs. 3 rounds vs. 4 rounds) to optimize reasoning depth. 3) Evaluate persona specialization strategies (experts in different reasoning types vs. generalists) to maximize diverse perspectives.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are limited to grid-based reasoning tasks on the ZebraLogic benchmark, raising questions about generalizability to other problem domains
- Performance improvements may be partly attributed to more detailed prompt engineering rather than the debate mechanism itself
- The method can lead to divergence or inconsistent outputs when applied to weaker LLMs that lack sufficient reasoning capabilities

## Confidence
- THDP improves logical reasoning accuracy: Medium
- Larger models benefit more from THDP: Medium
- THDP provides diverse perspectives without multiple agents: High

## Next Checks
1. Test THDP on diverse reasoning benchmarks beyond grid-based puzzles, including mathematical reasoning, commonsense inference, and symbolic manipulation tasks to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct ablation studies comparing THDP against simpler multi-turn prompting strategies to isolate the specific contribution of the debate mechanism versus additional prompting structure.

3. Evaluate the robustness of THDP by testing with different persona configurations (varying numbers, personality types, and expertise areas) to identify optimal debate dynamics for reasoning tasks.
