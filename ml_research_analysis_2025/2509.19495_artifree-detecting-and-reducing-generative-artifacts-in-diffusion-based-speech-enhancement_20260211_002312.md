# ArtiFree: Detecting and Reducing Generative Artifacts in Diffusion-based Speech Enhancement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.19495
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19495
- Reference count: 0
- High perceptual scores but degraded ASR performance due to generative artifacts like phoneme hallucinations, hiss, and breathing sounds

## Executive Summary
This work addresses a critical issue in diffusion-based speech enhancement: generative artifacts that degrade ASR performance despite high perceptual scores. The authors propose detecting artifacts using variance in speech embeddings across multiple diffusion samples, which correlates with regions of high uncertainty and hallucination. They introduce an ensemble inference method guided by semantic consistency, selecting the most phonetically stable output across multiple samples to reduce WER by up to 15% in low-SNR conditions. Additionally, they analyze the effect of diffusion steps, showing that adaptive step counts can reduce inference latency by 27% while maintaining perceptual quality.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes three strategies to detect and reduce generative artifacts in diffusion-based speech enhancement. First, they use variance in wav2vec 2.0 embeddings across multiple diffusion samples to identify artifact regions with high accuracy. Second, they implement ensemble inference where the most semantically consistent sample is selected from multiple diffusion outputs to filter out hallucinations. Third, they analyze the impact of diffusion steps on hallucination rates and latency, proposing adaptive step counts based on input SNR. The method leverages semantic priors to guide diffusion models toward artifact-free, ASR-friendly outputs without retraining.

## Key Results
- Embedding variance detects artifacts with 100% accuracy using thresholds of 0.0067-0.0095
- Ensemble selection reduces WER by 14-16% using centrality heuristic and 7-15% using noisy correlation
- Adaptive diffusion steps reduce inference latency by 27% while maintaining perceptual quality
- Variance-based detection and ensemble selection work effectively in low-SNR conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Embedding Variance as Artifact Predictor
Diffusion models sample stochastically from the posterior; regions where the model is uncertain (low SNR) produce divergent phonetic content across runs. Wav2vec embeddings capture phonetic structure, so computing frame-level variance across S samples identifies temporally localized artifact regions. Hallucinations vary across diffusion runs while genuine content remains consistent.

### Mechanism 2: Semantic Consistency-Based Ensemble Selection
Generate S enhanced outputs, extract embeddings for each, compute pairwise correlations, and select the sample closest to the ensemble centroid (or most correlated with noisy input). This favors outputs where phonetic content is stable across runs, filtering stochastic hallucinations.

### Mechanism 3: Adaptive Reverse Diffusion Steps for Quality-Latency Trade-off
Fewer denoising steps limit stochastic updates, reducing opportunities for hallucinations. Lower N directly reduces RTF linearly. Adaptive schedules allocate fewer steps to high-SNR inputs (where less enhancement needed) and moderate steps to low-SNR inputs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion-based speech enhancement (score-based generative models)**: Understanding that diffusion SE samples from posterior distribution explains stochastic output variability and motivates ensemble approaches.
  - Why needed: Explains why same input produces different outputs across runs
  - Quick check: Can you explain why the same noisy input produces different outputs across diffusion runs?

- **Self-supervised speech embeddings (wav2vec 2.0)**: The paper relies on wav2vec embeddings to capture phonetic similarity; understanding what these embeddings encode is essential for interpreting variance and correlation metrics.
  - Why needed: Critical for understanding how variance indicates phoneme errors
  - Quick check: What linguistic information does wav2vec 2.0 primarily capture, and why would variance in these embeddings indicate phoneme errors?

- **Perceptual vs. semantic evaluation metrics**: The paper shows PESQ/STOI correlate poorly with phoneme artifacts; understanding this gap motivates the proposed detection method.
  - Why needed: Explains why high PESQ can still yield poor ASR performance
  - Quick check: Why might a speech enhancement output score high on PESQ but still cause ASR errors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Diffusion SE backbone -> Wav2vec 2.0 encoder -> Variance calculator -> Correlation matrix builder -> Selection heuristic module -> Adaptive N scheduler

- **Critical path**:
  1. Estimate input SNR → select N from adaptive schedule
  2. Run diffusion model S times with different seeds → S enhanced waveforms
  3. Extract embeddings for all S outputs
  4. Compute variance → flag artifact-prone inputs (optional early exit or logging)
  5. Compute correlation matrix → select optimal output via chosen heuristic
  6. Return selected enhanced audio

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Ensemble size S: Larger S improves selection quality but increases latency linearly. Paper shows S=3–5 practical.
  - Diffusion steps N: Lower N reduces latency and hallucinations but may reduce PESQ. Paper recommends SNR-adaptive schedules.
  - Selection heuristic: Ensemble centrality is fully reference-free; noisy correlation assumes artifacts not present in input (may fail if input has phoneme errors).
  - Encoder choice: Wav2vec chosen for phonetic encoding; other encoders may not capture phoneme-level variance as effectively.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High variance but low WER improvement: Encoder may not capture phonetic structure; try alternative self-supervised models.
  - All ensemble members produce similar artifacts: Stochastic selection cannot help; consider training-time regularization or different backbone.
  - PESQ drops unacceptably with low N: Threshold N too low for input SNR distribution; recalibrate adaptive schedule.
  - Latency still too high with S=3: Reduce N further or consider caching strategies.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline replication: Run SGMSE on VoiceBank-DEMAND test set with N=30, S=1; measure PESQ, WER, RTF to establish reference points.
  2. Variance-artifact correlation: Generate S=5 samples per input, compute embedding variance, correlate with ground-truth phoneme errors (using forced alignment or manual labels) to validate detection claim on your data.
  3. Ensemble size sweep: Test S∈{3,5,7} with ensemble centrality selection on low-SNR subset; plot WER vs. RTF to find practical operating point for your latency budget.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method is tested primarily on VoiceBank-DEMAND; generalization to other domains (e.g., music, telephony) is unverified.
- No streaming/real-time implementation analysis; latency claims assume offline batch processing.
- Embedding variance assumes phonetic errors are stochastic and vary across diffusion runs; if errors are systematic, the method may fail to detect them.

## Confidence
- Embedding variance predicts artifacts: Medium
- Ensemble selection reduces WER by 15%: High
- Adaptive steps reduce latency by 27%: Medium
- Variance thresholds 0.0067-0.0095 work universally: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test artifact detection across diverse datasets (e.g., DNS-Challenge, Librispeech) to verify variance-based detection generalizes beyond VoiceBank-DEMAND.
2. Implement real-time streaming variant and measure actual end-to-end latency on embedded hardware to validate offline claims.
3. Ablate encoder choice by replacing wav2vec with HuBERT or APC to assess sensitivity of variance-based detection to embedding quality.
