- Primary result: Wav2Vec2-Conformer with complete fine-tuning achieved up to 90% accuracy in classifying hair type and moisture conditions using acoustic scattering

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that acoustic scattering can classify complex objects using deep learning on scattered sound fields, specifically applied to hair assessment. The approach captures incident acoustic waves interacting with hair samples on mannequin heads, recording scattered signals to encode structural and material properties. Four deep learning methods were benchmarked: fully supervised ResNet-50, embedding-based VGGish-XGB, supervised AST fine-tuning, and self-supervised Wav2Vec2-Conformer fine-tuning. Wav2Vec2-Conformer with complete fine-tuning achieved the highest performance, reaching up to 90% accuracy in classifying hair type and moisture conditions. The results validate acoustic scattering as a privacy-preserving, non-contact alternative to visual classification, with potential for broader industrial applications in material analysis, quality control, and beyond.

## Method Summary
The method uses exponential sine sweep (ESS) acoustic waves to interrogate hair samples on mannequin heads, recording the superposition of incident and scattered fields. Four deep learning architectures were evaluated: ResNet-50 with mel-spectrograms, VGGish embeddings with XGBoost, AST with spectrogram patches, and Wav2Vec2-Conformer with raw waveform input. Self-supervised learning models pre-trained on Librispeech were fine-tuned on the acoustic scattering data, with complete fine-tuning of all parameters outperforming partial fine-tuning that froze early layers.

## Key Results
- Wav2Vec2-Conformer with complete fine-tuning achieved highest accuracy at up to 90% for hair classification
- Complete fine-tuning outperformed partial fine-tuning (freezing CNN feature extractor) by 3-4% absolute accuracy
- The approach successfully classified hair type and moisture conditions from acoustic scattering data
- ResNet-50 provided faster training but lower performance compared to SSL-based approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
When an incident wave interacts with an object, it generates a scattered acoustic field encoding structural and material properties. The total recorded field (u = u_inc + u_s) contains a superposition of the direct incident wave and object-specific scattered information. Deep learning models learn to map time-frequency representations of this total field to object classes. The scattered component (u_s) introduces sufficiently distinct and detectable perturbations relative to the incident wave (u_inc) for the target classes.

### Mechanism 2
Self-supervised learning (SSL) models pre-trained on generic audio (speech) provide superior feature representations for acoustic scattering classification compared to models trained from scratch. The Wav2Vec2-Conformer model, pre-trained on 960 hours of Librispeech, learns robust universal audio representations (spectral, temporal features). Fine-tuning adapts these pre-learned features to the specific acoustic scattering domain. The architecture combines CNN layers (local feature extraction) with Conformer/attention layers (global context), which the paper identifies as critical. Audio features learned from speech transfer positively to the continuous, broadband nature of scattered sweep signals.

### Mechanism 3
Adapting the entire SSL model, including its initial feature extractor, is necessary for optimal performance on scattering data. Complete fine-tuning allows the low-level CNN filters to adapt from speech-specific features to scattering-specific features (e.g., fine-grained spectral ripples from the ESS stimulus). The optimal low-level audio features for scattering are different from those for speech, requiring adaptation of all model parameters rather than just the classifier layers.

## Foundational Learning

- **Acoustic Scattering & Superposition (u = u_inc + u_s)**: This is the core physical principle. You must understand that the "signal" is a modification of a known incident wave, and the goal is to extract the object's contribution. Quick check: If you only recorded the incident wave without any object present, how would you use it to isolate the scattered component u_s?

- **Exponential Sine Sweep (ESS) Stimulus**: ESS is the "interrogation signal." Its design (frequency range, duration) directly determines what physical properties can be probed and the achieved signal-to-noise ratio. Quick check: Why is an exponential sweep (frequency increases logarithmically) often preferred over a linear sweep for room acoustics or impulse response measurement?

- **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) & Wav2Vec 2.0**: The best results come from a large SSL model. You need to grasp that SSL learns powerful representations from unlabeled audio by solving pretext tasks (e.g., masked prediction), which then transfer to your downstream task. Quick check: What is the primary advantage of using a self-supervised model pre-trained on a massive dataset versus training a CNN (like ResNet-50) from scratch on a small dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Speaker emits ESS (5s) -> Scattering Object -> Microphone records superposed signal -> Cross-correlation for alignment -> Segmentation into 5s samples -> Resampling to 48kHz -> Model-dependent feature extraction -> Core model (CNN/Transformer/SSL) -> Linear classifier

- **Critical path**: Data collection (controlled environment, consistent positioning) -> Accurate signal alignment (cross-correlation) -> Model selection (Wav2Vec2-Conformer with complete fine-tuning)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - ResNet-50: Faster training, interpretable spectrogram features, but lower performance
  - Wav2Vec2-Conformer: Highest performance, leverages SSL knowledge, but massive (593.6M params), computationally expensive, and requires careful fine-tuning
  - Partial vs. Complete Fine-Tuning: Freezing the CNN extractor is faster and prevents catastrophic forgetting of low-level features, but updating it (complete fine-tuning) yields better adaptation to the novel scattering domain

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low Accuracy on All Models: Check data collection quality (room noise, speaker/mic positioning). The scattering signal may be too weak
  - High Variance (± std in results): Likely an overfitting or data leakage issue. Ensure round-robin cross-validation is correctly implemented by recording rounds
  - VGGish-XGB underperforms: The VGGish embeddings, trained on AudioSet (general sounds), may not capture the subtle physics of scattering
  - AST underperforms vs. Wav2Vec2: The AST's spectrogram patch-based attention may miss the fine-grained temporal dynamics that Wav2Vec2's convolutions capture well

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline Reproduction: Implement the ResNet-50 pipeline (spectrogram -> classification) to establish a baseline and validate the data loader and preprocessing
  2. SSL Fine-Tuning Ablation: Implement Wav2Vec2-Conformer and directly compare partial fine-tuning vs. complete fine-tuning to verify the paper's finding on your data
  3. Generalization Test: Train on data from mannequins A & B and test on MAMI & MINAYO (as in Task 2). This stress-tests the model's ability to generalize the underlying physical property (moisture) independent of the specific hair sample

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Controlled lab environment with mannequins differs substantially from real-world hair assessment conditions
- Performance metrics show high variance (±0.11 for Task 2), suggesting sensitivity to data quality or model initialization
- The 90% accuracy figure applies specifically to mannequin hair samples under controlled acoustic conditions, not human subjects or field applications

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core finding that Wav2Vec2-Conformer with complete fine-tuning outperforms other approaches on this specific dataset
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that acoustic scattering can encode structural and material properties detectable by deep learning
- **Low confidence**: The broader assertion that this approach generalizes to diverse industrial applications without additional validation studies

## Next Checks
1. Cross-environment validation: Test the trained models on hair samples in uncontrolled environments with varying background noise, humidity, and positioning to assess real-world robustness
2. Human subject validation: Validate classification accuracy on actual human hair samples with varying textures, colors, and styling products that weren't present in mannequin data
3. Feature attribution analysis: Apply interpretability methods (e.g., Grad-CAM on spectrograms or attention visualization in Conformer layers) to verify that the model learns physically meaningful acoustic scattering patterns rather than dataset artifacts
