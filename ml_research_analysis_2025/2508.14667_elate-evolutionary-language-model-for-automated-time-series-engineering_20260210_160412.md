# ELATE: Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.14667
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14667
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Automated feature engineering for time-series forecasting using LLM-guided evolutionary framework

## Executive Summary
ELATE introduces an automated feature engineering method for time-series forecasting that combines large language models with evolutionary algorithms. The approach uses time-series statistical measures to guide LLM suggestions for feature transformations, which are then refined through an iterative evolutionary process. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to baseline models, with ELATE achieving 8.4% lower RMSE and 9.6% lower MAE on average.

## Method Summary
ELATE employs an evolutionary framework centered around a large language model that proposes feature transformations guided by time-series statistical measures like Granger causality and mutual information. The LLM suggests contextually relevant transformations while an evolutionary process iteratively refines and prunes features based on their importance. This approach automatically discovers meaningful feature representations for time-series forecasting without requiring extensive domain expertise or manual feature engineering.

## Key Results
- 8.4% average improvement in RMSE compared to baseline models
- 9.6% average improvement in MAE compared to baseline models
- Outperforms LSTM, tsfresh, and vest on multiple datasets
- Demonstrates efficiency and interpretability across domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the LLM's ability to understand contextual relationships in time-series data while using evolutionary algorithms to optimize feature selection. Statistical measures provide quantitative guidance for the LLM's suggestions, ensuring transformations are grounded in data relationships. The iterative refinement process allows the system to discover non-obvious feature interactions that improve forecasting performance beyond what manual feature engineering or traditional automated methods can achieve.

## Foundational Learning
- Time-series statistical measures (Granger causality, mutual information): Why needed - to quantify relationships between variables and guide feature selection. Quick check - verify these measures correctly identify meaningful temporal dependencies.
- Evolutionary algorithms: Why needed - to iteratively improve feature sets through selection, mutation, and pruning operations. Quick check - ensure convergence and diversity in generated feature populations.
- Large language models for feature engineering: Why needed - to leverage contextual understanding for proposing relevant transformations. Quick check - validate LLM suggestions align with domain knowledge and statistical guidance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Time-series data -> Statistical measures -> LLM suggestion engine -> Evolutionary refinement -> Pruned feature set -> Forecasting model

**Critical Path:** Data preprocessing -> Statistical analysis -> LLM-guided transformation proposal -> Feature evaluation -> Evolutionary selection/pruning -> Final feature set generation

**Design Tradeoffs:** LLM-based suggestions provide contextual relevance but increase computational cost versus pure statistical approaches. Evolutionary refinement balances exploration of new features against exploitation of known good features. The system trades some interpretability for automation and potentially better performance.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor statistical guidance may lead to irrelevant LLM suggestions. Ineffective evolutionary parameters could result in premature convergence or excessive computation. Insufficient pruning may cause feature bloat and overfitting. Domain mismatch may produce transformations that don't generalize well.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare statistical measure-guided LLM suggestions versus random or heuristic-based approaches on a simple dataset
2. Test different evolutionary parameters (population size, mutation rates, pruning thresholds) on dataset performance
3. Evaluate the impact of removing LLM guidance entirely to measure its contribution to accuracy improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lacks detailed methodological specifications for LLM suggestion generation and evolutionary operations
- Computational costs of LLM-based evolutionary process are not reported
- Limited benchmarking against other automated feature engineering approaches specifically designed for time-series

## Confidence

**High confidence in:**
- Core conceptual framework of LLM-guided evolutionary search for time-series feature engineering
- General finding that automated feature engineering improves forecasting accuracy

**Medium confidence in:**
- Specific quantitative improvements (8.4% RMSE, 9.6% MAE)
- Claim of superior performance over stated baselines

**Low confidence in:**
- Efficiency claims without computational cost data
- Generalizability across all domains
- Practical interpretability of generated features

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of LLM guidance versus evolutionary search versus statistical measures, and quantify computational overhead of each component.

2. Implement ELATE on additional datasets with different characteristics (longer series, higher frequency, different domains) to test generalizability beyond the 7 datasets presented.

3. Perform head-to-head comparisons against other automated feature engineering methods specifically designed for time-series to establish true state-of-the-art position.
