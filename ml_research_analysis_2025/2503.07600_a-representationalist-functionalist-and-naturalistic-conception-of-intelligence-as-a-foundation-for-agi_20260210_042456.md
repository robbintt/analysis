# A Representationalist, Functionalist and Naturalistic Conception of Intelligence as a Foundation for AGI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.07600
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07600
- Authors: Rolf Pfister
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Proposes a representationalist, functionalist, and naturalistic conception of intelligence for AGI foundation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a theoretical framework for artificial general intelligence (AGI) based on a representationalist, functionalist, and naturalistic conception of intelligence. The approach defines intelligence as the ability to create novel skills that achieve goals under previously unknown conditions, relying on perception to obtain indirect representations of the world. The framework argues that AGI can be built without requiring mental features like consciousness or intentionality, allowing for a purely naturalistic interpretation. It suggests that AGI systems could potentially access the world more fundamentally than humans by being less constrained by preconceived interpretations.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a theoretical framework that integrates perception, reasoning methods (deduction, induction, abduction), abstraction, and classification to create world models. The approach is representationalist in its reliance on indirect representations of the world, functionalist in evaluating world models based on their viability for achieving goals, and naturalistic in dispensing with mental features like consciousness. The framework is grounded in philosophical foundations while maintaining computational tractability.

## Key Results
- Intelligence defined as novel skill creation under unknown conditions
- AGI can be achieved through representationalist approaches without requiring consciousness or intentionality
- World model viability is functionally determined by goal achievement potential
- No Free Lunch theorems constrain AGI by requiring assumptions about the environment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by establishing a clear theoretical foundation that bridges philosophical concepts of intelligence with computational requirements for AGI. By defining intelligence through observable capabilities (novel skill creation) rather than mental states (consciousness, intentionality), the framework creates a naturalistic path for AGI development. The integration of perception, reasoning, and abstraction provides a systematic method for building world models that can adapt to novel conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- Representationalism: Understanding that knowledge is based on representations rather than direct access to reality
  - Why needed: Provides theoretical basis for AGI systems that operate through models rather than direct perception
  - Quick check: Can the system distinguish between representation and reality?
- Functionalism: Evaluating mental states by their functional roles rather than their intrinsic properties
  - Why needed: Allows AGI evaluation based on performance rather than consciousness
  - Quick check: Does the system's output demonstrate goal achievement?
- Naturalism: Rejecting supernatural or non-physical explanations for intelligence
  - Why needed: Establishes that AGI can be built without invoking consciousness or intentionality
  - Quick check: Can the system be fully explained through physical processes?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Perception -> Reasoning (Deduction/Induction/Abduction) -> Abstraction/Classification -> World Model -> Goal Achievement

Critical Path:
1. Perception obtains environmental data
2. Reasoning processes data into structured knowledge
3. Abstraction and classification create hierarchical representations
4. World model integrates knowledge for prediction and planning
5. Actions are generated to achieve goals

Design Tradeoffs:
- Representation richness vs. computational efficiency
- Model complexity vs. adaptability to novel conditions
- Assumption specificity vs. generalizability across domains

Failure Signatures:
- Inability to adapt to novel conditions indicates insufficient abstraction capability
- Poor goal achievement suggests inadequate world model viability
- Computational intractability may require simplifying assumptions

First Experiments:
1. Test reasoning methods on benchmark problems requiring novel solutions
2. Evaluate abstraction capability on hierarchical categorization tasks
3. Measure world model prediction accuracy across diverse environments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework lacks empirical validation through implemented systems
- Claims about AGI accessing the world more fundamentally than humans remain speculative
- Functional approach to viability lacks operational definitions for measurement
- No Free Lunch theorems acknowledged but specific assumption selection not addressed

## Confidence

High:
- Naturalistic foundation rejecting consciousness/intent as prerequisites is well-supported by philosophical literature

Medium:
- Intelligence definition as novel skill creation is coherent but requires empirical testing
- Integration of perception, reasoning, and abstraction is theoretically plausible but lacks implementation details

## Next Checks
1. Implement a prototype system demonstrating the representationalist approach to world modeling using specified reasoning methods
2. Design experiments comparing framework-based systems against baselines in novel environment tasks
3. Develop concrete metrics for measuring world model viability and test predictive validity across multiple goal domains
