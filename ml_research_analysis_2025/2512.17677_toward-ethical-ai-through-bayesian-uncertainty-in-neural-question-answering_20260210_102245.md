# Toward Ethical AI Through Bayesian Uncertainty in Neural Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.17677
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17677
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Bayesian uncertainty quantification enables neural QA models to abstain when confidence is low, improving reliability over MAP predictions.

## Executive Summary
This paper shows that Bayesian uncertainty quantification can improve the reliability of neural question-answering models by enabling selective prediction. Starting with a simple MLP on the Iris dataset, the work demonstrates how posterior inference yields calibrated confidence estimates. These ideas are then extended to transformers: first by applying Bayesian inference to a frozen classification head, and then to LoRA-adapted transformers via a Laplace approximation on the CommonsenseQA benchmark. The experiments focus on uncertainty calibration and selective prediction, showing that models can abstain when confidence is low, producing more cautious and interpretable predictions.

## Method Summary
The method applies Bayesian inference to neural QA systems through three experiments: (1) MCMC on an MLP for Iris classification, (2) Bayesian multinomial logistic regression head on frozen DistilBERT embeddings, and (3) LoRA-adapted bert-base-uncased with diagonal Laplace approximation on CommonsenseQA. The approach treats model parameters as random variables with posterior distributions, enabling uncertainty quantification through posterior predictive marginalization. For the transformer experiments, LoRA adapters are injected into the last two layers, and a Laplace approximation with diagonal Fisher information provides tractable uncertainty estimates. At inference, Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior yields predictive distributions, and confidence thresholding enables selective abstention.

## Key Results
- Bayesian methods produce well-calibrated reliability diagrams compared to MAP estimates
- Accuracy-coverage curves show Laplace consistently outperforms MAP in selective prediction
- The MLP experiments visualize posterior concentration and per-sample predictive distributions
- Diagonal Laplace on LoRA-adapted transformers enables uncertainty-aware QA with abstention capability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Posterior Predictive Marginalization for Uncertainty Quantification
- Claim: Treating model parameters as random variables with posterior distributions yields calibrated confidence estimates that enable selective abstention.
- Mechanism: A prior p(θ) encodes initial beliefs; the likelihood p(y|x,θ) links data to parameters; Bayes' rule produces posterior p(θ|D). Predictions marginalize over this posterior: p(y|x,D) = ∫ p(y|x,θ)p(θ|D)dθ, propagating parameter uncertainty to predictions.
- Core assumption: The posterior distribution meaningfully captures epistemic uncertainty, and approximations (MCMC, Laplace) preserve sufficient structure for calibration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Bayesian reasoning treats the parameters themselves as random variables with a distribution that captures our uncertainty... This allows models to abstain when confidence is low."
  - [section 1] "This marginalization yields predictive distributions that reflect both the data fit and the epistemic uncertainty of the model."
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; neighbor papers (e.g., "Query-Level Uncertainty in Large Language Models") address uncertainty awareness but do not validate Bayesian posteriors specifically.
- Break condition: If the posterior approximation is too coarse (e.g., diagonal Laplace on highly correlated parameters), uncertainty estimates may be miscalibrated, undermining abstention reliability.

### Mechanism 2: Laplace Approximation via Diagonal Fisher Information
- Claim: A Gaussian posterior centered at MAP parameters with variance from the inverse empirical Fisher provides a tractable uncertainty estimate for fine-tuned transformers.
- Mechanism: Train to MAP solution → compute diagonal Fisher F(θ) = E[∇θ log p(y|x,θ)∇θ log p(y|x,θ)⊤] → approximate posterior as N(θ_MAP, F⁻¹) → sample parameter perturbations → average softmax outputs for predictive uncertainty.
- Core assumption: The loss surface is locally quadratic near θ_MAP, and the diagonal approximation captures dominant uncertainty directions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...compare Laplace approximations against maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates to highlight uncertainty calibration and selective prediction."
  - [section 3.3] "We approximate the posterior over the head parameters using a Laplace approximation... the Fisher captures the sensitivity of the likelihood to changes in θ."
  - [corpus] Corpus does not provide external validation of Laplace efficacy on QA tasks.
- Break condition: If parameters exhibit strong posterior correlations (cf. Fig. 2b), diagonal Fisher ignores coupling, potentially underestimating uncertainty.

### Mechanism 3: Selective Prediction Through Confidence Thresholding
- Claim: Thresholding on posterior predictive confidence enables abstention on uncertain inputs, trading coverage for accuracy.
- Mechanism: For each input, compute predictive distribution via Monte Carlo samples (S_MC ≈ 30) → extract max class probability as confidence → if below threshold, output "I don't know"; otherwise, predict.
- Core assumption: Confidence scores correlate positively with correctness probability; calibration is sufficient for threshold-based decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This allows models to abstain when confidence is low. An 'I don't know' response... improves interpretability."
  - [section 3.3, Fig. 7] "As coverage decreases (the model abstains on low-confidence answers), both curves rise in accuracy, with Laplace consistently tracking slightly above MAP."
  - [corpus] "Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning" (arXiv:2509.20750) shows confidence-guided refinement improves QA, suggesting confidence signals carry task-relevant information.
- Break condition: If model is confidently wrong (cf. Fig. 5b, Entry 2), high confidence misleads; calibration failure undermines threshold reliability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bayes' rule and posterior inference
  - Why needed here: The entire method hinges on understanding how priors, likelihoods, and posteriors combine to produce predictive distributions with uncertainty.
  - Quick check question: Given prior N(0, 1) and likelihood producing posterior N(μ, σ²), how does σ² affect prediction confidence?

- Concept: Fisher Information Matrix
  - Why needed here: The Laplace approximation uses the Fisher to estimate posterior curvature; understanding diagonal vs. full approximations is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Why might a diagonal Fisher underestimate uncertainty compared to a full covariance approximation?

- Concept: Calibration metrics (reliability diagrams, accuracy-coverage curves)
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates methods via calibration plots; you must interpret what "well-calibrated" means and how to read these figures.
  - Quick check question: In a reliability diagram, what does it mean if points lie above the diagonal?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Frozen BERT-base-uncased encoder**: Produces contextualized embeddings; backbone weights fixed.
  - **LoRA adapters**: Low-rank matrices injected into last two transformer layers (attention projections q, k, v, and output dense); only these are trainable during fine-tuning.
  - **Linear classification head**: Maps pooled representation to class logits; parameters receive Bayesian treatment.
  - **Laplace posterior module**: Computes diagonal Fisher over head/adapter parameters; stores MAP weights and variance estimates.
  - **Monte Carlo sampler**: Draws S_MC parameter samples from Gaussian posterior; averages softmax outputs for predictive distribution.

- Critical path:
  1. Load pretrained BERT; freeze backbone.
  2. Inject LoRA adapters; initialize classification head.
  3. Fine-tune on QA dataset to obtain MAP parameters.
  4. Compute diagonal Fisher via gradient statistics over training data.
  5. At inference: sample parameters → compute predictions → aggregate into predictive distribution → extract confidence → apply abstention threshold.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **MCMC vs. Laplace**: MCMC (Experiment 2) captures fuller posterior structure but scales poorly; Laplace (Experiment 3) is efficient but assumes local quadraticity and diagonal independence.
  - **Coverage vs. accuracy**: Higher abstention thresholds reduce coverage but increase accuracy on answered questions (Fig. 7a).
  - **Full Fisher vs. diagonal**: Full covariance captures parameter correlations but is O(p²) memory; diagonal is O(p) but ignores coupling (cf. Fig. 2).

- Failure signatures:
  - **Confidently wrong predictions**: High posterior confidence on incorrect answers (Fig. 5b) indicates calibration failure.
  - **Overconfidence**: Reliability diagram points below diagonal mean predicted confidence exceeds empirical accuracy.
  - **No abstention benefit**: Flat accuracy-coverage curve suggests confidence scores carry no discriminative information.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Iris MLP with MCMC (Section 3.1): visualize prior vs. posterior for individual weights; verify posterior concentration after conditioning on data.
  2. Implement Bayesian logistic regression head on frozen DistilBERT embeddings (Section 3.2): run HMC/NUTS sampling; plot per-example posterior predictives and reliability diagrams.
  3. Apply LoRA + diagonal Laplace to BERT on CommonsenseQA (Section 3.3): compare MAP vs. Laplace accuracy-coverage curves; test sensitivity to S_MC sample count.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do informative or structured priors (e.g., hierarchical, sparsity-inducing) affect calibration and selective prediction in Bayesian QA systems compared to the broad uninformative priors used in this work?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "Future work could explore richer priors, scalable approximate inference methods, and downstream tasks where abstention has clear value."
- Why unresolved: All experiments use standard Gaussian priors without domain-specific structure; the impact of prior choice on posterior behavior in large transformers remains uncharacterized.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments on CommonsenseQA with structured priors, reporting calibration metrics (ECE), reliability diagrams, and abstention trade-offs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the diagonal Fisher approximation used in the Laplace method significantly degrade uncertainty estimates compared to full or Kronecker-factored curvature approximations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper computes only the "diagonal approximation" of the empirical Fisher, noting it captures sensitivity "in practice," but parameter correlations in the true posterior (demonstrated in Figure 2 for the MLP) are ignored.
- Why unresolved: The diagonal approximation discards covariance information; the resulting miscalibration from this approximation is not quantified against richer alternatives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparison of diagonal vs. K-FAC vs. full Laplace on CommonsenseQA, measuring calibration error and accuracy-coverage curves.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the calibration benefit of Bayesian uncertainty persist when applied to the full transformer backbone rather than only LoRA adapters and the classification head?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] In Experiment 3, "the backbone BERT weights are frozen; only the LoRA parameters and a linear classification head are updated," limiting Bayesian inference to a small parameter subset while most of the model remains deterministic.
- Why unresolved: Epistemic uncertainty in the frozen backbone cannot be captured; whether a fully Bayesian transformer yields substantially better abstention behavior remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying scalable Bayesian methods (e.g., Laplace, variational inference) to all layers, comparing selective prediction performance against the partial-Bayesian approach.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does Bayesian abstention provide measurable benefits in human-AI collaboration or educational settings where users can query alternative explanations or request clarification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion suggests exploring "downstream tasks where abstention has clear value, such as education or human-AI collaboration."
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates abstention only via accuracy-coverage curves on static benchmarks; real-world utility when users interact with abstaining systems is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies in interactive QA scenarios measuring task completion, trust calibration, and user satisfaction when models can abstain versus forced prediction.

## Limitations
- Limited task diversity: Experiments confined to Iris (synthetic), toy QA (30 examples), and CommonsenseQA.
- LoRA-specific approximation: Laplace with diagonal Fisher is only validated on LoRA-tuned transformers.
- Posterior structure assumptions: Diagonal Fisher ignores parameter correlations, potentially degrading uncertainty estimates.
- Small-scale synthetic data: Iris and toy QA lack real-world complexity for production QA systems.

## Confidence
- **High**: Bayesian uncertainty improves calibration (reliability diagrams) and enables selective abstention (accuracy-coverage curves) within tested settings.
- **Medium**: Diagonal Laplace is an efficient approximation for transformer heads/adapters, but structural assumptions limit robustness.
- **Low**: Generalization of findings to diverse QA domains, architectures, and data regimes without recalibration.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-task validation**: Apply LoRA + Laplace to a second QA benchmark (e.g., SQuAD Open or TriviaQA) and compare calibration and abstention performance against MAP and full-covariance Laplace baselines.
2. **Posterior covariance ablation**: Repeat Experiment 3 with full Fisher approximation (or low-rank + diagonal) to quantify the impact of ignoring parameter correlations on uncertainty estimates.
3. **Confidence-out-of-distribution test**: Introduce out-of-distribution examples (e.g., paraphrased questions or foreign language inputs) and measure whether Bayesian methods yield higher uncertainty and abstention rates compared to MAP.
