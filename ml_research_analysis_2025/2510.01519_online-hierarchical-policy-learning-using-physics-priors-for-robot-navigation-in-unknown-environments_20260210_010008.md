# Online Hierarchical Policy Learning using Physics Priors for Robot Navigation in Unknown Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01519
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01519
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Hierarchical neural fields with TDM achieve 100% success rate and 0.08s planning in 1883 m² environments, outperforming sampling-based and imitation learning baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses robot navigation in large, complex, and unknown indoor environments by introducing Modular-NTFields (mNTFields), a hierarchical planning framework. The approach decomposes the problem into high-level global planning via a sparse navigation graph and low-level local planning using neural time fields that solve the Eikonal PDE. By integrating Temporal Difference Metric Learning (TDM) and modularizing the neural networks per room, the method overcomes spectral bias and convergence issues while maintaining scalability. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in success rate, planning time, and path quality across environments with 6 to 42 rooms, validated through both simulation and real-world deployment on a quadruped robot.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-level hierarchy: (1) high-level sparse navigation graph construction through online room segmentation using morphological operations, and (2) low-level neural time fields solving the Eikonal PDE locally with TDM losses. The system segments the environment into rooms, trains a separate neural network for each room using depth observations and odometry, and builds a graph where nodes are entry points and edges represent travel times. Planning involves graph search to find waypoint sequences, followed by local gradient-based path planning through the neural fields. The approach uses PirateNets with Fourier features and adaptive sampling, trained online during exploration with backtracking when goals are unreachable.

## Key Results
- Achieves 100% success rate in large environments (up to 1883 m² with 42 rooms)
- Planning time of 0.08 seconds outperforms baselines (ANTFields, TDM, RRTConnect, LazyPRM)
- Demonstrates real-world effectiveness on a quadruped robot in complex indoor spaces
- Shows scalability and efficiency across environments ranging from 6 to 42 rooms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Modular Decomposition Mitigates Spectral Bias
Standard neural networks struggle to represent high-frequency geometric details over large coordinate spaces. By segmenting the map into rooms and assigning a separate neural network to each, the effective frequency domain per network is reduced, allowing small MLPs to capture precise local geometry. This works when the environment is topologically separable into distinct regions.

### Mechanism 2: TDM Creates Smoother Loss Landscape
Pure PINNs minimize the PDE residual, which often has a complex loss landscape. TDM introduces a Taylor-expansion-based temporal difference loss that propagates value information along the trajectory, effectively guiding the optimizer toward a valid solution faster. This assumes sufficient sensing to approximate surface normals and speed profiles from depth data.

### Mechanism 3: High-Level Graph Abstracts Global Connectivity
The robot builds a graph where nodes are entry points and edges are travel times predicted by local neural fields. Running graph search on this structure generates a sequence of sub-goals that avoids computational explosion of searching a dense grid over large distances. This assumes morphological segmentation correctly identifies rooms and entry points.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Eikonal Equation**
  - Why needed: Defines the arrival time field T. Understanding that ||∇T|| = 1/S (speed) is crucial for tuning loss functions.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why the gradient of the travel time field represents the velocity direction of the robot?

- **Concept: Spectral Bias in Neural Networks**
  - Why needed: The paper explicitly claims to solve this. You must understand why standard MLPs fail to learn high-frequency details in large domains.
  - Quick check: Why does a standard MLP tend to produce "blurry" approximations of sharp geometric features in large environments?

- **Concept: Morphological Image Processing (Erosion/Dilation)**
  - Why needed: The high-level planner relies on morphological erosion to seal doorways and segment rooms.
  - Quick check: How does morphological erosion on an occupancy map help in separating distinct rooms for graph construction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Perception (Depth Sensor + Odometry) → Global Occupancy Map → Segmentation (Morphological operations) → Confirmed Rooms → High-Level (Graph G with Entry Points) → Low-Level (Subnetworks u_θ with TDM losses) → Planning (Dijkstra on G → Local gradients from u_θ)

- **Critical path:** Online Room Segmentation. If segmentation logic fails to identify a room or incorrectly merges two rooms, the subsequent training data distribution will be skewed and the global graph will be invalid.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Resolution vs. Scalability (trades infinite resolution of neural fields for memory overhead of storing multiple network weights), Training Load (accepts heavier compute during mapping for near-instantaneous planning later)

- **Failure signatures:** Jittery Planning (robot oscillates at doorways, likely caused by conflicting gradients between adjacent subnetworks), Exploration Loops (robot revisits same area, likely a backtracking failure), Network Divergence (training loss explodes, check bounding box normalization)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Unit Test (Segmentation): Feed pre-mapped 3-room occupancy grid into segmentation module; verify R_c matches expected count and entry points align with doorways
  2. Integration Test (Single Room Planning): Train one subnetwork on static room with obstacles; verify following -∇T yields collision-free path
  3. System Test (Large Scale): Run full exploration loop in simulated 10-room Gibson environment; measure mapping time and compare success rate against ANTFields baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the hierarchical framework be adapted to handle dynamic environments where obstacle configurations change in real-time? (Future work: investigate applicability in dynamic environments)
- Does the modular decomposition strategy effectively scale to high-dimensional configuration spaces, such as those required for robotic manipulation? (Future work: assess performance in higher-dimensional planning tasks)
- How robust is the morphological segmentation strategy in environments with ambiguous boundaries, such as open-floor plans? (Inference: relies on narrow openings to segment; open spaces may fail to segment)

## Limitations
- Network architecture details (PirateNet layer sizes, Fourier frequencies, metric function D) are not fully specified
- No comprehensive ablation studies on critical hyperparameters like TDM loss weights and morphological kernel sizes
- Limited validation of real-world deployment robustness under sensor noise conditions
- Does not address scalability challenges in 3D navigation or robotic manipulation scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Hierarchical decomposition strategy and superiority over monolithic ANTFields in static environments
- **Medium confidence**: TDM integration for improved convergence (supported by design rationale but lacks direct ablation evidence)
- **Low confidence**: Real-world deployment robustness and performance in dynamic environments

## Next Checks
1. Ablation study on TDM integration: Systematically remove each TDM loss component and compare convergence speed and path quality against standard PINN-based Eikonal solvers
2. Stress test on sensor noise: Evaluate performance with simulated noisy depth data to quantify robustness to perception uncertainty
3. Graph connectivity validation: Test system on environments with narrow, ambiguous doorways to assess whether morphological segmentation consistently identifies valid entry points and maintains global connectivity
