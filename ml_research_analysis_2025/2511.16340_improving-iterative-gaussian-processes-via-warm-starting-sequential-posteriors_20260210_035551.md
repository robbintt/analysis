# Improving Iterative Gaussian Processes via Warm Starting Sequential Posteriors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16340
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16340
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Warm starting iterative linear solvers for GP posterior inference accelerates convergence by 1.6-5.9× across multiple solvers and datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the scalability challenge of Gaussian processes in sequential settings where data arrives incrementally. The authors propose a warm starting approach that leverages solutions from previous, smaller linear systems to initialize iterative solvers for the current system. By starting closer to the solution, solvers like conjugate gradients, stochastic gradient descent, and alternating projections converge faster, reducing computational overhead while maintaining inference accuracy.

The method demonstrates significant speed-ups (1.6× for CG, 1.7× for SGD, 5.9× for AP) in regression tasks and improves Bayesian optimization performance under limited compute budgets. The approach is particularly valuable for applications requiring frequent posterior updates as new data arrives, such as online learning and real-time decision making with probabilistic models.

## Method Summary
The core idea is to warm start iterative linear solvers used in GP posterior inference by initializing them with solutions from previous, smaller linear systems. When new data points arrive, instead of starting the solver from scratch, the method uses the previous solution as a starting point for the updated system. This is particularly effective for conjugate gradient, stochastic gradient descent, and alternating projection methods, where the initial solution significantly impacts convergence speed.

The implementation involves maintaining the previous Cholesky factor or kernel matrix decomposition and using it to construct a warm start for the current system. For conjugate gradients, this means initializing with the previous solution vector. For SGD, it involves starting with the previous parameter values. For alternating projections, it uses the previous iterate as the initial point. The approach is designed to work seamlessly with standard GP inference pipelines without requiring modifications to the underlying probabilistic model.

## Key Results
- Warm starting achieves 1.6× speed-up for conjugate gradient solvers in GP regression tasks
- Stochastic gradient descent benefits from 1.7× faster convergence with warm initialization
- Alternating projection method shows 5.9× acceleration when using warm starts
- In Bayesian optimization with Thompson sampling, warm starting yields more accurate posteriors and better optimization performance under limited compute budgets
- The method demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and solver types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Warm starting works because iterative solvers for GP posterior inference converge faster when initialized closer to the true solution. In sequential settings, the posterior from the previous time step serves as an excellent approximation to the current posterior, since new data points typically only cause small updates to the belief. By using this previous solution as the starting point, the solver requires fewer iterations to reach the desired tolerance, effectively reusing computation from previous inference steps.

The effectiveness depends on the similarity between consecutive posteriors, which is guaranteed in most practical sequential settings where data arrives gradually. The computational overhead of maintaining and updating the warm start is minimal compared to the savings from reduced solver iterations, making the approach highly efficient in practice.

## Foundational Learning

**Gaussian Process Inference** - Understanding how GP posteriors are computed via linear systems (why needed: forms the basis for applying warm starting; quick check: can you derive the GP posterior mean and covariance equations?)

**Iterative Linear Solvers** - Knowledge of CG, SGD, and AP methods for solving linear systems (why needed: these are the solvers being accelerated; quick check: can you explain the convergence criteria for each solver?)

**Sequential Bayesian Updating** - How posterior distributions evolve as new data arrives (why needed: establishes why warm starts are effective; quick check: can you derive the posterior update equations for a simple conjugate prior?)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: GP Model -> Kernel Matrix Construction -> Iterative Solver -> Warm Start Initialization -> Posterior Inference

Critical Path: The method intercepts the iterative solver component, providing a warm start that accelerates convergence without modifying other parts of the GP inference pipeline. The warm start is constructed from the previous solution and used to initialize the current solver iteration.

Design Tradeoffs: The approach trades minimal memory overhead (storing previous solution) for significant computational savings. The method assumes sequential data arrival and may not benefit static GP models where all data is available upfront.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance occurs when consecutive posteriors differ significantly (rapid data arrival, concept drift) or when the previous solution is a poor approximation (initialization far from true solution). The method may also suffer if maintaining warm start state becomes expensive relative to solver iterations.

First Experiments:
1. Implement warm starting for conjugate gradient solver on synthetic GP regression with incremental data
2. Compare convergence speed with and without warm starting across different solver types
3. Evaluate the impact of warm starting on posterior accuracy in Bayesian optimization tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper identifies several open questions regarding the scalability of warm starting to massive datasets, performance across diverse kernel functions, and effectiveness for Bayesian optimization beyond Thompson sampling. The authors note that the benefits of warm starting in settings with different acquisition functions or non-myopic strategies remain unexplored, and the potential overhead of maintaining warm start solutions across iterations requires further investigation.

## Limitations

- Scalability to truly massive datasets remains untested, with current results based on moderate-sized regression tasks
- Performance across diverse kernel functions is not fully characterized, particularly for non-stationary and multi-task kernels
- The method's effectiveness for Bayesian optimization is limited to Thompson sampling with parallel evaluation
- Potential overhead from maintaining and updating warm start solutions across iterations is not thoroughly discussed
- Benefits may diminish when consecutive posteriors differ significantly due to rapid data arrival or concept drift

## Confidence

High: Warm starting can accelerate iterative solvers for GP posterior inference in tested settings, as evidenced by consistent empirical improvements across multiple datasets and solver types.

Medium: The approach will generalize well to larger-scale problems and different GP models, given promising results but limited scope of current evaluation.

Low: The method's effectiveness for Bayesian optimization beyond Thompson sampling setting studied, as this requires investigation across broader range of acquisition functions and optimization strategies.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate warm starting on GP regression tasks with tens of thousands of data points to assess scalability and identify potential bottlenecks.

2. Test the method with a variety of kernel functions, including non-stationary and multi-task kernels, to determine its robustness to different GP model assumptions.

3. Investigate warm starting for Bayesian optimisation with alternative acquisition functions, such as expected improvement or upper confidence bound, to gauge its benefits in diverse optimization settings.
