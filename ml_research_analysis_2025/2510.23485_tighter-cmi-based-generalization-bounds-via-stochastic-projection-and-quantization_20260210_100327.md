# Tighter CMI-Based Generalization Bounds via Stochastic Projection and Quantization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23485
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23485

- Primary result: Introduces stochastic projection and quantization framework to derive tighter CMI-based generalization bounds that resolve known counter-examples and provide meaningful guarantees even for previously problematic learning scenarios.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fundamental limitations of conditional mutual information (CMI)-based generalization bounds in statistical learning, particularly their failure to provide meaningful guarantees in certain problem instances. The authors develop a novel framework that combines stochastic projection and lossy compression within the CMI setting, introducing a "disintegrated CMI" formulation that accounts for dimensionality reduction and information control steps. This approach yields tighter bounds that remain informative even in cases where standard CMI bounds become vacuous, resolving known counter-examples in Stochastic Convex Optimization and extending to broader classes of learning problems.

The method works by projecting high-dimensional models onto lower-dimensional subspaces using random matrices, followed by quantization (adding noise) to control information leakage. This controlled information loss enables meaningful generalization guarantees while maintaining the theoretical rigor of information-theoretic approaches. The framework demonstrates that CMI-based bounds can be made robust through careful incorporation of dimensionality reduction and controlled information loss, offering both theoretical insights and potential practical implications for learning algorithm design.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce a new framework combining stochastic projection and lossy compression within the conditional mutual information (CMI) setting to derive tighter generalization bounds. The core approach involves projecting high-dimensional models onto lower-dimensional subspaces using random matrices, followed by quantization (adding noise) to control information leakage. This is formalized through a "disintegrated CMI" that accounts for the projection and compression steps, allowing the derivation of bounds that remain meaningful even in challenging problem instances where standard CMI bounds fail. The method is applied to resolve known counter-examples in Stochastic Convex Optimization and extended to broader classes of generalized linear stochastic optimization problems.

## Key Results
- For Stochastic Convex Optimization problems previously identified as counter-examples to standard CMI bounds, the new bounds yield meaningful generalization guarantees of order O(1/√n), decaying with training set size n.
- The method resolves memorization issues in learning algorithms by constructing auxiliary algorithms that achieve comparable generalization without memorizing training data.
- The framework extends to broader classes of generalized linear stochastic optimization problems beyond SCO.
- Application to subspace training algorithms (SGD/SGLD with projection) provides tighter bounds that remain non-vacuous even for deterministic updates.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by breaking the information flow between the training data and the learned parameters through controlled dimensionality reduction and noise injection. Stochastic projection reduces the effective dimensionality of the parameter space, limiting the amount of information that can be stored about the training set. Quantization then adds controlled noise that further limits information leakage while preserving the essential information needed for generalization. This "disintegrated CMI" approach separates the information-theoretic analysis into components that can be bounded more tightly than the original formulation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conditional Mutual Information (CMI)**: Measures the information that the learned parameters share with the training data, conditioned on the true data distribution. Why needed: CMI forms the basis for information-theoretic generalization bounds in learning theory. Quick check: Verify that CMI equals zero when parameters are independent of training data given the true distribution.
- **Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO)**: A learning framework where the goal is to minimize expected loss over a convex parameter space. Why needed: SCO provides a standard setting for analyzing generalization bounds and includes many practical learning problems. Quick check: Confirm that the expected loss is convex in the parameters for the SCO formulation.
- **Random Projections**: Technique for reducing dimensionality by multiplying high-dimensional vectors by random matrices. Why needed: Random projections preserve distances approximately while reducing dimensionality, limiting information storage capacity. Quick check: Verify that pairwise distances are preserved up to (1±ε) factor with high probability.
- **Quantization and Noise Injection**: Adding controlled randomness to parameters to limit information leakage. Why needed: Quantization provides a mechanism to bound information flow while maintaining sufficient information for generalization. Quick check: Ensure that the quantization noise level balances information control with generalization performance.
- **Disintegrated Information Measures**: Information-theoretic quantities that account for intermediate processing steps like projection and compression. Why needed: Standard CMI fails to capture the information dynamics when data passes through intermediate transformations. Quick check: Confirm that the disintegrated measure properly accounts for all information flows through the processing pipeline.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Data -> Stochastic Projection -> Quantization -> Parameter Update -> Generalization Bound

Critical Path:
The critical path for deriving tighter bounds involves: (1) applying stochastic projection to reduce parameter dimensionality, (2) introducing quantization noise to control information leakage, (3) computing the disintegrated CMI that accounts for these transformations, and (4) bounding the resulting expression using concentration inequalities and covering arguments.

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework trades off information preservation against bound tightness. Higher-dimensional projections preserve more information but yield looser bounds, while aggressive quantization provides tighter bounds at the cost of potential generalization degradation. The optimal balance depends on the specific problem structure and desired bound quality.

Failure Signatures:
The approach may fail when the projection dimension is too low (losing essential information for generalization) or when quantization noise is too high (destroying useful signal). Bounds become vacuous when the disintegrated CMI cannot be effectively bounded due to insufficient control over the intermediate transformations.

First Experiments:
1. Apply the framework to simple linear regression with known counter-examples to standard CMI bounds, measuring both bound tightness and actual generalization performance.
2. Test the stochastic projection approach on a convex optimization problem with high-dimensional parameters, comparing bounds with and without projection.
3. Evaluate the sensitivity of the bounds to projection dimension and quantization parameters across different problem classes.

## Limitations
- The computational overhead of implementing random projections and noise injection in real-world training scenarios requires empirical validation, as the theoretical framework may be computationally expensive.
- The construction of auxiliary algorithms for specific problem instances may not be straightforward in all cases, limiting the universal applicability of the approach.
- The extension to generalized linear stochastic optimization problems relies on problem-specific assumptions that may not generalize universally across all learning scenarios.

## Confidence
High confidence: The theoretical improvements over standard CMI bounds and the resolution of known counter-examples to CMI-based generalization.
Medium confidence: The practical utility of the proposed framework in real learning scenarios and the computational feasibility of the stochastic projection approach.
Low confidence: The universal applicability of the framework across diverse learning problems and the effectiveness of the quantization strategy in all settings.

## Next Checks
1. Implement the stochastic projection and quantization framework on standard benchmark datasets to measure empirical generalization improvements and computational overhead.
2. Test the auxiliary algorithm construction methodology on a diverse set of learning problems beyond the SCO counter-examples.
3. Evaluate the sensitivity of the bounds to the choice of projection dimension and quantization parameters across different problem classes.
