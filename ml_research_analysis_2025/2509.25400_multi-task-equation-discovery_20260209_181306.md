# Multi-Task Equation Discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25400
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25400
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Multi-task RVM improves equation discovery generalization across excitation regimes by sharing parameters while maintaining task-specific noise characteristics

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring equation discovery models generalize across operating conditions rather than overfitting to specific datasets. The authors apply a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM) within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, treating responses from the same structure under different excitation levels as related tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise characteristics. Using a simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear and cubic stiffness, they demonstrate that MTL-RVM outperforms standard single-task RVM in recovering true governing terms, particularly when excitations insufficiently stimulate nonlinear dynamics.

## Method Summary
The approach combines sparse Bayesian regression (SINDy-style) with multi-task learning by treating different excitation levels as related tasks. A shared weight vector w is learned across all tasks while maintaining task-specific noise variances. The RVM uses hierarchical priors with Gaussian weights governed by inverse-gamma hyperpriors to enforce sparsity. The method is validated on a simulated SDOF oscillator with three excitation regimes, comparing single-task versus multi-task RVM performance in parameter recovery and generalization.

## Key Results
- Standard single-task RVM models often fail to recover true governing terms when excitations insufficiently stimulate nonlinear dynamics
- MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for weakly and moderately excited datasets
- The multi-task approach maintained strong performance under high excitation while improving results for lower excitation levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Shared weight parameters across tasks enable information pooling from datasets where different physical dynamics are excited.
- Mechanism: The architecture enforces a single weight vector w shared across all L tasks while maintaining task-specific noise variances σ²_l. When high-excitation data reveals nonlinear terms (e.g., cubic stiffness), this information propagates to improve parameter estimates for low-excitation tasks where those terms remain dormant.
- Core assumption: Tasks share underlying physical parameters despite different excitation conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "responses from the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise characteristics"
  - [section 2.2] "Figure 2 shows that the weight vector, w, is shared between all tasks, while the noise variance is task-specific"
- Break condition: If tasks have fundamentally different governing equations (different physics), shared weights would cause negative transfer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical Bayesian priors with inverse-gamma hyperpriors enforce sparsity, pruning irrelevant basis functions from the dictionary.
- Mechanism: Each weight w_m follows a zero-mean Gaussian prior with variance governed by inverse-gamma hyperpriors Γ⁻¹(a, b). This hierarchical structure allows the posterior to drive irrelevant weights toward zero, effectively selecting only physically meaningful terms.
- Core assumption: The true governing equation uses a sparse subset of candidate basis functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] "Each weight is assumed to follow a zero-mean Gaussian prior, w_m ~ N(0, α) where the variance is governed by an inverse gamma distribution"
- Break condition: If the true system requires many non-sparse terms, or if the dictionary is missing critical basis functions, shrinkage will yield incorrect models.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint inference across excitation regimes mitigates overfitting to incomplete physics in individual datasets.
- Mechanism: Single-task models trained on weakly excited data cannot distinguish absent nonlinear terms from noise, leading to spurious parameter estimates. Multi-task learning constrains the solution space by requiring a single weight vector to explain all datasets simultaneously, acting as a regularizer.
- Core assumption: At least one task contains sufficient information to identify all relevant terms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Standard single-task RVM models were able to reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics"
- Break condition: If no task adequately excites the full dynamics, multi-task learning cannot recover missing physics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)**
  - Why needed here: The paper builds directly on SINDy, which frames equation discovery as sparse linear regression over a dictionary of candidate basis functions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why equation discovery can be formulated as linear regression with sparsity constraints?

- Concept: **Bayesian Hierarchical Priors**
  - Why needed here: The RVM uses hierarchical priors (Gaussian weights with inverse-gamma variance hyperpriors) to achieve automatic relevance determination.
  - Quick check question: How does placing a prior on the variance of weights (rather than the weights directly) encourage sparsity?

- Concept: **Multi-Task Learning (MTL)**
  - Why needed here: The core contribution applies MTL to equation discovery by treating different excitation levels as related tasks sharing parameters.
  - Quick check question: What conditions must hold for multi-task learning to improve (rather than degrade) performance on individual tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input data (D, F, ẍ) -> Single weight vector w (shared) and task-specific noise variances σ²_l -> Posterior distributions and predicted responses

- Critical path:
  1. Construct dictionary D(X) with candidate basis functions (e.g., polynomial terms up to cubic)
  2. Initialize hyperparameters a, b, λ
  3. Run Bayesian inference (expectation-maximization or variational) to compute posterior over w shared across all L tasks
  4. Inspect posterior mean of w to identify active terms; check NMSE on held-out data

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Shared vs. task-specific parameters**: Sharing weights promotes generalization but assumes common physics; task-specific weights increase flexibility but risk overfitting
  - **Dictionary size**: Larger M increases expressiveness but raises computational cost and risk of spurious correlations
  - **Hyperprior selection**: Strong shrinkage (small a, b) enforces sparsity aggressively but may prune weak-but-relevant terms

- Failure signatures:
  - Weights on physically implausible terms (e.g., large coefficients on y³ẏ³) suggest dictionary mismatch or insufficient excitation
  - High variance in posterior weights indicates ambiguous data; may need longer time series or richer excitation
  - Divergent NMSE across tasks suggests negative transfer—tasks may not share common physics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the SDOF oscillator case with f = [10¹, 10², 10³]; verify that single-task RVM fails on low/medium excitation while MTL-RVM recovers true weights
  2. Ablation study: remove the high-excitation task and observe degradation in parameter recovery for remaining tasks
  3. Stress test: add a task with different physics (e.g., quadratic stiffness) and confirm that shared weights cause negative transfer, validating the break condition

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the MTL-RVM framework be successfully applied to experimental structural health monitoring data, given the current validation relies solely on simulated datasets?
- How robust is the shared-weight assumption when applied to systems where the underlying physics change across tasks, such as systems with evolving damage or temperature-dependent stiffness?
- Under what conditions does the inclusion of low-excitation tasks degrade performance (negative transfer) compared to high-excitation single-task learning?

## Limitations

- Validation is limited to synthetic data with known physics, not tested on real experimental data
- The choice of three excitation levels appears arbitrary without sensitivity analysis
- No comparison against other equation discovery methods (e.g., SINDy with sequential thresholding)

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism that shared parameters across tasks can improve generalization when physics is consistent across datasets is well-supported by the synthetic results
- **Medium confidence**: The sparsity-promoting properties of the RVM framework are theoretically sound but not extensively validated beyond the synthetic case
- **Low confidence**: Claims about MTL-RVM's superiority over other sparse regression approaches lack comparative validation

## Next Checks

1. Test MTL-RVM on experimental data with known dynamics to assess robustness to real-world noise and model mismatch
2. Compare MTL-RVM against SINDy with various thresholding strategies to benchmark performance gains
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the number and distribution of excitation levels to determine optimal task construction
