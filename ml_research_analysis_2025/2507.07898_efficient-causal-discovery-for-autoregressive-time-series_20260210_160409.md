# Efficient Causal Discovery for Autoregressive Time Series

- Primary result: SyPI+ achieves higher F-scores and lower structural Hamming distance than competitors in causal structure learning for nonlinear autoregressive time series

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SyPI+, a constraint-based algorithm for causal structure learning in nonlinear autoregressive time series data. Building on the SyPI method, SyPI+ extends capability to nonlinear dependencies and adds a pruning step to reduce false positives. The algorithm achieves computational efficiency by requiring only two conditional independence tests per variable instead of exhaustive searches, reducing the total number of tests from exponential to quadratic growth.

Evaluated on 350 synthetic graphs (3-15 nodes, 50-1000 data points) and a real-world case study using CDS data from 11 major banks during the 2008 financial crisis, SyPI+ outperforms competitors like PCMCI and CD-NOTS. Using RCoT CI tests, it achieves higher F-scores and lower structural Hamming distance while requiring fewer tests, making it particularly effective in low-data regimes.

## Method Summary
SyPI+ is a constraint-based algorithm that learns causal structures in nonlinear autoregressive time series through a three-step process: lag identification, skeleton discovery, and pruning. The algorithm uses lag plots and distance correlation to identify minimum lags for each variable, then performs skeleton discovery using conditional independence tests between variables and their lagged counterparts. A novel pruning step removes spurious edges based on simple cycles and common ancestors. The key innovation is reducing the number of conditional independence tests from exponential to quadratic growth by testing only two dependencies per variable rather than exhaustive searches, achieving computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

## Key Results
- SyPI+ achieves higher F-scores and lower structural Hamming distance than PCMCI and CD-NOTS on synthetic datasets
- The algorithm requires fewer conditional independence tests due to its quadratic growth approach
- In a real-world CDS case study (242 weekly observations), SyPI+ identifies both direct and indirect causal links among 11 major banks, including Lehman Brothers' influence before the 2008 crisis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SyPI+ works by exploiting the structure of autoregressive time series to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The algorithm leverages the temporal ordering inherent in time series data, using lag plots to identify minimum lags and then focusing conditional independence tests only on relevant lagged variables. The pruning step removes false positives by identifying and eliminating edges that create simple cycles or are mediated by common ancestors, effectively enforcing causal directionality without explicitly estimating causal effects.

## Foundational Learning

**Distance correlation**: Measures both linear and nonlinear dependence between variables. Needed because traditional correlation misses nonlinear relationships. Quick check: Values range from 0 (independence) to 1 (perfect dependence).

**Conditional independence testing**: Determines whether two variables are independent given a set of conditioning variables. Essential for identifying causal structure. Quick check: Tests should maintain proper Type I error control under the null hypothesis.

**Lag plots**: Visual and statistical tools for identifying temporal dependencies. Required to determine appropriate lag structure for autoregressive models. Quick check: Plotted points should show clear patterns for dependent series.

**Structural Hamming Distance (SHD)**: Counts the number of edge insertions, deletions, and flips needed to convert one graph to another. Used to measure structural accuracy. Quick check: Lower values indicate better structural recovery.

**Simple cycles**: Closed paths in a graph where no node repeats except the start/end. Important for identifying spurious causal relationships. Quick check: A cycle exists if there's a path from node A back to itself without repeating nodes.

**Common ancestors**: Nodes that have directed paths to multiple other nodes. Used in pruning to remove redundant edges. Quick check: Can be identified through depth-first search from potential ancestor nodes.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Time Series Data -> Lag Identification -> Skeleton Discovery -> Pruning -> Final Causal Graph

Critical path: The algorithm follows a sequential pipeline where each stage depends on the previous one: lag identification must complete before skeleton discovery, which must complete before pruning. The most computationally intensive step is conditional independence testing during skeleton discovery.

Design tradeoffs: The algorithm trades exhaustive search completeness for computational efficiency by limiting tests to two per variable. This may miss some indirect dependencies but dramatically reduces computation time. The pruning step assumes acyclic structures, which may not hold in all real-world systems.

Failure signatures: Poor lag identification leads to missing true edges; overly aggressive pruning removes true edges; insufficient data causes false edges in skeleton discovery; nonlinear dependencies that distance correlation cannot detect result in missed causal relationships.

First experiments:
1. Test on synthetic linear Gaussian time series to verify baseline performance against established methods
2. Evaluate on small cyclic systems (3-5 nodes) to assess pruning behavior
3. Apply to high-dimensional data (15+ nodes) to measure scalability and computational efficiency gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The pruning step assumes acyclic structures, potentially limiting applicability to systems with feedback loops
- The algorithm's performance relies heavily on accurate lag identification through distance correlation, which may not capture all complex nonlinear dependencies
- While results show improvement over competitors, synthetic datasets may not fully represent real-world complexity

## Confidence
Algorithm performance claims: Medium
Real-world applicability: Low
Computational efficiency: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test SyPI+ on synthetic datasets with known feedback loops to evaluate its performance in cyclic systems
2. Apply the algorithm to multiple real-world time series datasets with different characteristics to assess generalizability
3. Conduct a systematic comparison of distance correlation versus alternative lag identification methods across various nonlinear dependency structures
