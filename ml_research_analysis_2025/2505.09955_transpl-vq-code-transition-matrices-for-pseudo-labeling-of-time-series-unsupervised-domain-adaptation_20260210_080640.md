# TransPL: VQ-Code Transition Matrices for Pseudo-Labeling of Time Series Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.09955
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09955
- **Reference count**: 27
- **Primary result**: Outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by 6.1% accuracy and 4.9% F1-score on time series UDA benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TransPL, a novel pseudo-labeling approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in time series classification. The key innovation is modeling the joint distribution P(X,y) of the source domain through code transition matrices derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. TransPL constructs class- and channel-wise transition matrices from the source domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods. The method explicitly models temporal transitions and channel-wise shifts between domains, offering versatility for different UDA scenarios and providing explainable pseudo-label generation. Extensive experiments on four time series UDA benchmarks demonstrate that TransPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods.

## Method Summary
TransPL addresses the unsupervised domain adaptation problem by constructing transition matrices that capture temporal patterns in time series data. The method first applies vector quantization to partition time series into patches, then builds transition matrices that model how VQ codes evolve over time for each class and channel. During adaptation, these matrices are used with Bayes' rule to compute class-conditional likelihoods for target samples. The pseudo-labels are generated by combining these likelihoods with class priors, weighted by channel-wise importance. This approach explicitly models the temporal dynamics and channel relationships that distinguish different classes, while accounting for domain shifts through the transition matrix framework.

## Key Results
- Achieves average accuracy improvement of 6.1% over state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods
- Demonstrates F1-score improvement of 4.9% across benchmark datasets
- Provides interpretable insights through learned code transition matrices
- Shows consistent performance across multiple UDA scenarios and benchmark datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TransPL works by explicitly modeling the temporal dynamics of time series through transition matrices constructed from vector-quantized patches. Unlike methods that treat time series as static feature vectors, TransPL captures how patterns evolve over time by tracking transitions between VQ codes. The channel-wise approach recognizes that different sensors or features may shift differently between domains, allowing the method to adapt each channel independently while maintaining temporal coherence. By using Bayes' rule with these transition-based likelihoods, TransPL effectively transfers the temporal structure learned from the labeled source domain to guide pseudo-label assignment in the unlabeled target domain, even when absolute values differ between domains.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vector Quantization (VQ)**: Partitioning continuous time series into discrete codebooks to capture representative patterns
  - *Why needed*: Enables construction of discrete transition matrices that model temporal dynamics
  - *Quick check*: Verify that quantization preserves essential temporal patterns while reducing complexity

- **Transition Matrices**: Modeling probability of moving from one VQ code to another over time
  - *Why needed*: Captures temporal dependencies and sequential patterns unique to each class
  - *Quick check*: Ensure transition probabilities sum to 1 and reflect meaningful temporal relationships

- **Channel-wise Adaptation**: Treating each feature channel independently during domain adaptation
  - *Why needed*: Accounts for different domain shifts across sensors or feature types
  - *Quick check*: Validate that channel importance weights reflect actual domain differences

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Time Series -> VQ Codebook -> Patch Segmentation -> Transition Matrix Construction -> Class-Conditional Likelihoods -> Channel Weighting -> Pseudo-Label Generation

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is VQ Codebook -> Patch Segmentation -> Transition Matrix Construction, as errors in quantization or segmentation directly propagate to poor transition modeling and ultimately incorrect pseudo-labels.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity for modeling accuracy - building class- and channel-specific transition matrices provides rich temporal modeling but increases memory requirements quadratically with codebook size and sequence length.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance manifests when domain shifts are too extreme for source transition matrices to generalize, when temporal patterns are non-stationary, or when VQ codebooks fail to capture domain-invariant features.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test on a simple synthetic dataset with known temporal patterns to verify transition matrix construction
2. Compare performance with varying codebook sizes to find optimal quantization granularity
3. Evaluate on a dataset with minimal domain shift to establish baseline performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Performance may degrade with extreme domain shifts where source temporal patterns don't generalize
- Computational complexity scales with sequence length and channel count, limiting scalability
- Sensitivity to VQ hyperparameters (codebook size, patch length) without systematic ablation studies
- Limited evaluation on very long time series or high-dimensional data

## Confidence

**Performance Claims**: High confidence - supported by comprehensive experimental results across multiple benchmarks
**Transition Matrix Interpretability**: Medium confidence - theoretical interpretability claims need more rigorous validation
**Versatility Claims**: Low confidence - limited testing on extreme domain shifts and varying time series characteristics

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies varying VQ codebook size and patch length to quantify hyperparameter impact
2. Evaluate on synthetic datasets with controlled domain shifts to systematically assess robustness
3. Perform runtime complexity analysis and scaling tests on longer time series sequences
