# Curriculum-Guided Antifragile Reinforcement Learning for Secure UAV Deconfliction under Observation-Space Attacks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.21129
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21129
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** Antifragile RL policy achieves up to 15% higher cumulative reward and 30% fewer conflicts under adversarial observation attacks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an antifragile reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance UAV deconfliction performance under adversarial observation-space attacks. By leveraging a curriculum of incrementally stronger perturbations and expert-guided critic alignment via Wasserstein distance minimization, the approach enables policies to adapt to increasingly hostile environments while maintaining value function stability. Evaluated in a 3D UAV navigation scenario with dynamic obstacles, the antifragile policy demonstrates superior robustness and generalization compared to standard and robust RL baselines when facing both PGD and GPS spoofing attacks.

## Method Summary
The framework combines action-robust RL with curriculum-guided antifragile adaptation. First, a robust expert policy is trained using adversarial actor-critic methods to withstand action-space attacks. Then, a curriculum of observation-space perturbations is introduced, with perturbation strength ε increasing gradually. At each curriculum stage, the critic is aligned to the expert's TD-error distribution using Wasserstein-1 distance minimization, ensuring bounded distributional shifts and preventing catastrophic forgetting. This process enables the policy to maintain performance across a wide range of adversarial conditions.

## Key Results
- Antifragile policy achieves up to 15% higher cumulative reward under PGD attacks compared to baselines.
- Conflict events reduced by over 30% when facing both PGD and GPS spoofing attacks.
- Theoretical guarantees on value function stability and bounded forgetting across perturbation levels.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Incremental exposure to curriculum-guided adversarial perturbations enables the policy to adapt value estimates across progressively stronger observation-space attacks.
- **Mechanism:** A simulated attacker generates adversarial states with increasing perturbation strength ε. The policy is trained via a curriculum, aligning its critic to the expert's TD-error distribution at each level using Wasserstein distance minimization. This bounds the shift in value estimates between adjacent perturbation levels.
- **Core assumption:** The perturbation curriculum spans the distributional shifts encountered at test time, and the expert critic from lower perturbation levels provides a stable alignment target.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "a curriculum of incremental adversarial perturbations... enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD observations"
  - [Section IV-A1] "The adversarial curriculum gradually increases ε across training stages to simulate escalating threat levels."
  - [corpus] Related work on parameter responses under stress (Panda et al., 2025) explores similar stress-based adaptation but does not guarantee bounded forgetting.
- **Break condition:** If the perturbation increments are too large or the expert critic becomes unreliable (e.g., high variance in TD errors), alignment fails and forgetting increases monotonically (as in non-adaptive policies).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Wasserstein-1 distance minimization between TD-error distributions quantifies and bounds catastrophic forgetting across perturbation levels.
- **Mechanism:** Catastrophic forgetting is defined as the Wasserstein distance f^ε_π between the TD-error distribution under clean observations and that under perturbation level ε. By minimizing W1(TD^k+1, TD^k) during curriculum adaptation, the divergence between successive TD distributions is bounded, stabilizing value learning.
- **Core assumption:** Lipschitz continuity of the value function and smooth system dynamics (Assumptions 1–2) ensure that small perturbation changes cause bounded TD-error shifts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "defines catastrophic forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with increasing perturbation strength"
  - [Section IV, Theorem 1] Proves monotonic increase in forgetting f^ε_π for non-adaptive policies under stronger perturbations.
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support; most related works focus on robustness rather than distributional forgetting bounds.
- **Break condition:** If Lipschitz assumptions are violated (e.g., non-smooth dynamics or reward functions), the theoretical bounds may not hold, and forgetting may increase unpredictably.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Expert-guided critic alignment via robust RL stabilizes adaptation and preserves safe navigation under unseen attacks.
- **Mechanism:** An action-robust RL policy (trained with agent–adversarial policies) serves as the expert critic. During curriculum adaptation, the antifragile policy's critic is updated to minimize the Wasserstein distance between its TD errors and the expert's TD errors at each perturbation level. This transfers robust value estimates to higher perturbation settings.
- **Core assumption:** The expert critic provides value estimates that are stable and generalize across perturbation levels up to a threshold.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance minimization across incrementally perturbed observations"
  - [Section III] Describes action-robust RL training to obtain the expert critic.
  - [corpus] Meta Policy Switching (Panda et al., 2025) uses meta-learning for switching but does not explicitly align critics via Wasserstein distance.
- **Break condition:** If the expert overfits to low perturbation levels or if the perturbation types differ substantially at test time (e.g., GPS spoofing vs. PGD), alignment may degrade performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Concept: Temporal Difference (TD) Error**
  - Why needed here: TD-error distributions are used to quantify catastrophic forgetting and measure the divergence induced by adversarial perturbations.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the TD error reflects the stability of a value function under perturbed observations?

- **Concept: Wasserstein Distance**
  - Why needed here: It provides a metric to bound the distributional shift in TD errors across perturbation levels, enabling theoretical guarantees on forgetting.
  - Quick check question: Why is Wasserstein-1 distance suitable for comparing TD-error distributions under adversarial perturbations?

- **Concept: Curriculum Learning**
  - Why needed here: Gradually increasing perturbation strength allows the policy to adapt incrementally, avoiding sudden large distributional shifts that cause forgetting.
  - Quick check question: How does curriculum-based adversarial training differ from one-time robust training?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Policy Networks (π_agent, π_adv) -> Critic Networks (Q_AR, Q_exp) -> Adversarial State Generator -> Domain Adaptation Module -> Replay Buffers
- **Critical path:** Train action-robust policy → Extract expert critic → Curriculum loop: generate adversarial states at ε_k, align critic via Wasserstein loss, update policies → Repeat with ε_{k+1}.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Choice of α in action-robust RL: Higher α increases robustness but may reduce nominal performance (Figure 3).
  - Perturbation increment Δε: Smaller increments improve stability but increase training time.
  - Expert selection: Using critic from α=0.1 provides best balance (low forgetting, good generalization).
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Monotonic increase in forgetting value f^ε_π across curriculum stages (indicates alignment failure).
  - High variance in episodic rewards under moderate perturbations (suggests overfitting to specific attack types).
  - Multi-modal TD-error distributions (sign of unstable value estimation, Figure 10).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline robustness test:** Evaluate action-robust policies with α∈{0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4} under PGD attacks (ε=1–5) to identify the expert candidate (lowest forgetting).
  2. **Curriculum adaptation validation:** Train the antifragile policy with Δε=0.25 and track convergence of Wasserstein distance between TD distributions (Figure 6) to ensure bounded forgetting.
  3. **Cross-attack generalization:** Test the adapted policy against both PGD and GPS spoofing attacks, comparing cumulative reward and conflict rates against robust baselines (Table I, Figures 8–9).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** How does the antifragile framework scale to multi-agent UAV swarms operating under decentralized adversarial attacks? The current study validates the framework using a single-agent DDPG architecture, which does not account for the complexities of inter-agent coordination or non-stationarity in multi-agent environments.
- **Open Question 2:** Does the antifragile policy maintain performance against non-periodic or highly stochastic obstacle dynamics? Validating the theoretical robustness bounds (Theorem 2) solely on predictable periodic motions may not generalize to erratic, real-world obstacle behaviors that violate smoothness assumptions.
- **Open Question 3:** Can the framework guarantee stability under simultaneous observation-space and action-space attacks during the adaptation phase? While the expert critic is pre-trained using Action Robust RL, the antifragile adaptation loop explicitly generates only "adversarial states" (observations).

## Limitations
- The theoretical guarantees rely heavily on Lipschitz continuity assumptions, which may not hold in highly nonlinear or discontinuous environments.
- The expert critic alignment mechanism assumes the robust RL policy remains a reliable target across all perturbation levels, but this may fail if attack types at test time differ substantially from training scenarios.
- Network architecture details and specific Wasserstein distance implementation remain unspecified, making exact reproduction challenging.

## Confidence
**High Confidence Claims:**
- The empirical improvement in cumulative reward (up to 15%) and conflict reduction (over 30%) under PGD attacks is well-supported by the experimental results shown in Table I and Figures 8-9.
- The monotonic increase in forgetting for non-adaptive policies (Theorem 1) is theoretically sound and validated through the curriculum adaptation results in Figure 7.

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The claim that Wasserstein-1 distance minimization effectively bounds catastrophic forgetting across perturbation levels is supported by the theoretical framework but lacks extensive empirical validation across diverse attack types.
- The assertion that curriculum-based adaptation provides superior generalization compared to one-time robust training is demonstrated in the experiments but could benefit from additional ablation studies.

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The generalization to GPS spoofing attacks, while mentioned, is less extensively validated than PGD attacks and may not capture all real-world attack scenarios.
- The scalability claims to more complex UAV scenarios are not directly tested and remain theoretical extrapolations from the 3D deconfliction case.

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness Across Attack Types:** Test the adapted policy against a wider range of observation-space attacks beyond PGD and GPS spoofing, including sensor noise, communication delays, and combined multi-modal attacks to assess true generalization capabilities.
2. **Ablation of Curriculum Parameters:** Systematically vary the perturbation increment Δε and expert selection criteria to identify the sensitivity of the framework to these design choices and establish optimal configuration guidelines.
3. **Theoretical Validation in Discontinuous Environments:** Evaluate the framework in environments with non-smooth dynamics or discontinuous reward functions to test the limits of the Lipschitz continuity assumptions and identify potential failure modes in real-world applications.
