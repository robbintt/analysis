# STeP-Diff: Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Mobile Fine-Grained Pollution Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04385
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 89.12% MAE improvement over second-best baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of forecasting fine-grained air pollution using incomplete and time-varying data from mobile sensors. The proposed Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff) integrates DeepONet for spatial feature extraction with a PDE-informed diffusion model to generate accurate pollution predictions. By embedding physical constraints into the denoising process, STeP-Diff ensures predictions align with real-world diffusion dynamics. Evaluated on 14 days of data from 59 sensors in two cities, STeP-Diff achieved up to 89.12% improvement in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE compared to the second-best baseline.

## Method Summary
The proposed STeP-Diff model combines DeepONet for spatial feature extraction with a physics-informed diffusion framework. The DeepONet component captures spatial dependencies in pollution data, while the diffusion model incorporates partial differential equation constraints to ensure physical consistency in predictions. The denoising process is guided by physical diffusion dynamics, allowing the model to generate accurate forecasts even with incomplete and time-varying mobile sensor data. This approach bridges the gap between data-driven learning and physical modeling for pollution forecasting.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 89.12% improvement in MAE over second-best baseline
- Achieved up to 82.30% improvement in RMSE over second-best baseline
- Achieved up to 25.00% improvement in MAPE over second-best baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of DeepONet for spatial feature extraction with a physics-informed diffusion framework allows STeP-Diff to capture both the spatial and temporal dynamics of pollution while ensuring predictions adhere to physical diffusion laws. The PDE constraints embedded in the denoising process prevent physically implausible predictions, while the DeepONet handles the complex spatial relationships in pollution fields. This combination enables accurate forecasting even with the challenges of incomplete and time-varying mobile sensor data.

## Foundational Learning
- DeepONet architecture: Needed to capture complex spatial dependencies in pollution fields; quick check: verify spatial feature extraction performance on synthetic data
- Physics-informed diffusion models: Required to embed physical constraints in predictions; quick check: validate PDE adherence in generated samples
- Spatio-temporal modeling: Essential for capturing pollution dynamics; quick check: test temporal consistency across prediction horizons
- Mobile sensor data processing: Necessary for handling incomplete and time-varying inputs; quick check: evaluate robustness to missing data patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Mobile Sensor Data -> DeepONet (Spatial Feature Extractor) -> Diffusion Model (with PDE Constraints) -> Pollution Forecasts

Critical path: The model processes incomplete mobile sensor data through DeepONet to extract spatial features, then feeds these features into a diffusion model guided by PDE constraints to generate physically consistent pollution forecasts.

Design tradeoffs: The physics-informed approach trades computational complexity for physical consistency, while the DeepONet adds significant computational overhead but enables better spatial feature extraction. The mobile sensor context requires balancing accuracy with inference speed.

Failure signatures: Predictions may violate physical diffusion laws if PDE constraints are insufficient, spatial features may be poorly extracted if DeepONet is inadequately trained, and the model may struggle with highly incomplete data if the denoising process is not robust enough.

First experiments:
1. Test DeepONet performance on synthetic spatial pollution patterns
2. Validate PDE constraint adherence in generated diffusion samples
3. Evaluate robustness to various levels of sensor data incompleteness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope with only 14 days of data from 59 sensors across two cities
- Physics-informed approach may struggle when real-world dynamics deviate from embedded PDE constraints
- DeepONet component requires substantial computational resources, potentially limiting practical deployment

## Confidence
- Performance metrics: Medium (constrained experimental setup)
- Physics-informed framework: Medium (general applicability concerns)
- Scalability claims: Low (insufficient geographic and temporal validation)

## Next Checks
1. Extended temporal evaluation: Test the model on multi-month datasets to assess performance stability across seasonal variations and long-term pollution patterns.
2. Geographic generalization: Evaluate STeP-Diff on sensor data from cities with substantially different pollution sources and meteorological conditions to verify cross-regional applicability.
3. Real-time deployment analysis: Conduct field tests with mobile sensor platforms to measure actual inference latency and resource consumption, comparing against the claimed benefits for mobile applications.
