## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.14758
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14758
- Reference count: 30
- Over 250,000 relevance judgments across 150+ queries for Chinese, Persian, and Russian retrieval tasks

## Executive Summary
NeuCLIRBench is a large-scale evaluation collection designed for monolingual, cross-language, and multilingual information retrieval across Chinese, Persian, and Russian documents with English machine translations. The collection combines TREC NeuCLIR track topics from 2022-2024 and includes over 250,000 relevance judgments across 150+ queries. The benchmark provides strong fusion baselines combining dense and learned-sparse retrieval models, enabling fair evaluation of reranking approaches. Results demonstrate that fusion baselines outperform individual systems, with listwise reranking methods like Rank-K and RankQwen-32B achieving the highest effectiveness scores.

## Method Summary
NeuCLIRBench introduces a modern evaluation collection for IR tasks across three languages (Chinese, Persian, Russian) with English machine translations. The benchmark uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to combine three heterogeneous retrieval models—PLAID-X (multi-vector dense), MILCO (learned-sparse), and Qwen3 8B Embed (single-vector dense)—to create a robust first-stage baseline. Reranking is performed on the top-100 documents from this fusion, with listwise methods using a sliding window of 20 documents and stride of 10. The collection includes four task types: monolingual, cross-language, multilingual, and document translation-based retrieval, evaluated using nDCG@20 and Judged@20 metrics.

## Key Results
- Fusion baseline consistently outperforms individual retrieval systems across all task types and languages
- Listwise reranking methods (Rank-K, RankQwen-32B) achieve highest nDCG@20 scores while some pointwise rerankers fail to improve strong initial ranking
- Learned sparse retrieval (MILCO) outperforms traditional BM25, especially in cross-language and multilingual tasks
- Multi-vector dense models (PLAID-X) show effectiveness advantages but with increased computational cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Diversity-Driven Retrieval Fusion
Combining heterogeneous neural retrieval architectures yields a stronger first-stage ranking than any single architecture alone. The fusion baseline aggregates PLAID-X (multi-vector), MILCO (learned-sparse), and Qwen3 8B Embed (single-vector) using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). This compensates for specific failure modes of individual architectures by intersecting their distinct relevance signals. The core assumption is that component models make errors on different queries or documents with low correlation. Evidence shows Fusion nDCG@20 consistently exceeds individual components like PLAID-X (0.461) or MILCO (0.420). Break condition: if component models are highly correlated, RRF fusion provides diminishing returns.

### Mechanism 2: Contextual Robustness in Listwise Reranking
Listwise rerankers appear more robust than pointwise rerankers when improving upon a strong neural first-stage baseline. Pointwise rerankers score query-document pairs independently, struggling to distinguish "highly relevant" from "relevant" when the initial retrieval is already strong. Listwise rerankers observe the set of top candidates simultaneously, allowing them to re-order based on relative utility rather than absolute score thresholds. The core assumption is that the initial retrieval pool contains relevant documents but ranks them imperfectly, with listwise context providing necessary signal. Evidence shows Rank-K (QwQ) achieves 0.655 nDCG@20 in Cross-Lingual tasks, whereas smaller pointwise rerankers like Qwen3 0.6B Rerank fail to beat the Fusion baseline. Break condition: if listwise context window is too small or LLM inference introduces hallucinated relevance criteria.

### Mechanism 3: Vocabulary Alignment for Cross-Lingual Consistency
Learned sparse retrieval can implicitly handle cross-lingual alignment without explicit translation by projecting diverse languages into a unified vocabulary space. Models like MILCO use a learned sparse connector that maps input text to an English-centric vocabulary regardless of source language, creating an "intersection" of concepts in the index. The core assumption is that the pivot vocabulary (English) has sufficient coverage to represent concepts from target languages without catastrophic semantic loss. Evidence shows MILCO outperforming BM25 significantly in Cross-Language retrieval (e.g., 0.476 vs 0.400 for Russian). Break condition: if source language contains cultural concepts with no direct lexical equivalent in pivot vocabulary, sparse representation may result in false negatives.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**
  - Why needed here: Algorithm used to merge diverse retrieval systems into robust baseline
  - Quick check question: If System A ranks a document #1 and System B ranks it #10, does RRF give it a higher or lower fused score than a document ranked #5 by both? (Answer: Higher, because 1/(k+1) decays slower than 1/(k+5))

- **Concept: Judged@20 / Pooling Completeness**
  - Why needed here: Paper claims "statistical discriminatory power" based on 250k judgments; evaluation limited to "pool" of documents judged by humans
  - Quick check question: Why does paper report "Judged@20" alongside nDCG? (Answer: To prove evaluation is fair; if top results mostly "unjudged," measured effectiveness would be artificially low)

- **Concept: Multi-Monolingual vs. Multilingual Retrieval**
  - Why needed here: Collection distinguishes between "run retrieval separately in 3 languages" (Multi-monolingual) and "search one index of 3 languages simultaneously" (Multilingual)
  - Quick check question: In Multilingual task, does system need to rank Chinese document against Persian document for same query? (Answer: Yes, requires score normalization or cross-lingual alignment)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Dataset (NeuCLIR-1) -> First-Stage Fusion (PLAID-X + MILCO + Qwen3 8B) -> Reranker (Pointwise/Listwise LLMs) -> Evaluation (qrels -> nDCG@20 / Judged@20)

- **Critical path**: 1) Load NeuCLIR-1 corpus and segment/index for three first-stage models 2) Run inference for each model to generate ranked lists 3) Apply Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60) to generate "Fusion Baseline" 4) Use top-100 results from Fusion as input for reranking experiments

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Fusion vs. Single Model: Fusion is computationally 3x more expensive but provides robust "floor" necessary to fairly evaluate modern rerankers
  - Zero-shot Listwise vs. Fine-tuned Pointwise: Listwise rerankers (Rank-K, RankQwen) are often massive (32B params) and slow but yield highest scores; Pointwise rerankers are faster but may fail to improve already-high Fusion baseline

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Pointwise Stagnation: Implement pointwise reranker (e.g., Qwen3 0.6B) and nDCG@20 drops below Fusion baseline; diagnosis: pointwise model cannot distinguish relevant from high-quality "distractors"
  - Sparse Misalignment: Using BGE-M3 Sparse (monolingual only) on Cross-Language tasks yields ~0.05 nDCG; diagnosis: sparse model lacks cross-lingual vocabulary mapping

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Sanity Check: Run Fusion Baseline on Persian corpus and verify nDCG@20 is approx 0.60
  2. Reranker Stress Test: Apply standard pointwise reranker (mT5) vs. listwise reranker (RankQwen) on English Monolingual Fusion output; confirm pointwise struggles to improve 0.483 baseline
  3. Cross-Lingual Sparse Analysis: Compare BM25 with Document Translation against MILCO on Russian Cross-Lingual task; verify learned sparse approach captures semantic nuances BM25-DT misses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can retrieval models be optimized for multilingual tasks where relevant documents span multiple languages, given that current models struggle more with this than cross-language retrieval? Basis: authors note "multilingual retrieval is noticeably harder for multilingual models" and explicitly "challenge the community to explore more challenging retrieval and multilingual scenarios."

- Why does increasing model parameter size (e.g., from 4B to 8B) fail to consistently improve effectiveness in multilingual retrieval tasks? Basis: authors observe 4B Qwen3 variant sometimes outperforms 8B variant in multilingual tasks, "indicating that the effectiveness gain from using a larger model observed in prior work might not hold."

- What architectural or training improvements are required for neural rerankers to consistently outperform strong neural fusion baselines? Basis: results show several rerankers (e.g., Jina, RankZephyr) fail to improve upon initial fusion ranking, suggesting current rerankers struggle to distinguish relevant documents from "closely related non-relevant documents."

## Limitations
- Reliance on machine-translated English versions of non-English documents may introduce semantic drift and degrade retrieval quality for queries requiring deep cultural or linguistic nuance
- Fusion baseline performance assessment lacks ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions and test sensitivity to component correlation
- Evaluation focuses on English queries only, limiting generalizability to native-language query scenarios

## Confidence
- Fusion mechanism superiority: High confidence
- Listwise reranker superiority: High confidence
- Learned sparse vocabulary alignment claims: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Perform ablation studies on fusion baseline to quantify individual component contributions and test sensitivity to component correlation
2. Evaluate retrieval performance using native-language queries rather than English queries across all language pairs
3. Test learned sparse vocabulary alignment with alternative pivot languages (e.g., Russian or Chinese) to assess robustness beyond English-centric representation
