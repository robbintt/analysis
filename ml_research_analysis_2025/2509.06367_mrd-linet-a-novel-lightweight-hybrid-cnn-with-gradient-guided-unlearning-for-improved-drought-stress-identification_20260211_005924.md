# MRD-LiNet: A Novel Lightweight Hybrid CNN with Gradient-Guided Unlearning for Improved Drought Stress Identification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.06367
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06367
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves 90.0% accuracy with 15-fold fewer parameters than conventional CNNs/ViTs for potato drought stress detection

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MRD-LiNet, a lightweight hybrid CNN architecture that combines MobileNetV2 bottleneck blocks, DenseNet connectivity, and ResNet skip connections to identify drought stress in potato crops. The framework reduces trainable parameters by 15-fold compared to conventional CNNs and Vision Transformers while maintaining competitive accuracy. A novel gradient norm-based machine unlearning mechanism selectively removes low-influence training samples, improving model adaptability and reducing false negatives. Evaluated on aerial potato field imagery, the model achieves 90.0% accuracy with F1-scores of 0.922 (stressed) and 0.874 (healthy).

## Method Summary
The method employs a hybrid CNN architecture that integrates MobileNetV2 bottleneck blocks with DenseNet-style feature reuse and ResNet skip connections. The model processes 224×224 RGB patches extracted from aerial imagery of potato fields. Training uses Adam optimizer with exponential learning rate decay, data augmentation, and a gradient norm-based unlearning step that removes the bottom 5% of training samples by influence score. The framework achieves high accuracy with only 0.231M parameters, making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained agricultural systems.

## Key Results
- Achieves 90.0% overall accuracy with F1-scores of 0.922 (stressed) and 0.874 (healthy)
- Reduces trainable parameters by 15-fold compared to conventional CNN/ViT models
- Gradient-guided unlearning improves stressed-class recall from 0.84 to 0.87
- False negatives reduced from 115 to 99 after unlearning step
- Learning curves show minimal train-validation gap when combining augmentation and unlearning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hybridizing MobileNetV2 bottleneck blocks with DenseNet-style feature reuse yields competitive accuracy with 15–60× fewer parameters than standalone CNN/ViT models. Bottleneck blocks reduce FLOPs through expansion-depthwise-projection sequences, while dense connectivity maximizes feature reuse by concatenating all prior feature maps. Skip connections preserve gradient flow in shallow parameter regimes.

### Mechanism 2
Gradient norm-based influence scores identify low-contribution training samples for removal. The L2 norm of the gradient vector quantifies how sensitive the loss is to each sample; low-norm samples contribute minimally to parameter updates and may represent redundant or mislabeled instances. Removing the lowest 5% reduces noise and improves generalization without accuracy loss.

### Mechanism 3
Data augmentation stabilizes training dynamics while machine unlearning further reduces overfitting. Augmentation expands the effective training set and enforces invariance, while unlearning removes samples that remain low-influence despite augmentation, suggesting they add noise rather than signal. This combination yields smoother convergence and reduced validation loss variance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Bottleneck Residual Blocks (MobileNetV2-style)**: Core building block enabling parameter efficiency through expansion-depthwise-projection; understanding inverted residuals is essential for modifying architecture depth/width.
  - *Quick check:* Given input channels=24, expansion factor=6, and output channels=24, what are the channel dimensions at each stage of the bottleneck?

- **Dense Connectivity and Growth Rate**: The dense block concatenates all prior feature maps; growth rate controls how many new channels each layer adds. This determines memory usage and feature reuse intensity.
  - *Quick check:* If a dense block has 4 layers with growth rate 32 and input channels 64, what is the output channel count after the block?

- **Gradient-Based Influence Functions**: The unlearning mechanism relies on interpreting gradient norms as sample importance; practitioners must understand what low vs high norms imply about data quality.
  - *Quick check:* A sample with near-zero gradient norm is correctly classified. Should it be removed? What additional information would change your decision?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input (224×224×3) → Initial Conv (3×3, stride=2, 36 filters) + BN + ReLU6 → Bottleneck Blocks ×4 (channels: 16→24→24→32, strides: 1,2,1,2) → Dense Block (4 layers, growth_rate=32) → Transition Layer (0.5 compression + 2×2 avg pool) → Bottleneck Block (32 channels, stride=1) → Global Average Pooling → Dense(128, ReLU) → Dense(1, Sigmoid)

- **Critical path:** The two stride-2 bottleneck blocks and transition layer pooling are the primary downsampling points. Errors here propagate and cannot be recovered downstream. The dense block is the parameter-densest component; ablate it first if debugging capacity issues.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Expansion factor=6 balances representation power vs FLOPs; reducing to 4 saves computation but may harm subtle stress pattern detection
  - Growth rate=32 and 4 dense layers yield 128 new channels; increasing improves feature diversity but raises memory 2–3×
  - Unlearning at 5% is empirically tuned; higher removal rates risk discarding boundary cases
  - Assumption: Binary classification suffices; multi-class stress severity would require output layer redesign

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High training accuracy (>0.98) with unstable/fluctuating validation accuracy → overfitting; check augmentation pipeline, consider increasing unlearning to 7–10%
  - Stressed-class recall stuck at ~0.84 despite augmentation → class imbalance; verify influence score distribution doesn't systematically undervalue stressed samples
  - Loss plateaus early with minimal improvement → learning rate decay may be too aggressive; verify exponential decay schedule

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline ablation:** Train without dense block (replace with single conv layer) to isolate its contribution; expect accuracy drop and increased false negatives per Table 2 patterns
  2. **Unlearning threshold sweep:** Compare 3%, 5%, 10% removal rates; monitor if recall improvements persist or if stressed-class precision degrades (signaling over-pruning)
  3. **Cross-crop validation:** Apply trained model to corpus-related soybean/maize stress datasets (e.g., Goyal et al. 2024 maize images) without retraining to assess domain gap; expect accuracy degradation that reveals which features are potato-specific vs general stress signatures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the MRD-LiNet framework perform when validated across diverse crop types and varying environmental field conditions beyond potato crops?
- Can the integration of unused multispectral bands (Near-Infrared, Red-Edge) improve classification accuracy without compromising the model's lightweight nature?
- Is the 5% removal threshold for gradient-guided unlearning optimal, or does the ideal retention rate vary with dataset noise levels?
- What are the inference latency and energy consumption metrics of MRD-LiNet when deployed on actual edge hardware (e.g., embedded GPUs or drones)?

## Limitations
- The unlearning mechanism's gradient-norm influence scores lack validation that low-norm samples are truly uninformative rather than minority-class or boundary cases
- The exact training/test split metadata is not provided, making faithful reproduction of the reported patch distribution impossible
- No cross-crop or cross-sensor validation is presented; performance may degrade significantly on different potato varieties or imaging platforms

## Confidence
- Architecture efficiency (15× parameter reduction while maintaining accuracy): **High** - supported by direct comparisons to ViT-TL and empirical results
- Machine unlearning improving generalization: **Medium** - demonstrated on this dataset but mechanism lacks theoretical grounding for agricultural stress detection
- Gradient norm as influence metric: **Medium** - standard ML practice but not validated for the specific characteristics of stress detection imagery

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a threshold sensitivity analysis (3%, 5%, 10% removal) to determine if unlearning consistently improves stressed-class recall without sacrificing precision
2. Apply the trained model to external potato stress datasets (different fields, varieties, or years) to quantify domain transfer capability
3. Perform ablation studies removing the dense block to isolate its contribution to the reported accuracy improvements
