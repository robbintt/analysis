# LLMs for Argument Mining: Detection, Extraction, and Relationship Classification of pre-defined Arguments in Online Comments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.22956
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22956
- Reference count: 29
- Four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5-flash, Llama3-8b) tested on detecting, extracting, and classifying relationships of predefined arguments in online comments across six polarizing topics

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates Large Language Models on three argument mining tasks - detecting, extracting, and classifying relationships of predefined arguments in online comments across six polarizing topics. Using over 2,000 annotated comments, the study compares four LLMs in zero-, one-, and five-shot settings against fine-tuned RoBERTa and Llama3 baselines. Results demonstrate that fine-tuned Llama3 outperformed all other models on detection and extraction tasks, while larger LLMs excelled in relationship classification. The study reveals systematic weaknesses including over-prediction in emotional language, struggles with long or nuanced comments, and poor performance on implicit argumentation.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5-flash, Llama3-8b) on three argument mining tasks using over 2,000 annotated online comments across six polarizing topics. Models were tested in zero-, one-, and five-shot settings and compared against fine-tuned RoBERTa and Llama3 baselines. The ArgKP dataset provided pre-defined argument categories for detection, extraction, and relationship classification tasks. Performance was measured using standard metrics, with systematic error analysis revealing key limitations in handling emotional language, long comments, and implicit arguments.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Llama3 outperformed all other models on detection and extraction tasks
- Larger LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini) excelled in relationship classification
- Models showed systematic weaknesses: over-prediction in emotional language, struggle with long/nuanced comments, and poor performance on implicit argumentation
- F1 scores for relationship classification remained modest (0.5-0.7 range), indicating these tasks remain challenging

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of LLMs for argument mining stems from their ability to understand context and semantic relationships in text, enabling them to identify argumentative structures within online discourse. Fine-tuned models leverage task-specific training to improve detection and extraction accuracy, while larger models with more parameters demonstrate superior capability in classifying complex argument relationships. The study's multi-shot prompting approach helps models generalize across different argumentative contexts, though performance varies significantly based on comment length, emotional content, and the explicitness of argumentation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Argument mining concepts**: Understanding how to identify, extract, and classify argumentative structures in text
  - Why needed: Core task requires recognizing different types of arguments and their relationships
  - Quick check: Can distinguish between claim, premise, and support structures
- **Few-shot learning**: Ability to perform tasks with limited examples through in-context learning
  - Why needed: Enables model adaptation without extensive retraining
  - Quick check: Performance improves with additional examples in prompts
- **Zero-shot learning**: Task performance without any examples
  - Why needed: Baseline comparison and practical deployment scenarios
  - Quick check: Models can generalize from task description alone
- **Fine-tuning methodology**: Adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks through additional training
  - Why needed: Improves performance on domain-specific tasks
  - Quick check: Model shows better performance than base version on target task
- **Error analysis techniques**: Systematic examination of model failures to understand limitations
  - Why needed: Identifies specific areas for improvement and model weaknesses
  - Quick check: Can categorize and explain patterns in incorrect predictions
- **Annotation quality assessment**: Ensuring reliable ground truth for evaluation
  - Why needed: Valid performance metrics require accurate reference data
  - Quick check: Multiple annotators achieve high agreement on labels

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: ArgKP Dataset -> Preprocessing Pipeline -> LLM Inference (Zero/One/Five Shot) -> Fine-tuned Baselines -> Performance Evaluation -> Error Analysis

**Critical Path**: Comment Text → Argument Detection → Argument Extraction → Relationship Classification → Performance Metrics → Error Analysis

**Design Tradeoffs**: Few-shot vs. fine-tuning approaches balance between flexibility and performance; larger models provide better relationship classification but at higher computational cost; pre-defined categories enable consistent evaluation but may limit generalization

**Failure Signatures**: Over-prediction in emotionally charged language; missed arguments in long or nuanced comments; inability to handle implicit argumentation; poor performance on less common argument types

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate model performance on a different argument mining dataset with distinct topic domains
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the number and selection of few-shot examples
3. Implement human evaluation studies comparing model outputs against gold annotations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on pre-defined argument categories from a single dataset (ArgKP) may limit generalizability to other domains
- Performance differences could be influenced by prompt engineering variations and specific few-shot example selection
- Absolute performance numbers remain relatively modest (F1 scores in 0.5-0.7 range for relationship classification), suggesting these tasks remain challenging even for state-of-the-art models

## Confidence
- **High**: Error analysis findings - qualitative patterns align with established NLP challenges and are supported by multiple annotator validations
- **Medium**: Comparative performance claims - experimental design is rigorous but absolute performance remains modest and may be influenced by prompt variations

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on a different argument mining dataset with distinct topic domains to assess generalizability beyond the six polarizing topics studied
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the number and selection of few-shot examples to quantify their impact on performance
3. Implement human evaluation studies comparing model outputs against gold annotations to validate the automated metrics, particularly for the relationship classification task where performance was lower
