# From Questions to Clinical Recommendations: Large Language Models Driving Evidence-Based Clinical Decision Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.10282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10282
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Quicker achieves fine-grained question decomposition (over 75% F1 score), retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and near-comprehensive study screening (94.74% sensitivity at T=2)

## Executive Summary
Quicker is an LLM-powered system that automates the entire evidence-based clinical decision-making process, from question decomposition to recommendation formulation. It implements a five-phase workflow (question decomposition, literature search, study selection, evidence assessment, and recommendation formulation) modeled after standard clinical guideline development. The system integrates user interaction interfaces and external knowledge bases to support customized decision-making. Evaluation using the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset showed that Quicker achieves fine-grained question decomposition (over 75% F1 score), retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and near-comprehensive study screening (94.74% sensitivity at T=2). Quicker-assisted evidence assessment improved human accuracy to approximately 80%, and its recommendations were rated more comprehensive and logically coherent than clinician-written ones. In system-level testing, collaboration between Quicker and a single reviewer reduced recommendation development time to 20-40 minutes while maintaining alignment with established clinical guidelines.

## Method Summary
Quicker automates evidence-based clinical decision making through a five-phase sequential workflow. The system uses GPT-4o for most tasks and DeepSeek-v3 for privacy-sensitive full-text analysis. Key techniques include hierarchical RAG with query rewriting for evidence extraction, agentic iterative refinement for literature search, and chain-of-thought prompting for study screening. The system employs user interfaces for PICO revision, study inclusion decisions, and data verification. Evaluation was conducted using Q2CRBench-3, a benchmark dataset containing clinical questions and inclusion/exclusion labels derived from three guidelines (ACR RA, EAN Dementia, KDIGO CKD). Performance metrics include F1 scores for question decomposition, sensitivity/precision for search/screening, accuracy for evidence assessment, and direction alignment scores for recommendations.

## Key Results
- Quicker achieves over 75% F1 score for fine-grained question decomposition
- Study screening sensitivity reaches 94.74% at threshold T=2 using chain-of-thought prompting
- Human accuracy in evidence assessment improves to approximately 80% when assisted by Quicker
- System-level testing shows 20-40 minute recommendation development time with guideline alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aligning LLM workflows with established evidence-based medicine (EBM) methodology improves task reliability and clinician acceptance.
- Mechanism: Quicker decomposes the clinical guideline development process into five sequential phases (question decomposition, literature search, study selection, evidence assessment, recommendation formulation), each with standardized inputs/outputs modeled after real guideline workflows. This provides task structure that constrains LLM behavior within clinically meaningful boundaries.
- Core assumption: LLMs perform better when tasks are decomposed into discrete, well-defined sub-tasks with clear input-output specifications rather than end-to-end generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It implements a five-phase workflow...modeled after standard clinical guideline development."
  - [section] "Inspired by established methodologies in clinical guideline development[15,16], Quicker's workflow is designed as a sequential, five-phase process..."
  - [corpus] MedGUIDE (arxiv:2505.11613) similarly notes that clinical guidelines are "typically structured as decision trees" and questions whether LLMs can follow structured protocols—supporting the structural alignment hypothesis.
- Break condition: If downstream phases require context not captured in the structured outputs (e.g., nuanced clinical judgment), the pipeline may produce recommendations misaligned with real-world practice.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Task-specific prompting strategies (few-shot, self-reflection, chain-of-thought, agentic) outperform generic zero-shot approaches for complex clinical tasks.
- Mechanism: Quicker applies different prompting strategies per phase: few-shot with self-reflection for question decomposition (leveraging user interaction history), chain-of-thought (COT) for record screening (improving sensitivity from 86.96% to 94.74% at T=2), and agentic iterative refinement for literature search (improving macro sensitivity from 0.5240 to 0.5942).
- Core assumption: Different clinical tasks have different reasoning requirements; search benefits from iterative refinement while screening benefits from explicit reasoning chains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and near-comprehensive study screening (94.74% sensitivity at T=2)"
  - [section] "Among these methods, Few-shot and Self-reflection achieved similar performance...The most pronounced performance difference was observed in the extraction of Comparison concepts, where the Self-reflection method still outperformed the Few-shot approach."
  - [corpus] CPGPrompt (arxiv:2601.03475) addresses translating guidelines into LLM-executable decision support, suggesting prompt engineering is an active research direction, but corpus lacks direct comparisons of prompting strategies for EBM tasks.
- Break condition: If prompts become too specialized, they may overfit to benchmark datasets and fail to generalize to novel clinical domains.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with query rewriting enables accurate extraction from full-text articles despite varied writing styles.
- Mechanism: For evidence assessment, Quicker first attempts queries using article abstracts; if insufficient, it retrieves semantically similar passages from full text; if still insufficient, it rewrites queries to broaden search. This multi-stage approach balances accuracy with computational cost.
- Core assumption: Relevant information is often present in full text but requires iterative retrieval strategies to locate in heterogeneous document structures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Quicker-assisted evidence assessment improved human accuracy to approximately 80%"
  - [section] "Given the substantial variation in writing styles and phrasing across scientific articles, we implemented a hierarchical RAG strategy combined with query rewriting techniques..."
  - [corpus] Visual-Conversational Interface (arxiv:2507.02920) combines interactive visualization with evidence-based explanations, supporting the value of grounding systems in scientific evidence, but corpus lacks direct comparison of hierarchical vs flat RAG for clinical tasks.
- Break condition: If articles lack structured abstracts or use highly non-standard formatting, the hierarchical approach may fail to retrieve relevant content.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **PICO Framework** (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)
  - Why needed here: Quicker uses PICO decomposition to structure clinical questions into searchable components. The system's question decomposition phase extracts these elements to enable precise evidence matching.
  - Quick check question: Given a clinical question "Should patients with RA receive MTX monotherapy or combination therapy?", can you identify the PICO components?

- Concept: **GRADE Methodology** (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations)
  - Why needed here: Quicker's evidence assessment phase uses GRADE to systematically rate evidence quality based on risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, and indirectness. Understanding this framework is essential for interpreting Quicker's outputs.
  - Quick check question: What five domains does GRADE consider when rating evidence certainty?

- Concept: **Sensitivity vs. Precision Trade-off in Retrieval**
  - Why needed here: The study selection phase explicitly trades off sensitivity (capturing all relevant studies) against precision (excluding irrelevant studies) using thresholds. System users must understand this to configure appropriate screening strictness.
  - Quick check question: If you need to ensure no relevant studies are missed but can tolerate more false positives, should you increase or decrease the screening threshold T?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  LLM Orchestrator -> Prompt Templates -> RAG System -> PubMed API Tool -> User Interfaces -> Knowledge Bases

- Critical path:
  1. Question → PICO decomposition (self-reflection method, 5-shot examples)
  2. PICO → Search terms → Agentic literature search (up to 5 refinement iterations)
  3. Records → Record screening (COT method, threshold T) → Full-text assessment (PICO matching, threshold M)
  4. Studies → RoB assessment + Data extraction (hierarchical RAG) → GRADE profiles
  5. Evidence profiles → Summaries → Analysis → Recommendation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Basic vs. COT screening**: Basic (higher precision) vs. COT (higher sensitivity, ~23.5 more records included on average)
  - **T threshold**: Higher T increases precision but may miss relevant studies; paper recommends T=2 for balance
  - **M matching threshold**: M=3 (stricter) vs. M=2 (near-comprehensive inclusion but precision loss Δ0.11-0.29)
  - **Automation level**: Full automation vs. human-in-the-loop at critical checkpoints (question decomposition, full-text assessment, data extraction)
  - **Model selection**: GPT-4o for concurrency needs vs. local DeepSeek-v3 for privacy-sensitive full-text analysis

- Failure signatures:
  - **RoB assessment discrepancies**: Quicker tends toward "Serious" ratings vs. GDG's "Not serious"—may reflect missing contextual scoring guidelines (κ=0.190)
  - **Numerical data extraction errors**: 71.56% precision due to unstructured presentation, varied locations, and interacting challenges (see Supplementary Table 4)
  - **Indirect evidence inclusion**: Primary error source in full-text assessment when studies loosely match target PICO
  - **Missing selective reporting bias**: Quicker showed 0% sensitivity for this domain, requiring detailed method-outcome comparisons

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Single-question end-to-end validation**: Run Quicker on one clinical question from Q2CRBench-3, verify each phase output matches expected format and quality metrics (e.g., decomposition F1 >75%, screening sensitivity >90%)
  2. **Search strategy comparison**: Compare Basic vs. Agentic methods on a held-out clinical question, measure sensitivity difference and analyze refinement iterations
  3. **Threshold calibration study**: Run record screening with T=1, T=2, T=3 on the same record set, quantify sensitivity-precision tradeoff to establish domain-specific recommendations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can specialized attention and memory mechanisms improve LLM accuracy in extracting numerical data from unstructured clinical literature?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "future research will focus on designing more tailored approaches for data collection to further enhance automation" by leveraging "advances in attention mechanisms, memory systems, and agent-based technologies."
- Why unresolved: Current methods using hierarchical RAG achieved only 71.56% precision on numerical data due to complex, unstructured presentation in source texts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation on the Q2CRBench-3 numerical dataset showing significantly higher precision using tailored architectures compared to the current RAG baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does incorporating explicit, granular evaluation criteria into prompts resolve the subjectivity discrepancies between LLM and human expert risk-of-bias (RoB) assessments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The discussion notes discrepancies in RoB ratings likely stem from "context-specific downgrade thresholds" and suggests that "providing additional explicit evaluation criteria... could reduce discrepancies caused by subjective interpretations."
- Why unresolved: LLMs currently favor "Serious" ratings due to information asymmetry, while human experts distribute ratings more evenly based on implicit holistic contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment measuring the agreement (quadratic-weighted $\kappa$) between Quicker and human assessors when the model is prompted with detailed, context-specific scoring rules.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does Quicker's performance in study selection and evidence assessment generalize to non-randomized study designs, such as observational or qualitative studies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note their validation was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and state, "Further testing across diverse disease types, study designs, assessment tasks, and clinical questions is essential."
- Why unresolved: The system was optimized for RCTs using the GRADE methodology and RoB 2 criteria; its applicability to the heterogeneous formats of observational studies remains unproven.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of Quicker's sensitivity and precision on a benchmark dataset derived from clinical guidelines based on observational or non-interventional evidence.

## Limitations

- System performance is validated only on three clinical domains (rheumatoid arthritis, dementia, chronic kidney disease), limiting generalizability
- 0% sensitivity for detecting selective reporting bias indicates a fundamental gap in comprehensive evidence assessment
- Dependency on proprietary LLM APIs creates potential reproducibility barriers and performance consistency concerns

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims**:
- The five-phase workflow structure improves task completion reliability compared to end-to-end approaches
- Chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves study screening sensitivity (86.96% → 94.74%)
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints at critical phases (question decomposition, full-text assessment) improve overall accuracy
- The system can reduce recommendation development time from days to 20-40 minutes while maintaining guideline alignment

**Medium Confidence Claims**:
- Quicker's recommendations are more comprehensive and logically coherent than clinician-written ones
- Hierarchical RAG with query rewriting enables accurate full-text extraction despite varied writing styles
- Task-specific prompting strategies outperform generic approaches for complex clinical tasks
- Collaboration between Quicker and single reviewer matches guideline accuracy

**Low Confidence Claims**:
- Quicker's recommendations would maintain accuracy across diverse clinical domains beyond the three tested
- The system can operate effectively with local LLM deployment rather than proprietary APIs
- The observed time savings would scale proportionally to larger, more complex clinical questions
- The current evidence assessment capabilities (particularly selective reporting bias detection) are sufficient for clinical practice

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Generalization Test**: Deploy Quicker on clinical questions from five additional medical specialties not represented in Q2CRBench-3, measuring whether the reported F1 scores (>75%) and sensitivity metrics (>90%) hold across diverse clinical contexts.

2. **Real-World Time-to-Recommendation Study**: Conduct a prospective trial comparing Quicker-assisted recommendations against traditional guideline development workflows across 10 complex clinical questions, measuring actual time savings and user satisfaction beyond the controlled benchmark conditions.

3. **Critical Appraisal Capability Assessment**: Design a targeted evaluation focusing specifically on selective reporting bias detection, testing whether prompt engineering modifications or additional knowledge base integration can improve from 0% to clinically acceptable sensitivity levels.
