# Z0-Inf: Zeroth Order Approximation for Data Influence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11832
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11832
- Reference count: 35
- This paper introduces a zeroth-order approximation method (Z0-Inf) for estimating data influence in machine learning models, particularly addressing the computational challenges of large language models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a zeroth-order approximation method (Z0-Inf) for estimating data influence in machine learning models, particularly addressing the computational challenges of large language models. The core idea is to bypass gradient computations by directly fitting vectors to approximate finite differences in losses across model checkpoints, using only loss values and model weights. This approach is both more accurate and significantly faster than first-order methods like TracIn and second-order methods like LoGra, especially for large models.

## Method Summary
Z0-Inf estimates data influence by fitting vectors to approximate finite differences in losses across model checkpoints, bypassing expensive gradient computations. For self-influence, it computes the variance of loss across checkpoints. For train-test influence, it finds nearest neighbor checkpoints within a distance threshold, fits directional gradient vectors via least squares, and aggregates dot products across checkpoints. The method uses precomputation of Gram matrices of weights and offline loss values for efficiency, making it particularly suitable for large language models where traditional influence methods are computationally prohibitive.

## Key Results
- Z0-Inf achieves superior accuracy in self-influence estimation compared to baseline methods
- For train-test influence in fine-tuned LLMs, Z0-Inf achieves comparable or improved accuracy with an order of magnitude less computation time and memory
- Z0-Inf is both more accurate and significantly faster than first-order methods like TracIn and second-order methods like LoGra

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Z0-Inf works by approximating the influence of training data on model predictions without computing gradients. It leverages the fact that finite differences in loss values across checkpoints can be directly approximated using only loss values and model weights. By fitting vectors to these differences and aggregating them appropriately, Z0-Inf captures the essential information about data influence while avoiding the computational overhead of gradient calculations. This zeroth-order approach is particularly effective for large models where gradient-based methods become prohibitively expensive.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gradient-based influence methods**: First-order approximations using loss gradients; needed to understand why Z0-Inf's zeroth-order approach is more efficient and sometimes more accurate.
- **Finite difference approximations**: Numerical methods for approximating derivatives; crucial for understanding how Z0-Inf approximates gradients without computing them.
- **Checkpoint-based training**: Saving model weights and losses during training; required to implement Z0-Inf's core algorithm using historical training data.
- **Variance-based self-influence**: Using variance of loss across checkpoints as a proxy for self-influence; important baseline method that Z0-Inf builds upon.
- **Nearest neighbor search in weight space**: Finding similar checkpoints to compute directional gradients; key algorithmic component for the train-test influence estimation.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Model checkpoints (θ₀,...,θₜ) -> Loss storage -> Gram matrix precomputation -> Neighbor search (distance τ) -> Directional gradient fitting (least squares) -> Influence score aggregation
- **Critical path**: Save checkpoints and losses during training → Precompute Gram matrices → For each checkpoint, find nearest neighbors → Fit directional gradients → Compute influence scores
- **Design tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. computational cost (uses last-layer parameters only for fair comparison) vs. memory usage (Gram matrix precomputation)
- **Failure signatures**: Low correlation with SSRT baseline (check if noise is inherent or if implementation error exists) → High memory usage (verify Gram matrix optimization and last-layer parameter usage)
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Verify self-influence on small dataset matches paper results, 2) Compare Z0-Inf vs. TracIn runtime on same model, 3) Test nearest neighbor selection with different distance metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends on quality and frequency of checkpoints; insufficient checkpointing may degrade accuracy
- Nearest neighbor selection threshold τ requires careful tuning for optimal performance
- Limited evaluation to last-layer parameters only, which may not capture full model influence patterns

## Confidence
High: Core algorithm, mathematical formulation, and empirical results are clearly specified and reproducible. Medium: Some implementation details like distance metric and threshold τ require clarification.

## Next Checks
1. Verify self-influence correlation with SSRT on a small dataset to confirm baseline functionality
2. Benchmark runtime comparison between Z0-Inf and TracIn on same model architecture
3. Test sensitivity to checkpoint frequency and distance threshold τ on influence estimation accuracy
