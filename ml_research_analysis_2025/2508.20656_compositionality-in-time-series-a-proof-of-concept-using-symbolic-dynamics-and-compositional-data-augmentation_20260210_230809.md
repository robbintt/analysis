# Compositionality in Time Series: A Proof of Concept using Symbolic Dynamics and Compositional Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Clinical time series exhibit compositional structure that enables effective synthetic data generation via symbolic dynamics

## Executive Summary
This work investigates compositionality in time series by formalizing it as a property of the data generation process, where observations are generated from sequences of latent physiological states via a homomorphism. The authors present a data-driven pipeline using symbolic dynamics and compositional data augmentation to deconstruct and reconstruct these processes. Two empirically testable criteria, rooted in domain adaptation theory, are introduced to evaluate whether original time series data is compositional.

Experiments on clinical time series datasets (MIMIC-III and eICU) show that training and testing models on compositionally synthesized data yields performance comparable to using original data, significantly outperforming randomization-based augmentation (CutMix). Additionally, downstream SOFA score prediction improves significantly when training on synthesized data. These results suggest that clinical time series are indeed compositional, enabling effective synthetic data generation for low-resource scenarios.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize compositionality in time series as a homomorphism from latent physiological states to observed data, enabling compositional data augmentation through symbolic dynamics. The pipeline involves discretizing continuous physiological signals into symbolic sequences, then composing new sequences by combining symbols from different original sequences. Two criteria for evaluating compositionality are introduced: distributional consistency between original and synthesized data, and invariance of model performance when trained on synthesized versus original data. The method is validated on clinical time series from MIMIC-III and eICU, with downstream task performance measured for SOFA score prediction.

## Key Results
- Training and testing models on compositionally synthesized data yields performance comparable to using original data
- Synthesized data significantly outperforms randomization-based augmentation (CutMix) on both datasets
- Downstream SOFA score prediction improves significantly when training on synthesized data
- Results support the hypothesis that clinical time series exhibit compositional structure via homomorphism from latent physiological states

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages symbolic dynamics to discretize continuous physiological signals into symbolic sequences, which can then be recomposed to generate new synthetic data. This approach captures the underlying compositional structure of clinical time series, where observations are generated from sequences of latent physiological states. By preserving the distributional properties of the original data while enabling controlled augmentation, the method maintains the compositional relationships that are critical for downstream task performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Symbolic dynamics**: Discretizing continuous signals into symbolic sequences to capture temporal patterns; needed for transforming continuous physiological data into a form suitable for compositional manipulation
- **Homomorphism in time series**: Mathematical framework for representing compositional structure where observations are generated from latent states; needed to formalize the theoretical basis for compositionality
- **Domain adaptation theory**: Framework for evaluating whether synthetic data preserves distributional properties of original data; needed to develop empirically testable criteria for compositionality
- **Compositional data augmentation**: Method for generating synthetic data by combining components from different sequences; needed to create new training examples that maintain underlying structure
- **SOFA score prediction**: Downstream clinical task for evaluating utility of synthesized data; needed to demonstrate practical value beyond theoretical compositionality
- **MIMIC-III and eICU datasets**: Large-scale clinical time series repositories; needed for empirical validation on real-world medical data

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw physiological signals -> Symbolic discretization -> Symbol composition -> Synthetic time series -> Model training -> Performance evaluation

**Critical Path**: The core pipeline transforms raw continuous signals into symbolic sequences, composes new sequences by combining symbols, and evaluates the resulting synthetic data against the original data using both distributional metrics and downstream task performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades off between preserving fine-grained temporal information (lost in symbolic discretization) and capturing higher-level compositional structure. Alternative approaches like wavelet transforms or recurrence plots might preserve different aspects of temporal structure but lack the explicit compositional framework.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when the symbolic discretization loses critical temporal dependencies, when the composition process generates physiologically implausible sequences, or when the downstream task requires fine-grained temporal resolution that symbolic representation cannot capture.

**First Experiments**: (1) Compare symbolic dynamics augmentation against CutMix and other randomization-based methods on MIMIC-III vital signs; (2) Test compositional hypothesis on eICU data from different medical specialties; (3) Evaluate cross-hospital generalization by training on MIMIC-III and testing on eICU data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical formalization of compositionality remains unproven beyond empirical demonstration
- Symbolic dynamics may not capture all forms of temporal compositionality, particularly in non-stationary or non-Markovian processes
- Generalizability to other clinical domains or non-clinical time series data remains untested

## Confidence
- High confidence in empirical results showing comparable performance between original and synthesized data for MIMIC-III and eICU datasets
- Medium confidence in assertion that clinical time series are compositional, relying heavily on domain adaptation theory rather than rigorous mathematical proof
- Low confidence in broader applicability of findings to other types of time series data or clinical settings beyond tested domains

## Next Checks
1. Test compositional hypothesis on additional clinical time series datasets from different medical specialties and institutions to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing symbolic dynamics-based augmentation with alternative methods that preserve different aspects of temporal structure (e.g., wavelet transforms, recurrence plots)
3. Implement cross-validation studies where models trained on synthesized data from one hospital's dataset are tested on another hospital's data to evaluate robustness to domain shifts while maintaining compositional properties
