# Failure-Aware Bimanual Teleoperation via Conservative Value Guided Assistance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01092
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01092
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Achieves up to 98% success rate and 25% faster completion times on 10 daily-life bimanual tasks compared to conventional teleoperation and shared-autonomy baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of failure-aware teleoperation in contact-rich manipulation by introducing a value-guided framework that provides compliant haptic assistance while preserving continuous human authority. The key innovation is using conservative value learning to estimate task feasibility from heterogeneous offline teleoperation data, yielding a risk-sensitive success score that remains reliable under distribution shift. During operation, this success score regulates assistance intensity while a learned actor provides corrective motion directions, integrated through joint-space impedance feedback on the master side. Experiments on 10 daily-life manipulation tasks demonstrate that this approach effectively prevents failures while maintaining human control authority.

## Method Summary
The method combines conservative value learning with haptic assistance for bimanual teleoperation. First, a critic network is trained via Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) on offline teleoperation data containing both successful and failed trajectories, learning to predict task success probability while remaining conservative on out-of-distribution actions. An auxiliary failure-prediction head improves temporal modeling of failure risks. The critic outputs a normalized success score that gates assistance intensity. A separate actor network is trained to maximize this success score while staying close to the original teleoperation actions, providing corrective motion directions. During online operation, the success score modulates the impedance gain of a joint-space velocity controller on the leader (slave) arm, rendering corrective torques toward the actor's suggested motions when assistance is warranted.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 98% success rate across 10 daily-life bimanual manipulation tasks
- Reduces completion times by up to 25% compared to conventional teleoperation
- Maintains continuous human authority while preventing failures through compliant haptic guidance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by embedding failure awareness into the teleoperation loop through conservative value estimation. The CQL-trained critic provides a reliable success score that remains robust to distribution shift, avoiding over-optimistic predictions that could lead to dangerous guidance. By gating assistance intensity with this score and integrating corrective motions through impedance control, the system provides help only when needed while preserving human control authority. The conservative learning objective prevents the agent from recommending actions outside the safe distribution observed in training data, ensuring the haptic guidance remains trustworthy.

## Foundational Learning
- Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): Needed to prevent overestimation of out-of-distribution actions; quick check: verify Q-values are lower for OOD actions in validation
- Value Normalization: Needed to map arbitrary Q-values to interpretable [0,1] success scores; quick check: confirm Q_min and Q_max capture the range across all tasks
- Impedance Control: Needed to render compliant corrective torques that preserve human authority; quick check: validate torque rendering matches desired velocity corrections
- Failure Prediction Head: Needed to improve temporal modeling of failure risks; quick check: test whether H-step predictions correlate with actual failures
- Actor-Critic Framework: Needed to separate value estimation from motion generation; quick check: verify actor actions increase Q-values while staying close to teleoperation inputs

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Visual observations + Joint velocities -> State Encoder -> Critic (CQL) -> Success Score -> Gating Function -> Actor -> Corrective Motion -> Impedance Controller -> Corrective Torque

**Critical path**: Human inputs → Actor → Corrective motion → Impedance feedback → Slave motion → Task completion

**Design tradeoffs**: Conservative learning (safety) vs. assistance strength (effectiveness); assistance intensity (helpfulness) vs. human authority (transparency); computational complexity (real-time performance) vs. model capacity (generalization)

**Failure signatures**: Over-conservative guidance blocking valid motions (Q too low for correct actions); guidance fails to prevent failures (Q doesn't drop near failure states); oscillatory haptic feedback (actor output instability or insufficient filtering)

**First experiments**: 1) Validate CQL critic separates success/failure trajectories on held-out data; 2) Test actor's ability to suggest corrective motions that increase success score; 3) Verify impedance controller renders smooth corrective torques proportional to guidance intensity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Neural network architectures and hyperparameters are unspecified, significantly impacting reproducibility
- Visual observation processing pipeline (resolution, frame rate, encoding) is not detailed
- Trajectory-level binary labeling assumes perfect human annotation without uncertainty quantification
- Performance claims are limited to 10 specific daily-life tasks, generalizability to novel scenarios is unclear
- Assumes leader-follower teleoperation setup which may not generalize to other architectures

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core technical approach and algorithmic framework
- Medium confidence in the quantitative performance claims due to unspecified implementation details
- Low confidence in generalizability beyond the evaluated task set

## Next Checks
1. Implement and train the CQL critic with auxiliary failure prediction head on a small subset of data (one task), validate Q-value separation between success/failure trajectories, and tune hyperparameters for conservative estimation
2. Integrate the learned actor with the impedance controller on a simulated bimanual manipulator, verify that guidance intensity g_t modulates smoothly with normalized Q-values, and test corrective torque rendering
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the conservative learning component to quantify its contribution to failure prevention versus baseline teleoperation
