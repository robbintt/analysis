# Signal Fidelity Index-Aware Calibration for Dementia Predictions Across Heterogeneous Real-World Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.08679
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08679
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SFI-aware calibration at α=2.0 significantly improved all performance metrics (p<0.001) across 2,500 synthetic datasets, with improvements ranging from 10.3% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5% for Recall.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of "diagnostic signal decay" - performance degradation when machine learning models trained on electronic health records are deployed across healthcare systems with inconsistent diagnostic coding practices. The authors introduce a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) that quantifies diagnostic data reliability using six interpretable components, and propose SFI-aware calibration, a post-hoc adjustment method that scales model prediction probabilities based on patient SFI scores. Across extensive synthetic experiments, this approach significantly improved dementia prediction performance metrics without requiring labeled outcomes in the target domain.

## Method Summary
The authors propose SFI-aware calibration to address diagnostic signal decay in EHR-based dementia prediction. The method computes a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) for each patient using six components: specificity, temporal consistency, entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory stability. These components are normalized and averaged to create a scalar SFI score. The calibration applies a multiplicative adjustment to raw model probabilities based on the patient's SFI relative to a reference dataset, using hyperparameter α. The approach is tested on 2,500 synthetic datasets using random forest models trained on age and race predictors, with optimal α=2.0 identified through significance-based plateau detection.

## Key Results
- SFI-aware calibration at α=2.0 significantly improved all performance metrics (p<0.001) across 2,500 synthetic datasets
- Performance improvements ranged from 10.3% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5% for Recall
- The method notably increased Precision by 31.9% and F1-score by 26.1%
- Calibration brought F1-score and Recall within 1% of reference standards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Multiplicative probability adjustment based on data fidelity can recover predictive performance lost to diagnostic signal decay.
- **Mechanism:** The SFI-aware calibration applies a post-hoc scaling factor to raw model probabilities, amplifying predictions for patients with high SFI scores and attenuating those with low scores.
- **Core assumption:** Prediction miscalibration correlates systematically with the computed SFI.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Methods, Page 6]: Defines calibration formula; [Results, Pages 12-13]: Shows 10.3% to 32.5% improvements; [corpus]: TabStruct validates structural fidelity as evaluation dimension.
- **Break condition:** If the relationship between SFI and prediction error is non-monotonic or zero, the adjustment will introduce noise.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A composite index of six interpretable features effectively proxies the latent reliability of diagnostic codes.
- **Mechanism:** SFI aggregates six normalized components including specificity, temporal consistency, entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory stability.
- **Core assumption:** The six components are sufficient to capture diagnostic signal decay.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Methods, Page 6, Table 1]: Defines six components; [Discussion, Page 17]: Notes components were designed to be interpretable; [corpus]: Measuring multi-calibration discusses calibration complexity.
- **Break condition:** If specific components are irrelevant for a disease phenotype, the proxy loses validity.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Label-free calibration is feasible by relying on structural metadata rather than ground-truth outcomes in the target domain.
- **Mechanism:** The method computes SFI using only available structured EHR data and compares it to the SFI distribution of the source/training domain.
- **Core assumption:** Documentation/coding variability is fully captured by the SFI.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Abstract]: States goal is to improve performance without requiring outcome labels; [Discussion, Pages 15-16]: Compares SFI favorably against methods requiring target labels; [corpus]: Classifier Calibration at Scale highlights post-hoc methods.
- **Break condition:** If the target domain has high data fidelity but the model fails for other reasons, SFI calibration won't address the root cause.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Model Calibration (Post-hoc)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper proposes a "post-hoc" adjustment method that modifies output probabilities of already trained models rather than retraining them.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the SFI method change the weights of the Random Forest trees, or does it only transform the final probability output?

- **Concept: Distribution Shift vs. Signal Decay**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper distinguishes standard distribution shift from "diagnostic signal decay" - the measurement itself is variable and unreliable.
  - **Quick check question:** If a hospital changes its EHR software, causing all diagnosis codes to shift slightly, is this signal decay or standard covariate shift?

- **Concept: Composite Metric Normalization**
  - **Why needed here:** SFI averages 6 components, requiring normalization of diverse features onto a comparable 0-1 scale.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is "1 minus normalized entropy" used for the Entropy component rather than raw entropy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Ingestion -> SFI Engine -> Reference Calculator -> Calibrator -> Model
- **Critical path:** Medication Alignment and Contextual Concordance components rely on domain-specific knowledge mappings (e.g., dementia-specific drugs, appropriate encounter types). Incorrect mappings invalidate SFI scores.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Simplicity vs. Specificity: Simple linear scaling (α) is computationally cheap but may underfit complex non-linear relationships
  - Universality vs. Phenotype-lock: SFI requires disease-specific mappings, increasing maintenance overhead when generalizing
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Over-correction: α > 2.0 may harm AUC and Calibration
  - Zero-SFI Division: Reference SFI of 0 causes division by zero
  - Negative Probabilities: Low raw probabilities with negative SFI deviation could theoretically push predictions below 0
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Replication: Generate synthetic data to verify α=2.0 reproduces ~30% F1 improvement
  2. Ablation Study: Remove one SFI component at a time to measure performance impact
  3. Real-Data Stress Test: Apply pre-computed SFI to different EHR dataset (e.g., MIMIC-IV) to test label-free claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can SFI-aware calibration replicate observed performance gains on real-world administrative datasets like Medicare claims where labeled outcomes are unavailable?
- **Open Question 2:** Do the six SFI components require phenotype-specific re-weighting or structural adaptation for conditions other than dementia?
- **Open Question 3:** Does integrating SFI directly into model training yield greater performance robustness than the current post-hoc calibration approach?

## Limitations
- The six SFI components may not be universally sufficient for all disease phenotypes and require manual curation
- The linear scaling assumption may be too simplistic for complex non-linear relationships between data quality and prediction reliability
- Generalizability to other diseases and EHR systems remains unproven beyond synthetic data

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Synthetic data generation framework and SFI calculation methodology are clearly specified and reproducible. Statistical significance of performance improvements is well-supported.

**Medium Confidence:** The conceptual framework for addressing diagnostic signal decay through fidelity-aware calibration is sound, but real-world validation is needed.

**Low Confidence:** Generalizability to other diseases and EHR systems, and sufficiency of the six-component SFI for capturing all aspects of diagnostic signal decay.

## Next Checks

1. Apply the pre-computed SFI and calibration to a different publicly available EHR dataset (e.g., MIMIC-IV) to test the "label-free" claim on real, non-synthetic noise.

2. Systematically remove each SFI component and measure performance degradation to identify which components are most critical for observed improvements.

3. Adapt the SFI components for a different disease phenotype (e.g., Diabetes) by redefining disease-specific mappings and evaluating whether similar performance improvements are achieved.
