## Executive Summary
This paper presents a class-specific GAN framework for generating synthetic ECG beats to address data scarcity and imbalance in cardiac amyloidosis (CA) research. The approach uses bidirectional LSTMs in both generator and discriminator to capture temporal dependencies in ECG morphology. A user-friendly Streamlit GUI and modular training/generation scripts enable clinical researchers to produce labelled synthetic data without deep ML expertise. The tool targets improved early diagnosis and patient stratification in CA by augmenting limited datasets with physiologically plausible synthetic ECG beats.

## Method Summary
The method employs class-specific GANs trained separately for each of five ECG beat types from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The generator uses a bidirectional LSTM (input=187, hidden=128) to process noise into 187-point ECG signals, while the discriminator uses a bidirectional LSTM (input=187, hidden=256) to distinguish real from synthetic beats. Training runs for 3000 epochs with batch size 96 and Adam optimizer (lr=2×10⁻⁴). Generated beats are saved as CSVs and can be merged with real data for downstream machine learning tasks. The system includes a Streamlit GUI for interactive generation and validation.

## Key Results
- Class-specific GAN architecture preserves minority class morphology and variability
- Bidirectional LSTM layers capture temporal dependencies essential for ECG beat synthesis
- Fixed-seed reproducibility and modular design enable clinical researcher adoption
- Planned experiments will evaluate morphological fidelity, statistical similarity, and downstream ML performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Bidirectional LSTM layers enable realistic ECG beat synthesis by capturing temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions along the signal.
- **Mechanism:** The generator processes noise through a BiLSTM (input size 187, hidden size 128), producing a 256-dimensional representation that preserves beat morphology through temporal context. The discriminator similarly uses BiLSTM (hidden size 256) to classify real vs. synthetic beats based on temporal coherence.
- **Core assumption:** ECG diagnostic features (QRS morphology, ST-segment, T-wave) depend on sequential relationships that bidirectional processing captures better than unidirectional or non-recurrent architectures.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section IV.B]: "a bidirectional LSTM layer with input size 187, hidden size 128... to model temporal dependencies along the beat"
  - [Section IV.B]: "The discriminator mirrors this design... comprising a bidirectional LSTM with input size 187 and size 256"
  - [Corpus]: Weak direct evidence—neighbor papers use diffusion and contrastive learning but do not compare LSTM-based temporal modeling specifically.
- **Break condition:** If temporal dependencies are not the primary discriminative feature (e.g., if amplitude statistics alone suffice), BiLSTM complexity may not justify computational cost.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Training class-specific generators rather than a single multi-class generator preserves minority class morphology and variability.
- **Mechanism:** Each arrhythmia class (normal, atrial premature, PVC, fusion types) trains an independent generator-discriminator pair. This isolates each class's distribution, preventing dominant classes (82.77% normal beats) from overwhelming minority patterns.
- **Core assumption:** Class-conditional generation via separate models better captures rare phenotypes than a single conditional generator with class embeddings.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "allowing clinical researchers to train class-specific generators once and then interactively produce large volumes of labelled synthetic beats that preserve the distribution of minority classes"
  - [Section IV.C]: "Training is performed separately for each arrhythmia class, yielding class-specific generators that focus on reproducing the morphology and variability of a single beat type"
  - [Corpus]: No direct comparison in neighbors; related work on synthetic ECG (arXiv:2505.18189, arXiv:2511.09895) does not evaluate class-specific vs. unified training.
- **Break condition:** If classes share substantial morphological overlap (e.g., CA subtypes AL vs. ATTR with subtle differences), separate generators may fragment signal space and reduce sample efficiency.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Fixed-seed reproducibility and modular training/generation scripts enable clinical researchers to adopt GAN augmentation without deep ML expertise.
- **Mechanism:** Global random seed (2021) set for NumPy and PyTorch; model weights saved as `.pth` files; generation script operates independently after training. Streamlit GUI exposes hyperparameters as sliders with validation.
- **Core assumption:** Usability barriers (code editing, environment configuration) are primary obstacles to clinical adoption, not model performance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section IV.C]: "a global random seed (2021) is set for NumPy and PyTorch to ensure experiment reproducibility"
  - [Section V.B]: "All required inputs are surfaced as form elements with sensible defaults, and invalid states... are intercepted with explicit warning or error messages"
  - [Corpus]: No direct evidence—neighbor papers do not address usability or tooling for clinical researchers.
- **Break condition:** If downstream task performance (AUROC, AUPRC gains) is marginal despite usability, adoption may still fail without demonstrated clinical utility.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire augmentation pipeline depends on understanding adversarial training dynamics (generator vs. discriminator, mode collapse, vanishing gradients).
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the generator loss uses the discriminator's output with target label 1, rather than directly minimizing distance to real data?

- **Concept: Bidirectional LSTM for sequence modeling**
  - **Why needed here:** Both generator and discriminator use BiLSTMs to process 187-point ECG beats; understanding hidden states and sequence processing is essential for debugging or modifying architecture.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a bidirectional LSTM capture QRS morphology better than a unidirectional LSTM processing the same beat?

- **Concept: ECG signal morphology and CA phenotypes**
  - **Why needed here:** Evaluation metrics (DTW, productivity rate, feature extraction) assume familiarity with QRS voltage, ST-segment, T-wave, and CA-specific patterns (low voltage, pseudoinfarction).
  - **Quick check question:** What ECG features distinguish cardiac amyloidosis from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and why might synthetic augmentation help when these features are subtle?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - `train_gan.py` -> `app.py` (Streamlit GUI) -> `generate_signals.py`
  - Data flow: `mitbih_processed.csv` → class-specific DataLoader → GAN training → `.pth` weights → noise sampling → synthetic CSV

- **Critical path:**
  1. Prepare ECG data as CSV with 187 columns (samples) + class label column
  2. Run `train_gan.py` (or GUI) for target class; monitor loss curves for convergence
  3. Verify generated beats via real-vs-synthetic comparison plot
  4. Run `generate_signals.py` to produce N synthetic beats
  5. Merge synthetic CSV with real data for downstream classifier/clustering

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Class-specific vs. conditional GAN:** Separate generators improve minority class fidelity but require training N models and fragment data. Assumption: simplicity and isolation outweigh unified model benefits.
  - **BiLSTM vs. transformer:** BiLSTM is simpler and proven for 187-point sequences; transformers may scale better for multi-beat generation (see corpus: arXiv:2505.18189 explores longer sequences).
  - **Fixed seed vs. stochasticity:** Fixed seed ensures reproducibility but limits diversity across runs. Paper sets seed 2021 for all experiments.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Mode collapse:** Generated beats look identical across noise inputs. Monitor via comparison plots every 300 epochs.
  - **Discriminator dominance:** D loss → 0, G loss diverges. Check learning rate balance; paper uses equal lr=2×10^-4 for both.
  - **Physiological implausibility:** Synthetic beats violate ECG constraints (negative R-peaks, impossible intervals). Run KS tests on extracted features before downstream use.
  - **Overfitting to training class:** Generator memorizes training beats. Check productivity rate against 95th percentile real-real distance threshold.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline morphology check:** Train generator on "Normal" class; compute DTW and productivity rate between synthetic and held-out real normal beats. Expect median DTW < real-real 95th percentile.
  2. **Minority class augmentation:** Train on rare class (e.g., PVC, 0.73% of data); generate 10,000 synthetic beats; measure KS statistic for QRS duration and R-peak amplitude. Target: non-significant p-values (p > 0.05).
  3. **Downstream classifier impact:** Train binary classifier (CA vs. non-CA) on three regimes: original imbalanced data, naive oversampling, GAN-augmented. Compare AUROC and AUPRC on held-out real test set. Expect AUPRC improvement in GAN regime if augmentation is effective.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation plan remains incomplete with no reported results for proposed metrics (DTW, KS tests, AUROC, clustering stability)
- Comparison of class-specific vs. unified GAN approaches is purely theoretical without empirical validation
- Clinical impact claims depend entirely on downstream task performance which is untested

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: GAN architecture specification (BiLSTM layers, optimizer settings, training epochs) is clearly defined and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical justification for class-specific generators is sound but lacks empirical comparison with unified conditional GANs
- **Low confidence**: Clinical impact claims (improved early diagnosis, patient stratification) are entirely dependent on future experiments that have not been conducted or reported

## Next Checks

1. **Morphological fidelity validation**: Train the GAN on "Normal" class and compute DTW distance distribution between synthetic and held-out real beats. Compare against real-real 95th percentile threshold to verify synthetic beats are morphologically plausible.

2. **Minority class preservation test**: Train on rare PVC class (0.73% prevalence) and generate 10,000 synthetic beats. Apply KS tests on QRS duration and R-peak amplitude to ensure synthetic distribution matches real minority class statistics (p > 0.05).

3. **Downstream classifier impact**: Implement three experimental conditions using real test set: (a) original imbalanced data, (b) naive oversampling, (c) GAN-augmented data. Train binary classifier (CA vs. non-CA) in each condition and compare AUROC/AUPRC to quantify augmentation benefit.
