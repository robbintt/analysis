# Are LLM Agents Behaviorally Coherent? Latent Profiles for Social Simulation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.03736
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03736
- **Authors:** James Mooney; Josef Woldense; Zheng Robert Jia; Shirley Anugrah Hayati; My Ha Nguyen; Vipul Raheja; Dongyeop Kang
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LLM agents show systematic behavioral inconsistencies, suppressing disagreement and treating positive/negative sentiment asymmetrically despite explicit preference assignments.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language model agents exhibit internal behavioral consistency in social interactions. The authors develop a framework that assigns agents explicit preference and openness scores, then measures whether these latent profiles predict conversational agreement outcomes. Across multiple model families and sizes, agents systematically suppress disagreement even at maximal preference gaps, treat positive and negative sentiment alignment asymmetrically, and allow topic contentiousness to override preference alignment. While agents maintain surface-level plausibility, these deeper inconsistencies reveal they fail to reliably substitute for humans in research contexts requiring behavioral coherence.

## Method Summary
The framework constructs agents with explicit latent profiles (Preference P, Openness O, Bias B) and demographic attributes, then pairs them for 5-turn dialogues on contentious topics. Agents are evaluated by LLM-as-a-judge scoring, with agreement scores compared against bootstrap-derived expected distributions. The study tests six formal hypotheses about agreement patterns using statistical significance thresholds (p<0.01) and analyzes results across model families including GPT-3.5-turbo, Claude-3-Haiku, Llama3.1, and Qwen2.5.

## Key Results
- Agents virtually never disagree, with fewer than 1% of conversations yielding scores below 3, even at maximal preference gaps
- Observed mean agreement (3.6) at maximum preference gaps is roughly twice the expected value (1.8)
- Pairs anchored at negative sentiment (1,1) systematically agree less than those anchored at positive sentiment (5,5), even under identical preference gaps
- Topic contentiousness overrides preference alignment, with highly contentious topics showing lower agreement than expected

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Profile Probing for Behavioral Consistency
If LLM agents possess coherent internal states, stated preferences and openness scores should predict conversational agreement outcomes in systematically pairable ways. The framework constructs agents with explicit latent profiles, then pairs agents with known preference gaps to measure whether observed agreement matches expected agreement.

### Mechanism 2: Sycophantic Agreement Amplification
LLMs exhibit systematic sycophancy that amplifies agreement and suppresses disagreement regardless of actual preference divergence. RLHF and instruction-tuning biases models toward agreeableness, causing agents to produce neutral-to-positive responses even when their assigned preferences maximally conflict.

### Mechanism 3: Sentiment-Dependent Coherence Asymmetry
LLM agents treat positive and negative sentiment alignment asymmetrically—shared negative sentiment produces systematically lower agreement than shared positive sentiment. Training data or alignment procedures implicitly penalize negative expression, causing agents to treat shared dislike as less coherent grounds for agreement than shared appreciation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Latent Profile Construction**: Understanding how agents are assigned internal states (preference P, openness O, bias B) is prerequisite to interpreting why behavioral inconsistencies emerge.
  - Quick check: Given an agent with P=1 (strong disagreement with "taxes help society") and O=0 (low openness), what agreement score would you expect when paired with an agent having P=5 on the same topic?

- **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation**: The framework relies on a judge model to score conversational agreement; understanding calibration and potential biases in this evaluation method is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check: Why might using the same model family as both agent and judge introduce systematic scoring bias, and how does the paper address this?

- **Bootstrap Sampling for Non-Parametric Comparison**: Agreement score distributions are not normally distributed; bootstrap sampling enables statistical comparison without parametric assumptions.
  - Quick check: If observed mean agreement is 3.6 and bootstrap-derived expected mean is 1.8 with non-overlapping 95% intervals, what can you conclude about disagreement suppression?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Topic Selection Module -> Agent Generator -> Latent Profile Elicitation -> Pairing Engine -> Conversation Simulator -> Agreement Scorer
- **Critical path:** Topic selection → Agent construction with demographics + bias → Elicit P and O → Pair agents → Generate dialogue → Score final agreement → Bootstrap comparison against expected distributions
- **Design tradeoffs:** Controlled scope vs. generalizability (US demographics only), LLM-as-judge vs. human annotation (scalable but introduces potential bias), bootstrap vs. parametric tests (more robust but requires larger samples)
- **Failure signatures:** High Self-BLEU scores (>0.19) indicate repetitive conversations (4.18% filtered), naturalness scores declining over turns suggests coherence degradation, judge returning -1 indicates conversation termination anomalies
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate Test 2 (Agreement Amplification) on a new model not in the original study
  2. Extend sentiment asymmetry analysis by adding neutral-anchored pairs (3,3) as baseline
  3. Test whether increasing conversation turns (5→10) amplifies or attenuates inconsistency effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Do LLM agents exhibit internal consistency when configured with latent traits other than Openness and Preference, such as Agreeableness or Neuroticism? The authors note their framework could be extended by substituting alternative question sets for different personality traits.

### Open Question 2
Can behavioral models grounded in social theory mitigate the systematic suppression of disagreement and sentiment asymmetry found in current agents? The authors suggest future work should develop stronger behavioral models grounded in social theory.

### Open Question 3
Does the observed lack of behavioral coherence persist across agents representing non-US or non-Western demographic backgrounds? The authors restricted analysis to US agents, implying cultural context is a variable that was excluded.

### Open Question 4
To what extent is the systematic suppression of disagreement an artifact of specific alignment techniques (e.g., RLHF) versus underlying model architecture? While the paper establishes the failure mode exists across models, it does not isolate the specific training dynamic causing disagreement dampening.

## Limitations
- Framework assumes agent-internal scores should predict conversational agreement, but LLMs may operate through different reasoning mechanisms than humans
- Reliance on single judge model introduces potential systematic bias, though cross-model judging partially mitigates this concern
- 5-turn conversation limit may be insufficient to reveal longer-term coherence patterns

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Agents show systematic sycophantic agreement suppression (Test 2 finding) - consistently demonstrated across multiple model families with clear statistical significance
- **Medium confidence:** Sentiment-dependent coherence asymmetry (Test 3 finding) - robust pattern but requires further validation across more topics and judge models
- **Medium confidence:** Overall behavioral incoherence findings - well-supported statistically but interpretation depends on framework assumptions

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-cultural validation:** Replicate the framework using non-US demographics to test whether behavioral incoherence patterns persist across cultural contexts
2. **Extended conversation analysis:** Increase conversation turns from 5 to 10-15 to determine if inconsistency effects amplify, attenuate, or remain stable over longer interactions
3. **Alternative judge models:** Systematically test agreement scoring using multiple judge model families (not just cross-model for self-evaluation) to isolate judge-specific biases from agent-level incoherence
