# CAME-AB: Cross-Modality Attention with Mixture-of-Experts for Antibody Binding Site Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.06465
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06465
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves F1-score of 0.8185 and MCC of 0.7134 on antibody binding site prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

## Executive Summary
CAME-AB introduces a novel multimodal framework that integrates five biologically grounded feature representations—amino acid encodings, BLOSUM matrices, pretrained language model embeddings, structural features, and GCN-based biochemical graphs—to predict antibody binding sites. The key innovation is an adaptive modality fusion module that dynamically weights modalities based on global relevance, input-specific variation, and class-aware semantics. The architecture further incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for feature specialization, supervised contrastive learning to enhance inter-class separability, and stochastic weight averaging for training stability. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines across multiple metrics.

## Method Summary
CAME-AB employs a multimodal architecture that processes five distinct biological feature representations through parallel encoders, then fuses them using an Adaptive Modality Fusion (AMF) module that learns dynamic weights based on global importance, sample-specific variation, and class-aware semantics. The fused representation passes through a Pre-LN Transformer with a Mixture-of-Experts backbone, where a router directs features to specialized expert MLPs. The model is trained with a combination of focal classification loss and supervised contrastive loss, with stochastic weight averaging applied for improved generalization.

## Key Results
- Achieves F1-score of 0.8185 and MCC of 0.7134 on benchmark datasets
- ESMC embeddings are the most critical modality (1.94% F1 drop when removed)
- AMF module improves performance (F1 drops from 0.8185 to 0.8127 when removed)
- MoE backbone enhances recall (0.8250 to 0.8177 when removed)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Triple-Weighted Adaptive Fusion
Dynamic weighting of biological modalities (sequence, structure, graph) captures complementary signals better than static concatenation. The Adaptive Modality Fusion (AMF) module computes a fused representation using three factors: global importance (α_m), sample-specific variation (β_m), and class-aware semantics (γ_m). This allows the model to emphasize ESM embeddings for one input while prioritizing BLOSUM/GCN features for another. Core assumption: distinct biological modalities provide non-redundant signal; a single static weighting scheme is insufficient for diverse antibody sequences. Evidence: Table 2 shows removing AMF drops F1 from 0.8185 to 0.8127.

### Mechanism 2: Expert Specialization via Diversity Regularization
A Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone with diversity constraints forces the model to learn disentangled feature subspaces. A router g directs the transformer output z_i to specific expert MLPs. The diversity loss L_diversity penalizes high cosine similarity between expert outputs, preventing collapse where all experts learn identical mappings. Core assumption: the latent space contains distinct sub-structures (e.g., different physicochemical interaction patterns) that are better modeled by separate experts than a single monolithic network. Evidence: Table 2 shows removing MoE causes a drop in Recall (0.8250 to 0.8177), suggesting experts aid sensitivity.

### Mechanism 3: Contrastive Geometry Shaping
Supervised contrastive loss improves class discrimination by explicitly separating binding site embeddings in the latent space. The projection head maps embeddings z_i to a space where positive pairs (same epitope class) are pulled together and negative pairs are pushed apart. This acts as a regularizer alongside the focal classification loss. Core assumption: standard cross-entropy or focal loss is insufficient to separate the complex, overlapping manifolds of different binding site classes. Evidence: Figure 3 (t-SNE) visualizes clear clustering of classes (e.g., S:RBD vs HA:Stem), attributed to contrastive supervision.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Protein Language Models (PLMs) & ESM**
  - **Why needed here:** The model relies on ESMC embeddings as the primary sequence modality. You must understand that these are not just one-hot vectors but contextual embeddings capturing evolutionary semantics.
  - **Quick check question:** How does ESMC capture "long-range dependencies" that a simple BLOSUM matrix cannot?

- **Concept: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) on Residues**
  - **Why needed here:** One modality constructs a graph where nodes are residues connected by biochemical similarity. You need to know how GCNs propagate information across this neighborhood.
  - **Quick check question:** In Equation 2, what does the adjacency matrix A represent in terms of residue relationships?

- **Concept: Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses SWA to smooth the optimization trajectory.
  - **Quick check question:** How does averaging weights from the tail of training (Equation 15) improve generalization compared to just taking the final epoch's weights?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** One-hot -> BLOSUM -> ESMC -> ESMC-Struct -> GCN -> Projection -> Adaptive Modality Fusion -> Pre-LN Transformer -> MoE Router + Experts -> Classification MLP + Contrastive Projection

- **Critical path:** The critical path flows from ESMC/GCN extraction -> AMF weighting -> MoE Router. If the GCN edge construction (PyBioMed thresholding) fails or returns a disconnected graph, the graph modality collapses to just node features.

- **Design tradeoffs:** SWA vs. AUC: Table 2 reveals a counter-intuitive tradeoff: removing SWA actually increased AUC-ROC (0.9351 to 0.9397) but lowered MCC. This suggests SWA improves robustness (MCC) at the slight cost of raw separability confidence (AUC). Modality Redundancy: Table 1 shows ESMC is critical (-1.94% F1), while GCN adds only marginal gain (+0.38% F1). The computational cost of the GCN branch may outweigh its standalone signal contribution.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Expert Collapse: Check router outputs; if one expert receives >90% of weight, L_diversity is failing.
  - Modality Silencing: Check α_m weights; if one modality is consistently near zero, the model is ignoring that view (possibly due to projection collapse).
  - Class Confusion: High precision but low recall usually indicates the contrastive loss is pushing embeddings too far apart or the focal loss γ is too aggressive.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Modality Ablation (Reconstruction): Retrain removing ESMC features specifically to verify the 1.94% F1 drop reported in Table 1 on your specific hardware.
  2. MoE Router Analysis: Visualize the router distribution g across different epitope classes to verify if specific experts correlate with specific structural features (e.g., does Expert 1 handle S:RBD?).
  3. SWA Schedule Test: Vary the SWA start epoch S to see if the tradeoff between MCC and AUC can be mitigated.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset bias and generalization to novel antibody-antigen pairs remains untested
- Marginal gain from GCN-based graph modality (+0.38% F1) raises computational cost-effectiveness questions
- Adaptive fusion weights may be sensitive to initialization and training dynamics

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core architecture (ESMC + AMF + MoE + contrastive loss) is technically sound and the reported metrics (F1=0.8185, MCC=0.7134) are internally consistent with ablation patterns.
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism claims for AMF and MoE are supported by ablation but lack deeper analysis of why certain modalities or experts dominate for specific epitope types.
- **Low Confidence:** The generalization claim to unseen antibody-antigen pairs is weakly supported, as no out-of-distribution or temporal split validation is reported.

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Dataset Validation: Evaluate CAME-AB on an independent antibody binding site dataset (e.g., from a different structural database) to test generalization beyond the original benchmark.

2. Expert Disentanglement Analysis: Perform a detailed analysis of the MoE router outputs—plot the distribution of expert selections per epitope class and correlate with structural features (e.g., surface accessibility, secondary structure) to validate the claimed specialization.

3. Fusion Weight Interpretability: Visualize the learned α, β, γ weights across a diverse set of antibody sequences to identify if the model consistently prioritizes certain modalities for specific structural contexts (e.g., does it favor ESMC for hypervariable regions?).
