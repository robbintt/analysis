# Saddle-Free Guidance: Improved On-Manifold Sampling without Labels or Additional Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21863
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21863
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 on ImageNet-512 with no additional training

## Executive Summary
Saddle-Free Guidance (SFG) addresses the challenge of improving sample fidelity in score-based generative models without requiring additional training or labeled data. The method exploits the surprising discovery that positive curvature in saddle regions of the log density provides a strong guidance signal. By estimating the maximal positive eigenvalue of the score network Jacobian and steering sampling away from these regions, SFG achieves state-of-the-art performance on unconditional ImageNet-512 generation while maintaining model-agnostic applicability.

## Method Summary
SFG operates at inference time by computing the maximal positive eigenvalue λ₊ and corresponding eigenvector of the score network Jacobian using power iteration. When λ₊ > 0, the method applies a correction to the score estimate that steers sampling away from saddle regions. The approach requires only two forward passes per timestep (one perturbed), uses warm-starting of eigenvector estimates from previous steps for computational efficiency, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Key hyperparameters include perturbation size h=0.1, shift parameter α≥1, and guidance strength w_SFG tuned per task.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation
- When combined with Auto-Guidance, achieves general state-of-the-art FD-DINOv2 scores across benchmarks
- Improves diversity while maintaining prompt adherence and image fidelity when applied to FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5
- Requires no additional training or labeled data, working with off-the-shelf models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Saddle regions of the log density cause poor score estimates that degrade sample quality.
- Evidence: Controlled 16-simplex GMM experiment shows explicit score matching loss is highest in saddle regions and improves least with model scaling (1.3× vs 10× for mode data).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The maximal positive eigenvalue of the score network Jacobian identifies problematic saddle regions.
- Evidence: Power iteration on (∇s_θ(x) + αI) computes λ₊ and v, with the update s_SFG = s_θ + w_SFG · σ · H(λ₊) · (u - αv) steering away from saddles when λ₊ > 0.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Warm-starting power iteration with previous eigenvector estimates makes SFG computationally equivalent to CFG.
- Evidence: Single power iteration step with v initialized from u_{i-1} achieves same computational cost as classifier-free guidance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Score-based models and the score function ∇log p(x)**: SFG operates directly on score estimates and their Jacobians; understanding what scores represent is essential. Quick check: Can you explain why the score function points toward higher-density regions of the data distribution?

- **Power iteration for eigenvalue/eigenvector estimation**: SFG's core computational primitive; you must understand convergence properties and the role of the shift parameter α. Quick check: Why does adding αI to a matrix guarantee power iteration converges to the most positive rather than most negative eigenvalue?

- **Guidance as score correction (CFG paradigm)**: SFG positions itself against CFG and Auto-Guidance; you need to understand the baseline to evaluate tradeoffs. Quick check: In CFG, what does the difference s_θ(x, y) - s_φ(x) represent geometrically?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input x → Forward pass 1 (ε̂ = ε_θ(x)) → Forward pass 2 (ε_θ(x + hσv)) → u = (ε̂ - ε_θ(x + hσv)) / h → λ₊ = u^T v → α = max(α, -λ₊) → ε̂_SFG = ε̂ - H(λ₊) · w_SFG · u → Output ε̂_SFG, v_next, α

- Critical path: The second forward pass (perturbed prediction) is the computational overhead. Finite-difference approximation quality depends on h; too large introduces bias, too small causes numerical instability.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - w_SFG: Higher values improve fidelity (lower FD-DINOv2) but trade off FID; sweep [1, 30] for conditional, [1, 10] for unconditional
  - h (perturbation size): Paper found low sensitivity; chose h=0.1 for slightly better FD-DINOv2
  - α (shift parameter): Must be ≥1 to ensure convergence; paper tests α ∈ {1, 3, 10}
  - Power iteration steps: Fixed at 1 for all experiments

- Failure signatures:
  - If λ₊ is consistently negative, H(λ₊) = 0 and SFG provides no guidance
  - If v becomes degenerate (||v|| → 0), reinitialize randomly
  - If FID degrades sharply while FD-DINOv2 improves, guidance is too strong (reduce w_SFG)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the 2D Gaussian separation problem to visualize how SFG's positive curvature eigenvectors align with classifier gradients
  2. Compare convergence quality when reinitializing v randomly each step vs. carrying over across timesteps
  3. Sweep w_SFG ∈ [1, 10] and α ∈ {1, 3, 10} on EDM2-s-unconditional to reproduce the FID vs. FD-DINOv2 Pareto frontier

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does increasing the number of power iterations for eigenvalue estimation impact SFG's sample fidelity and convergence?
- Basis: Authors state they fixed power iteration count to one and did not study varying this parameter.
- Why unresolved: Computational overhead was avoided, leaving trade-off between curvature estimation accuracy and sampling speed unexplored.
- Evidence: Ablation study measuring FID and FD-DINOv2 on ImageNet-512 while sweeping power iteration count from 1 to 10.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can SFG effectively guide score-based models in domains outside of image generation?
- Basis: Analysis is limited to image generation; other applications would be informative benchmarks.
- Why unresolved: Geometry of log-density in modalities with temporal dependencies may interact differently with curvature guidance.
- Evidence: Applying SFG to audio (AudioCaps) or video (UCF-101) benchmarks and comparing against unguided baselines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does SFG provide consistent benefits for Diffusion Transformers (DiT) in large-scale conditional generation settings?
- Basis: Extensive DiT experiments were excluded due to computational constraints and lack of compatible inference-time unconditional guidance baselines.
- Why unresolved: Analysis was less comprehensive than for U-Nets, leaving interaction between SFG and transformer architectures less verified.
- Evidence: Systematic comparison of SFG on conditional DiT models against U-Net counterparts using identical metrics.

## Limitations
- Theoretical connection between saddle geometry and sampling quality remains implicit rather than rigorously proven
- Second forward pass per timestep remains a practical computational limitation
- Guidance strength shows strong tradeoffs requiring careful per-task tuning

## Confidence
- High confidence: Consistent empirical improvements on ImageNet-512 with clear methodology
- Medium confidence: Mechanism connecting saddle curvature to sampling quality needs broader validation
- Low confidence: Claims about working with "off-the-shelf" models lack implementation details

## Next Checks
1. Run curvature analysis across multiple model scales and architectures to verify systematic underfitting pattern in saddle regions
2. Track eigenvector evolution across sampling steps measuring cosine similarity between consecutive estimates
3. Benchmark SFG's computational overhead on production-scale models measuring actual wall-clock time versus CFG
