# Aircraft Fuel Flow Modelling with Ageing Effects: From Parametric Corrections to Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.15736
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15736
- **Reference count:** 33
- **Primary result:** Classical models like BADA systematically underestimate fuel consumption for older aircraft; neural models with explicit age parameters significantly improve accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating aircraft engine ageing and deterioration effects into fuel flow prediction. Using a dataset of nearly 19,000 Quick Access Recorder flights from nine Airbus A320-214 airframes with ages ranging from 3 to 14 years, the study compares classical parametric models, empirical age-based corrections, and data-driven neural network architectures. Standard baseline models like BADA consistently underestimate fuel consumption for older aircraft, with age-dependent corrections significantly reducing this bias. Neural models that explicitly include age as a feature or inductive bias further improve accuracy, though limited fleet diversity and lack of maintenance data constrain generalizability. Long-term fleet projections reveal that failing to account for ageing can lead to substantial underestimation of future fuel burn, emphasizing the need for robust age-aware corrections in operational and environmental assessments.

## Method Summary
The study employs a feed-forward neural network architecture with five hidden layers (128 units each, ReLU activations, L2 regularization λ=10⁻⁵) to predict aircraft fuel flow. A key innovation is the "inductive bias" approach where age is incorporated multiplicatively as a parametrized function: ŷ = ŷ_base × (1 + a × log(age + 1)). The model is trained using AdamW optimizer with warm-up cosine learning rate schedule over 200 epochs, batch size 4096, and temporal split (2/3 train, 1/3 test). The dataset consists of QAR data from 9 A320-214 airframes (3-14 years old), with features including pressure altitude, TAS, vertical speed, mass, and temperature. Performance is evaluated against baseline BADA models and compared across different age-aware neural architectures.

## Key Results
- Standard BADA models show increasing negative bias (underestimation) in fuel consumption predictions for older aircraft, with bias growing systematically with age.
- Age-based multiplicative corrections significantly reduce prediction errors, with the inductive bias approach showing particular robustness for extrapolation to future fleet ages.
- Neural architectures incorporating age as an explicit structural parameter outperform models treating age as a generic input feature, especially when predicting for aircraft ages outside the training distribution.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Embedding aircraft age as a multiplicative inductive bias improves model robustness and extrapolation compared to treating age as a generic input feature, particularly when training data is sparse. Rather than allowing a neural network to learn an arbitrary relationship between age and fuel flow, the architecture constrains learning by computing a base fuel flow prediction and multiplying it by a parametrized function of age, forcing the model to respect the domain assumption that performance deterioration follows a logarithmic trend.

### Mechanism 2
Classical physics-based models (like BADA) systematically underestimate fuel consumption for older aircraft because they rely on nominal, time-invariant performance coefficients. As engines age, physical degradation increases Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC). Without a time-dependent variable, the model cannot account for this efficiency loss, resulting in a negative bias that grows with aircraft age.

### Mechanism 3
Purely data-driven models (treating age as a standard input) can capture complex interactions but risk overfitting to the specific age distribution of the training fleet. With limited airframes, the model struggles to distinguish between aircraft-specific idiosyncrasies and true ageing effects, leading to erratic behavior when predicting for ages outside the training distribution.

## Foundational Learning

**Inductive Bias in Machine Learning**
*Why needed:* Explains why the multiplicative model generalizes better than the raw feature model despite less flexibility. *Quick check:* If a model is trained on aircraft aged 0–10 years, why might a standard neural network fail to predict fuel flow for a 25-year-old aircraft, while the inductive bias model succeeds?

**Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) & Engine Deterioration**
*Why needed:* The paper attributes fuel flow increases to engine degradation. *Quick check:* Does an increase in SFC imply more or less fuel is required to maintain the same thrust, and how does this relate to the "underestimation" bias found in the BADA model?

**Time-Invariant vs. Time-Variant Systems**
*Why needed:* The core conflict is between static models and dynamic reality. *Quick check:* Why is the "nominal performance" assumption in BADA classified as a time-invariant limitation?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** QAR sensors (Altitude, TAS, Mass, etc.) + Age (Years) -> Preprocessing (Normalization) -> Physics Engine (BADA) / Neural Core (5-layer Dense Network) -> Correction Layer (Coeff(age) = 1 + a * log(age + 1)) -> Output (Fuel Flow)

**Critical path:** Extract operational features and metadata -> Pass operational features through Neural Core to get ŷ_base -> Calculate Coeff(age) using learned parameter a -> Compute final ŷ = ŷ_base * Coeff(age)

**Design tradeoffs:** The "Acropole Age" model is more flexible but oscillates on extrapolation; the "Inductive Bias" model is rigid but robust for future fleet projections. The inductive bias approach requires fewer diverse airframes to learn a general trend.

**Failure signatures:** Negative Bias (Baseline) shows consistent ~5% underestimation; Oscillation (Raw Feature) shows jagged or non-monotonic age-effect curves; Extrapolation Collapse shows unstable predictions for age > 15 years.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Baseline Bias Audit: Run BADA vs. Ground Truth across age bins (3yr, 6yr, 10yr, 14yr) to confirm increasing negative bias
2. Feature vs. Structure Ablation: Train two NNs—one with Age as input vector, one with Age as multiplicative parameter; compare MAE on oldest aircraft
3. Extrapolation Stress Test: Synthetically age test data (e.g., input age = 20) and plot correction coefficient curves to verify monotonic increase

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** How does inclusion of granular maintenance history alter estimated deterioration coefficients compared to models relying solely on years in service? The study lacks maintenance event logs, forcing conflation of time-in-service with cumulative degradation.

**Open Question 2:** Do calibrated age-correction factors derived for A320-214 generalize effectively to different aircraft types or engine variants? The study is restricted to a single aircraft type, requiring validation on broader fleets.

**Open Question 3:** Does performance benefit of explicit inductive bias over standard feature learning persist as training fleet size increases? It's unclear if structural constraints are inherently superior or merely regularization for small datasets.

## Limitations
- Limited fleet diversity (9 airframes) constrains generalizability across different aircraft types and operational patterns
- Absence of detailed maintenance records prevents distinguishing true ageing from maintenance-induced performance variations
- Logarithmic age-correction assumption may not capture all ageing dynamics across diverse operational profiles

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The systematic negative bias in BADA predictions for older aircraft is well-established through direct comparison with QAR data.

**Medium Confidence:** The superiority of inductive bias approaches for extrapolation is demonstrated but may not generalize to fleets with different operational patterns or maintenance regimes.

**Low Confidence:** Long-term fleet projections beyond 20 years should be interpreted cautiously due to extrapolation from limited training distribution (3-14 years).

## Next Checks

1. **Maintenance Data Integration:** Incorporate detailed engine maintenance records to distinguish between ageing effects and maintenance-induced performance variations, potentially revealing non-monotonic deterioration patterns.

2. **Fleet Diversity Testing:** Validate the age-correction models on a larger, more diverse fleet (different aircraft types, operational regions) to assess generalizability beyond the A320-214 dataset.

3. **Cross-Validation Across Time Periods:** Implement k-fold temporal cross-validation on the existing dataset to better estimate model performance uncertainty and assess sensitivity to temporal sampling bias.
