# CARE-Bench: A Benchmark of Diverse Client Simulations Guided by Expert Principles for Evaluating LLMs in Psychological Counseling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09407
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09407
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive benchmark using expert-guided client simulations and psychological scales reveals significant model disparities across client characteristics, with reasoning-enhanced models showing strongest performance but all models struggling with affective empathy and challenging client profiles.

## Executive Summary
CARE-Bench addresses critical limitations in existing LLM counseling benchmarks through expert-guided client simulations and multidimensional evaluation using established psychological scales. Built on over 1,500 real counseling cases, the benchmark evaluates models across therapeutic relationship, empathic understanding, and counseling skills dimensions. Testing of six models including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and specialized counseling models revealed systematic performance disparities across client personality characteristics, with reasoning-enhanced models showing strongest overall performance but all models struggling with affective empathy and challenging clients.

## Method Summary
CARE-Bench employs a two-step pipeline for creating diverse client simulations: expert psychologists define behavioral principles for different client types, which are then decomposed into verifiable questions and used to iteratively revise client responses until compliance is achieved. The benchmark evaluates models using three established psychological scales—WAI (therapeutic relationship), BLRI (empathic understanding), and CCS-R (counseling skills)—with GPT-4o scoring validated against human experts at 0.72 correlation. Client profiles are constructed from real cases, enriched with Big Five personality dimensions, and balanced across topics and demographics.

## Key Results
- DeepSeek-R1 achieved highest overall scores, leading by 0.51 points on BLRI and 0.58 on CCS-R compared to other models
- All models scored lowest on Affective Empathy (BLRI subscale, avg 1.61/6.0) and Change Facilitation (CCS-R subscale, avg 3.43/5.0)
- Performance disparities emerged across client characteristics: models performed worse with low openness, low conscientiousness, low agreeableness, or high neuroticism clients
- Counseling effectiveness was significantly lower for male clients and children under 12 years old

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Expert-Guided Principle Adherence for Realistic Client Simulation
- Claim: Embedding expert-defined behavioral principles into client simulation produces more authentic, diverse, and challenging client personas than profile-only approaches
- Mechanism: Two-step pipeline—Principle-to-Question Rewriting decomposes expert principles into verifiable yes/no questions; Principle-Adherence Check evaluates responses against applicable questions and iteratively revises until compliance
- Core assumption: Psychologists can articulate client behaviors as explicit, verifiable principles; LLMs can faithfully execute and self-correct against these principles
- Evidence anchors: Table 2 shows statistically significant improvements across all metrics when principles are added (Authenticity +0.40, p<0.001); Table 3 demonstrates qualitative differences—principled clients exhibit emotionally volatile responses aligned with high-neuroticism profiles
- Break condition: If expert principles become too numerous or contradictory (>~20 per profile may degrade coherence), or if revision loop fails to converge within reasonable iterations

### Mechanism 2: Multidimensional Psychological Scale Evaluation Surfaces Capability Gaps
- Claim: Using established psychological scales (WAI, BLRI, CCS-R) across therapeutic relationship, empathic understanding, and counseling skills reveals differentiated model strengths and weaknesses invisible to single-metric evaluations
- Mechanism: Each scale targets distinct competencies—WAI measures goal/task/bond dimensions; BLRI captures cognitive vs. affective empathy differentiation; CCS-R assesses probing, reflecting, and change facilitation skills
- Core assumption: LLM-based scoring can approximate expert clinical judgment; scale items retain validity when applied to LLM-client dialogues
- Evidence anchors: "CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales"; Table 4 reveals all models score lowest on Affective Empathy (BLRI subscale, avg 1.61/6.0) and Change Facilitation (CCS-R subscale, avg 3.43/5.0)
- Break condition: If LLM-scorer alignment with human experts drops significantly for specific populations or scale dimensions; scale validity may not transfer to AI counseling contexts

### Mechanism 3: Reasoning-Enhanced Models Outperform in Counseling Through Deeper Inference
- Claim: Models with explicit reasoning capabilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) achieve superior counseling performance by inferring underlying cognitive distortions rather than relying on surface-level emotional responses
- Mechanism: Reasoning models analyze client statements to identify core issues (e.g., cognitive distortions, defense mechanisms) before selecting interventions, enabling proactive technique application rather than reactive soothing
- Core assumption: Explicit chain-of-thought reasoning correlates with better clinical judgment; inference pathway is inspectable and valid
- Evidence anchors: "Analysis of DeepSeek-R1's intermediate reasoning reveals that it infers underlying cognitive distortions and core issues from client statements rather than relying on superficial soothing"; DeepSeek-R1 leads by 0.51 points on BLRI and 0.58 on CCS-R (Table 4)
- Break condition: If reasoning traces become disconnected from actual response quality, or if reasoning overhead introduces latency unacceptable for real-time counseling

## Foundational Learning

- **Big Five Personality Traits in Clinical Contexts**
  - Why needed here: Performance analysis is stratified by Big Five dimensions; models systematically underperform with low openness/agreeableness/conscientiousness and high neuroticism clients
  - Quick check question: Given a client profile showing high neuroticism and low agreeableness, what communication pattern should a counselor expect and adapt to?

- **Therapeutic Alliance (Working Alliance Inventory)**
  - Why needed here: WAI is the primary therapeutic relationship measure; understanding goal agreement, task agreement, and emotional bond helps interpret evaluation results
  - Quick check question: If a model scores high on Emotional Bond but low on Task Agreement, what specific counseling behavior might be missing?

- **Cognitive vs. Affective Empathy Distinction**
  - Why needed here: The critical weakness identified across all models is affective empathy—"feeling what the client feels"—not cognitive understanding
  - Quick check question: A counselor correctly identifies a client's emotion (cognitive) but responds with logically sound yet emotionally flat advice. Which empathy dimension failed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Profile Construction Pipeline -> Principle Collection Interface -> Client Simulation Engine -> Evaluation Framework

- **Critical path:** Profile quality -> Principle specificity -> Simulation adherence -> Scale validity -> Score reliability. Weak principles lead to unchallenging clients; poor scoring alignment invalidates comparisons.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Chinese-only benchmark limits cross-cultural generalization (acknowledged by authors)
  - GPT-4o scoring trades human validation cost for scale; 0.72 consistency is acceptable but imperfect
  - Principle counts (avg 5, max 22) balance specificity vs. coherence

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Clients become overly compliant or self-aware (principle adherence broken)
  - Models score uniformly across personality dimensions (insufficient profile diversity)
  - GPT-4o scores diverge from human experts on specific populations (scorer bias)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run a single client profile through simulation pipeline with and without principles; compare dialogue transcripts for authenticity markers (emotional volatility, resistance patterns)
  2. Evaluate 2-3 models on a 20-profile subset; correlate GPT-4o scores with human expert scores to validate scorer alignment in your context
  3. Stratify results by Big Five dimensions to identify which client types your model handles poorly; analyze 5 lowest-scoring transcripts with a psychologist to diagnose failure modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can LLMs be trained to effectively utilize "confrontation" to address client inconsistencies without compromising therapeutic alliance?
- Basis in paper: Section 4 notes models "perform poorly in Change Facilitation" because they "tend to maintain surface-level harmony rather than actively addressing underlying discrepancies"
- Why unresolved: Standard alignment techniques likely discourage model disagreement, leaving gap in necessary therapeutic challenge skills
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of models fine-tuned on confrontation strategies showing improved CCS-R "Change Facilitation" scores without dropping WAI scores

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific data augmentation or fine-tuning methods are required to mitigate significant performance disparities for male clients and children (ages 0–11)?
- Basis in paper: Section 5 reports "counseling effectiveness was significantly lower for male clients" and "the 0–11 age group scores significantly lower," identifying these as capability biases
- Why unresolved: Authors identify bias (potentially stemming from training data imbalance) but do not propose or test specific mitigation strategy
- What evidence would resolve it: Study demonstrating statistically insignificant performance gaps between these demographics and others on CARE-Bench following targeted model updates

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do identified failure modes with "challenging" clients (e.g., high neuroticism, low agreeableness) generalize across different cultural and linguistic contexts?
- Basis in paper: Ethical Statement concedes benchmark is Chinese-only and findings "may not be directly generalizable to other languages and cultures"
- Why unresolved: Cultural norms heavily influence expression of personality traits and mental health; unclear if model limitations are universal or context-specific
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of CARE-Bench evaluation framework on English or multilingual datasets showing similar performance drops for specific personality profiles

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can LLMs be specifically trained to improve affective empathy, rather than just cognitive understanding?
- Basis in paper: Results section highlights "Affective empathy... is a common weakness across all models," making responses appear "mechanical or cold"
- Why unresolved: Paper distinguishes cognitive empathy (understanding) from affective empathy (feeling), noting latter is currently underdeveloped in LLMs
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of training objective yielding statistically significant increase in "Affective Empathy" subscore of BLRI scale

## Limitations
- Cultural and Linguistic Constraints: Benchmark built exclusively on Chinese counseling cases, limiting generalizability to other cultural contexts
- Scorer Reliability vs. Clinical Validity: GPT-4o scoring correlation established in same cultural context; validity of applying psychological scales to LLM dialogues partially unproven
- Principle Adherence vs. Real-World Complexity: Iterative revision process may create artificially coherent clients that don't fully capture real therapeutic unpredictability

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Benchmark construction methodology (expert-guided principles, multidimensional evaluation using established scales) is technically sound and addresses documented limitations in existing counseling benchmarks
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance disparities across personality dimensions and demographics are likely real but may be partially influenced by cultural-specific counseling approaches embedded in benchmark
- **Low Confidence**: Claim that reasoning-enhanced models inherently produce better counseling through cognitive distortion inference needs further validation across diverse counseling scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Cultural Validation: Test CARE-Bench with counseling models trained on non-Chinese datasets to assess whether performance patterns hold across cultural contexts
2. Scorer Generalization Study: Evaluate GPT-4o scoring consistency on a subset of dialogues from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds to determine scorer bias limits
3. Real-World Practitioner Review: Have practicing counselors review a stratified sample of model responses (high/low performers across different client types) to validate that benchmark performance correlates with clinically meaningful counseling quality
