# WINELL: Wikipedia Never-Ending Updating with LLM Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.03728
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03728
- **Reference count**: 22
- **Primary result**: Agentic framework updates Wikipedia with 15.4% hard and 34.4% soft factual coverage of human edits, outperforming open-source and closed-source baselines.

## Executive Summary
WINELL introduces an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia articles using LLM agents. The system iteratively searches online sources, identifies relevant updates, and generates precise edit suggestions for human review. Trained on Wikipedia's historical human edits, WINELL's fine-grained editing models outperform both open-source instruction-following baselines and closed-source LLMs like GPT-4o in key-information coverage and editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages demonstrates WINELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates, achieving 15.4% hard coverage and 34.4% soft coverage of human edits. Human evaluation shows 68% of suggested edits were accepted without revision, validating the approach's practical utility for automating knowledge base updates.

## Method Summary
WINELL employs a three-stage pipeline: Section Criteria Induction uses GPT-4.1 to induce per-section content inclusion rules; Agentic Update Aggregation uses an INFOGENT-style Navigator-Extractor-Aggregator loop with GPT-4.1-mini and Google Search API to iteratively search, extract, and filter updates; Fine-Grained Editing finetunes Llama-3.1-8B or Qwen2.5-7B on historical edit triplets to produce efficient, neutral edits. The system evaluates coverage via atomic fact decomposition and entailment scoring with GPT-4o, comparing against human edits from 45 high-activity Wikipedia pages.

## Key Results
- WINELL achieves 15.4% hard coverage and 34.4% soft coverage of human edits, outperforming both open-source instruction-following models and closed-source LLMs like GPT-4o.
- The fine-tuned editor achieves 90.7% key facts coverage with only 20.1% commentary coverage, significantly better than raw models and GPT-4o.
- Human evaluation shows 68% of WINELL's suggested edits were accepted without revision.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Section-specific content criteria improve update placement accuracy.
- Mechanism: An LLM analyzes the article's section headings and existing content to induce explicit inclusion criteria per section (e.g., "Early Life" → biographical background; "Professional Career" → milestones). These criteria guide subsequent update aggregation and editing, reducing misplacement.
- Core assumption: Section headings and existing content reliably encode human editorial norms that generalize to future updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] §3.1 describes passing the marked article to an LLM to output section-wise content inclusion criteria.
  - [table] Table 2 shows removing section criteria reduces Section Accuracy from 33.2% to 28.6%.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on section-criteria mechanisms; related work on knowledge editing focuses on model parameters rather than structural guidance.
- Break condition: If article structure is highly unstable or sections have inconsistent editing patterns across time, induced criteria may misguide placement.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Iterative agentic search with feedback increases update coverage compared to single-query retrieval.
- Mechanism: The Navigator-Extractor-Aggregator loop retrieves candidate sources, extracts updates, and evaluates significance. Rejected updates (insignificant or duplicate) trigger query refinement, enabling adaptive exploration of information space.
- Core assumption: The feedback signal from the Aggregator's accept/reject decisions is sufficient to guide productive query refinement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] §3.2 and Figure 3 describe the tri-agent loop with iterative feedback for closing information gaps.
  - [table] Table 2 shows removing agentic search drops hard coverage from 15.4% to 9.5% and soft coverage from 34.4% to 21.5%.
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbors (e.g., INFOGENT) support iterative multi-agent search for information aggregation, though not Wikipedia-specific.
- Break condition: If feedback signals are noisy (e.g., false rejections due to overly strict aggregation), the refinement loop may converge to unproductive queries.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning on historical human edits yields more efficient, neutral edits than zero-shot instruction-following.
- Mechanism: Training on triplets (original paragraph, edited paragraph, source) teaches the model to preserve key facts, minimize token changes, and exclude subjective commentary—mimicking human editorial judgment.
- Core assumption: Historical Wikipedia edits encode consistent, transferable editing preferences that generalize to new entities and time periods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [table] Table 1 shows Qwen2.5-7B-Editor achieves 90.7% key facts coverage with 20.1% commentary coverage, outperforming GPT-4o (91.3%/53.1%) and raw Qwen (95.1%/86.0%).
  - [section] §5.1.2 notes the model learns "an efficient editing strategy" from human edit records.
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbors on knowledge editing (e.g., MemEIC, Model Merging) address parameter updates but do not test historical-edit fine-tuning for KB maintenance.
- Break condition: If training edits contain systematic biases (e.g., over-representation of certain topics), the model may replicate those biases or struggle on underrepresented entity types.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Multi-agent orchestration patterns (Navigator-Extractor-Aggregator)**
  - Why needed here: WINELL decomposes update discovery into specialized agent roles with iterative feedback; understanding role boundaries and communication protocols is essential.
  - Quick check question: Can you diagram what information flows from Aggregator back to Navigator, and what triggers query refinement?

- Concept: **Fine-tuning on structured edit triplets**
  - Why needed here: The editor model learns from (original, updated, source) records rather than generic instruction data; this shifts the optimization objective toward edit efficiency and neutrality.
  - Quick check question: Given an edit triplet, what loss signal would penalize copying subjective commentary while rewarding fact inclusion?

- Concept: **Atomic fact decomposition for coverage evaluation**
  - Why needed here: Automatic evaluation decomposes human edits into atomic facts and measures entailment against agent edits; this handles many-to-many matching.
  - Quick check question: Why is soft coverage (matching facts anywhere) higher than hard coverage (matching within the same section)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. **Section Criteria Inducer** (LLM: GPT-4.1) → produces per-section inclusion rules
  2. **Agentic Update Aggregator** (LLM: GPT-4.1-mini) → Navigator (search), Extractor (parse updates), Aggregator (filter/consolidate)
  3. **Fine-Grained Editor** (Llama-3.1-8B-Editor or Qwen2.5-7B-Editor) → integrates updates into target paragraphs
  4. **Evaluation Layer** → atomic fact decomposition + entailment scoring (GPT-4o)

- Critical path: Section criteria → agentic search (iterative) → extracted updates → fine-grained edit → human review. The agentic loop is the coverage bottleneck.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - GPT-4.1 for criteria induction vs. GPT-4.1-mini for aggregation: accuracy vs. cost/latency.
  - Hard vs. soft coverage: strict section locality (Chard) vs. factual recall regardless of placement (Csoft).
  - Training on historical edits: learns efficiency but may inherit human biases; zero-shot models are more neutral but less efficient.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low Chard with high Csoft: correct facts, wrong sections (section mapping failure).
  - High commentary coverage: model over-copies source text (insufficient filtering training).
  - High token change with low key facts: model makes unnecessary edits (poor efficiency learning).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the oracle baseline (using human-cited URLs directly) to measure upper-bound extraction and section-placement accuracy; compare against WINELL to isolate search vs. editing gaps.
  2. Ablate the Aggregator's feedback loop by forcing single-iteration search; measure coverage drop to quantify iterative refinement value.
  3. Evaluate the fine-tuned editor on held-out entity categories (e.g., politicians vs. sports figures) to identify domain-specific performance gaps and potential training bias.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How can automated systems achieve human-level precision in determining the correct Wikipedia section for integrating new factual updates?
  - **Basis in paper**: The authors explicitly note that "determining not only what to update but also where to integrate it within the existing article" is a key challenge, with the gap between soft coverage (34.4%) and hard coverage (15.4%) demonstrating this difficulty.
  - **Why unresolved**: The oracle baseline, even with perfect source discovery, achieved only 41.4% section accuracy, indicating that section placement is inherently difficult even with ground-truth sources.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Development of methods that close the gap between soft and hard coverage scores, or a systematic study identifying what cues human editors use for section placement decisions.

- **Question**: How can LLM-based editing systems reliably filter Wikipedia-worthy updates from high-volume news coverage for entities like politicians and celebrities?
  - **Basis in paper**: The paper hypothesizes that lower performance on politician and celebrity pages is due to "high volume of online news coverage...making it harder to determine which updates are significant and Wikipedia-worthy," but provides no solution.
  - **Why unresolved**: The notability and significance filtering mechanisms are not explicitly modeled or trained; the system relies on implicit learning from historical edits which may not generalize to high-coverage entities.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: A comparative study showing improved performance on high-coverage entities after implementing explicit notability filtering, or analysis of what distinguishes Wikipedia-worthy from non-worthy updates in high-volume contexts.

- **Question**: How can automated Wikipedia editing systems be extended to handle structured content such as infoboxes and tables?
  - **Basis in paper**: The limitations section states "the current version of WINELL mainly edits paragraphs, and cannot update infoboxes or any tables within the articles."
  - **Why unresolved**: Structured content requires different extraction, validation, and formatting capabilities than free-text paragraphs; prior work on infobox updating is noted but not integrated into this agentic framework.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Extension of WINELL with infobox/table editing capabilities demonstrating comparable coverage metrics on structured content updates.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies heavily on automatic metrics via GPT-4o without extensive human factuality checks or long-term update stability assessment.
- Training data filtering process (retaining ~2,000 out of 20,000 edits) lacks transparency, potentially introducing selection bias.
- Framework's dependence on high-activity Wikipedia pages limits generalizability to less-edited or niche topics.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: WINELL's fine-tuned editor outperforms both open-source instruction-following models and closed-source LLMs in key-fact coverage while minimizing token changes and subjective commentary.
- **Medium confidence**: The iterative agentic search loop meaningfully improves coverage compared to single-query retrieval.
- **Low confidence**: The assumption that historical human edits encode universally transferable editorial norms is not rigorously validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Factuality audit**: Have human annotators independently verify a random sample of WINELL's suggested edits for factual accuracy, not just acceptance rate. Measure precision (accepted edits that are factually correct) and recall (human edits that WINELL should have caught but missed).

2. **Robustness to editorial diversity**: Evaluate WINELL on Wikipedia pages with varied editorial norms (e.g., controversial biographies, rapidly evolving tech topics) to test if induced section criteria and edit efficiency generalize beyond the training distribution.

3. **Long-term update coherence**: Run WINELL on a page over multiple consecutive intervals and check for edit conflicts, contradictions, or redundancy accumulation—ensuring the system maintains consistency rather than just making isolated updates.
