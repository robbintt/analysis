# FINDER: Feature Inference on Noisy Datasets using Eigenspace Residuals

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19917
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19917
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves 0.970 AUC on Alzheimer's disease classification, outperforming SVM (0.910) and LogitBoost (0.790)

## Executive Summary
FINDER addresses binary classification on noisy datasets by incorporating stochastic analysis into feature learning. The method treats empirical data as realizations from an underlying random field, maps them to Hilbert spaces, and uses the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève expansion to decompose features into irreducible components. This enables classification via eigen-decomposition, identifying distinct class regions in the spectrum of associated operators.

On Alzheimer's disease classification from blood plasma proteins, FINDER achieved AUCs up to 0.970 compared to benchmark SVM (0.910) and LogitBoost (0.790), with 2-4× error reduction and 2-3× faster runtime. For deforestation detection using optical and SAR data, FINDER achieved 0.942 overall accuracy with 71 optical days versus 0.935 for state-of-the-art methods requiring 130 days. The method is particularly effective when noise is high, data is limited, or classes overlap.

## Method Summary
FINDER operates by first centering data on one class mean, then estimating the covariance matrix from training samples of that class. The method applies truncated Karhunen-Loève expansion to extract the dominant eigenvectors, then constructs a residual subspace orthogonal to the first class using either MLS (Moving Least Squares) or ACA-S/ACA-L methods. Both classes are projected onto this residual subspace, and an SVM classifier is trained on the projected features. The approach works in both balanced (N_A-1 samples for SVM) and unbalanced regimes (all Class A samples for both covariance estimation and SVM training).

## Key Results
- Achieved 0.970 AUC on CN vs LMCI Alzheimer's classification, outperforming SVM (0.910) and LogitBoost (0.790)
- Reduced deforestation monitoring requirements from 130 to 71 optical days while maintaining 0.942 accuracy
- Demonstrated 2-4× error reduction and 2-3× faster runtime compared to benchmark methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FINDER leverages stochastic analysis to handle noise in classification problems by treating data as realizations of random fields. The Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève expansion decomposes features into orthogonal components, allowing the method to identify and isolate class-specific information in the eigenspace. By focusing on residual subspaces orthogonal to dominant class structures, FINDER can better separate overlapping classes in high-noise environments.

## Foundational Learning
**Karhunen-Loève Expansion**: Decomposes stochastic processes into orthogonal eigenfunctions - needed to break features into irreducible components; quick check: verify eigenvalues decay sufficiently for truncation
**Hilbert Space Mapping**: Projects empirical data into function spaces - needed to apply functional analysis tools; quick check: confirm inner product structure preserves class separability
**Moving Least Squares (MLS)**: Constructs basis functions for residual subspaces - needed when data is too sparse for standard covariance estimation; quick check: ensure basis spans the intended orthogonal complement
**Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA)**: Low-rank matrix approximation technique - needed for efficient covariance matrix inversion in high dimensions; quick check: verify approximation error stays below tolerance
**Eigenspace Residuals**: Uses orthogonal complement of dominant eigenvectors - needed to isolate class-specific information; quick check: confirm residual subspace captures sufficient variance

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Raw Data -> Centering -> Covariance Estimation -> KLE Truncation -> Residual Subspace Construction -> Projection -> SVM Classification
**Critical Path**: The core innovation lies in the residual subspace construction step, where FINDER isolates class-specific information orthogonal to dominant structures
**Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing truncation parameter M_res for accuracy vs computational cost; choosing between MLS and ACA methods based on data sparsity; selecting SVM kernel type
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on clean datasets (expected), sensitivity to M_res parameter selection, degraded accuracy when classes are well-separated in original space
**First Experiments**: 1) Implement ACA-S with M_res sweep (10-150) and plot AUC curves; 2) Compare FINDER against PCA+SVM baseline on same datasets; 3) Test on clean dataset (GCM cancer) to verify predicted performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance degrades on clean datasets where signal-to-noise ratio is high (e.g., GCM cancer data)
- Computational costs increase significantly with larger truncation parameters M_res
- Method requires careful tuning of M_res parameter for optimal performance

## Confidence
- High confidence in AUC and accuracy comparisons for ADNI and deforestation datasets
- Medium confidence in runtime claims due to unspecified hardware and implementation details
- Medium confidence in theoretical framework given mathematical soundness but limited empirical validation across diverse domains

## Next Checks
1. Implement ACA-S with the exact M_res sweep (10-150) and verify the AUC peak occurs at the reported values
2. Run FINDER on a clean dataset (like GCM cancer) to confirm the predicted performance degradation
3. Benchmark against standard dimensionality reduction (PCA + SVM) on the same datasets to isolate the benefit of stochastic feature inference
