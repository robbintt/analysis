# Localization using Angle-of-Arrival Triangulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.16908
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16908
- Reference count: 21
- One-line primary result: Achieves 1.25 m median localization error using distributed smart speakers with no hardware modifications

## Executive Summary
This paper presents GCC+, a system for passive 2D indoor localization of human speakers using commodity smart speakers. The approach estimates Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of speech signals through an enhanced Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) method, then triangulates the speaker's position from multiple devices. The system requires no hardware modifications, prior calibration, or explicit user cooperation, making it practical for real-world deployment. Experimental evaluation in a real home environment demonstrates median AoA estimation error of 2.2 degrees and median localization error of 1.25 meters.

## Method Summary
GCC+ estimates AoA by computing Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) across all microphone pairs in a 6-mic circular array, expanding the feature space from 5 to 36 dimensions, and applying subsample interpolation for precise Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) estimation. The system uses a grid search over 0-360 degrees to find the angle minimizing error between observed TDoAs and theoretical delays based on array geometry. Localization is performed through triangulation using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) to find the intersection of direction vectors from known device coordinates.

## Key Results
- Median AoA estimation error of 2.2 degrees
- Median localization error of 1.25 meters in real-world home environment
- Outperforms baseline methods without requiring hardware modifications or explicit user cooperation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: GCC-PHAT Phase Whitening
Phase whitening in the frequency domain mitigates reverberation effects by normalizing the cross-power spectrum magnitude before inversion. This suppresses dominant low-frequency components and emphasizes phase alignment, effectively "flattening" the signal spectrum to make the delay peak more distinct amidst room reflections. The core assumption is that the line-of-sight signal component retains sufficient energy relative to multipath reflections.

### Mechanism 2: Feature-Space Expansion
Increasing the dimensionality of the delay vector from 5 to 36 dimensions improves angular estimation robustness by over-determining the system. Computing TDoA across all unique pairs (15 pairs) and symmetries provides more data points for the grid search, allowing the algorithm to average out noise and localized errors. The core assumption is that noise in TDoA estimation is distributed such that aggregating more pairwise measurements reduces aggregate error.

### Mechanism 3: Subsample Interpolation
Subsample interpolation recovers precise temporal resolution lost due to hardware sampling rate limits. The 44.1 kHz sampling rate limits spatial resolution to ~7.77 mm, which is too coarse for small-aperture arrays. Quadratic spline interpolation applied to the correlation peak estimates the true peak location between discrete samples, achieving sub-sample precision. The core assumption is that the true correlation function is smooth and behaves quadratically in the immediate vicinity of the discrete peak.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT)**
  - Why needed here: This is the core signal processing block. Without understanding how PHAT whitens the spectrum, one cannot debug why the system fails in specific acoustic environments.
  - Quick check question: If you see multiple peaks of similar height in the correlation output, what does that physically represent in the room?

- **Concept: Geometry of Triangulation (MLE/IRLS)**
  - Why needed here: Converting angles to coordinates is error-prone. Understanding that small angular errors create massive position errors at long distances is critical for setting expectations for system accuracy.
  - Quick check question: Why do two angle lines rarely intersect at a perfect point in a real deployment, necessitating an "estimator" like MLE?

- **Concept: Array Manifold & Steering Vectors**
  - Why needed here: The system relies on knowing the relative position of microphones (hexagonal geometry) to convert time delays into angles.
  - Quick check question: If the microphone array were linear instead of circular, would you still be able to determine the angle uniquely (considering front-back ambiguity)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** 6-mic Circular Array (Hardware) -> Bandpass Filter (300Hz-3.5kHz) -> GCC-PHAT Computation (All 15 pairs) -> Quadratic Interpolator -> 36-dim vector construction -> Grid Search (0-360°) -> Heatmap generation -> Central Server collects AoAs -> Triangulation Solver (MLE/IRLS) -> (x,y) Coordinate

- **Critical path:** The GCC-PHAT -> Interpolation stage. If the time delay estimation is inaccurate (jitter), the subsequent AoA estimation and triangulation will amplify this error non-linearly.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Computation vs. Accuracy: Computing all 15 pairs (and expanding to 36 dimensions) increases CPU load but is required for robustness against noise.
  - Calibration-free vs. Precision: The system relies on "known" device coordinates. Manual entry of these coordinates is a tradeoff; it avoids complex calibration routines but introduces human error in the "anchor" positions.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Ghost" Localization: System reports a position where no user is present (often due to strong multipath reflection from a wall).
  - Ambiguity Flip: System confuses front/back if the array geometry or sampling is compromised (though hexagonal arrays mitigate this).
  - High Variance: Estimated location jumps significantly frame-to-frame; suggests SNR is too low for the interpolation to lock onto a stable peak.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Single Node Validation: Place one speaker at known angles (0, 90, 180, 270) relative to a single device. Verify the AoA heatmap peak aligns with ground truth to within the stated 2.2° median error.
  2. Interpolation Ablation: Run the pipeline with the subsample interpolator disabled. Compare localization error against the full GCC+ system to quantify the marginal gain from sub-sample precision.
  3. Geometric Dilution Test: Place two devices very close together vs. far apart. Measure how the localization error increases as the triangulation angle becomes acute (geometric dilution of precision).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can speaker profiling or source separation techniques be integrated to enable simultaneous localization of multiple active speakers in a single environment?
- Can 3D localization be achieved by geometrically triangulating azimuth estimates from multiple planar arrays positioned at different elevations?
- Can autonomous anchor localization via acoustic ranging or RF-based techniques replace the need for manual coordinate input?
- At what specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels does the GCC+ pipeline fail to converge on accurate Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) estimates?

## Limitations
- The exact construction of the "36-dimensional delay vector" from the 15 unique microphone pairs is not fully specified, preventing precise replication of reported robustness gains.
- The system's performance degrades significantly in highly reflective environments where the direct path signal is weaker than reflections.
- Manual entry of device coordinates is required, and errors in anchor positioning directly propagate to localization errors through triangulation geometry.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** GCC-PHAT as a core signal processing technique, basic triangulation geometry
- **Medium Confidence:** The 2.2° median AoA error claim, 1.25 m localization error
- **Low Confidence:** The specific 36-dimensional feature expansion mechanism and its contribution to robustness

## Next Checks
1. Implement and compare two versions of the system - one using only direct microphone pair delays (R5) versus the full expanded feature space (R36). Quantify the impact on localization accuracy in a controlled environment.
2. Systematically vary the distance between the two smart speakers (e.g., 2m, 4m, 6m) and measure how the 1.25 m median error changes to reveal geometric dilution of precision.
3. Conduct experiments in rooms with varying reverberation times (e.g., empty room vs. furnished room) and compare the AoA error histogram to identify when multipath interference causes systematic bias.
