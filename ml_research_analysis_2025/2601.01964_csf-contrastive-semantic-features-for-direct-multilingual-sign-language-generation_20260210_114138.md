# CSF: Contrastive Semantic Features for Direct Multilingual Sign Language Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01964
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01964
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Achieves 99.03% average slot extraction accuracy across four typologically diverse languages with 0.74MB model size and 3.02ms CPU inference time

## Executive Summary
CSF introduces a language-agnostic semantic representation framework that enables direct translation from any source language to sign language without English mediation. The system extracts nine universal semantic slots using a compact transformer architecture with custom 8,000-token BPE vocabulary. A key innovation is a comprehensive 35-class condition taxonomy organized into eight semantic categories, enabling nuanced representation of conditional expressions. The model achieves 99.03% average slot extraction accuracy across four typologically diverse languages (English, Vietnamese, Japanese, French), with particularly strong performance on condition classification (99.4% accuracy).

## Method Summary
CSF extracts nine semantic slots (event, intent, time, condition, agent, object, location, purpose, modifier) from multilingual input using a compact transformer architecture. The system uses a custom 8,000-token BPE vocabulary optimized for the four target languages and employs slot-specific classification heads for semantic extraction. Extracted slots are converted to GLOSS format following ASL grammar conventions with topic-comment ordering. The complete system requires only 0.74 MB and performs inference in 3.02ms on CPU, enabling real-time browser-based deployment.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.03% average slot extraction accuracy across English, Vietnamese, Japanese, and French
- 99.4% accuracy on condition classification despite 35-class taxonomy complexity
- 0.74 MB total system size enabling real-time browser deployment at 331 inferences per second
- 3.02ms CPU inference time with custom 8,000-token BPE vocabulary

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fixed semantic slot classification over multilingual input achieves language-agnostic meaning extraction.
- Mechanism: The model maps surface text from any source language to nine predefined semantic slots (event, agent, condition, etc.) with fixed vocabulary values. By constraining output to 73 total classes across slots, the model learns cross-lingual correspondences without requiring aligned translation pairs. The shared encoder backbone with slot-specific classification heads allows semantic specialization while maintaining language-independence.
- Core assumption: Semantic primitives (agent-action-location-condition) are truly universal across typologically diverse languages, and conversational meaning can be adequately captured by the 73-class output space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "achieves 99.03% average slot extraction accuracy across four typologically diverse languages: English, Vietnamese, Japanese, and French"
  - [section 5.1] Table 6 shows per-slot accuracy ranging from 97.8% (event) to 99.7% (purpose), with condition achieving 99.4% despite 35 classes
  - [corpus] SONAR-SLT (arxiv 2510.19398) similarly uses language-agnostic sentence embeddings for multilingual SLT, suggesting cross-lingual semantic representations are an active research direction
- Break condition: If input utterances contain meanings outside the 73-class schema (e.g., novel events, complex multi-clause structures), the model cannot represent them without schema extension and retraining.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Compact transformer trained from scratch on domain-specific multilingual corpus achieves comparable semantic extraction at ~700× size reduction versus pretrained multilingual encoders.
- Mechanism: Rather than distilling large models (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa exceed 500MB), CSF trains a 1.5M parameter transformer directly on a carefully constructed multilingual corpus with custom 8,000-token BPE vocabulary optimized for the four target languages. The constrained task (73-class classification vs. open generation) reduces representational requirements.
- Core assumption: The semantic slot extraction task is sufficiently constrained that general-purpose pretrained knowledge is unnecessary; task-specific training data provides sufficient signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "CSF takes a different approach: rather than distilling large models, we train a compact architecture from scratch... achieving comparable semantic extraction at 0.74 MB—a reduction of approximately 700×"
  - [section 6.1] "achieving 99%+ accuracy with only 18,885 training samples (approximately 4,700 per language)... significantly more efficient than typical slot-filling systems, which require 50,000–100,000 samples"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison available for from-scratch vs. distilled approaches in sign language generation; neighboring papers use pretrained backbones
- Break condition: If deployed on languages or domains significantly different from training distribution, the from-scratch model may underperform versus pretrained multilingual encoders with broader pretraining coverage.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ASL-compatible topic-comment ordering in GLOSS conversion preserves semantic coherence across source languages.
- Mechanism: Extracted slots are reordered following ASL grammar: MODIFIER → TIME → CONDITION → AGENT → LOCATION → OBJECT → EVENT → PURPOSE. Default values (NONE, ME for agent) are omitted. This fixed ordering ensures consistent GLOSS output regardless of source language word order (SVO for English/French, SOV for Japanese).
- Core assumption: A single GLOSS ordering convention sufficiently approximates ASL grammar for practical generation; sign language variation across regions (ASL, BSL, Auslan) can be handled by downstream adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.5] "ASL uses a topic-comment structure where temporal and conditional markers precede the main predicate"
  - [section 3.5] Example: "If it rains tomorrow, I stay home" → "TOMORROW IF_RAIN HOME STAY"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; neighboring papers focus on sign-to-text translation rather than text-to-GLOSS generation pipelines
- Break condition: If target sign language has fundamentally different grammatical structure from ASL's topic-comment pattern, the fixed GLOSS ordering will produce unnatural sign sequences.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) vs. Slot Filling
  - Why needed here: CSF differs from traditional SRL by classifying entire utterances into fixed categories rather than labeling text spans. Understanding this distinction clarifies why CSF achieves high accuracy with constrained output space.
  - Quick check question: Given "I go to school tomorrow," would SRL label "I" as AGENT span, while CSF directly classifies agent=ME from the whole utterance?

- Concept: Topic-Comment Structure in Sign Languages
  - Why needed here: The GLOSS conversion module relies on ASL's topic-comment grammar where conditions and time establish context before the main action. Misunderstanding this produces syntactically incorrect sign output.
  - Quick check question: In ASL, would "I STAY HOME TOMORROW IF_RAIN" or "TOMORROW IF_RAIN HOME STAY" follow proper topic-comment ordering?

- Concept: BPE Tokenization for Multilingual Coverage
  - Why needed here: The custom 8,000-token vocabulary must efficiently cover Vietnamese diacritics, Japanese kana, French accents, and English subwords. Standard tokenizers (e.g., XLM-R's 250K vocabulary) are too large for browser deployment.
  - Quick check question: Why might a BPE tokenizer trained on English alone fail on Vietnamese "Nếu mưa thì tôi ở nhà"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Text → Custom BPE Tokenizer (8K vocab, 321KB) → Transformer Encoder (4 layers, 256 dim) → 9 Classification Heads → Slot Values → GLOSS Converter → Output

- Critical path:
  1. Tokenizer must correctly handle all four languages' character sets
  2. Encoder [CLS] representation must capture cross-lingual semantic content
  3. All nine classification heads must predict correctly for coherent GLOSS output
  4. GLOSS converter must apply correct ASL ordering and omit defaults

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed vocabulary (73 classes) enables high accuracy and fast inference but cannot represent novel events/locations without retraining
  - From-scratch training reduces size 700× but may not transfer to languages outside training distribution
  - Single-event extraction simplifies architecture but requires sentence decomposition for complex multi-clause input

- Failure signatures:
  - Low accuracy on event/location slots (97.8-97.9%) indicates semantic ambiguity at category boundaries
  - Confusion between IF_TIRED and IF_SICK when context is ambiguous (section 6.2)
  - Novel conditions/events map to incorrect classes or NONE without warning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate slot extraction accuracy on the released 18,885-sample dataset; verify 99%+ average matches paper claims.
  2. Test inference latency on target deployment hardware (browser/CPU); confirm <5ms per inference for real-time applications.
  3. Evaluate on out-of-distribution input: informal text, code-switched utterances, or languages not in training set to characterize generalization boundaries.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The 73-class semantic schema constrains representational flexibility and cannot express meanings outside predefined categories without schema extension and retraining
- The fixed ASL topic-comment ordering may not generalize to other sign languages with different grammatical structures
- The from-scratch training approach, while efficient, lacks the broad linguistic coverage of pretrained multilingual encoders, potentially limiting transfer to unseen languages or domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence (90-100%)**: The slot extraction accuracy claims (99.03% average, 99.4% on condition classification) are well-supported by the experimental results section and consistent with the constrained nature of the 73-class classification task. The model size (0.74MB) and inference speed (3.02ms on CPU) claims are directly verifiable from the system architecture specifications.

**Medium Confidence (70-89%)**: The claim of language-agnostic semantic extraction relies on the assumption that semantic primitives are truly universal across typologically diverse languages. While the four languages tested span different families (Indo-European, Austroasiatic, Japonic), broader typological diversity would strengthen this claim. The effectiveness of bypassing English as intermediate representation is logically sound but lacks comparative evaluation against English-mediated baselines.

**Low Confidence (Below 70%)**: The generalization to sign languages beyond ASL is speculative, as the paper focuses exclusively on ASL GLOSS conversion without testing on other sign languages. The real-world effectiveness for the 95% of deaf individuals in non-English-speaking regions is an extrapolation that would require field deployment studies to verify.

## Next Checks

1. **Schema Coverage Test**: Systematically evaluate CSF on input sentences containing events, conditions, and locations not represented in the 73-class schema. Measure what percentage of diverse conversational utterances can be meaningfully represented without schema extension, and assess the degradation in output quality when forced to map to nearest available classes.

2. **Cross-Sign-Language Generalization**: Deploy CSF to generate GLOSS for non-ASL sign languages (e.g., BSL, DGS, JSL) and evaluate with native signers whether the ASL-derived topic-comment ordering produces natural sign sequences. Compare against sign languages with different grammatical structures to identify systematic ordering failures.

3. **Real-World Performance Benchmark**: Deploy the browser-based system with actual deaf users in target non-English-speaking regions. Measure practical metrics beyond accuracy: latency under varying network conditions, ease of integration with existing sign language tools, and qualitative assessment of generated sign sequences for communicative effectiveness in everyday conversations.
