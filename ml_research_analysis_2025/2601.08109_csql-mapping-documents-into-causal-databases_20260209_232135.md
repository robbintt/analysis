# CSQL: Mapping Documents into Causal Databases

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08109
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08109
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: CSQL converts unstructured text collections into SQL-queryable causal databases, demonstrated by compiling 265,656 causal claim instances from economics papers

## Executive Summary
CSQL is a system that automatically transforms collections of unstructured text documents into SQL-queryable causal databases (CDBs), enabling causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. The system builds on DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse, and extends it by compiling these causal artifacts into an SQL-queryable database. CSQL supports causal queries such as influence ranking, hub detection, and multi-step causal paths, and can ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale.

The system was demonstrated by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers. This database enables corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in SQL, providing a principled algebra of queries for causal analysis across many domains. The approach represents a significant advancement in moving from document retrieval to causal reasoning at scale.

## Method Summary
CSQL builds on DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse analysis. The system extends this foundation by compiling these causal artifacts into an SQL-queryable database structure. This compilation process transforms the rich causal representations into a relational format that supports SQL-based querying while preserving causal relationships and enabling complex causal queries.

The system ingests RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora and processes them into a structured database format. This enables causal queries such as influence ranking (identifying which entities have the most causal impact), hub detection (finding central causal nodes), and multi-step causal path analysis (tracing causal chains through the corpus). The compilation process maintains the integrity of causal relationships while making them accessible through standard SQL interfaces.

## Key Results
- Successfully compiled the TCC dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers
- Enabled corpus-level causal queries including influence ranking, hub detection, and multi-step causal path analysis
- Demonstrated SQL-based longitudinal causal analysis capabilities across large document collections

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CSQL works by first extracting causal relationships from unstructured text using DEMOCRITUS, which identifies causal discourse patterns and constructs local causal models. These local models are then compiled into a unified SQL database structure that preserves causal relationships while enabling efficient querying. The compilation process involves translating causal graphs and relationships into relational tables with appropriate foreign key constraints and indexing strategies.

The system leverages the structured nature of causal relationships - which naturally map to entities, relationships, and attributes - making them amenable to relational database representation. SQL's expressive power allows complex causal queries to be formulated as standard database queries, while the underlying causal structure ensures results maintain their causal interpretation. This approach bridges the gap between unstructured text analysis and structured causal reasoning.

## Foundational Learning

**Causal Discourse Analysis**: The identification of causal language patterns and relationships in text. Needed to extract meaningful causal claims from unstructured documents. Quick check: Verify that extracted causal claims align with human-annotated ground truth.

**Local Causal Models**: Individual causal graphs derived from single documents or document segments. Needed to represent document-level causal understanding before aggregation. Quick check: Ensure model consistency across related documents.

**Causal Database Schema Design**: The relational structure for storing causal relationships, entities, and attributes. Needed to enable SQL querying while preserving causal semantics. Quick check: Validate that causal queries return expected results on test datasets.

**SQL-Based Causal Querying**: Expressing causal queries using SQL syntax and operators. Needed to leverage existing database infrastructure and query tools. Quick check: Benchmark query performance against domain-specific causal query languages.

**Longitudinal Causal Analysis**: Tracking causal relationships and their evolution across time or document collections. Needed to support temporal causal reasoning. Quick check: Verify temporal ordering and causal propagation in time-series datasets.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: DEMOCRITUS (causal extraction) -> Causal Model Compiler (database schema generation) -> SQL Database (storage) -> Query Interface (causal analysis)

**Critical Path**: Document Ingestion → Causal Extraction → Model Compilation → Database Population → Query Execution

**Design Tradeoffs**: Relational database structure enables SQL querying but may limit expression of complex causal reasoning patterns. SQL interface provides familiarity but may require specialized knowledge for complex causal queries. Compilation process enables scalability but may introduce latency and storage overhead.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor causal extraction quality propagates to database queries. Complex multi-step causal paths may be difficult to express in SQL. Database performance degrades with scale. Query results may be incomplete if causal relationships span document boundaries.

**First Experiments**:
1. Load a small test corpus (100 documents) and verify causal extraction accuracy using human annotators
2. Execute basic causal queries (influence ranking, hub detection) on the test database and validate results
3. Test multi-step causal path queries and measure query execution times

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- The system's accuracy depends heavily on the quality of causal extraction from unstructured text, which requires independent validation across diverse domains
- SQL interface may not fully capture the complexity of causal reasoning, particularly for nuanced temporal relationships and multi-step causal paths
- Scalability claims lack systematic evaluation of query performance as database size increases or under concurrent access patterns

## Confidence

**High**: Technical feasibility of compiling local causal models into SQL databases; demonstration of basic causal queries on TCC dataset
**Medium**: Claims about handling arbitrary document collections; support for complex longitudinal causal analyses
**Low**: Scalability assertions beyond demonstrated dataset; accuracy of causal extractions across diverse domains

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic accuracy evaluation of causal extractions from CSQL on a diverse set of document types (news articles, social media posts, technical documentation) using human annotators to verify causal relationships
2. Perform benchmark testing of query performance and response times with databases scaled to 10x and 100x the TCC dataset size, including stress testing under concurrent query loads
3. Design and execute case studies testing the system's ability to discover novel causal insights in longitudinal datasets, comparing results against established causal inference methods in the respective domains
