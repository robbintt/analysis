# (GG) MoE vs. MLP on Tabular Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.03608
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03608
- Authors: Andrei Chernov
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: MoE models achieve higher average performance than MLPs on tabular data while using 10x fewer parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates whether mixture-of-experts (MoE) models can outperform multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) on tabular data. The authors introduce GG MoE, which uses a Gumbel-Softmax gating function to regularize expert selection. Experiments on 38 datasets show that GG MoE achieves the highest average performance, especially when combined with piecewise-linear embeddings. GG MoE and MoE models use significantly fewer parameters than MLPs (often 10x fewer) while maintaining comparable accuracy. Monte Carlo sampling with 10 samples is sufficient for reliable inference. GG MoE also trains faster than MLP models on large datasets. The results suggest MoE architectures are promising alternatives for efficient, high-performance tabular deep learning.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce GG MoE, a mixture-of-experts architecture for tabular data that uses a Gumbel-Softmax gating function to regularize expert selection. The model combines this gating mechanism with piecewise-linear embeddings to improve performance. The evaluation is conducted across 38 different tabular datasets, comparing GG MoE against standard MLPs and other MoE variants. The study systematically examines parameter efficiency, inference reliability through Monte Carlo sampling, and training speed across different dataset sizes.

## Key Results
- GG MoE achieves the highest average performance across 38 tabular datasets
- MoE models use significantly fewer parameters than MLPs (often 10x fewer) while maintaining comparable accuracy
- Monte Carlo sampling with 10 samples is sufficient for reliable inference
- GG MoE trains faster than MLP models on large datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Gumbel-Softmax gating function in GG MoE provides a differentiable approximation to the discrete selection of experts, allowing for end-to-end training while maintaining the benefits of expert specialization. The gating mechanism regularizes expert selection, preventing over-reliance on a single expert and promoting diverse feature representation. When combined with piecewise-linear embeddings, the model can better capture non-linear relationships in tabular features. The sparse activation pattern of MoE models naturally leads to parameter efficiency, as only a subset of experts is activated for each input, reducing computational cost while maintaining representational power.

## Foundational Learning
- Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): A neural network architecture where multiple expert networks specialize in different regions of the input space, with a gating network routing inputs to appropriate experts. Needed to understand the core architecture being evaluated. Quick check: Can you explain how the gating network decides which experts to activate?
- Gumbel-Softmax: A continuous relaxation of the categorical distribution that allows gradient-based optimization of discrete latent variables. Needed to understand how GG MoE achieves differentiable expert selection. Quick check: What's the difference between Gumbel-Softmax and standard softmax?
- Tabular Data Embeddings: Techniques for converting categorical and continuous features into vector representations suitable for deep learning. Needed to understand how features are processed before expert networks. Quick check: How do piecewise-linear embeddings differ from standard embedding approaches?
- Monte Carlo Sampling: A statistical technique for estimating expectations by averaging over random samples. Needed to understand the inference methodology used to evaluate uncertainty in MoE predictions. Quick check: Why would Monte Carlo sampling be particularly useful for MoE models?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Features -> Piecewise-Linear Embeddings -> Gating Network (Gumbel-Softmax) -> Expert Networks -> Weighted Sum -> Output

Critical Path: The most important components are the gating network with Gumbel-Softmax, the expert networks, and the embedding layer. The gating mechanism determines which experts process each input, making it critical for both performance and efficiency.

Design Tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between model capacity and computational efficiency. More experts increase capacity but also parameter count and inference time. The Gumbel-Softmax temperature parameter balances exploration of expert selection versus exploitation of learned patterns.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance may indicate that the gating network is not learning effective routing, experts are not sufficiently diverse, or the embedding layer is not capturing feature relationships. Slow convergence could suggest suboptimal Gumbel-Softmax temperature or insufficient training data.

First Experiments:
1. Test gating network activation patterns to verify diverse expert selection
2. Compare performance with different numbers of experts to find optimal capacity
3. Evaluate the impact of Gumbel-Softmax temperature on both training stability and final performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The generalization of GG MoE's advantages beyond the 38 tested tabular datasets is uncertain, particularly for highly sparse or categorical-heavy data
- The paper does not thoroughly analyze whether gains hold when scaling to datasets with millions of rows or complex feature interactions
- The faster training time claim is based on large datasets but lacks comparison with optimized MLP implementations

## Confidence

High confidence: MoE models use fewer parameters than MLPs while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Medium confidence: GG MoE's highest average performance claim across 38 datasets.

Low confidence: Generalizability to unseen tabular data distributions and larger-scale problems.

## Next Checks

1. Test GG MoE on additional real-world tabular datasets with varying sparsity and categorical feature ratios to assess robustness.

2. Benchmark training speed against optimized MLP implementations and other state-of-the-art tabular models on datasets with millions of rows.

3. Investigate the impact of Monte Carlo sample size on inference accuracy across datasets with different noise levels and class imbalances.
