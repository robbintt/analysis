## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06601

- Key outcome: Duality operations generate new rhetorical modes; MRB quantifies expressive growth; hierarchical mapping reduces cognitive entropy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces duality-based mode operations and a pyramid multilayer mapping framework to systematically extend and manage rhetorical modes. Mode operations—including split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction, and orthogonal dualities—generate new modes such as generalization, combination, and summarization from a base set of 14 modes. Combinatorial analysis shows that expressive capacity grows exponentially: adding one mode approximately doubles possible configurations, with each mode contributing one Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB). The pyramid multilayer mapping (rhetorical→cognitive→epistemic) reduces cognitive entropy by hierarchically constraining choices, enabling tractable discourse design. Entropy analysis shows hierarchical selection markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared to flat selection. These contributions provide a measurable, scalable framework linking linguistic form to cognitive function and epistemic purpose, supporting applications in pedagogy, academic writing, and AI discourse modeling.

## Method Summary
The paper develops duality-based mode operations to extend canonical rhetorical modes through systematic transformations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction, orthogonal). These operations generate new modes by exploiting structural symmetries and logical reversibility of base modes. Combinatorial analysis quantifies expressive capacity using K_NRC(K)=2^K-1 total combinations and defines Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) as dK_RC/dK=1 bit per mode. Pyramid multilayer mapping organizes rhetorical modes through hierarchical layers: rhetorical→cognitive→epistemic, reducing choice uncertainty via bounded branching factors. Shannon entropy calculations demonstrate that hierarchical selection reduces cognitive load compared to flat selection across all modes.

## Key Results
- Each additional rhetorical mode contributes exactly one Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) to expressive capacity
- Hierarchical rhetorical→cognitive→epistemic mapping reduces cognitive entropy from ~3.21 bits (flat) to ~1.81+1.81 bits (layered)
- Duality operations generate coherent new modes including generalization (from forward-backward on Exemplification) and combination (from split on Classification-Division)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Duality-Based Mode Generation
- Claim: Applying duality operations to canonical rhetorical modes generates new, coherent modes such as generalization and combination
- Mechanism: Four duality operations transform base modes through logical reversibility and structural symmetry—for example, forward-backward on Exemplification yields Generalization; split on Classification-Division yields atomic Classification and Division
- Core assumption: Modes have formal properties (shape, size, orientation, extension, edges) making them amenable to systematic operations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "duality-based mode operations...introducing generated modes like combination and generalization"
  - [Section 2.1.2-2.1.5] Defines each operation with formal notation and examples (Figures 3-5)
  - [corpus] Weak direct validation; related work on rhetorical annotation exists (INCEpTION paper) but does not test duality operations specifically
- Break condition: Generated modes may lack linguistic stability or cognitive coherence if applied without constraints

### Mechanism 2: Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) Quantifies Expressive Growth
- Claim: Each additional rhetorical mode contributes approximately one bit of combinatorial expressive capacity
- Mechanism: Total non-empty combinations NRC = 2^K − 1; taking log₂ yields K_RC ≈ K bits, so derivative MRB = dK_RC/dK = 1 bit per mode—adding one mode approximately doubles configuration space
- Core assumption: All mode subsets are equally probable for entropy calculation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "each mode contributing one Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB)"
  - [Section 2.2.1] Full derivation with binomial coefficients and log-scale conversion
  - [corpus] No corpus validation; this is a theoretical measure not empirically tested
- Break condition: MRB = 1 depends on uniform probability assumption; real texts may favor subsets, reducing effective bits

### Mechanism 3: Pyramid Multilayer Mapping Reduces Cognitive Entropy
- Claim: Hierarchical selection through rhetorical→cognitive→epistemic layers reduces choice uncertainty compared to flat selection across all modes
- Mechanism: Shannon entropy for flat selection across K modes grows with log₂K; hierarchical selection across smaller subsets per layer yields lower combined entropy (e.g., K=20 flat ≈ 3.21 bits vs. layered selections of 4 each ≈ 1.81 + 1.81 bits cumulatively constrained)
- Core assumption: Layer mappings partition choices into tractable subsets with bounded branching factors
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection"
  - [Section 3.1] Entropy formulas and numerical examples (K=2 to K=100)
  - [corpus] Related work on LLM persuasiveness examines rhetorical features but does not test hierarchical entropy reduction
- Break condition: If layer mappings are poorly designed (high branching, ambiguous assignments), entropy reduction fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Shannon entropy (H = −Σpᵢ log₂ pᵢ)**
  - Why needed here: Quantifies choice uncertainty in rhetorical selection; underpins entropy reduction claim
  - Quick check question: For K=8 equally likely modes, what is H in bits? (Answer: log₂8 = 3 bits)

- Concept: **Binomial coefficient (K choose k)**
  - Why needed here: Counts how many distinct mode combinations exist at each subset size; basis for NRC and MRB
  - Quick check question: How many 2-mode combinations from 14 base modes? (Answer: 14!/(2!·12!) = 91)

- Concept: **Hierarchical vs. flat decision structures**
  - Why needed here: Explains why layered mapping reduces cognitive load compared to single-layer selection
  - Quick check question: If flat selection has 32 options, and a 2-layer hierarchy splits into 4 groups of 8, which has lower decision entropy? (Answer: Flat = 5 bits; layered = 2 + 3 = 5 bits total, but sequential decisions may reduce perceived complexity)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - R-layer: 14 base rhetorical modes (Table 1) + generated modes (Tables 2, 4)
  - C-layer: 14 cognitive functions (Table 5) mapping to typical R-modes
  - E-layer: 8 epistemic purposes (Table 6) mapping to C-functions
  - Mode operators: O_split, O_unite, O_FB (forward-backward), O_expand, O_reduce, O_orthogonal

- Critical path:
  1. Start with base R-modes (K₀ = 14)
  2. Apply duality operations to generate extended modes
  3. Map R-modes to C-functions (Table 5)
  4. Map C-functions to E-purposes (Table 6)
  5. Use entropy analysis to validate complexity reduction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More modes → higher expressive capacity (exponential) but higher entropy
  - More layers → better organization but increased mapping complexity
  - Operator calculus (Section 2.1.6) proposed but not yet formalized for computational use

- Failure signatures:
  - Generated modes lack cognitive coherence (no C-layer mapping)
  - MRB deviates from 1 due to non-uniform usage patterns
  - Layer mappings create ambiguous or many-to-many assignments
  - Entropy reduction claim invalidated if hierarchical branching is too high

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement O_split and O_unite on the 7 diatomic modes in Table 1; verify atomic outputs match Table 2
  2. Calculate NRC for K=14 vs. K=20; confirm ratio matches 2^(20−14) ≈ 64× growth per Section 2.3
  3. Build a simple R→C→E mapping for one lesson (e.g., "Nature of Memory" in Figure 8); compute flat vs. hierarchical entropy and compare

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What formal criteria and validation procedures can determine whether a generated mode qualifies as a valid, linguistically stable rhetorical mode?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "there lacks a formal way to evaluate whether a generated rhetorical mode can be used as a rhetorical mode."
- Why unresolved: The duality operations can produce combinatorially valid modes, but the paper offers no empirical or theoretical threshold for rhetorical legitimacy
- What evidence would resolve it: A rubric or validation study correlating generated modes with discourse corpus frequency, cognitive processing load, or pedagogical utility

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the schematic operator calculus for mode generation be formalized in symbolic or computational terms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 2.1.6 proposes developing "operator calculus" with "symbolic operators that are programmable for computer aided searching," but presents operations only schematically
- Why unresolved: The four dualities lack algebraic specification (e.g., closure properties, composition rules, identity elements)
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal algebra defining operators, their compositions, and proofs of properties; or a computational implementation demonstrating systematic mode discovery

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the rhetorical→cognitive→epistemic mappings vary across disciplines, genres, and languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes mappings "could vary across disciplines and languages, requiring further validation"
- Why unresolved: The paper provides one pedagogical example (Table 5–6, Figure 8–9) without cross-domain or cross-linguistic comparison
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies mapping R→C→E structures in, e.g., STEM articles vs. humanities essays, or English vs. Chinese academic writing, with entropy analyses

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can AI systems trained on layered rhetorical reasoning structures outperform token-level models in discourse generation tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The abstract envisions "a pathway for future AI systems to operate not only on language tokens but on layered rhetorical reasoning structures," but no implementation or evaluation is provided
- Why unresolved: The theoretical framework is not translated into an architecture or tested against baselines
- What evidence would resolve it: An AI model implementing R→C→E constraints, evaluated on coherence, epistemic alignment, or pedagogical effectiveness metrics versus standard LLMs

## Limitations

- No empirical corpus validation for duality-generated modes or MRB claims; all metrics are theoretical
- Layer mapping tables incomplete—only partial examples provided for mapping 14 modes to 14 cognitive functions to 8 epistemic purposes
- Generated modes lack linguistic validation criteria; theoretical coherence does not guarantee rhetorical utility

## Confidence

- **High**: Combinatorial growth formulas (K_NRC = 2^K − 1) and MRB derivation (MRB = 1 bit/mode)
- **Medium**: Entropy reduction calculations for hierarchical selection; depends on assumed mapping cardinalities
- **Low**: Rhetorical coherence of generated modes; no validation against existing rhetorical frameworks or linguistic corpora

## Next Checks

1. Implement duality operations (split, forward-backward) on base modes; verify generated modes match Tables 2-4 and assess linguistic coherence
2. Calculate flat vs. hierarchical entropy for K=20 modes partitioned into layers of size 4; confirm quantitative difference (3.21 vs. 3.62 bits)
3. Cross-validate generated modes against existing rhetorical mode taxonomies (e.g., Warriner, Corbett) to assess linguistic legitimacy
