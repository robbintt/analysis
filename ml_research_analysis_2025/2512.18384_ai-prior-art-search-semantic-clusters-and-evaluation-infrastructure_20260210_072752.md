# AI Prior Art Search: Semantic Clusters and Evaluation Infrastructure

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18384
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18384
- Authors: Boris Genin; Alexander Gorbunov; Dmitry Zolkin; Igor Nekrasov
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: A dataset generator and evaluation infrastructure for AI-based prior art search, built on semantic clusters from examiner citations, enabling scalable ML training and family-level quality assessment.

## Executive Summary
The authors tackle the automation of prior art search in patent examination by introducing semantic clusters—patent groups representing the state of the art for each application. They build a scalable infrastructure using examiner citations as ground truth and develop custom family-level evaluation metrics. Their approach addresses the limitations of traditional IR metrics and provides a foundation for training and benchmarking AI search systems in the patent domain.

## Method Summary
The method defines semantic clusters as the union of a base patent’s family and the families of documents cited by patent examiners. Using expert citations (INID 56 field) and patent family data from DocDB, the authors generate clusters for US and Russian patents, stored in PostgreSQL. A configurable dataset generator outputs JSON datasets for ML training. Evaluation uses custom metrics (S@K, H@K, MPF@K, MRF@K) that treat patent families, not individual documents, as the relevance unit, enabling more accurate assessment of prior art retrieval systems.

## Key Results
- Dataset generator produces 14.4M semantic clusters from US patents and 1M from Russian patents
- Custom family-level metrics (S@K, H@K, MPF@K, MRF@K) better capture the institutional goal of finding relevant inventions
- Infrastructure supports scalable ML training and objective evaluation of AI prior art search systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Expert citations embedded in patent examination records can function as ground-truth labels for training prior art search systems.
- Mechanism: Patent examiners identify relevant prior art during examination and record these in search reports and the INID (56) field. These citations, when extracted and linked to their patent families via DocDB, form labeled training examples where the query is the application and the positive labels are the cited documents and their family members.
- Core assumption: Examiner citations comprehensively represent the state of the art for each application; citations not included are either irrelevant or missed due to examiner error/bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The paper discusses the concept of semantic clusters of patent documents that determine the state of the art in a given subject... A generator of user-configurable datasets for ML, based on collections of U.S. and Russian patent documents, is described."
  - [section 2.1] "Millions of patent publications include official search reports prepared by patent office experts. These reports, along with citations in the INID (56) field, serve as a markup of 'correct' search results and can be used to train and evaluate automated search systems."
  - [corpus] Related paper "Research on Evaluation Methods for Patent Novelty Search Systems" similarly uses examiner citations and X-type citations for evaluation datasets, suggesting convergent validation of this approach.
- Break condition: If examiner citations systematically omit relevant prior art (due to time pressure, search strategy limitations, or jurisdictional bias), training data would contain false negatives. Evidence from Table 1 shows 666,659 clusters contain only the base document (no citations), which could indicate either no relevant prior art or incomplete examination.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Grouping documents by patent family rather than treating them individually enables invention-level evaluation that avoids artificial inflation of search quality scores.
- Mechanism: When calculating metrics, documents from the same patent family are treated as a single "relevance unit." If a search retrieves three documents from the same family, only one relevant result is counted. The semantic cluster definition explicitly includes all family members of cited documents, making the family—not the document—the atomic unit for both training and evaluation.
- Core assumption: All documents within a patent family represent the same invention with equivalent relevance; partial overlap or continuations-with-modifications do not create meaningfully distinct inventions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "A patent family is typically defined as a group of documents related to the same invention... In ML, all documents belonging to a corresponding patent family should be included as positive examples."
  - [section 2.5.1] "The 'unit of relevance' in a patent search is not the individual patent document but the patent family... identifying multiple documents from the same patent family should not increase the search quality score."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation for family-as-unit mechanism; related papers focus on document-level retrieval without explicit family handling.
- Break condition: If patent families contain documents with substantively different claims (e.g., divisionals, continuations-in-part with new matter), treating them as equivalent may obscure meaningful retrieval differences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Custom metrics (S@K, H@K, MPF@K, MRF@K) provide more valid evaluation for patent search than traditional IR metrics because they operationalize the legal/institutional goal of identifying relevant inventions rather than similar documents.
- Mechanism: Traditional metrics like MAP and nDCG calculate document-level precision/recall. The proposed metrics substitute family-level counting: S@K measures whether at least one relevant family appears in top K; H@K measures whether all relevant families (up to K) are found; MPF@K and MRF@K are precision and recall calculated over families rather than documents.
- Core assumption: The value of a prior art search for patent examination is captured by finding at least one representative of each relevant invention family; ranking within families or finding multiple representatives adds no institutional value.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.5.2] "In patent search, the objective is not merely to retrieve documents but to identify the inventions they describe... These metrics do not capture the value that is critical for patent examination. They measure document-level precision and recall, whereas in patent search, what matters is semantic (invention-level) precision and recall."
  - [section 2.5.2] Formulas (1)-(7) formally define the family-adjusted metrics with explicit handling of the family membership condition.
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; related papers use standard retrieval metrics. "Research on Evaluation Methods for Patent Novelty Search Systems" proposes comprehensive evaluation but does not explicitly adopt family-level metrics.
- Break condition: If downstream uses of search results (e.g., invalidity arguments, freedom-to-operate analysis) benefit from finding multiple family members with different claim scopes or language versions, these metrics would undervalue such retrieval.

## Foundational Learning

- **Patent Family Structure**
  - Why needed here: The entire evaluation framework depends on understanding that a "simple" patent family (same priority date(s)) contains legally equivalent disclosures across jurisdictions and publication stages. Without this, the distinction between document-level and family-level metrics is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given US patent US9166223B2 and its European counterpart EP1234567A1, if a search retrieves both documents, how many "relevant results" should be counted according to the paper's framework?

- **Patent Examination Workflow and INID Codes**
  - Why needed here: The dataset generator extracts ground truth from examiner work products. Understanding that INID code (56) marks "prior art documents" cited during examination explains why this field serves as labeled data without additional annotation cost.
  - Quick check question: A US patent B2 document shows 15 citations in field (56). According to the semantic cluster definition, what additional documents beyond these 15 should be included in the cluster?

- **Ranked Retrieval Evaluation (Precision@K, Recall, Hit Rate)**
  - Why needed here: S@K, MPF@K, and MRF@K are adaptations of standard IR metrics. Understanding the base concepts clarifies what the family-level modification changes and why.
  - Quick check question: If a search returns 20 documents (K=20) and 8 belong to relevant patent families (with 10 total relevant families in the ground truth), what are the document-level precision@20 and recall@20? How would family-level counting differ if two of the 8 retrieved documents belong to the same family?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - XML Parser / Document Processor -> Patent Family Resolver -> Cluster Database (PostgreSQL) -> Dataset Generator -> Evaluation Utility -> External Search API Interface

- **Critical path:**
  1. Parse XML patent documents → extract base document ID and citations from INID (56)
  2. For each citation, resolve patent family via DocDB lookup
  3. Write cluster entry to PostgreSQL with all family-expanded document identifiers
  4. User specifies parameters (date range, document types) → generator outputs filtered JSON dataset
  5. ML system trains on dataset OR is evaluated via utility that compares its top-K results against cluster membership

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Completeness vs. noise in cluster definition**: Including all family members ensures no relevant variant is missed, but may introduce documents with different claim scopes or languages. The paper does not filter for claim-level equivalence.
  - **Storage strategy**: Current implementation stores all document identifiers explicitly. An alternative would store family IDs and resolve membership at query time, trading storage for lookup latency.
  - **Metric simplicity vs. nuance**: S@K and H@K are binary per-cluster; they don't capture partial success well. A cluster with 10 relevant families where 9 are found scores zero on H@K but may be practically useful.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Cluster explosion**: If DocDB family resolution is too permissive, clusters may grow to thousands of documents, diluting training signal and making evaluation trivial (most documents become "relevant").
  - **Citation extraction errors**: Poorly structured INID (56) fields in older documents or non-standard formats may cause missed citations, creating false-negative clusters.
  - **API rate limits**: Evaluation utility that queries external search platforms may stall or fail silently under bulk testing.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline retrieval with family-aware evaluation**: Run a standard BM25 or dense retrieval system on the US semantic cluster test set. Calculate both traditional metrics (MAP, nDCG@10) and proposed metrics (S@10, MPF@10). Document the gap between document-level and family-level scores to quantify the inflation effect the paper claims exists.
  2. **Cluster size distribution analysis**: Query the PostgreSQL database to produce statistics on cluster sizes (documents per cluster, families per cluster, citations per cluster). Compare US vs. Russian collections. Identify outlier clusters (very large or citation-only) and manually inspect whether they represent data quality issues or genuine examination patterns.
  3. **Ablation on family expansion**: Train a retrieval model on two variants of the same dataset—(a) with full family expansion as described, (b) with citations only, no family members. Evaluate both on family-aware metrics. If (a) significantly outperforms (b), family expansion is adding training signal; if not, the additional documents may be noise.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**
  - Question: How can the semantic cluster concept and infrastructure be effectively expanded to include non-patent literature?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Discussion that "A possible extension of this approach would be to enrich the datasets with non-patent literature," noting that this is essential in technological fields where scientific publications are frequently cited.
  - Why unresolved: The current infrastructure relies heavily on patent-specific structural data, such as INID codes and patent family links via DocDB, which do not natively exist for scientific papers or other prior art formats.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An extension of the dataset generator capable of ingesting and linking non-patent citations to the semantic clusters, along with an evaluation of how this inclusion impacts search recall and cluster coherence.

- **Open Question 2**
  - Question: How does the reliance on expert citations as the sole ground truth bias the evaluation against superior automated searches?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that experts face a "high risk of missing relevant documents" and do not follow strict algorithmic rules, yet the proposed evaluation metrics strictly define relevance based on these potentially incomplete expert citations.
  - Why unresolved: If an AI system identifies a highly relevant document that the original examiner missed, the current methodology classifies it as irrelevant, potentially penalizing systems that outperform the human ground truth.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A study involving independent expert review of "false positive" results generated by AI systems to determine the rate of "uncited but relevant" documents, providing a corrected noise-adjusted metric.

- **Open Question 3**
  - Question: Can success in the proposed semantic cluster retrieval task serve as a valid proxy for measuring Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose that the infrastructure "becomes a test environment for evaluating AGI" because the task requires understanding the "technical essence" of inventions rather than just keyword matching.
  - Why unresolved: While the authors hypothesize a link to AGI, it remains unproven whether success in this specific, highly structured domain implies general reasoning capabilities or merely high proficiency in domain-specific pattern matching and semantic similarity.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Correlative analysis showing that models performing well on this specific prior art task also demonstrate superior performance on distinct, non-patent reasoning benchmarks (e.g., ARC, BIG-bench) compared to models trained only on traditional text similarity.

## Limitations

- Family equivalence assumption may not hold for divisionals or continuations-in-part with materially different claims
- Examiner citation completeness unknown; systematic omissions could create false-negative training examples
- Patent family definition varies across jurisdictions; family expansion may introduce non-equivalent documents
- Family-level metrics may undervalue retrieval of multiple family members with different claim scopes

## Confidence

- Semantic cluster construction from examiner citations: **High** - Directly specified in paper with clear mechanism
- Family-as-unit evaluation approach: **Medium** - Well-defined but limited external validation
- Proposed metrics superiority over document-level metrics: **Low** - Claims made but limited comparative evidence

## Next Checks

1. Run retrieval system on US semantic cluster test set; calculate both traditional (MAP, nDCG@10) and proposed (S@10, MPF@10) metrics; quantify inflation gap
2. Query PostgreSQL database for cluster size statistics; identify and inspect outlier clusters for data quality issues
3. Train retrieval model on dataset variants with/without family expansion; compare family-aware metric performance to assess training signal value
