# SafeMobile: Chain-level Jailbreak Detection and Automated Evaluation for Multimodal Mobile Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.00841
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00841
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SafeMobile improved average G-Scores by 52.9 points, reduced G-ASR by 78.4%, and maintained stable task completion rates on multimodal mobile agents

## Executive Summary
SafeMobile addresses the critical challenge of jailbreak attacks on multimodal mobile agents that can bypass safety constraints to execute risky operations. The system introduces SafeTrajGuard, a behavior trajectory defense mechanism trained with SafeTrajDPO to identify and block high-risk actions using historical context, and GPTJudge, an automated evaluator that scores task trajectories for jailbreak success. Through comprehensive evaluation across six high-risk task categories, SafeMobile demonstrates significant improvements in security metrics while maintaining task completion performance.

## Method Summary
SafeMobile employs a dual-component architecture to detect and evaluate jailbreak attacks on multimodal mobile agents. The core defense mechanism, SafeTrajGuard, uses behavior trajectory analysis to identify and block potentially harmful actions by examining historical context patterns. It is trained using SafeTrajDPO, a reinforcement learning approach that optimizes for safety constraints. The second component, GPTJudge, serves as an automated evaluator that scores task trajectories to determine jailbreak success likelihood. This combination enables both proactive prevention and systematic evaluation of attack attempts, addressing the unique challenges posed by multimodal agents that interact with mobile environments.

## Key Results
- Improved average G-Scores by 52.9 points compared to baseline approaches
- Reduced G-ASR (Generation Attack Success Rate) by 78.4% while maintaining task completion
- Achieved over 85% consistency between GPTJudge automated evaluations and human annotations across 330 tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SafeMobile's effectiveness stems from its dual-layer approach to security. SafeTrajGuard leverages historical behavior trajectory analysis to establish context-aware safety boundaries, preventing harmful actions before they occur. By training with SafeTrajDPO, the system learns to distinguish between legitimate task progression and jailbreak attempts based on action patterns. GPTJudge provides a consistent, scalable evaluation framework that can assess jailbreak success across diverse task categories without human intervention. This combination addresses both the detection and evaluation challenges inherent in multimodal mobile agent security, where traditional single-modal approaches fail to capture the full spectrum of potential attack vectors.

## Foundational Learning
- Behavior trajectory analysis - Needed to understand sequential action patterns in mobile agents; Quick check: Can identify anomalous sequences in agent behavior logs
- Reinforcement learning for safety - Required for optimizing defensive policies against evolving attack strategies; Quick check: SafeTrajDPO achieves higher safety scores than baseline RL approaches
- Multimodal interaction modeling - Essential for understanding complex agent-environment relationships; Quick check: System maintains performance across text, visual, and sensor modalities
- Automated evaluation frameworks - Critical for scalable assessment of jailbreak attempts; Quick check: GPTJudge achieves >85% agreement with human evaluators
- Context-aware action filtering - Necessary to prevent harmful operations while preserving legitimate functionality; Quick check: System blocks high-risk actions without disrupting task completion

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Mobile Agent -> SafeTrajGuard -> Action Decision -> GPTJudge Evaluation -> Feedback Loop

Critical Path: Agent action generation → SafeTrajGuard trajectory analysis → Risk assessment and filtering → GPTJudge evaluation of filtered trajectory → Performance metrics update

Design Tradeoffs: SafeMobile prioritizes security over potential false positives, accepting some legitimate actions may be blocked to ensure safety. The system trades computational overhead for comprehensive multimodal analysis, and relies on automated evaluation rather than human review for scalability.

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation when multimodal context is incomplete or noisy; increased false positives during unusual but legitimate task sequences; evaluation inconsistencies when GPTJudge encounters novel attack patterns not represented in training data.

First 3 Experiments: 1) Baseline comparison of G-Scores and G-ASR across six high-risk task categories; 2) Human vs GPTJudge consistency evaluation on 330 annotated tasks; 3) Task completion rate analysis under various attack scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational overhead from comprehensive multimodal trajectory analysis may impact real-time performance
- Potential for false positives when legitimate actions resemble high-risk patterns in historical context
- Reliance on automated evaluation may miss nuanced attack strategies that deviate from training patterns

## Confidence
High: 52.9 point G-Score improvement, 78.4% G-ASR reduction, >85% human-judge consistency
Medium: Computational overhead and real-time performance impact claims
Low: Long-term effectiveness against evolving attack strategies

## Next Checks
1. Measure real-time performance overhead under varying multimodal data loads
2. Test system robustness against novel attack patterns not present in training data
3. Evaluate false positive rates across different mobile agent application domains
