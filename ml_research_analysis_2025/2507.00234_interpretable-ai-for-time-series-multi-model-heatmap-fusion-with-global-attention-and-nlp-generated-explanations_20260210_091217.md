# Interpretable AI for Time-Series: Multi-Model Heatmap Fusion with Global Attention and NLP-Generated Explanations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.00234
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00234
- Reference count: 29
- Key outcome: Fusion of ResNet Grad-CAM and 2D Transformer attention heatmaps improves accuracy (94.1% on ECG) and generates expert-rated explanations (4.6/5 clarity)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving interpretability in time-series deep learning by integrating heatmaps from two complementary architectures—ResNet and a restructured 2D Transformer—into a unified visualization that preserves both local precision and global context. Their approach fuses gradient-weighted activation maps from ResNet with Transformer attention rollout using element-wise multiplication, which maximizes mutual information while maintaining spatial-temporal alignment. An NLP module translates the fused heatmaps into domain-specific narratives (e.g., medical or industrial explanations). Experimental results on ECG and energy datasets show significant performance gains: 94.1% accuracy (F1: 0.93) on PhysioNet and RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R² = 0.95) on UCI, outperforming baselines by 3.8–12.4%. BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L (0.650) scores confirm high-quality explanations, and domain expert evaluations rate clarity and actionability at 4.6/5. The method provides a scalable, technically rigorous solution for transparent, time-aware decision-making in safety-critical domains.

## Method Summary
The method combines a ResNet-18 branch (1D convolutional with Grad-CAM) and a 2D Transformer branch (patch-embedded, multi-head self-attention) to process multivariate time-series data. Heatmaps from both branches are fused via element-wise multiplication after spatial-temporal alignment using DTW and bilinear upsampling. The fused heatmap is thresholded and clustered to generate domain-specific explanations using either template-based NLP or optional T5 fine-tuning. The architecture is trained end-to-end with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (Optuna) and validated on PhysioNet/CinC 2017 ECG and UCI Energy Appliance datasets.

## Key Results
- ECG classification: 94.1% accuracy, F1 = 0.93, outperforming baselines by 3.8–12.4%
- Energy regression: RMSE = 0.28 kWh, R² = 0.95
- NLP explanations: BLEU-4 = 0.586, ROUGE-L = 0.650; domain experts rate clarity 4.6/5
- Heatmap fusion: Element-wise multiplication achieves higher mutual information than concatenation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Element-wise multiplication of ResNet Grad-CAM heatmaps with Transformer attention rollout yields higher fidelity explanations than concatenation or either source alone.
- **Mechanism:** Grad-CAM provides localized gradient-weighted activations (high spatial precision, limited temporal span), while attention rollout captures global dependencies across all timesteps. Multiplication acts as a consensus filter: regions where both architectures agree are amplified, while uncorrelated noise is suppressed. This theoretically reduces variance in the explanation distribution.
- **Core assumption:** The true importance distribution H* has overlapping support in both local gradient signals and global attention patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "fuses gradient-weighted activation maps from ResNet with Transformer attention rollout using element-wise multiplication, which maximizes mutual information while maintaining spatial-temporal alignment"; [section III.3]: "multiplication inherently implements a consensus mechanism: Ep(x,y)[∥Hmul − H*∥2] ≤ Ep(x,y)[∥Hcat − H*∥2] under Gaussian noise assumptions"; [corpus]: Weak—no direct corpus validation of multiplication vs. concatenation for heatmap fusion.
- **Break condition:** If input data quality degrades (noisy sensors, missing values), Grad-CAM may mislocalize and attention may entangle spurious correlations, causing fused heatmap to inherit artifacts from both. Paper explicitly notes heatmap fidelity drops to 4.2/5 expert rating under noisy conditions.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Restructuring the Transformer to process time-series as a 2D grid (time × channel) enables simultaneous modeling of intra-channel temporal dynamics and cross-channel correlations.
- **Mechanism:** Standard 1D Transformers treat multivariate time-series as flat sequences, conflating time and channel dimensions. The 2D patch embedding preserves spatial structure, allowing multi-head self-attention to learn separate query-key distributions for temporal proximity vs. channel relationships. Early layers attend locally (adjacent timesteps), later layers establish long-range cross-channel dependencies.
- **Core assumption:** Cross-channel interactions (e.g., ECG lead correlations, sensor-sensor dependencies) carry predictive signal that flat sequence models lose.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency"; [section IV.B.5]: "early heads exhibit local temporal attention... late-layer heads demonstrate global connectivity, linking distant time points across multiple channels"; [corpus]: STPFormer uses pattern-aware spatio-temporal attention for traffic forecasting; CICADA addresses cross-domain anomaly detection. Both support 2D/structured attention for multivariate time-series, but neither explicitly validates the early/late layer specialization claim.
- **Break condition:** If channel dimension is small (C < 4) or channels are highly uncorrelated, the 2D structure adds computational overhead without representational benefit. Sparse attention reduces cost by 30% with 1.5% AUC drop (section IV.B.4), suggesting redundancy at high channel counts.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Template-based NLP generation with optional T5 fine-tuning produces domain-adapted explanations that achieve human-acceptable clarity without sacrificing semantic fidelity.
- **Mechanism:** Thresholding isolates high-activation heatmap regions; spatial clustering segments contiguous salient intervals. These are mapped to domain templates (e.g., "Elevated [variable] between [start]-[end]") ensuring terminology consistency. T5 adds nuance for edge cases but introduces 400ms additional latency.
- **Core assumption:** Domain experts prioritize actionable specificity over fluent paraphrase; BLEU/ROUGE overlap with reference reports correlates with clinical utility.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L (0.650) scores confirm high-quality explanations, and domain expert evaluations rate clarity and actionability at 4.6/5"; [section VI.E]: "Clarity: 4.6, Relevance: 4.8, Actionability: 4.5" on 5-point Likert scale from 10 clinicians rating 50 explanations; [corpus]: Mechanistic Interpretability for Transformer-based Time Series Classification focuses on internal circuit analysis rather than NLP output. No corpus papers directly validate template+T5 hybrid generation for time-series XAI.
- **Break condition:** If heatmap segments do not correspond to ground-truth causal features (e.g., model attends to artifacts), NLP will generate confident but misleading explanations. Faithfulness deletion test (41.3% accuracy drop masking top 20% regions) suggests reasonable alignment but not proof of causality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Grad-CAM for 1D Time-Series**
  - **Why needed here:** ResNet branch requires gradient-weighted activation mapping adapted from 2D images to 1D signals. Understanding how αk weights aggregate across channels to produce HResNet(t) is prerequisite for debugging fusion quality.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a 3-channel ECG input, if Grad-CAM highlights t=50–60 but the model predicts based on t=10–15, what does this indicate about gradient flow?

- **Concept: Attention Rollout and Layer Aggregation**
  - **Why needed here:** Raw attention weights are entangled with value projections and may not reflect true feature importance. Rollout recursively aggregates attention across layers to produce A_global.
  - **Quick check question:** If early-layer attention is uniformly distributed but late-layer attention is sparse, should rollout weight layers equally or prioritize later layers?

- **Concept: Mutual Information as Fusion Objective**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper claims multiplication maximizes I(H; Y) between fused explanation and prediction. This is an information-theoretic justification, not empirically measured in the paper.
  - **Quick check question:** How would you estimate I(H_fused; Y) empirically to validate the multiplication vs. concatenation claim?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data → Preprocessing (normalization, DTW alignment) → ResNet-18 (1D conv, Grad-CAM) → 2D Transformer (patch embedding, attention rollout) → Fusion (element-wise multiplication) → NLP (threshold, cluster, template/T5) → Output (explanations)
- **Critical path:** Data quality → heatmap alignment → fusion weighting → explanation generation. If DTW alignment fails (high cross-sample variance), fused heatmap will misattribute timesteps. If α (ResNet weight) is misspecified, local precision may dominate and suppress global context.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Computational overhead: 30% additional latency from dual inference + fusion vs. 3.8–12.4% accuracy gain over baselines; Template vs. T5: Templates are fast (<100ms), consistent, but rigid; T5 adds nuance but variable latency (up to 500ms); Sparse attention: 30% compute reduction for 1.5% AUC drop—acceptable for offline analysis, questionable for real-time ICU.
- **Failure signatures:** Noisy input → heatmap artifacts in both branches → fused explanation highlights spurious regions → NLP generates confident but wrong narrative; Channel imbalance → 2D attention overfits to high-variance channels → cross-channel dependencies underrepresented; Template mismatch → domain terminology does not match heatmap activation pattern → T5 fallback produces generic explanation.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablate fusion strategy:** Compare element-wise multiplication vs. weighted averaging vs. learned 1×1 convolution on held-out test set. Measure faithfulness (deletion AUC) and prediction accuracy.
  2. **Noise sensitivity test:** Inject Gaussian noise (σ=0.05, 0.1, 0.2) into UCI Energy sensors. Track heatmap entropy and BLEU/ROUGE degradation to quantify robustness bounds.
  3. **Latency profiling:** Measure end-to-end inference time on RTX 3070 vs. Jetson edge device for (a) template-only, (b) T5-only, (c) hybrid. Identify bottleneck for real-time deployment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can knowledge distillation effectively reduce the 30% inference latency of the dual-branch architecture to enable real-time edge deployment without degrading interpretability fidelity?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in Section VIII that future work will focus on "real-time deployment optimization via knowledge distillation (targeting 30% latency reduction)."
- **Why unresolved:** The current hybrid pipeline relies on parallel ResNet and Transformer branches, which creates synchronization overhead that currently limits the system to offline analysis.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks on embedded hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) showing inference speeds compatible with real-time monitoring (e.g., <100ms) while maintaining Faithfulness and Deletion scores comparable to the full model.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent do spatial-temporally aligned explanations improve domain expert decision-making efficiency and trust compared to standard post-hoc methods?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VIII.A proposes "empirical studies measuring how spatiotemporal explanations influence domain experts’ confidence and task efficiency" as a key future direction.
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper reports high user ratings for clarity, it does not quantify the causal impact of the fused heatmaps on actual human decision-making speed or error reduction in high-risk scenarios.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Controlled A/B testing with clinicians or engineers demonstrating statistically significant improvements in diagnostic speed or accuracy when using the fused method versus standalone Grad-CAM or SHAP.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the framework dynamically adapt its heatmap generation to maintain fidelity under non-stationary conditions and concept drift?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify "Dynamic adaptation to concept drift" as a necessary extension to address evolving clinical protocols or sensor degradation in Section VIII.A.
- **Why unresolved:** The current model is trained on static distributions, yet the Limitations section notes that noisy or changing sensor readings can propagate errors, potentially misleading the fusion mechanism.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments on streaming data with injected concept drift, showing that online learning mechanisms can trigger successful recalibration and prevent degradation in explanation quality over time.

## Limitations
- The mutual information maximization claim for element-wise multiplication is theoretical but not empirically validated
- Domain expert evaluation involved only 10 clinicians rating 50 explanations, potentially insufficient for statistical significance
- Model performance degrades under noisy sensor conditions (heatmap fidelity drops to 4.2/5 expert rating)

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Classification and regression performance metrics (accuracy, F1, RMSE, R²) are directly measurable and benchmarked against established baselines.
- **Medium confidence:** Heatmap fusion mechanism and NLP explanation quality, supported by deletion tests and expert ratings but lacking independent replication.
- **Low confidence:** Information-theoretic claims (mutual information maximization) and long-term robustness under diverse noise conditions.

## Next Checks
1. **Information-theoretic validation:** Implement mutual information estimation between fused heatmaps and predictions to empirically test the multiplication vs. concatenation claim.
2. **Cross-domain generalization:** Test the method on at least two additional time-series datasets (e.g., human activity recognition, financial time-series) to assess robustness beyond ECG and energy domains.
3. **Real-time deployment feasibility:** Profile end-to-end latency on edge devices (Jetson Nano/TX2) to identify bottlenecks and validate practical deployment constraints.
