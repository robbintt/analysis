# Objective Evaluation of Prosody and Intelligibility in Speech Synthesis via Conditional Prediction of Discrete Tokens
## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20485
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces TTScore, a reference-free evaluation framework for speech synthesis targeting intelligibility and prosody

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TTScore, a framework for evaluating speech synthesis quality by focusing on two key aspects: intelligibility and prosody. The authors propose TTScore-int for assessing how well the linguistic content is conveyed and TTScore-pro for evaluating the appropriateness of pitch patterns. Both metrics are based on conditional likelihood models that predict discrete speech tokens given input text, making them reference-free and directly aligned with human perception. Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks show that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall speech quality compared to traditional metrics like WER, CER, and F0-based measures.

## Method Summary
TTScore leverages conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens to evaluate synthesis quality. TTScore-int assesses intelligibility by predicting linguistic tokens from input text, while TTScore-pro evaluates prosody by predicting pitch-related tokens. Both metrics use reference-free models, avoiding the need for parallel reference speech. The approach is grounded in the idea that accurate prediction of speech tokens conditioned on text indicates higher synthesis quality. Experiments validate the metrics against human ratings across multiple benchmarks.

## Key Results
- TTScore-int and TTScore-pro show stronger correlations with human judgments than WER, CER, and F0-based measures on SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks.
- The reference-free nature of TTScore allows evaluation without parallel reference speech.
- Targeted evaluation of intelligibility and prosody provides more interpretable assessments of synthesis quality.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The metrics work by modeling the conditional likelihood of speech tokens given text, capturing both linguistic and prosodic aspects of speech synthesis. By focusing on discrete token prediction, the approach aligns with how humans perceive and judge speech quality, offering a more direct link to perceptual attributes than traditional error-based metrics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conditional likelihood modeling**: Predicts speech tokens from text to assess synthesis quality; needed to capture the relationship between linguistic content and acoustic realization; quick check: ensure model learns to predict tokens accurately given diverse inputs.
- **Discrete speech tokenization**: Converts continuous speech into discrete units for prediction; needed to enable reference-free evaluation; quick check: verify tokenization preserves relevant acoustic and linguistic information.
- **Reference-free evaluation**: Avoids reliance on parallel reference speech; needed for real-world applicability where references may not exist; quick check: confirm metrics correlate with human ratings without references.
- **Prosody modeling**: Focuses on pitch and rhythm patterns; needed to assess naturalness and expressiveness; quick check: evaluate metric sensitivity to prosodic variations.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Text -> Discrete token predictor -> Likelihood score (intelligibility/prosody)
- **Critical path**: Input text is tokenized and fed into a conditional prediction model, which outputs likelihoods for discrete speech tokens; these likelihoods are aggregated into final scores.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Discrete tokenization may lose fine-grained acoustic details; reference-free design avoids need for parallel speech but may miss some alignment-based cues.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor correlation with human ratings may indicate model misalignment with perceptual attributes or insufficient tokenization granularity.
- **First experiments**: 1) Test correlation with human ratings on held-out data; 2) Compare against baseline metrics (WER, CER, F0) on same benchmarks; 3) Ablate tokenization schemes to assess impact on metric reliability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focuses only on intelligibility and prosody, not naturalness, speaker identity, or environmental robustness.
- Relies on discrete tokenization, which may lose information and limit generalization.
- Benchmark results are based on specific datasets (SOMOS, VoiceMOS, TTSArena), raising external validity concerns.

## Confidence
- High: TTScore-int and TTScore-pro outperform traditional metrics in correlation with human judgments.
- Medium: Discrete token prediction is a superior reference-free approach, but comparisons to alternatives are limited.
- Low: Scalability and robustness across synthesis systems and domains remain untested.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate TTScore-int and TTScore-pro on a broader set of speech synthesis systems and languages to test generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of tokenization granularity and model architecture on metric reliability.
3. Perform head-to-head comparisons with other reference-free, speech-domain metrics (e.g., P.563, NISQA) on matched benchmarks to situate TTScore's relative performance.
