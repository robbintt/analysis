core_contribution: This paper investigates the impact of Reinforcement Learning with
  Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) on intermediate reasoning traces in LLMs, beyond final
  answer accuracy. The authors introduce a FOL-based measure called trace coherence
  to assess local consistency in reasoning steps by identifying errors.

# Local Coherence or Global Validity? Investigating RLVR Traces in Math Domains

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.18176
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18176
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: RLVR improves local trace coherence in math reasoning but does not guarantee correct final answers or global validity.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves not just final answer accuracy but also the intermediate reasoning traces of LLMs. Using a FOL-based trace coherence metric, the authors analyze reasoning step quality in Qwen-2.5-0.5B on GSM8K, distinguishing local coherence (step-to-step consistency) from global validity (correctness of the full reasoning chain). Results show RLVR enhances trace coherence, especially on problems the base model fails but the RL model succeeds, yet improved local coherence does not translate to guaranteed correctness of final answers or complete trace validity. The study calls for careful interpretation of RLVR's effects on reasoning, emphasizing the need to separate perceived trace quality from actual reasoning validity.

## Method Summary
The authors employ Qwen-2.5-0.5B fine-tuned with GRPO (via VERL pipeline) on GSM8K. Pass@K accuracy and trace coherence are evaluated at training steps 0, 10, and 100, using GPT-4o as an LLM-as-a-judge to classify reasoning traces according to a FOL-based error taxonomy (False Premise, False Rule, Calculator Error, Format Error). Trace coherence is defined as the existence of at least one error-free trace among all correct-answer responses for a given problem. Human validation is performed on a small subset (25 samples per error type + 100 error-free) to check for LLM-as-a-judge bias.

## Key Results
- RLVR improves Pass@K trace coherence, especially on problems where the base model fails but the RL model succeeds.
- Improved local coherence does not guarantee correct final answers or full trace validity.
- The FOL-based error taxonomy effectively identifies distinct reasoning errors in RLVR-generated traces.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Not applicable—this paper is an empirical study, not a mechanism design paper.

## Foundational Learning
- **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**: A variant of RLHF used for fine-tuning LLMs with verifiable rewards; needed to understand how RLVR shapes reasoning traces; quick check: verify reward function aligns with answer correctness and trace quality.
- **Trace coherence vs. global validity**: Distinguishes local consistency of reasoning steps from correctness of the overall chain; needed to interpret why RLVR may improve intermediate steps without ensuring correct final answers; quick check: confirm coherence is only computed over correct-answer responses.
- **FOL-based error taxonomy**: Formal ontology for classifying reasoning errors into False Premise, False Rule, Calculator Error, and Format Error; needed to systematically assess trace quality; quick check: validate error tags on a human-annotated subset.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: GSM8K problems -> Qwen-2.5-0.5B (GRPO training) -> RL checkpoints (steps 0,10,100) -> Pass@K responses -> GPT-4o error tagging -> coherence and accuracy metrics
- **Critical path**: Problem input → Model response generation → Error tagging (GPT-4o) → Coherence and accuracy computation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Use of small model (0.5B) for training efficiency vs. generalizability; LLM-as-a-judge (GPT-4o) for scalability vs. potential bias
- **Failure signatures**: Inconsistencies in error tagging due to LLM-as-a-judge bias; coherence improvements that do not translate to accuracy gains
- **First experiments**:
  1. Validate GPT-4o error tagging on a human-annotated subset to check for bias.
  2. Test FOL-based coherence measure on a second dataset/model to assess robustness.
  3. Compare coherence and accuracy gains across training steps to confirm trend.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: Does improving trace coherence through RLVR lead to better sample efficiency for downstream verification or self-correction mechanisms? The paper notes the coherence-validity gap but does not investigate whether coherent-but-invalid traces are easier to correct.
- **Open Question 2**: Can token-level advantage shaping in RLVR be designed to explicitly optimize for global validity rather than implicitly improving only local coherence? The authors identify uniform advantage distribution as a limitation but do not propose alternatives.
- **Open Question 3**: How does the coherence-validity relationship in RLVR generalize to reasoning domains beyond grade-school mathematics? The study is limited to GSM8K and one model family, leaving open whether results extend to higher-level math or formal proofs.

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to a single 0.5B-parameter model and one math dataset (GSM8K).
- Trace coherence metric relies on LLM-as-a-judge (GPT-4o), which may introduce bias; human validation limited to a small subset.
- FOL-based taxonomy may not fully capture semantic dependencies or higher-order reasoning flaws.

## Confidence
- **High**: RLVR improves local trace coherence (Pass@K coherence increases with training steps).
- **Medium**: Improved local coherence does not guarantee correct final answers or global trace validity.
- **Medium**: FOL-based error taxonomy effectively identifies distinct error categories in reasoning traces.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the error-tagging pipeline on a human-annotated validation set to quantify LLM-as-a-judge accuracy and bias.
2. Test the FOL-based coherence measure on a second dataset (e.g., MATH) and a larger model (e.g., Qwen-2.5-7B) to assess robustness.
3. Design a controlled RLVR ablation where the reward signal explicitly rewards error-free traces to test whether coherence gains are intentional or emergent.
