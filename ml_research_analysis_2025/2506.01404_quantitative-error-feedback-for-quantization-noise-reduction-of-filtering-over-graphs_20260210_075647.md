core_contribution: This paper proposes a quantitative error feedback (QEF) framework
  to mitigate quantization noise in distributed graph filtering, addressing the challenge
  of communication-constrained systems where quantized messages introduce noise that
  accumulates and propagates through the network. The method draws from error spectrum
  shaping techniques in classical digital filters, establishing a state-space perspective
  for graph filtering that models quantization noise as round-off errors.

# Quantitative Error Feedback for Quantization Noise Reduction of Filtering over Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.01404
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01404
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes QEF framework achieving exact quantization noise compensation across graph filtering scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of quantization noise in distributed graph filtering over communication-constrained networks. The authors introduce a quantitative error feedback (QEF) framework that leverages error spectrum shaping techniques to mitigate quantization-induced errors that accumulate and propagate through networked systems. By establishing a state-space perspective for graph filtering and modeling quantization noise as round-off errors, the framework provides exact compensation across deterministic graph filtering, random graph filtering, and random node-asynchronous update scenarios.

The work extends classical digital filter error feedback concepts to graph signal processing, deriving closed-form solutions for optimal error feedback coefficients. The framework is further generalized to communication-efficient decentralized optimization, demonstrating significant improvements in error floors compared to conventional quantization strategies. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments validate the approach across various filtering tasks, showing consistent accuracy improvements and robustness in quantization-constrained environments.

## Method Summary
The QEF framework models quantization noise as round-off errors within a state-space representation of graph filtering. The method derives noise propagation models and optimizes feedback coefficients to achieve exact quantization noise compensation. The approach is validated through theoretical analysis demonstrating significant noise reduction, with extensions to decentralized optimization showing lower error floors compared to conventional strategies. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results across various filtering tasks and optimization scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves exact compensation of quantization noise across deterministic graph filtering scenarios
- Derives closed-form solutions for optimal error feedback coefficients with theoretical noise reduction guarantees
- Extends framework to decentralized optimization with consistently lower error floors than conventional quantization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by modeling quantization noise as round-off errors within a state-space graph filtering framework, then applying error spectrum shaping techniques from classical digital filters. By deriving precise noise propagation models and optimizing feedback coefficients, the method can exactly cancel quantization-induced errors. The closed-form solutions for feedback coefficients enable practical implementation while maintaining theoretical guarantees of noise reduction across different graph filtering scenarios.
