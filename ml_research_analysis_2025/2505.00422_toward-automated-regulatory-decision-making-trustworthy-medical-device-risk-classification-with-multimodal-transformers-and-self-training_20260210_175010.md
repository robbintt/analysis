# Toward Automated Regulatory Decision-Making: Trustworthy Medical Device Risk Classification with Multimodal Transformers and Self-Training

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.00422
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00422
- **Reference count:** 34
- **Primary result:** Transformer-based multimodal framework achieves 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC for automated medical device risk classification

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a transformer-based multimodal framework for automated classification of medical device risk levels (Class I, II, III), integrating textual descriptions and visual information via a cross-attention mechanism and self-training strategy. The method significantly outperforms unimodal baselines (text-only: 77.2% accuracy; image-only: 54.8%) achieving up to 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC on a regulatory dataset. Self-training with high-confidence pseudo-labels further improves SVM performance by 3.3 percentage points in accuracy. The approach enhances regulatory compliance, supports harmonization frameworks (UDI, GMDN), and demonstrates robustness in low-resource settings, offering a scalable decision-support tool for automated medical device risk classification.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a cross-attention Transformer encoder to jointly model text (via BERT embeddings) and images (via EfficientNet-B4 features), projecting both modalities to a shared 1024-dimensional space before fusion. A self-training loop with an ensemble (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) generates high-confidence pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, which are used to expand the training set over multiple rounds. The final classifier can be either a neural network head or an SVM trained on the fused embeddings, with self-training providing the largest performance gains.

## Key Results
- **Cross-modal attention** improves accuracy from 77.2% (text-only) to 90.4% by resolving semantic ambiguity
- **Self-training** with high-confidence pseudo-labels boosts SVM performance by 3.3 percentage points
- **Ablation studies** confirm complementary benefits of cross-modal attention and self-training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Modal Attention for Disambiguation
Jointly modeling text and images via cross-attention improves risk classification accuracy over single-modality approaches by resolving semantic ambiguity. The model uses a cross-attention Transformer encoder to allow textual features (e.g., "invasive") to attend to visual features (e.g., device shape/ports), leveraging visual cues when text is sparse or domain-specific jargon is ambiguous. Core assumption: visual features contain risk-relevant signal that correlates with textual description. Evidence: multimodal approach outperforms unimodal baselines (text-only: 77.2%; image-only: 54.8%). Break condition: if input images are generic stock photos lacking device-specific details, visual attention may attend to noise.

### Mechanism 2: Self-Training with Model Consistency
Semi-supervised self-training with high-confidence pseudo-labels improves generalization in low-resource regulatory settings. An ensemble generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, retaining only samples with unanimous model agreement and confidence > 0.95. This expands the effective training set size and smooths decision boundaries. Core assumption: high prediction confidence correlates with ground-truth correctness, and unlabeled data distribution matches labeled distribution. Evidence: self-training improves SVM performance by 3.3 percentage points. Break condition: if initial labeled set is biased, ensemble will confidently propagate errors, degrading performance.

### Mechanism 3: Modality-Specific Projection Alignment
Projecting heterogeneous inputs (BERT embeddings vs. EfficientNet features) into a shared latent space stabilizes fusion. Textual and visual features pass through separate projection layers (Linear -> Batch Norm -> GELU) to produce aligned vectors (d=1024) before entering the Transformer, preventing the modality with larger feature magnitudes from dominating attention. Core assumption: unified vector space required for Transformer's self-attention to effectively calculate similarity between text and image tokens. Evidence: modality-agnostic feature representations offer resilience to documentation variations. Break condition: if feature scaling is omitted or projection dimensions too small, attention mechanism fails to correlate modalities.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transformer Cross-Attention**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the engine that fuses text and image tokens. Without understanding how Q, K, and V matrices function across modalities, one cannot debug why the model might be ignoring image inputs.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how the attention score is calculated between a text token representing "sterile" and an image patch showing a packaged device?

- **Concept: Semi-Supervised Pseudo-Labeling**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on this to boost performance from 87.1% to 90.4%. Understanding the trade-off between threshold strictness and data volume is critical for replicating results.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to the model's bias if the confidence threshold (τ) is set too low during the self-training loop?

- **Concept: Transfer Learning (Domain Adaptation)**
  - **Why needed here:** The model uses bert-base-chinese and EfficientNet-B4 (pretrained on ImageNet). Understanding that these are "frozen" or "fine-tuned" starting points explains how the model succeeds with only 1,000 samples.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is ImageNet pre-training potentially insufficient for medical device images, necessitating the fine-tuning step described in Section 3.2?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Text/Image Preprocessing -> Feature Extraction (BERT/EfficientNet) -> Projection to Shared Space -> Transformer Fusion -> Classification
- **Critical path:** Text/Image Preprocessing → Feature Extraction (BERT/EfficientNet) → Projection to Shared Space → Transformer Fusion → Classification. The self-training loop wraps this path to augment data.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Fusion Strategy: chooses late interaction (Cross-Attention) over early concatenation, increasing compute cost but allowing the model to weigh specific text tokens against specific image regions. Self-Training: uses conservative threshold (0.95) + ensemble unanimity, prioritizing precision over recall in pseudo-labeling to avoid model collapse.
- **Failure signatures:** Modality Collapse: if ablation shows Text+Image ≈ Text-Only, image gradient flow has likely failed. Overfitting to Noise: if self-training causes accuracy to fluctuate wildly, threshold τ is too low. Class Imbalance: if Macro-F1 is significantly lower than Accuracy, model is ignoring minority classes.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Unimodal Baseline: Train SVM/RF on text-only and image-only features separately. 2) Ablation on Fusion: Compare "Early Fusion" (concatenation) vs. "Cross-Attention". 3) Self-Training Sensitivity: Run self-training loop with τ ∈ [0.8, 0.9, 0.95].

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can the framework maintain high performance when applied to multilingual and cross-jurisdictional regulatory environments (e.g., FDA, EMA)?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state that expanding studies to include data from multiple agencies like the FDA or EMA is necessary to provide a stronger basis for generalization.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current study relies exclusively on a dataset from the Chinese NMPA, limiting diversity in device categories and documentation formats.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful evaluation of the model on regulatory datasets from distinct jurisdictions with varying classification protocols and languages.

- **Question:** Does the integration of structured metadata (e.g., clinical specialty, manufacturer ID) significantly improve classification fidelity over text and image fusion alone?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper notes the model "does not yet incorporate structured metadata" and suggests that including it could enhance classification fidelity for borderline or novel device types.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current architecture processes only unstructured text and images, potentially missing domain-specific context crucial for regulatory assessment.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative experiments showing performance gains when structured fields are jointly modeled with existing multimodal embeddings.

- **Question:** Can explanation mechanisms like SHAP or attention visualization effectively support regulatory auditing and foster user trust?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify the incorporation of explanation mechanisms as a critical direction for future work to support regulatory auditing and accountability.
  - **Why unresolved:** While the model achieves high accuracy, it currently lacks interpretability features required to justify specific risk predictions to human reviewers.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation of attribution maps and user studies demonstrating that regulators can interpret and trust the model's decision rationale.

## Limitations
- **Dataset size:** Small dataset (1,000 samples) raises questions about external validity and generalization
- **Jurisdictional scope:** Chinese NMPA dataset limits generalizability to other regulatory frameworks (FDA, EU MDR)
- **Implementation ambiguities:** Discrepancies between stated optimizers and underspecified image bottleneck architecture create uncertainty for reproduction

## Confidence
- **Core claims:** Medium confidence - methodology is sound and results are compelling, but small dataset and implementation ambiguities prevent High confidence
- **Generalizability:** Low confidence - limited to Chinese regulatory context with no cross-jurisdictional validation
- **Reproducibility:** Medium confidence - key implementation details underspecified (image bottleneck, optimizer choice)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the self-training ablation with varying confidence thresholds (0.8, 0.9, 0.95) to quantify the precision-recall tradeoff
2. Test model generalization by evaluating on a held-out test set from a different regulatory jurisdiction (e.g., FDA vs. NMPA)
3. Implement and compare the exact 64-dimensional image bottleneck architecture described in Section 3.2 to isolate its contribution
