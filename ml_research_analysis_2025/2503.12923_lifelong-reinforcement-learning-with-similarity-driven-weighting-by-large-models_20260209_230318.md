# Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Similarity-Driven Weighting by Large Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.12923
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12923
- Authors: Zhiyi Huang; Xiaohan Shan; Jianmin Li
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SDW achieves superior lifelong RL performance on MiniHack and Atari benchmarks with reduced computational overhead

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SDW, a lifelong reinforcement learning framework that leverages large language models to dynamically adjust training based on task similarity. The framework generates two key functions: one for quantifying task similarity and another for computing adaptive training weights. This enables effective balancing between learning new tasks and retaining knowledge from previous ones. Experiments demonstrate that SDW significantly outperforms existing methods in task performance, catastrophic forgetting mitigation, and knowledge transfer.

## Method Summary
SDW employs a similarity-driven weighting approach where large language models pre-generate task similarity and weighting functions offline. These functions dynamically adjust training priorities based on how similar new tasks are to previously learned ones. The framework uses these similarity metrics to compute adaptive weights that determine how much emphasis to place on new versus old task knowledge during training. By generating these functions offline, SDW reduces computational overhead during the actual learning process while maintaining high performance across multiple tasks.

## Key Results
- SDW significantly outperforms existing lifelong RL methods on MiniHack and Atari benchmarks
- The framework effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while enabling positive knowledge transfer
- Pre-generating LLM functions offline reduces computational overhead during training
- SDW achieves superior results with fewer training iterations compared to baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to quantify task relationships and dynamically adjust learning priorities. By using LLM-generated similarity metrics, SDW can identify when new tasks are closely related to previously learned ones, allowing for targeted knowledge transfer. The adaptive weighting mechanism ensures that learning resources are allocated efficiently between acquiring new knowledge and preserving existing skills. This prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining the flexibility to learn from new experiences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Task similarity metrics**: Needed to quantify relationships between tasks for effective knowledge transfer; quick check involves measuring correlation between predicted and actual transfer performance
- **Adaptive weighting mechanisms**: Required to balance learning between new and old tasks; quick check involves verifying weight distributions align with expected learning priorities
- **Catastrophic forgetting mitigation**: Essential for lifelong learning systems; quick check involves measuring performance decay on old tasks after learning new ones
- **Knowledge transfer optimization**: Critical for leveraging previous experience; quick check involves comparing transfer performance against random initialization baselines

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Tasks -> LLM Generator -> Similarity Function + Weighting Function -> RL Agent -> Output Policy

**Critical Path**: Task Input → Similarity Function → Weight Calculation → Weighted Experience Replay → Policy Update

**Design Tradeoffs**: Offline function generation reduces runtime computation but may limit adaptability to truly novel tasks; fixed similarity metrics may not capture task nuances that emerge during training

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation on old tasks despite high similarity scores; poor transfer to seemingly similar tasks; excessive weight given to new tasks causing catastrophic forgetting

**First Experiments**: 1) Test similarity function accuracy on known task relationships; 2) Validate weight distribution aligns with expected learning priorities; 3) Measure catastrophic forgetting on sequential task learning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability across diverse domains beyond MiniHack and Atari benchmarks remains unproven
- Reliance on LLM-generated functions may introduce brittleness with significantly different task distributions
- Long-term stability across hundreds of tasks has not been thoroughly evaluated
- Framework performance in non-stationary task distributions is not explored

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Experimental methodology and benchmark results demonstrating SDW's performance improvements
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about reduced computational overhead through offline function generation
- **Medium confidence**: Catastrophic forgetting mitigation effectiveness within tested domains

## Next Checks
1. Test SDW's robustness across heterogeneous task distributions, including scenarios where tasks share visual similarities but require opposing policies
2. Conduct ablation studies removing LLM components to quantify their specific contribution versus simpler heuristic approaches
3. Evaluate performance when tasks arrive in non-stationary distributions or with concept drift, measuring how quickly the weighting mechanism adapts
