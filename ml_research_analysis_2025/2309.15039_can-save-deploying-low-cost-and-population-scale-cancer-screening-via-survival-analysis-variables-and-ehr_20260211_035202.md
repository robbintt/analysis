# Can-SAVE: Deploying Low-Cost and Population-Scale Cancer Screening via Survival Analysis Variables and EHR

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2309.15039
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15039
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 4-10x higher cancer detection rate vs. standard screening with Average Precision 0.228 vs 0.193

## Executive Summary
Can-SAVE is a lightweight AI system for population-wide cancer screening that leverages routine EHR data and medical history events. The method integrates survival model outputs into a gradient-boosting framework to detect long-term cancer risk patterns before clinical symptoms appear. Evaluated on 2.5 million patients across five Russian regions, Can-SAVE achieved a 4-10x higher detection rate at identical screening volumes, with Average Precision of 0.228 versus 0.193 for the best baseline. In a 12-month prospective pilot with 426K patients, it nearly doubled cancer detection rate (+91%) and increased population coverage by 36% over the national screening protocol.

## Method Summary
Can-SAVE processes EHR data by extracting survival analysis variables from routine medical history events and feeding them into a gradient-boosting classifier. The system focuses on long-term cancer risk patterns detectable before clinical symptoms appear, making it suitable for population-scale deployment with limited computational resources. The method was trained and validated on a dataset of 2.5 million patients across five Russian regions, with prospective validation conducted on 426K patients over 12 months.

## Key Results
- 4-10x higher cancer detection rate at identical screening volumes compared to standard protocols
- Average Precision of 0.228 versus 0.193 for the best baseline model
- Prospective pilot: +91% cancer detection rate increase and 36% higher population coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system exploits the predictive power of longitudinal EHR data through survival analysis variables, capturing subtle risk patterns that precede clinical diagnosis. By integrating these variables into a gradient-boosting framework, Can-SAVE can identify high-risk individuals who would benefit from early screening interventions. The approach leverages the temporal structure of medical histories to build robust risk models without requiring expensive biomarker tests or imaging studies.

## Foundational Learning
- **Survival Analysis**: Models time-to-event data to predict cancer onset probabilities; needed to capture longitudinal risk patterns from medical histories
- **Gradient Boosting**: Ensemble method that combines weak learners into strong predictors; needed for handling complex interactions in EHR data
- **EHR Data Mining**: Extracting meaningful features from routine healthcare records; needed to operationalize population-scale screening without additional data collection
- **Population Screening Optimization**: Balancing detection sensitivity with resource constraints; needed to demonstrate real-world clinical utility

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Ingestion -> Feature Extraction -> Survival Model -> Gradient Boosting Classifier -> Risk Scoring

**Critical Path:** EHR Data → Survival Variables → Risk Prediction → Screening Prioritization

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system prioritizes computational efficiency and clinical interpretability over maximal predictive performance, enabling deployment on standard hardware while maintaining transparency for medical decision-making.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance in populations with sparse medical histories, potential bias toward conditions with well-documented EHR patterns, and sensitivity to data quality variations across healthcare facilities.

**First 3 Experiments:** 1) Benchmark processing speed on 1M patient records, 2) Compare detection rates across different cancer types, 3) Validate performance consistency across age and demographic subgroups

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on single national EHR system from Russia, limiting generalizability
- Model performance may vary across healthcare systems with different data quality and screening protocols
- Potential survivorship bias from 7-year washout period in training data construction

## Confidence

**High**: Technical implementation details, processing speed benchmarks, and gradient-boosting architecture integration are well-documented and reproducible

**Medium**: Retrospective performance metrics on 2.5 million patient dataset require external validation

**Medium**: Prospective pilot results show promise but represent single-site, single-country implementation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct external validation on EHR data from healthcare systems in different countries with varying cancer screening protocols and demographic distributions
2. Perform subgroup analysis to verify consistent performance across age groups, socioeconomic statuses, and cancer types
3. Implement multi-site prospective trial with control arms to establish causal impact on mortality reduction and cost-effectiveness compared to standard screening approaches
