# DecMetrics: Structured Claim Decomposition Scoring for Factually Consistent LLM Outputs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.04483
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04483
- Authors: Minghui Huang
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: DecModel outperforms strong baselines in claim decomposition completeness and correctness while using fewer parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DecMetrics, a framework for evaluating claim decomposition quality in fact-checking systems. The approach decomposes claims into atomic facts using three metrics—COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS, and SEMANTIC ENTROPY—which together assess recall, precision, and diversity. Using these metrics as rewards, the authors train DecModel via reinforcement learning, demonstrating improved performance over larger models like Qwen3-32B. The work addresses the critical need for reliable decomposition in fact-checking pipelines where aggregation quality directly impacts verification accuracy.

## Method Summary
The method follows a three-stage pipeline: first, synthetic decomposition data is generated from Wikipedia summaries using a teacher LLM; second, DecMetrics models are trained to evaluate completeness, correctness, and semantic entropy using fine-tuned NLI models; third, DecModel is trained via supervised fine-tuning followed by PPO optimization using the composite reward function. The approach creates Claim2Atom benchmark combining existing datasets with new synthetic data, enabling systematic evaluation of decomposition quality across multiple dimensions.

## Key Results
- DecModel-large (0.78B params) achieves 98.96% Correctness vs. Qwen3-32B's 94.77%
- Ablation studies confirm all three metrics are essential for optimal performance
- In downstream fact-checking, DecModel improves balanced accuracy over GPT-4 baseline
- Parameter efficiency demonstrated: smaller model outperforms larger baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Axis Decomposition Evaluation (DecMetrics)
- **Claim:** Effective claim decomposition requires evaluating three distinct axes—Completeness, Correctness, and Semantic Entropy—because optimizing for just one often degrades others
- **Mechanism:** This framework repurposes NLI models where Completeness acts as recall, Correctness as precision, and Semantic Entropy quantifies diversity by clustering atomic claims
- **Core assumption:** Standard NLI models are insufficient and require fine-tuning on synthetic decomposition data
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "...introduces DecMetrics, which comprises three new metrics: COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS, and SEMANTIC ENTROPY..."; [section 3.1] "These metrics function similarly to recall, precision, and accuracy..."; [section 3.4] Table 1 shows standard NLI models struggle with DecMetrics test set
- **Break condition:** If the underlying NLI model fails to distinguish between "supported" and "unsupported" in the context of atomic facts, the reward signal becomes noise

### Mechanism 2: Reinforcement Learning from Decomposition Metrics
- **Claim:** A lightweight model (DecModel) can outperform larger LLMs when trained via RL using DecMetrics as reward signal
- **Mechanism:** Three-stage pipeline: SFT to learn formatting, composite reward function R = α·cp + β·cr + γ·se, PPO optimization to maximize reward
- **Core assumption:** Automatically calculated metrics serve as reliable proxy for human judgment
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4.1] "...these metrics are advantageous when used as reward signals within a reinforcement learning framework."; [section 6.1] Table 3 shows DecModel-large achieving 98.96% Correctness vs. Qwen3-32B's 94.77%
- **Break condition:** If reward weights are misaligned, the model may "game" the metric—for example, generating redundant claims to maximize entropy while sacrificing correctness

### Mechanism 3: Synthetic Data Generation via Tree-Based Reverse Validation
- **Claim:** High-quality training data for decomposition metrics can be synthesized by recursively decomposing Wikipedia summaries into trees and validating them via "reverse check"
- **Mechanism:** Sample entities, extract summaries, recursively decompose using LLM, construct decomposition tree, generate training pairs by manipulating leaf nodes, perform reverse check to ensure aggregated atomic claims faithfully represent root claim
- **Core assumption:** Teacher model's decomposition logic is sufficiently robust to generate valid "positive" examples
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.2] "Step 4: Decomposition Tree Generation... involves a reverse check... to ensure each subtree meets specific criteria."; [corpus] Weak external signal; neighbor papers discuss similar extraction but this paper's specific "reverse check" mechanism is internally defined
- **Break condition:** If teacher model introduces subtle hallucinations that pass the reverse check, metric models will learn to score factually drifted claims as "Correct"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Natural Language Inference (NLI) & Entailment**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire DecMetrics framework relies on NLI to determine if Claim A "supports" Claim B
  - **Quick check question:** If an atomic claim adds information not present in the source text, which metric (Completeness or Correctness) should penalize it? (Answer: Correctness)

- **Concept: Reinforcement Learning (PPO) in LLMs**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper moves beyond standard SFT to use PPO where reward models guide the policy to generate higher-quality outputs
  - **Quick check question:** Why might SFT fail to optimize for "Semantic Entropy" compared to RL? (Answer: SFT mimics distribution; RL explicitly maximizes a defined scalar reward for diversity)

- **Concept: Atomic Claims**
  - **Why needed here:** The definition of "atomic" is the unit of analysis—defined as "non-splittable"
  - **Quick check question:** Is "John was born in 1990 in Paris" an atomic claim according to strict decomposition principles? (Answer: Likely no; it is splittable into "John was born in 1990" and "John was born in Paris")

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Wikipedia Sampler -> Qwen3-32B Decomposer -> Tree Builder -> Reverse Checker -> Synthetic Dataset (DecData) -> Metric Engine: DeBERTa-v3-large fine-tuned on Synthetic Dataset -> DecMetrics Scorer -> Training Engine: T5 Model (SFT initialization) -> PPO Optimizer -> DecModel

- **Critical path:** The Metric Engine is the bottleneck. If the reward model (DeBERTa fine-tuned on synthetic data) does not generalize to real claims, the RL training will optimize for the wrong objective

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Synthetic vs. Human Data:** Relies heavily on synthetic data to train metric models, scaling but risking embedding teacher model's biases
  - **Aggregation Strictness:** Downstream fact-checking requires all atomic claims to be supported, increasing precision but may lower recall
  - **Metric Correlation:** Returning the original claim yields high Completeness/Correctness but zero Semantic Entropy; system must balance competing pressures

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"The Parroting Failure":** High Correctness, Low Entropy. Model simply repeats the input claim or splits it into trivially similar paraphrases
  - **"The Hallucination Drift":** High Entropy, Low Correctness. Model generates diverse claims that are factually incorrect regarding the source
  - **"The Omission Failure":** High Correctness, Low Completeness. Model only generates safe, simple claims, ignoring complex facets of the original text

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate the Metric Proxy:** Run fine-tuned DecMetrics scorer on small human-labeled set to verify it correlates with human judgment
  2. **Ablate Reward Weights:** Train three versions of DecModel varying α, β, γ to confirm causal link between Semantic Entropy rewards and claim diversity
  3. **End-to-End Fact-Checking Stress Test:** Integrate DecModel into pipeline and measure if "better" decomposition scores lead to higher verification accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Generalization Limitations:** Synthetic data from Wikipedia might miss real-world complexity, and the chosen 200 subjects do not represent all topics
- **Aggregation Strategy Impact:** Current approach (demanding support for all claims) can enhance precision but may negatively impact recall; suggests exploring more sophisticated aggregation strategies
- **Scalability Issues:** Resource-intensive process limiting scalability and experimentation across larger datasets

## Limitations
- **Synthetic Data Dependence:** DecMetrics models trained entirely on synthetic data from Qwen3-32B decompositions, raising generalization questions
- **Teacher Model Bias:** Performance improvements may reflect teacher model's decomposition patterns rather than universal principles
- **Limited Evaluation Scope:** Fact-checking pipeline evaluation shows improvement over GPT-4 but doesn't compare against other specialized decomposition approaches

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Mathematical formulation and ablation study showing each metric's importance are well-supported
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that DecModel outperforms strong baselines is supported but magnitude of improvement requires further validation
- **Low Confidence:** Scalability claims are weak—paper acknowledges challenges but doesn't provide systematic testing across domains

## Next Checks

1. **Human Judgment Validation:** Conduct human evaluation study comparing DecModel decompositions against human-annotated "ground truth" atomic claims
2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Evaluate DecModel on claims from domains not represented in Wikipedia (scientific literature, legal documents, social media)
3. **End-to-End Fact-Checking Benchmark:** Implement DecModel in multiple fact-checking pipelines and compare overall verification accuracy against state-of-the-art systems across standard benchmarks
