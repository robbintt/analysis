# MRN: Harnessing 2D Vision Foundation Models for Diagnosing Parkinson's Disease with Limited 3D MR Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.17566
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17566
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: MRN achieved first place in the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation challenge with 86.0% accuracy on 300 labeled QSM and NM-MRI scans, outperforming the second-place method by 5.5%

## Executive Summary
MRN introduces a novel approach for diagnosing Parkinson's disease by leveraging 2D vision foundation models (VFMs) to analyze limited 3D MR data. The method processes multiple regions of interest (ROIs) from quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) images in parallel, compressing each ROI into a token using pre-trained 2D VFMs, and fusing them into a unified patient representation. To enhance feature discriminability, MRN employs an auxiliary segmentation head and multi-ROI supervised contrastive learning. This approach achieved state-of-the-art performance in the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation challenge, demonstrating the potential of combining 2D VFMs with limited 3D medical imaging data for neurological disease diagnosis.

## Method Summary
MRN addresses the challenge of limited 3D MR data by utilizing pre-trained 2D vision foundation models to process multiple ROIs extracted from QSM and NM-MRI scans. The method operates by first identifying and extracting relevant ROIs from the 3D volumetric data, then processing each 2D slice of these ROIs through 2D VFMs to generate compact token representations. These tokens are subsequently fused to create a comprehensive patient-level representation. The architecture incorporates an auxiliary segmentation head for improved feature learning and employs multi-ROI supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminability of features across different ROIs. This framework effectively leverages the rich feature representations learned by 2D VFMs while addressing the scarcity of 3D medical imaging data in Parkinson's disease diagnosis.

## Key Results
- MRN achieved 86.0% accuracy on the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation challenge dataset
- Outperformed the second-place method by 5.5 percentage points
- Demonstrated superior performance using only 300 labeled QSM and NM-MRI scans

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MRN's effectiveness stems from its ability to bridge the gap between abundant 2D vision foundation models and scarce 3D medical imaging data. By decomposing 3D volumetric data into multiple 2D ROIs and processing them through pre-trained 2D VFMs, the method capitalizes on the rich feature representations learned from large-scale natural image datasets. The token compression step reduces dimensionality while preserving discriminative information, and the fusion mechanism aggregates multi-ROI information into a unified patient representation. The auxiliary segmentation head provides additional supervision for feature learning, while multi-ROI contrastive learning ensures that features from different ROIs are both discriminative and consistent across patients.

## Foundational Learning

**Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM)**
- Why needed: QSM provides quantitative measures of tissue magnetic susceptibility, which is crucial for detecting iron deposition patterns in Parkinson's disease
- Quick check: Verify that QSM preprocessing includes phase unwrapping and background field removal

**Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI)**
- Why needed: NM-MRI specifically visualizes neuromelanin in the substantia nigra, a key biomarker for Parkinson's disease progression
- Quick check: Confirm that NM-MRI acquisition parameters are optimized for neuromelanin contrast

**Vision Foundation Models**
- Why needed: Pre-trained 2D VFMs provide rich feature representations learned from massive natural image datasets, compensating for limited medical imaging data
- Quick check: Validate that the 2D VFM weights are properly transferred and fine-tuned for medical imaging tasks

**Multi-ROI Processing**
- Why needed: Parkinson's disease affects multiple brain regions, requiring comprehensive analysis across different anatomical areas
- Quick check: Ensure that ROI selection covers all clinically relevant regions for Parkinson's disease diagnosis

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
QSM and NM-MRI scans -> ROI extraction -> 2D VFM processing -> Token compression -> Token fusion -> Patient representation -> Classification head

**Critical Path**
ROI extraction and 2D VFM processing form the critical path, as they directly impact the quality of token representations and subsequent patient classification performance

**Design Tradeoffs**
- 2D VFMs vs 3D CNNs: 2D VFMs offer pre-trained knowledge but require careful ROI selection; 3D CNNs could process volumetric data directly but lack pre-training
- Token compression: Balances between preserving discriminative information and reducing computational complexity
- Multi-ROI approach: Increases robustness by capturing multiple disease signatures but adds computational overhead

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor ROI selection leading to missed disease markers
- Token compression losing critical discriminative features
- Inconsistent fusion when ROIs contain conflicting information
- Overfitting to the specific dataset when contrastive learning is insufficient

**3 First Experiments**
1. Test ROI extraction quality by visualizing extracted regions against ground truth anatomical landmarks
2. Evaluate token compression by measuring information retention through reconstruction experiments
3. Assess fusion mechanism by analyzing classification performance when individual ROIs are processed separately versus fused

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method relies on specific imaging modalities (QSM and NM-MRI) which may limit generalizability to other Parkinson's disease imaging protocols
- Performance is validated on a single challenge dataset without independent external validation, raising questions about real-world applicability
- Computational complexity of processing multiple ROIs through 2D VFMs and token fusion is not discussed, potentially impacting clinical deployment feasibility

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The challenge results and technical implementation details are verifiable through the published work
- **Medium confidence**: The claimed advantages of using 2D VFMs for limited 3D data are plausible but require further validation across diverse datasets
- **Low confidence**: Real-world clinical performance and generalization to different populations remain unproven

## Next Checks
1. Validate MRN performance on independent Parkinson's disease cohorts from multiple institutions with different imaging protocols
2. Conduct head-to-head comparison with clinical expert diagnosis and established diagnostic tools on the same dataset
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (2D VFM processing, token compression, contrastive learning) to overall performance
