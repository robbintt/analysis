- Addresses recommendation unlearning in GNN-based recommender systems with selective forgetting capabilities

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces UnlearnRec, a framework for recommendation unlearning that enables selective forgetting of user interactions in Graph Neural Network-based recommender systems without complete retraining. The framework employs a pre-training paradigm with an Influence Encoder that predicts how unlearning requests affect GNN embeddings, achieving both privacy compliance and computational efficiency. UnlearnRec demonstrates effectiveness across three benchmark datasets, providing over 10x speedup compared to retraining while maintaining model utility and requiring comparable GPU memory to partition-based methods.

## Method Summary
UnlearnRec introduces a novel pre-training approach where the Influence Encoder is trained to predict the impact of unlearning requests on GNN embeddings before any actual unlearning occurs. This allows the system to efficiently update the model when unlearning requests arrive, avoiding expensive full retraining cycles. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic, working with various GNN architectures, and particularly addresses limitations of traditional unlearning methods when applied to advanced self-supervised learning-based GNNs. The pre-training phase learns influence patterns that enable rapid adaptation when specific user interactions need to be forgotten for privacy or regulatory reasons.

## Key Results
- Achieves MI-BF and MI-NG values above 1 across Movielens-1M, Gowalla, and Yelp2018 datasets, indicating effective removal of learned interactions while maintaining utility
- Provides more than 10x speedup compared to retraining approaches for unlearning operations
- GPU memory usage comparable to partition-based methods with significantly faster processing time than existing techniques

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
UnlearnRec works by pre-training an Influence Encoder to learn the relationship between unlearning requests and their impact on GNN embeddings. This pre-trained knowledge allows the system to efficiently adjust the model when unlearning requests occur, without needing to retrain the entire model. The influence prediction mechanism identifies how removing specific user interactions propagates through the graph structure and affects recommendations, enabling targeted updates that maintain overall model performance while ensuring compliance with privacy requirements.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** - Why needed: Form the backbone of modern recommender systems that UnlearnRec aims to support. Quick check: Can propagate node information through graph structures for recommendation tasks.

**Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in GNNs** - Why needed: Many modern GNNs use SSL techniques that make traditional unlearning methods less effective. Quick check: Can identify limitations of existing unlearning approaches on SSL-based models.

**Influence Functions** - Why needed: Core concept for predicting how unlearning requests affect model parameters and predictions. Quick check: Can quantify the impact of removing specific training samples on model behavior.

**Recommendation Unlearning** - Why needed: Addresses privacy and regulatory requirements for selective forgetting in recommender systems. Quick check: Can distinguish between complete retraining and selective forgetting approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Pre-training Module -> Influence Encoder -> GNN Model -> Unlearning Request Handler -> Updated Model

Critical path: Unlearning request arrives → Influence Encoder predicts impact → Model parameters updated → Recommendations regenerated

Design tradeoffs: Prioritizes computational efficiency over complete retraining, accepting approximation in influence prediction for speed gains

Failure signatures: Poor influence prediction accuracy leads to incomplete unlearning or excessive utility loss; model-agnostic claims may not hold for all GNN variants

First experiments:
1. Benchmark unlearning effectiveness on Movielens-1M with varying request patterns
2. Compare inference time with baseline retraining approaches
3. Stress test influence prediction accuracy on influential nodes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation metrics measure only immediate effectiveness rather than long-term stability or adversarial robustness
- Influence prediction mechanism may not capture real-world scenarios with unpredictable unlearning requests
- Model-agnostic claims lack validation across the full spectrum of GNN architectures, particularly attention-based and hypergraph variants

## Confidence

**High confidence** in pre-training efficiency and computational benefits
**Medium confidence** in influence prediction accuracy and unlearning effectiveness
**Medium confidence** in model-agnostic generalization
**Low confidence** in long-term stability and adversarial robustness claims

## Next Checks

1. Conduct adversarial testing with targeted unlearning requests on influential nodes to assess robustness of the influence prediction mechanism under stress conditions.

2. Perform longitudinal evaluation tracking unlearning effectiveness over multiple sequential requests and extended time periods to identify potential degradation patterns.

3. Expand validation to include diverse GNN architectures beyond GraphSAIL and PinSage, particularly testing on attention-based and hypergraph GNN variants.
