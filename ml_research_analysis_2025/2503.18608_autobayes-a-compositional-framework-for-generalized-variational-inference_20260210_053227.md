core_contribution: The paper introduces AutoBayes, a compositional framework for generalized
  variational inference that clarifies the different parts of a probabilistic model,
  how they interact, and how they compose. The key insight is that both exact Bayesian
  inference and loss functions used in variational inference satisfy chain rules similar
  to reverse-mode automatic differentiation, enabling compositional construction and
  optimization of models.

# AutoBayes: A Compositional Framework for Generalized Variational Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.18608
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18608
- Reference count: 7
- Introduces compositional framework for generalized variational inference

## Executive Summary
AutoBayes presents a compositional framework for generalized variational inference that clarifies how probabilistic models interact and compose. The framework introduces open models, Bayesian lenses, and statistical games as composable components, enabling automatic construction of loss functions for complex models without manual derivation. By leveraging chain rules similar to reverse-mode automatic differentiation, AutoBayes provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for building and optimizing probabilistic models in a modular way.

## Method Summary
The framework introduces open models (directed probabilistic models with separate observed/unobserved/latent spaces), Bayesian lenses (models paired with local inversions), and statistical games (lenses equipped with energy and entropy terms). These components compose according to a chain rule, allowing complex models to be built from simpler parts without manually deriving loss functions. The authors demonstrate how this compositional structure enables automatic construction of loss functions for complex models, separation of model specification from optimization, and support for dependent types. Parameterized statistical games can be optimized compositionally, though with some technical challenges around gradient computation.

## Key Results
- Framework introduces open models, Bayesian lenses, and statistical games that compose according to chain rules
- Enables automatic construction of loss functions for complex models without manual derivation
- Supports dependent types and separates model specification from optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by recognizing that both exact Bayesian inference and loss functions used in variational inference satisfy chain rules similar to reverse-mode automatic differentiation. This insight allows models to be composed modularly, with the loss function automatically derived from the composition of components. The separation of observed/unobserved/latent spaces in open models, combined with local inversions in Bayesian lenses, creates a compositional structure that mirrors the chain rule of probability distributions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Open models**: Directed probabilistic models with explicit separation of observed, unobserved, and latent spaces - needed to clarify model boundaries for composition
- **Bayesian lenses**: Models paired with local inversions - needed to enable bidirectional reasoning in composed models
- **Statistical games**: Lenses equipped with energy and entropy terms - needed to define the optimization objectives
- **Chain rule composition**: The mathematical principle enabling modular construction - needed to automatically derive loss functions from component parts
- **Dependent types**: Support for variables with varying types across model components - needed for flexible model specification
- **Parameterized statistical games**: Games with optimizable parameters - needed for practical model training

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Open models -> Bayesian lenses -> Statistical games -> Composed models
**Critical path**: Model specification → Lens construction → Game definition → Composition → Optimization
**Design tradeoffs**: Modularity vs. computational efficiency; theoretical elegance vs. practical implementation complexity
**Failure signatures**: Gradient computation issues in composed models; type mismatches in dependent type handling
**First experiments**:
1. Compose two simple statistical games to verify automatic loss function construction
2. Test dependent type support with a model having different observed variable types
3. Benchmark the framework on a hierarchical Bayesian model against manual implementation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Assumes familiarity with advanced variational inference and category theory concepts
- Practical implementation details for complex models with dependent types need further elaboration
- Technical challenges around gradient computation in composed models remain unresolved

## Confidence
- Core compositional framework claims: Medium
- Practical implementation details and scalability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Implement and benchmark the framework on a non-trivial probabilistic model (e.g., hierarchical Bayesian model) to evaluate practical utility
2. Test the dependent type support with concrete examples showing how the framework handles different observed variable types
3. Validate the compositional gradient computation approach on a simple chain of statistical games to verify the claimed automatic loss function construction
