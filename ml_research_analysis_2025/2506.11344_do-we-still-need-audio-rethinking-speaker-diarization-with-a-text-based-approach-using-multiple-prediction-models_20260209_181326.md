# Do We Still Need Audio? Rethinking Speaker Diarization with a Text-Based Approach Using Multiple Prediction Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.11344
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11344
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Text-based speaker diarization using T5-3B achieves 4.9% WDER for short dialogues, outperforming audio-based systems in this regime

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a text-based approach to speaker diarization that operates solely on dialogue transcripts, bypassing audio-based challenges like poor quality or speaker similarity. The method employs two models: a Single Prediction Model (SPM) that evaluates speaker changes between sentences, and a Multiple Prediction Model (SPM) that aggregates predictions over sliding windows for enhanced robustness. Both models use T5-3B and operate on the premise that LLM-based semantic understanding can identify speaker changes through conversational role and linguistic pattern recognition. Evaluated on a curated dataset with 2-speaker conversations, the MPM achieved 4.9% WDER for short dialogues and 11.4% for longer ones, outperforming audio-based systems in short conversations. The approach highlights the potential of leveraging linguistic features and semantic understanding for speaker diarization, offering a promising alternative to traditional audio-based methods. Limitations include reliance on accurate ASR transcripts and performance degradation in longer, complex dialogues.

## Method Summary
The paper reframes speaker diarization as sentence-level binary classification (speaker change: yes/no) using only text transcripts. Two T5-3B models are employed: SPM predicts speaker changes between consecutive sentences using single context windows, while MPM aggregates predictions across multiple overlapping sliding windows using majority voting. The approach processes ASR-generated transcripts (Whisper → GPT-4 punctuation correction → spaCy segmentation) into training examples where each sentence boundary is labeled as a speaker change or not. Context windows of 4-8 sentences are tested, with MPM showing superior performance by correcting 40.9% of individual prediction errors through aggregation. The method achieves 4.9% WDER for short dialogues (≤15 min) and 11.4% for longer ones, demonstrating that text-based diarization can be competitive with audio-based approaches under favorable conditions.

## Key Results
- MPM achieved 4.9% WDER for short dialogues (≤15 min) and 11.4% for longer ones (>15 min)
- Aggregation corrects 40.9% of individual prediction errors through majority voting across overlapping windows
- WDER-S (sentence-weighted) decreases from 27.7% to 10.4% as context window increases from 4 to 8 sentences
- SPM baseline shows 31.2% WDER, demonstrating significant improvement from MPM's aggregation strategy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multiple overlapping predictions aggregated via majority voting correct individual prediction errors. MPM generates predictions for the same speaker-change boundary from multiple sliding windows with different contexts. When predictions disagree, aggregation (majority vote) resolves conflicts. The paper reports 40.9% of predictions that were incorrect in at least one window were corrected through aggregation. Errors are context-dependent and not systematic across all windows; correct predictions cluster. Break condition: When errors are systematic across all windows (consistently incorrect at 41.1%), aggregation provides no benefit. Long dialogues may suffer from context dilution where windows lack sufficient discriminative information.

### Mechanism 2
LLM-based semantic understanding identifies speaker changes through conversational role and linguistic pattern recognition. T5-3B processes concatenated sentence sequences and learns to detect turn-taking cues—lexical variety, semantic shifts, conversational structure—that indicate speaker transitions. The model implicitly learns: (a) response patterns, (b) topic continuity/discontinuity, (c) discourse markers. Speaker identity correlates with detectable linguistic signatures in dialogue transcripts. Break condition: When (a) sentences lack sufficient semantic content (short responses like "Wow."), (b) speakers share similar linguistic patterns (similar roles/ages), or (c) ASR errors corrupt linguistic signals. Examples in Appendix A.3 show these exact failure modes.

### Mechanism 3
Longer input context provides more discriminative information for speaker change detection. Increasing the number of sentences in each prediction window (4 → 6 → 8) gives the model broader conversational context. WDER-S decreases from 27.7% to 10.4% as context expands (Table 2). Speaker patterns manifest over multi-sentence spans; context captures discourse-level regularities. Break condition: T5-3B has input length limits (hence experiments capped at 8 sentences); very long dialogues show performance degradation (11.4% WDER >15 min vs. 4.9% ≤15 min), suggesting context management challenges at scale.

## Foundational Learning

- **Speaker Diarization (SD) task formulation**: The paper reframes SD as sentence-level binary classification (speaker change: yes/no) rather than traditional clustering of audio embeddings. Understanding this task transformation is essential.
  - Quick check: Given consecutive sentences s3 and s4, what does the model predict, and how does this differ from audio-based clustering approaches?

- **Aggregation over overlapping predictions**: MPM's improvement over SPM depends entirely on understanding how multiple predictions for the same boundary are combined. Without this, the 40.9% error correction rate is opaque.
  - Quick check: If 5 overlapping windows predict [1,0,0,1,0] for a boundary (1=change, 0=no change), what is the aggregated output under majority voting?

- **WDER vs. WDER-S metrics**: The paper introduces WDER-S (sentence-weighted) to account for conversation length. Standard WDER can be misleading for mixed-length datasets.
  - Quick check: Why would a model performing well on many short conversations show different WDER vs. WDER-S scores?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
Input: Dialogue transcript (ASR-generated)
      ↓
[Sentence Segmentation] ← spaCy
      ↓
[Context Window Construction] (h front + k back per boundary)
      ↓
[T5-3B Encoder-Decoder] ← Binary classification head
      ↓
[SPM: Single predictions per boundary]
      OR
[MPM: Multiple window predictions → Aggregation layer (majority vote)]
      ↓
Output: Speaker change labels {0,1} per sentence pair
      ↓
[Post-processing] → Speaker sequence derivation

- **Critical path**:
  1. **Data pipeline quality**: ASR accuracy (Whisper) → Punctuation correction (GPT-4) → Sentence segmentation (spaCy) → Ground truth alignment (align4d). Errors cascade: ASR hallucinations, missing punctuation, or segmentation errors directly degrade model input.
  2. **Context window configuration**: h and k values determine how much context surrounds each prediction point. Paper experiments with 4/6/8 total sentences.
  3. **Aggregation implementation**: Majority voting across overlapping windows must correctly track which predictions correspond to the same boundary.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **SPM vs. MPM**: SPM is simpler and faster (single pass), but MPM provides ~26% absolute WDER improvement on short dialogues (31.2% → 4.9%) at the cost of multiple forward passes.
  - **Context length vs. input limits**: Longer context improves performance but hits T5-3B input constraints; the paper caps at 8 sentences.
  - **Text-only vs. multimodal**: Eliminates audio-quality issues but introduces ASR-dependency and struggles with speakers having similar linguistic patterns.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Short sentences**: High error rate when utterances lack semantic content (e.g., "Wow.", "What?")
  - **Similar speaker roles**: Teenagers, colleagues in same role—convergent speech patterns reduce discriminability
  - **ASR grammatical errors**: "How things with you busy?" → Model mispredicts speaker boundary
  - **Long dialogues**: WDER degrades from 4.9% (≤15 min) to 11.4% (>15 min); model loses coherence over extended context
  - **Consistent errors**: 41.1% of errors are not corrected by aggregation—they're systematic across all windows

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Reproduce SPM baseline**: Implement single-prediction model with 8-sentence context on a 2-speaker subset. Verify WDER ~38% matches paper before proceeding to MPM.
  2. **Ablate aggregation**: Run MPM with different aggregation strategies (majority vote, weighted average by confidence, max-confidence) to understand if 40.9% correction rate is aggregation-method dependent.
  3. **Stress-test with ASR noise**: Inject synthetic ASR errors (word deletion, substitution, hallucination) at controlled rates to quantify degradation curve and identify error-tolerance thresholds for deployment decisions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can text-based speaker diarization approaches be effectively extended to multi-party conversations with more than two speakers while maintaining accuracy? The conclusion states: "As we look forward to expanding this work to multi-party dialogues," and Appendix A.4 provides a theoretical extension framework without empirical validation. All experiments were conducted exclusively on 2-speaker conversations; the multi-speaker formulation is proposed mathematically but not tested. Empirical evaluation of MPM on datasets with 3+ speakers, comparing WDER against audio-based baselines across varying speaker counts would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What mechanisms can mitigate the performance degradation of text-based diarization in longer, complex dialogues? The limitations section notes "their performance degrades as conversation length and complexity increase. The models struggle with maintaining context over long dialogues." The paper shows WDER increases from 4.9% (≤15 min) to 11.4% (>15 min); no solution for context maintenance is proposed. Comparison of context-handling architectures (e.g., hierarchical attention, memory networks) on long-dialogue benchmarks showing improved WDER-S would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How robust is the text-based approach to ASR errors in noisy acoustic environments compared to audio-based methods? The limitations state: "The effectiveness... heavily relies on the accuracy of ASR-generated transcripts. Mis-recognitions, omissions, or errors... can significantly affect diarization performance, particularly in noisy or challenging acoustic environments." While the training data simulates ASR discrepancies via alignment, systematic evaluation under varying noise levels and ASR error rates is not conducted. Controlled experiments with synthetic ASR errors at varying word error rates (WER) and comparisons with audio-based systems under matched noisy conditions would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The approach requires high-quality ASR transcripts; performance degrades significantly with ASR errors, which the paper acknowledges but doesn't quantify systematically across different ASR systems
- Only evaluated on 2-speaker conversations from curated datasets; generalization to multi-speaker scenarios (3+ speakers) remains unproven
- T5-3B's input length constraints limit context to ~8 sentences, potentially missing long-range speaker patterns in extended dialogues

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The aggregation mechanism's error correction capability (40.9% rate), the performance advantage of MPM over SPM on short dialogues (4.9% vs 31.2% WDER), and the identification of specific failure modes (short sentences, similar speaker roles)
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about LLM-based semantic understanding being the primary driver of success, as the paper doesn't provide ablation studies isolating semantic features from other factors
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability to real-world scenarios with diverse speaker counts, audio qualities, and conversation lengths beyond the curated dataset

## Next Checks
1. Test the MPM's aggregation mechanism with different voting strategies (weighted by confidence, majority vote) to determine if the 40.9% error correction rate is aggregation-method dependent
2. Quantify performance degradation as a function of ASR error rate by injecting synthetic errors at controlled levels to establish error-tolerance thresholds
3. Evaluate on multi-speaker datasets (3+ speakers) to verify if the approach scales beyond the 2-speaker assumption, measuring WDER degradation with increasing speaker count
