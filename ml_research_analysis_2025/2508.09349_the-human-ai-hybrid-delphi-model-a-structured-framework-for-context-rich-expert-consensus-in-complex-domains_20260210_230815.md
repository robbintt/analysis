## Executive Summary
This study introduces a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi (HAH-Delphi) framework that integrates generative AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro) with small senior expert panels to improve expert consensus development in complex domains. The AI replicated 95% of published consensus outcomes and achieved 95% directional alignment with human experts, though it lacked experiential nuance. Compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus coverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The model demonstrated methodological transparency, enhanced interpretive depth, and scalability across health, coaching, and performance science domains. It offers a structured, generalisable approach for generating context-sensitive, actionable consensus in settings where evidence is complex or conditional.

## Method Summary
The HAH-Delphi framework combines AI-generated consensus with expert panel validation through three phases. Phase I retrospectively evaluated AI against six published consensus studies using a constrained public corpus with strict cutoff dates. Phase II prospectively tested the model on a 20-item insomnia questionnaire with six senior experts. Phase III applied the framework to 143-item Endurance and 159-item Resistance training questionnaires. The AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro) was restricted to open-access evidence only, while expert panels provided Likert ratings and free-text justifications. Consensus was classified into four tiers (Strong, Conditional, Operational, Divergent) based on manual coding of justifications into seven reasoning themes (Conditional, Experiential, Pragmatic, etc.). The model's effectiveness was measured through directional alignment, consensus coverage, and thematic saturation analysis.

## Key Results
- AI achieved 95% directional alignment with human expert consensus across all test domains
- Six-expert panels reached >90% consensus coverage with thematic saturation by participant 5-6
- AI replicated 95% of published consensus outcomes when constrained to appropriate evidence corpus
- The framework demonstrated scalability across health, coaching, and performance science applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The HAH-Delphi model succeeds by combining AI's systematic literature synthesis with human experts' contextual judgment and experiential knowledge. The AI rapidly processes and synthesizes large volumes of public evidence while maintaining strict temporal constraints, providing a comprehensive baseline consensus. Human experts then apply their domain-specific experience, practical constraints, and nuanced reasoning to refine and validate these outputs. This hybrid approach addresses the traditional Delphi method's limitations of being time-intensive and potentially consensus-driven by incorporating AI's efficiency while preserving human interpretive depth. The compact panel design achieves efficiency without sacrificing validity, as thematic saturation occurs before the final participant, suggesting diminishing returns beyond six experts.

## Foundational Learning
**Corpus Constraint Enforcement**: AI must be restricted to specific time-bound public evidence to prevent data leakage and ensure fair comparison with historical consensus. *Why needed*: Without strict constraints, AI could access newer information giving unfair advantage. *Quick check*: Audit AI citations against cutoff dates and paywall status.
**Expert Panel Saturation**: Small panels (n=6) can achieve thematic saturation efficiently without requiring larger groups. *Why needed*: Traditional Delphi uses 10-20 experts, creating unnecessary burden. *Quick check*: Track introduction of new reasoning themes across participants.
**Justification Coding Framework**: Manual classification of AI and human responses into seven reasoning themes enables systematic comparison. *Why needed*: Quantitative alignment alone misses qualitative differences in reasoning quality. *Quick check*: Verify consistent application of coding framework across all responses.
**Consensus Tier Classification**: Four-tier system (Strong, Conditional, Operational, Divergent) captures nuanced agreement levels beyond simple majority. *Why needed*: Complex domains require recognition of conditional or operational agreements. *Quick check*: Test inter-rater reliability on consensus tier assignments.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Corpus Construction -> AI Synthesis -> Expert Panel Validation -> Thematic Analysis -> Consensus Classification

**Critical Path**: The most time-sensitive sequence is Corpus Construction → AI Synthesis → Expert Panel Validation. Corpus must be built before AI can generate outputs, and expert panels must complete validation before thematic analysis can occur. Any delay in corpus preparation or expert recruitment directly impacts the entire timeline.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Compact panels (n=6) offer efficiency but may miss minority perspectives compared to larger traditional panels. AI constraints ensure fair comparison but limit access to potentially relevant post-cutoff evidence. Manual coding provides nuance but introduces facilitator subjectivity. The tradeoff favors methodological transparency and practical efficiency over comprehensiveness.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- High AI-human alignment but zero "Experiential" tags indicates shallow consensus (surface agreement without shared reasoning)
- Panel fails to reach saturation by participant 6 suggests insufficient question discriminative power or homogeneous expert selection
- AI cites post-cutoff or paywalled sources indicates corpus constraint failure
- Low inter-rater reliability on consensus tiers reveals facilitator subjectivity problems

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Construct a validated open-access corpus with strict cutoff date for a target consensus study
2. Run AI synthesis and recruit six senior experts to complete identical questionnaire
3. Perform thematic coding and calculate directional alignment between AI and expert responses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Facilitator Independence**: Can the HAH-Delphi model maintain reliability and consistency when deployed with multiple facilitators of varying expertise? The study relied on a single senior facilitator, introducing dependency on individual interpretive skills and potential bias that masks variability across different facilitators.

**Ethical Domain Applicability**: Does the HAH-Delphi framework function effectively in ethically charged or interdisciplinary domains where empirical evidence is insufficient? The current validation focused on applied health and performance science domains grounded in physiological principles, not complex areas involving value trade-offs or sparse data.

**Implementation Impact**: Do HAH-Delphi-derived consensus statements result in lower implementation ambiguity and higher practitioner uptake than traditional Delphi methods? The study focused on methodological validity but did not assess downstream impact, clarity, or adoption rates of resulting guidelines.

## Limitations
The technical implementation of corpus constraints on the AI system remains unspecified, creating a critical reproducibility gap for verifying the 95% alignment claim. The facilitator's role in adjudicating nuanced consensus classifications introduces subjectivity lacking transparent inter-rater reliability documentation. The compact panel design (n=6) raises questions about external validity due to underspecified expert selection criteria and potential homogeneity effects.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Directional alignment metrics (95% AI-expert alignment) and saturation findings (thematic saturation by participant 5-6) are methodologically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Consensus coverage (>90%) and practical utility across health, coaching, and performance domains
- **Low Confidence**: Absolute prevention of AI data leakage and precise replication of facilitator adjudication decisions

## Next Checks
1. Implement systematic citation audit comparing AI-generated justifications against predefined corpus to flag any references outside specified time bounds or paywalled sources
2. Replicate panel study with heterogeneous expert pool (varying experience levels, institutions, geographic locations) to test saturation pattern under less homogeneous conditions
3. Conduct blinded classification exercise where multiple independent raters apply four-tier consensus framework to same qualitative data, measuring inter-rater reliability
