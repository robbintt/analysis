# Generalized Kernelized Bandits: A Novel Self-Normalized Bernstein-Like Dimension-Free Inequality and Regret Bounds

## Quick Facts

- Introduces generalized kernelized bandits (GKBs) unifying kernelized bandits and generalized linear bandits with novel self-normalized concentration inequality

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the novel setting of generalized kernelized bandits (GKBs), unifying kernelized bandits (KBs) and generalized linear bandits (GLBs). In GKBs, the expected reward function f* belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and the reward model follows an exponential family (EF) distribution whose mean is a non-linear function μ(f*). The paper develops a novel Bernstein-like dimension-free self-normalized concentration inequality for martingales in Hilbert spaces, enabling regret bounds of order Õ(γT√(T/κ*)). Two algorithms are proposed: GKB-UCB with theoretical guarantees and Trac-GKB-UCB with tractable implementation.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two algorithms for regret minimization in GKBs. GKB-UCB uses a maximum likelihood estimate with a confidence set derived from the novel concentration inequality. Trac-GKB-UCB implements a tractable version using the representer theorem to reduce optimization to finite dimensions. Both algorithms leverage weighted normalization using decision-specific variances to avoid dependence on worst-case non-linearity parameters. The key technical contribution is a self-normalized Bernstein-like inequality that achieves dimension-free concentration through Fredholm determinant analysis of trace-class operators.

## Key Results
- Develops novel Bernstein-like dimension-free self-normalized concentration inequality for martingales in Hilbert spaces
- Achieves regret bound Õ(γT√(T/κ*)) for GKB-UCB, matching state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs
- Proposes Trac-GKB-UCB with tractable O(T²) implementation and similar regret guarantees
- Demonstrates how weighted normalization removes dependence on worst-case non-linearity index κX

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Variance-weighted normalization removes dependence on worst-case non-linearity index κX while preserving tight bounds on κ*
- **Mechanism:** The weighted covariance operator eVt(λ; f*) = Σₛ g(τ)⁻¹μ̇(f(xs))ϕ(xs)ϕ(xs)⊤ + λI incorporates decision-specific variances directly into the normalization. By using μ̇(f*(xs)) as weights, the concentration inequality adapts to local variance rather than assuming uniform bound, converting a multiplicative κX penalty into a controlled sum over the actual path.
- **Core assumption:** The variance structure μ̇(f(x)) correctly characterizes the noise heterogeneity across decisions (Assumption 3.3 bounded noise, Assumption 3.4 self-concordance).
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract], [Section 5.1, pp. 8-10], [corpus: Neural Logistic Bandits]

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Dimension-free concentration is achieved by replacing explicit dimension d with maximal information gain γT through the log-determinant of the weighted covariance operator.
- **Mechanism:** The Fredholm determinant det(λ⁻¹eVt(λ)) for trace-class operators in Hilbert spaces equals the matrix determinant det(λ⁻¹eKt(λ)) via Equation (1). This equivalence allows expressing concentration bounds using eΓt(f) = ½ log det(λ⁻¹eKt(λ)), which captures effective dimensionality through the spectrum decay without explicit d dependence.
- **Core assumption:** The covariance operator Vt is trace-class (guaranteed by Assumption 3.2 bounded kernel: k(x,x) ≤ K²).
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 5.2, Theorem 5.1], [Section 4, Equation 1], [corpus: A variational approach to dimension-free self-normalized concentration]

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Generalized self-concordance enables decomposition of regret into permanent term O(γT√(T/κ*)) and transient term that depends only logarithmically on T.
- **Mechanism:** The self-concordance property |μ̈(f(x))| ≤ Rs μ̇(f(x)) bounds the curvature of the link function relative to its slope. This allows Taylor expansion of regret with controlled second-order terms (R2(T) in proof), ensuring the dominant regret comes from R1(T) which scales with κ* rather than κX.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption 3.4 holds with finite Rs; for bounded rewards |y| ≤ Y, Rs = Y automatically.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Theorem 6.2, pp. 24-26], [Appendix C, Lemma C.1-C.2], [corpus: Vector-valued self-normalized concentration]

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**
  - **Why needed here:** GKBs assume f* ∈ H where H is an RKHS. The reproducing property f(x) = ⟨f, k(·,x)⟩ enables finite computation with infinite-dimensional functions.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the kernel trick allows optimization in potentially infinite-dimensional spaces without explicit computation in that space?

- **Concept: Exponential Family Distributions**
  - **Why needed here:** The reward model p(y|x; f) follows canonical exponential family form with log-partition m and inverse link μ = m'. Understanding the variance structure Var[y|x; f] = g(τ)⁻¹μ̇(f(x)) is essential for weighted normalization.
  - **Quick check question:** For a logistic bandit (Bernoulli rewards), what is the inverse link function μ and its derivative μ̇?

- **Concept: Self-Normalized Martingale Concentration**
  - **Why needed here:** The key technical contribution is controlling ‖St‖_{eV⁻¹t(λ)} where St = Σ ϵsϕ(xs) is a martingale in Hilbert space. Understanding why standard Hoeffding/Bernstein bounds fail in this setting motivates the new inequality.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does self-normalization by eVt(λ) provide tighter bounds than normalization by a fixed constant?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  ```
  Decision Loop (Trac-GKB-UCB):
  1. Tractable ML Estimation
  2. Confidence Radius Computation
  3. Optimistic Decision Selection
  4. Observe reward yₜ, update state
  ```

- **Critical path:** The optimistic decision selection (step 3) requires solving a constrained convex program for each candidate action. This is the computational bottleneck. The representer theorem restricts α ∈ R^{t-1}, making optimization finite-dimensional despite infinite RKHS.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Confidence set choice:** Ct(δ) (Equation 8) is tighter but intractable; Dt(δ) (Equation 22) is looser but computable. Paper shows regret order is preserved.
  - **Discretization of X:** For continuous X, discretization is required. Error depends on kernel regularity (see Rando et al., 2022 reference).
  - **Regularization λ:** Must satisfy λ ≥ Ω(K²) for clean bounds; larger λ reduces dependence on kernel norms but may slow convergence.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Exploding confidence radius:** If Γₜ grows faster than O(log t), check kernel choice—some kernels (e.g., linear) have γₜ = O(d log t), others (e.g., squared exponential) have γₜ = O((log t)^{d+1})
  - **Numerical instability in Kₜ⁻¹(λ):** Kernel matrix may become ill-conditioned; ensure λ is large enough or use Cholesky decomposition with regularization
  - **Constraint violation in step 3:** If Lₜ(α̂t) + Dₜ(δ) is infeasible, the confidence radius may be incorrectly computed (check δ, ρₜ values)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity check on synthetic KB (μ = identity):** Verify Trac-GKB-UCB recovers GP-UCB behavior on a known benchmark (e.g., Branin function with Gaussian noise). Compare regret against Õ(γT√T) bound.
  2. **GLB validation on logistic bandit:** Use d-dimensional linear kernel with Bernoulli rewards. Verify κ* scaling by comparing two instances with different μ̇(f*(x*)) values at optimum. Expected: regret ratio ≈ √(κ₁*/κ₂*).
  3. **Full GKB stress test:** Non-linear kernel (e.g., Matérn-2.5) with logistic link. Measure actual vs. predicted confidence set calibration: over T=5000 rounds, count how often f*(xₜ) falls outside the constructed interval (should be ≤ δ). Monitor computational cost of step 3 per round.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the multiplicative dependence on the norm and kernel bounds $(1 + R_s B K)$ be removed from the regret upper bound of GKB-UCB?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states: "Future works include investigating the use of the techniques from Lee et al. (2024) to remove the multiplicative dependence on the norm and kernel bounds $(1 + R_s B K)$ in the regret bound."
- **Why unresolved:** Current self-normalized bounds introduce this dependence, and adapting the techniques from Lee et al. (2024) used for GLBs to the GKB setting is described as non-trivial.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A regret analysis of GKB-UCB (or a variant) showing a rate of $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$ that does not scale with the product of the self-concordance constant $R_s$, the norm bound $B$, and the kernel bound $K$.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the regret lower bounds for the Generalized Kernelized Bandit setting?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion lists "the study of the inherent complexity of regret minimization in the GLB setting by conceiving regret lower bounds (Scarlett et al., 2017)" as future work.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper establishes upper bounds but does not provide a corresponding theoretical limit (lower bound) to certify the optimality of the proposed algorithms.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical derivation proving a lower bound on the regret that matches the $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$ upper bound, potentially restricting the action set or kernel class.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the leading multiplicative constant (currently $\sqrt{73}$) in the novel self-normalized inequality be tightened?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 5.2 compares the proposed constant of $\sqrt{73}$ to the tighter $\sqrt{6}$ achieved in concurrent work by Akhavan et al. (2025), noting the trade-offs in normalization techniques.
- **Why unresolved:** The derivation relies on a specific stitching argument and Freedman's inequality which resulted in larger constants than the method of mixtures used in concurrent works.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A revised proof of Theorem 5.1 that achieves a leading constant closer to $\sqrt{6}$ while maintaining the dimension-free and variance-weighted properties essential for the GKB analysis.

## Limitations

- **No experimental validation:** The paper lacks experimental section, making practical performance unclear
- **O(T²) computational complexity:** Trac-GKB-UCB's quadratic time and space complexity may limit scalability for large T
- **Discretization details missing:** Ad hoc discretization scheme for continuous decision sets X is not fully specified

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The mathematical derivation of the novel Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality (Theorem 5.1) appears sound based on the Fredholm determinant framework and self-concordance analysis.
- **Medium confidence:** The regret bound analysis (Theorem 6.2) follows logically from the concentration inequality, but practical tightness depends on unknown constants.
- **Low confidence:** The tractability claims for Trac-GKB-UCB are theoretically supported but unproven in practice without experiments.

## Next Checks

1. Implement Trac-GKB-UCB on a simple logistic bandit with known optimal solution to verify κ* scaling empirically.
2. Test the dimension-free property by comparing regret growth across kernels with different effective dimensions (linear vs. RBF).
3. Validate the weighted normalization by comparing performance with and without the variance weighting (eVt vs. Vt normalization).
