# The Hidden Costs of Translation Accuracy: Distillation, Quantization, and Environmental Impact

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.23990
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23990
- **Reference count**: 12
- **Key outcome**: Model compression (distillation, quantization) can substantially reduce computational demands and environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings.

## Executive Summary
This study examines the trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale, distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis revealed that the full 3.3B FP32 model, while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental footprint (~0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled 600M FP32 model reduced inference time by 71-78% and carbon emissions by 63-65% compared with the full model, with only minimal reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations further showed that even aggressive quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings.

## Method Summary
The study compares five NLLB-200 model variants: full 3.3B FP32, distilled 600M FP32, and quantized versions (FP16, INT8, INT4) of the 600M model. Models were evaluated on the Flores+ devtest split for French, Hindi, and Kannada, measuring BLEU scores, inference latency, and carbon emissions using CodeCarbon. Human evaluations were conducted on 100 conversational English sentences translated into each target language, rated for accuracy and fluency on a 1-5 scale. All experiments ran on a single 40GB A100 GPU with PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, clearing GPU memory between runs.

## Key Results
- Full 3.3B FP32 model achieved highest BLEU scores but highest environmental footprint (~0.008 kg CO2 per run)
- Distilled 600M FP32 model reduced inference time by 71-78% and carbon emissions by 63-65% with only 1-3.5 BLEU point degradation
- INT4 quantization preserved high human-perceived accuracy and fluency across all languages
- Trade-offs were more pronounced for low-resource languages, with Kannada showing 3.5 BLEU point degradation versus 1.9 for French

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Knowledge Distillation Compresses Representational Redundancy
The student model learns from the teacher's soft probability distributions rather than hard labels, capturing implicit knowledge in compressed form. Fewer parameters mean fewer floating-point operations during inference. The core assumption is that the teacher model's decision boundary can be approximated with significantly fewer parameters without catastrophic information loss. Evidence shows the distilled model achieved 71-78% inference time reduction with only 1-3.5 BLEU point loss. Break condition: Compression losses amplify for low-resource languages where teacher representations are less robust.

### Mechanism 2: Quantization Preserves Semantic Quality at Lower Precision
Reducing numerical precision from FP32 to INT4 maintains human-perceived translation quality while reducing memory and compute demands. Neural network weights contain redundant precision bits; rounding to 4-8 bits reduces memory bandwidth without destroying semantic structure. The core assumption is that learned representations are sufficiently overdetermined that precision loss introduces noise but not systematic semantic distortion. Evidence shows INT4 achieved highest Hindi accuracy (4.47) and competitive fluency across all languages. Break condition: Outlier activation channels can cause disproportionate degradation without specialized handling.

### Mechanism 3: Resource Level Moderates Compression Robustness
High-resource languages tolerate compression better than low-resource languages due to richer training signal during original model development. Models develop more robust internal representations for high-resource languages through abundant training examples. The core assumption is that pre-compression representation quality directly determines post-compression robustness. Evidence shows Kannada (low-resource) had 3.5 BLEU point degradation versus 1.9 for French (high-resource). Break condition: For extremely low-resource languages, even full models may have weak representations, making any compression risky.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the 600M student derives from the 3.3B teacher explains both efficiency gains and performance gaps.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a student model trained on soft probabilities might generalize differently than one trained on hard labels?

- **Concept: Quantization (Post-Training)**
  - Why needed here: The paper applies FP16, INT8, and INT4 quantization without retraining; understanding precision-to-performance tradeoffs is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What is the theoretical bit-width below which you would expect significant accuracy degradation for a typical transformer?

- **Concept: BLEU Score Limitations**
  - Why needed here: The paper supplements BLEU with human evaluation because BLEU captures n-gram overlap, not semantic adequacy or fluency.
  - Quick check question: Why might a translation with high BLEU still receive low human fluency ratings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: English source → NLLB-200 model (full 3.3B or distilled 600M) → Quantization (FP32/FP16/INT8/INT4) → Target language (French/Hindi/Kannada) → BLEU/human evaluation

- **Critical path**: 1) Load pretrained NLLB model (full or distilled) 2) Apply quantization transformation (if using INT8/INT4) 3) Run inference on Flores+ devtest split 4) Compute BLEU scores against references 5) Measure latency and estimate carbon emissions 6) For human eval: generate translations, collect ratings per rubric

- **Design tradeoffs**: Full model: Highest BLEU, highest cost (~0.008 kg CO₂/run); Distilled: ~65% emission reduction, 1-3.5 BLEU loss; INT4: Maximum efficiency, potential outliers in low-resource settings; Assumption: Human evaluation sample (100 sentences × 3 languages) is representative

- **Failure signatures**: BLEU drops >5 points: Likely incompatible quantization for that language pair; Human ratings <4.0: Semantic drift or fluency collapse; Disproportionate low-resource degradation: Kannada failing while French stable indicates resource-level sensitivity

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate full vs. distilled comparison on one language pair to verify inference time and BLEU gap 2) Test INT4 quantization on a new low-resource language not in the study to probe generalization limits 3) Add a mid-point quantization level (e.g., INT6 if supported) to map the precision-to-quality curve more finely

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Lifecycle Environmental Impact**: How do the environmental and quality trade-offs observed during inference compare to those during the full training and distillation lifecycle? The study restricted carbon emission measurements to inference, omitting computational costs of creating distilled models. A comprehensive lifecycle assessment measuring training and distillation phases would resolve this.

2. **Generalization Across Languages and Tasks**: Do stability and efficiency gains from quantization and distillation generalize to a broader set of languages and distinct NLP tasks? The study was limited to three languages and machine translation. Evaluation across more linguistic families and unrelated tasks would test generalization limits.

3. **Optimization for Low-Resource Languages**: Can specific optimization techniques be developed to mitigate disproportionate performance degradation observed in low-resource languages during compression? While the study identifies that distillation hurts low-resource languages more, it does not investigate algorithmic solutions. Language-aware regularization or specialized distillation loss functions could address this imbalance.

## Limitations

- **Language Sample Size**: Findings based on only three languages limit generalizability of resource-level effects
- **Quantization Configuration**: Exact quantization pipeline (library, calibration, fine-tuning) is underspecified, affecting reproducibility
- **Human Evaluation Scope**: Small sample size (100 sentences per language) and undefined rater criteria constrain robustness of qualitative findings

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Full model achieves highest BLEU scores; Distilled 600M provides substantial inference time and emission reductions; INT4 quantization preserves high human-perceived accuracy and fluency
- **Medium Confidence**: Distilled model incurs only minimal BLEU score reductions; Environmental impact per inference run is approximately 0.007-0.008 kg CO2; Model compression can substantially reduce computational demands while maintaining competitive quality
- **Low Confidence**: Trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings (based on three-language sample); INT4 quantization consistently preserves high human-rated quality across diverse language pairs (limited sample size)

## Next Checks

1. **Quantization Method Replication**: Re-run INT4 quantization using specified quantization library (e.g., bitsandbytes with explicit configuration) on an additional low-resource language not included in the original study (e.g., Swahili or Sinhala) to test generalizability.

2. **Expanded Language Resource Testing**: Extend compression-quality comparison to include at least two additional languages—one high-resource (e.g., Spanish) and one low-resource (e.g., Nepali)—to quantify the relationship between resource level and compression robustness.

3. **Human Evaluation Scaling**: Expand human evaluation sample to 300 sentences per language and report inter-rater reliability metrics (e.g., Krippendorff's alpha) to strengthen confidence in qualitative findings.
