- Primary result: Demonstrates computational equivalence between conformant planning and $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperty model checking through bidirectional reductions

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a fundamental connection between conformant planning and $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperty verification. Conformant planning seeks plans that achieve goals despite non-deterministic action effects, while hyperproperties relate multiple system executions to capture properties like information flow. The authors show these problems are computationally equivalent by providing efficient reductions in both directions. They demonstrate that conformant planning can be encoded as an $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperty over a transition system of all possible plan executions, while $\exists^*\∀^*$ formulas can be encoded as conformant planning problems where existentially quantified traces are controlled by the plan while universal traces explore all possibilities.

## Method Summary
The authors present bidirectional reductions between conformant planning and $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperty verification. For hyperproperty verification, they encode $\exists^*\∀^*$ formulas as conformant planning problems where existentially quantified traces are controlled by the plan while universal traces explore all possibilities. Conversely, they show that conformant planning itself is an $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperty over a transition system of all possible plan executions. The encodings work for both explicit-state and symbolically represented systems, with the symbolic version directly translating to STRIPS-style planning. Their prototype implementation translates PDDL planning problems to HyperLTL verification instances within seconds.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated computational equivalence between conformant planning and $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperty verification through bidirectional reductions
- Showed that conformant planning can be encoded as an $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperty over a transition system of all possible plan executions
- Presented prototype implementation that translates PDDL planning problems to HyperLTL verification instances within seconds
- Created challenging benchmarks for hyperproperty verification tools through the planning-to-verification reduction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The equivalence stems from the fundamental similarity between planning under non-determinism and verifying properties that relate multiple system executions. In conformant planning, a single plan must work for all possible outcomes of non-deterministic actions, which mirrors the universal quantification in $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperties. Conversely, when verifying $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperties, existentially quantified traces can be viewed as the controlled part of a plan while universally quantified traces represent all possible outcomes. The reductions preserve this duality by carefully encoding the control structures and state transitions in both directions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformant Planning**: Planning under uncertainty where the plan must succeed regardless of non-deterministic action effects; needed to understand the planning side of the equivalence; quick check: verify the plan works for all possible non-deterministic outcomes
- **$\exists^*\∀^*$ Hyperproperties**: Properties that relate multiple system executions with alternating existential and universal quantifiers; needed to understand the verification side of the equivalence; quick check: verify the property holds for all combinations of existential and universal traces
- **STRIPS Planning**: A planning domain representation using preconditions, effects, and goals; needed for the symbolic encoding of the reduction; quick check: verify the STRIPS representation correctly captures the original planning problem
- **Transition Systems**: Mathematical models representing system states and transitions; needed as the underlying representation for both planning and verification; quick check: verify all possible executions are captured in the transition system

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Planning Problem -> Transition System -> STRIPS Encoding -> HyperLTL Formula; HyperLTL Formula -> Transition System -> Planning Problem -> STRIPS Encoding

**Critical Path**: The reduction from conformant planning to $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperties involves: (1) constructing a transition system representing all possible plan executions, (2) encoding the planning goal as a hyperproperty over this system, (3) ensuring the plan corresponds to existential choices while non-determinism corresponds to universal quantification.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The reduction assumes finite state spaces and deterministic conformant planning formulations, trading generality for computational tractability. The symbolic encoding directly to STRIPS provides efficiency but may restrict expressiveness for complex domains with rich state representations.

**Failure Signatures**: If the reduction fails to preserve problem complexity, the resulting verification instances may be significantly harder or easier than the original planning problems. If the finite-state assumption is violated, the reduction may not terminate or may produce incorrect results for systems with infinite state spaces.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Verify that the prototype implementation correctly translates a simple PDDL planning problem with non-deterministic effects to the corresponding HyperLTL formula
2. Test the bidirectional reduction on a small planning domain with known solutions to verify equivalence
3. Measure the translation time and resulting formula size for planning problems of increasing complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The reductions assume finite state spaces, which may not capture all practical planning scenarios involving continuous or infinite state systems
- The computational complexity claims rely on the assumption that reductions preserve problem complexity classes, requiring formal verification
- The evaluation focuses primarily on translation performance rather than solving the resulting verification instances, leaving the practical utility of the approach unproven

## Confidence
- **High**: The core theoretical equivalence between conformant planning and $\exists^*\∀^*$ hyperproperties is well-established through the bidirectional reductions presented
- **Medium**: The practical utility of the reductions depends on the efficiency of underlying planning and model-checking tools, which may vary significantly across different problem instances
- **Medium**: The symbolic encoding's direct translation to STRIPS assumes certain limitations on the underlying representation, which may restrict expressiveness for complex planning domains

## Next Checks
1. Implement formal complexity analysis proving that the reductions preserve problem complexity classes, including consideration of state space explosion in both directions
2. Evaluate the approach on planning problems with continuous or infinite state spaces to assess the practical limitations of the finite-state assumption
3. Compare the performance of the prototype implementation against specialized conformant planning solvers on a benchmark suite of planning problems with varying degrees of non-determinism
