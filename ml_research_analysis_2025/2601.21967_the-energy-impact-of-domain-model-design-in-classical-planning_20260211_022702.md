# The Energy Impact of Domain Model Design in Classical Planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21967
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21967
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Redundant action arity increases energy consumption by factors of 2-12× across planners

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first systematic investigation of how domain model configuration impacts the energy consumption of classical planners. A Domain Model Configuration Framework is introduced to generate 32 domain variants per benchmark across five domains, enabling controlled variation of syntactic structure, modelling redundancy, and task design choices. Using five state-of-the-art planners, 150 configurations per domain were evaluated under consistent energy measurement conditions. Results show that syntactic variations have minimal energy impact, while redundant action arity consistently increases energy use by factors of 2-12 across planners. Task design choices produce mixed effects, with some variants causing extreme deviations up to 30-fold increases in energy. FD-based planners show high sensitivity to redundancy and dead ends, while LAPKT-based planners demonstrate greater resilience to redundancy but occasional sensitivity to action ordering. The findings demonstrate that energy efficiency in classical planning arises from structural interactions among domain configuration, planner architecture, and domain topology, establishing energy as a critical performance metric for AI planning systems.

## Method Summary
The study uses the PLANERGYM framework to evaluate energy consumption across five classical planners (FDSSA, Cerberus Agile, DALAI Agile, ANST, FBNS) on five IPC benchmark domains with 32 domain variants each. Energy is measured using Intel RAPL counters via pyRAPL at the CPU package level. Experiments run on Intel Core i7-1065G7 with 32GB RAM under Ubuntu 24.04 in containerized environments with single-core, 8GB RAM, and 5-minute timeout constraints. Each configuration is executed 30 times, with only completed runs within timeout included in analysis. The Domain Model Configuration Framework generates variants through 17 transformation mechanisms categorized as syntactic structure changes (20 variants), modelling redundancy (7 variants), and task design choices (4 variants).

## Key Results
- Redundant action arity (MRC-ROA) consistently increases energy consumption by factors of 2-12× across planners
- FD-based planners show high sensitivity to redundancy and dead-end states, while LAPKT-based planners demonstrate greater resilience to redundancy but occasional sensitivity to action ordering
- Domain topology amplifies configuration impact, with Blocks World and Barman showing high sensitivity while Gripper and Ricochet Robots maintain stability
- Energy variations range from near-zero (SSC variants) to extreme (>30×) depending on domain and planner combination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Redundant action arity (MRC-ROA) consistently increases energy consumption by factors of 2–12× across planners.
- Mechanism: Adding unused dummy parameters to action definitions expands the grounding phase—the process of converting abstract PDDL operators into concrete ground actions. More parameters increase the Cartesian product of possible action instantiations, raising memory use and search-space size even when semantics remain unchanged.
- Core assumption: The measured energy increase is primarily attributable to grounding and search expansion rather than secondary effects like cache behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "redundant action arity consistently increases energy use by factors of 2-12 across planners"
  - [section 3.2] "MRC-ROA dominates as the primary source of inefficiency, increasing mean energy consumption by roughly 2× to over 12×"
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; neighboring papers focus on energy in ML/training contexts, not planning grounding.
- Break condition: If a planner uses lazy grounding or on-demand instantiation, the effect may diminish or disappear.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Planner architecture determines which domain configurations cause energy sensitivity.
- Mechanism: FD-based planners front-load computation through aggressive grounding and preprocessing, making them sensitive to redundancy and dead-end states. LAPKT-based planners use novelty-guided search with lighter grounding, showing resilience to redundancy but sensitivity to action/effect ordering when order-dependent data structures affect heuristic evaluation.
- Core assumption: Energy differences reflect architectural design choices in grounding strategy and heuristic computation rather than implementation details.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FD-based planners show high sensitivity to redundancy and dead ends, while LAPKT-based planners demonstrate greater resilience to redundancy but occasional sensitivity to action ordering"
  - [section 4] "FD-based planners show pronounced sensitivity to redundancy and dead ends, consistent with architectures that front-load computation through grounding and preprocessing"
  - [corpus] No direct architectural comparison papers found; gap in corpus.
- Break condition: Hybrid architectures or configuration changes (e.g., switching grounding strategies) may alter sensitivity profiles.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain topology amplifies or buffers the energy impact of configuration choices.
- Mechanism: Domains with rich relational structures (e.g., Blocks World, Barman) magnify small modeling changes into disproportionate search expansions. Compact, constrained domains (e.g., Gripper, Ricochet Robots) maintain predictable energy use because their state spaces limit the impact of representational overhead.
- Core assumption: The observed domain-specific variability is intrinsic to domain structure, not artifact of benchmark selection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "Blocks World and Barman emerge as highly sensitive domains, where rich relational structures magnify modelling and task-level changes...Gripper and Ricochet Robots show exceptional stability"
  - [section 4] "TDC mechanisms thus occupy an intermediate position, sometimes increasing energy sharply and sometimes reducing it"
  - [corpus] Indirect support from planning literature; no energy-specific domain topology papers in corpus.
- Break condition: Novel domains with hybrid topologies may exhibit mixed or unpredictable sensitivity patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **PDDL Domain Models**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework manipulates PDDL syntax (predicates, actions, preconditions, effects). Without understanding domain/problem separation and action schemas, the configuration mechanisms are opaque.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why adding a dummy parameter to an action schema increases the number of ground actions?

- Concept: **Grounding in Classical Planners**
  - Why needed here: MRC-ROA's energy impact is attributed to grounding expansion. Understanding lazy vs. eager grounding is essential for predicting planner sensitivity.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between lifted (parameterized) actions and ground actions, and when does each get computed?

- Concept: **Energy Measurement Methodology (RAPL)**
  - Why needed here: The study uses Intel RAPL counters at CPU package level. Understanding what RAPL measures—and its limitations—is critical for interpreting results and replicating experiments.
  - Quick check question: Does RAPL measure total system power or CPU package power, and what components might be excluded?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Feature Identification -> Feature Taxonomy -> Transformation Principles -> Configuration Mechanisms -> 32 variants -> Planner execution -> Energy/runtime measurement

- Critical path: Original domain → Feature Identification → Feature Taxonomy classification → Apply Transformation Principles → Execute Configuration Mechanisms → Generate 32 variants → Planner execution → Energy/runtime measurement.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **SSC variants**: Low implementation cost, generally safe; useful for testing planner robustness to syntactic variation.
  - **MRC variants**: Semantics-preserving but computationally expensive; MRC-ROA is the most diagnostic for grounding sensitivity.
  - **TDC variants**: Change solution space; useful for stress-testing but may cause timeouts or unsolvable instances.

- Failure signatures:
  - **FD-based + MRC-ROA**: 2–12× energy increase, possible coverage loss (e.g., Blocks World instance failure).
  - **LAPKT-based + SSC ordering**: Near-zero or negative correlation, up to 4× energy variation in effect/action reordering.
  - **TDC-DEF in sensitive domains**: Up to 30× energy increase (Blocks World with FDSSA).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Run FDSSA and ANST on original Gripper domain to establish your own energy/runtime baselines using pyRAPL under minimal environment.
  2. **MRC-ROA sensitivity test**: Apply MRC-ROA to Gripper and measure energy delta across both planners; verify 2×+ increase for FDSSA.
  3. **Cross-domain comparison**: Run MRC-ROA on Blocks World vs. Ricochet Robots with FDSSA; confirm amplified sensitivity in Blocks World and stability in Ricochet Robots.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can static domain model properties be used to accurately estimate energy costs, thereby enabling energy-aware modelling without exhaustive empirical testing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work should develop predictive models that estimate energy costs from static domain model properties, enabling energy-aware modelling without exhaustive empirical testing."
- Why unresolved: The current study relies on empirical measurement through execution; no static analysis heuristics for energy have been formulated or validated yet.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model that analyzes PDDL syntax/features and predicts energy consumption with a high correlation to actual measured consumption across unseen domain variants.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do specific internal planning components—specifically grounding versus heuristic evaluation—drive the energy deviations observed in redundant and task-design configurations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors state that "direct measurements and attribution to specific internal components (e.g., grounding or heuristic evaluation) is beyond the scope of this study," despite observing that energy spikes are likely linked to these components.
- Why unresolved: The paper measures overall energy consumption but does not profile the energy usage of individual pipeline stages (grounding, preprocessing, search).
- What evidence would resolve it: Granular profiling data isolating the energy consumption of the grounding phase versus the search/heuristic phase for the identified high-energy configurations (e.g., MRC-ROA).

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do interactions between combined domain model choices result in non-linear or multiplicative energy effects that differ from individual configuration impacts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "studying combined design choices may reveal new results," as the current study isolated configuration mechanisms into distinct categories.
- Why unresolved: The framework tested variations in isolation (SSC, MRC, TDC); it is unknown if applying multiple transformations simultaneously creates compounding inefficiencies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying multiple transformations simultaneously (e.g., combining redundant action arity with dead-end states) and analyzing if the resulting energy consumption exceeds the additive sum of the individual effects.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Why do novelty-based search heuristics (LAPKT) and goal-directed heuristics (Fast Downward) exhibit fundamentally different energy sensitivities to action ordering and redundancy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper calls for investigation into "the differing behaviour of novelty-based versus goal-directed heuristics" and "planner-specific sensitivities."
- Why unresolved: While the paper documents the divergence (LAPKT's sensitivity to ordering vs. FD's resilience), it does not provide a verified causal explanation rooted in the algorithms' internal logic.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of data structures and memory access patterns in novelty-search algorithms versus heuristic-search algorithms when processing reordered action sets.

## Limitations

- Energy measurements rely on Intel RAPL, which captures CPU package power but excludes DRAM and GPU energy—a relevant omission for planners with heavy memory use.
- Results are based on a fixed hardware/software stack (Intel Core i7-1065G7, Ubuntu 24.04), limiting generalizability.
- Some TDC variants may render problems unsolvable, potentially biasing comparisons.
- The mechanism by which domain topology amplifies configuration impact is inferred but not directly tested.

## Confidence

- **High**: The core finding that redundant action arity (MRC-ROA) increases energy by 2-12× across planners is well-supported by systematic variation and consistent results.
- **Medium**: The architectural sensitivity claims (FD vs. LAPKT) are plausible but rely on indirect inference rather than direct profiling of planner internals.
- **Medium**: The domain topology amplification effect is observed but not formally isolated from other factors.

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce MRC-ROA energy increases on a different hardware platform (e.g., AMD or ARM) to test RAPL generalizability.
2. Profile planner memory and grounding separately (e.g., via PDDL parsing logs) to confirm energy correlates with grounding expansion.
3. Test a hybrid planner (e.g., Fast Downward with novelty-guided search) to see if architectural sensitivity profiles can be altered by configuration.
