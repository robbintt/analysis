# Question Answering under Temporal Conflict: Evaluating and Organizing Evolving Knowledge with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.07270
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07270
- **Reference count**: 16
- **Primary result**: KO framework consistently outperforms ICL and RAG baselines on temporal QA benchmarks by reducing context conflict through structured knowledge organization.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles question answering over temporally evolving knowledge where facts change and conflicting information appears across sources. The authors introduce two benchmarks—Temporal Wiki and Unified Clark—to evaluate models' ability to handle temporal conflict and knowledge drift. They show that standard approaches like in-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation struggle with temporal conflicts, often falling back to parametric knowledge or being confused by conflicting context. To address this, they propose a lightweight knowledge organization framework that incrementally builds a structured, external memory from source documents and retrieves temporally filtered information at inference time. The approach consistently outperforms baselines across both benchmarks, especially on complex reasoning tasks requiring integration of conflicting facts.

## Method Summary
The knowledge organization framework operates in three stages: (1) question decomposition into structured quadruples (Subject, Relation, Object, Timestamp) using in-context learning; (2) fact extraction from documents into timestamped tuples via another ICL prompt; (3) indexing facts in an external knowledge base keyed by Subject+Relation pairs, then retrieving matching entries at inference to answer questions using only the retrieved information. The approach disables parametric memory access to ensure grounding in provided documents. RAG baseline uses 500-character chunks with 50-character overlap, retrieves top-12 chunks using 512-dimensional embeddings, and applies Meta Prompting strategy. Models evaluated include Llama 3.1 70B, Llama 3 8B, and Mistral 7B v2.

## Key Results
- KO framework achieves 68.8% accuracy on Temporal Wiki vs. 61.6% for zero-shot and 60.2% for RAG
- On Unified Clark, KO reaches 63.1% accuracy vs. 59.4% for zero-shot and 58.2% for RAG
- KO shows largest improvements on complex reasoning tasks (20.3% gain on "latest" snapshot subset) and maintains performance across model sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Knowledge Extraction Reduces Temporal Conflict
Converting unstructured documents into timestamped quadruples improves reasoning by isolating temporally relevant facts and filtering out conflicting historical versions. The agent retrieves only entries matching the question's subject-relation pair, reducing interference from multiple fact versions in context.

### Mechanism 2: Retrieval as Context Filtering
RAG outperforms naive ICL because retrieval acts as a noise filter, limiting context to question-relevant chunks rather than full documents. This reduces exposure to irrelevant or conflicting information that degrades model performance.

### Mechanism 3: Incremental External Memory Avoids Parametric Interference
Storing facts in external structured memory reduces reliance on potentially outdated parametric knowledge. The model reasons over retrieved entries rather than its pretrained weights, shifting the reasoning source from internal to external.

## Foundational Learning

- **In-Context Learning (ICL)**: Baseline approach being compared; understanding its failure modes (context length sensitivity, answer position bias, conflict confusion) motivates the KO solution.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Intermediate baseline; understanding chunk-based retrieval explains why RAG improves on ICL but still struggles with temporal integration.
- **Knowledge Conflict in LLMs**: Core problem addressed; LLMs fall back to parametric memory when context contains conflicting evidence.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Document ingestion → Question decomposition (LLM prompt) → Fact extraction (LLM prompt) → Knowledge base (Subject+Relation keyed) → Query retrieval → Answer generation
- **Critical path**: Quadruple decomposition accuracy → Fact extraction completeness → Timestamp handling
- **Design tradeoffs**: Chunk size (500 chars) vs. retrieval count (12 chunks); structured KB vs. raw retrieval; external-only vs. hybrid reasoning
- **Failure signatures**: Questions answered correctly zero-shot but incorrectly with context; RAG outperforming ICL but still underperforming KO; performance degrading with "latest" vs. "closest" snapshot
- **First 3 experiments**: Replicate zero-shot vs. ICL vs. RAG vs. KO comparison on Temporal Wiki subset; ablate temporal filtering by removing timestamps; test retrieval count sensitivity from 4 to 16 chunks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Knowledge base updates**: How can the framework handle fact corrections and deletions in the structured knowledge base?
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: How does the approach scale to tasks requiring chaining multiple time-dependent facts?
- **Extraction error sensitivity**: How sensitive is the framework to errors propagated during the fact structuring stage?

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on accurate quadruple decomposition and fact extraction
- Assumes documents contain explicit temporal markers; accuracy degrades without them
- LLM-based evaluation consensus voting may mask subtle errors in complex reasoning tasks

## Confidence

**High confidence**: RAG outperforms ICL due to context filtering; structured knowledge extraction reduces temporal conflict when implemented correctly; incremental external memory avoids parametric interference.

**Medium confidence**: KO superiority over RAG across benchmarks depends on specific prompt engineering and retrieval hyperparameters not fully specified.

**Low confidence**: Generalizability to domains without explicit timestamps or where temporal scope is ambiguous; KO's reliance on quadruple decomposition may fail on multi-hop reasoning.

## Next Checks

1. **Extraction accuracy audit**: Log and manually validate first 50 quadruple decompositions and fact extractions from Temporal Wiki documents, measuring precision/recall against ground truth.

2. **Temporal filtering ablation**: Implement KO without temporal filtering and measure accuracy degradation on time-sensitive questions to validate temporal structure's importance.

3. **Retrieval hyperparameter sweep**: Systematically vary retrieval count (top-4 to top-16 chunks) and measure accuracy vs. context length tradeoff to identify optimal noise-signal balance.
