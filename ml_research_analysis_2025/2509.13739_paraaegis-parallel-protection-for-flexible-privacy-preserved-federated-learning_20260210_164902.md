# ParaAegis: Parallel Protection for Flexible Privacy-preserved Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13739
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13739
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Achieves 77.53% accuracy on ImageNet with improved privacy-efficiency trade-offs

## Executive Summary
ParaAegis introduces a parallel protection framework for federated learning that partitions model parameters into two groups: one protected by lightweight differential privacy (DP) and the other by homomorphic encryption (HE). This dual-protection approach addresses the inherent trade-offs between privacy, utility, and efficiency in federated learning. A voting mechanism ensures consistent parameter partitioning across clients, while a tunable partition ratio allows dynamic adaptation during training. Experimental results demonstrate that ParaAegis achieves higher accuracy and efficiency ratios compared to existing methods like DP-FedAvg and CKKS-FedAvg on ImageNet classification tasks.

## Method Summary
ParaAegis partitions model parameters into two groups: one protected by lightweight differential privacy (DP) and the other by homomorphic encryption (HE). A voting mechanism ensures consistent partitioning across clients, while a tunable partition ratio allows dynamic adaptation during training. The method provides tunable control over the privacy-utility-efficiency trade-off by adjusting the partition ratio and supports dynamic adaptation during training. Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate that ParaAegis achieves higher accuracy and efficiency ratios compared to existing methods like DP-FedAvg and CKKS-FedAvg, with classification accuracy up to 77.53% and improved efficiency ratios of 0.81-1.11 depending on the configuration.

## Key Results
- Achieves classification accuracy up to 77.53% on ImageNet
- Improves efficiency ratios to 0.81-1.11 compared to baseline methods
- Provides tunable control over privacy-utility-efficiency trade-offs through partition ratio adjustment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ParaAegis works by leveraging the complementary strengths of differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. Lightweight DP provides efficient protection for less sensitive parameters with minimal computational overhead, while HE offers stronger protection for critical parameters at higher computational cost. The voting mechanism ensures all clients maintain consistent partitioning, preventing model degradation from inconsistent updates. The tunable partition ratio allows dynamic adjustment based on training phase and performance requirements, enabling optimal trade-offs between privacy, utility, and efficiency throughout the federated learning process.

## Foundational Learning
- Differential Privacy: A mathematical framework for quantifying and limiting information leakage from individual data points. Why needed: Provides rigorous privacy guarantees while allowing useful statistical analysis. Quick check: Verify epsilon-delta values are within acceptable privacy budgets.
- Homomorphic Encryption: A cryptographic technique enabling computation on encrypted data without decryption. Why needed: Allows secure aggregation of sensitive model updates while preserving data confidentiality. Quick check: Confirm ciphertext operations maintain correctness after decryption.
- Parameter Partitioning: Strategy for dividing model parameters into groups with different protection mechanisms. Why needed: Balances computational efficiency with varying privacy requirements across model components. Quick check: Ensure partition consistency across all clients via voting mechanism.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Client models -> Parameter partition voting -> DP-protected parameters / HE-protected parameters -> Encrypted aggregation -> Global model update
- Critical Path: Local training → Partition voting → Dual protection (DP/HE) → Encrypted aggregation → Global update
- Design Tradeoffs: DP offers speed but weaker privacy; HE offers strong privacy but higher computational cost
- Failure Signatures: Inconsistent partitioning causes model divergence; HE decryption failures indicate computational errors
- First Experiments: 1) Verify parameter partitioning consistency across clients, 2) Test DP noise impact on model accuracy, 3) Validate HE encryption/decryption correctness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Performance improvements depend on specific experimental configurations that may not generalize across different datasets or model architectures
- Security analysis does not extensively evaluate robustness against adaptive or active attacks in federated settings
- Scalability to large-scale deployments with thousands of clients remains untested

## Confidence
- Claims about accuracy improvements: Medium - results are specific to ImageNet and may not transfer to other domains
- Claims about efficiency gains: Medium - depends heavily on hardware acceleration for HE operations
- Claims about privacy guarantees: High - based on established DP and HE foundations
- Claims about adaptability: Medium - limited validation across diverse training scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test ParaAegis on non-image datasets (e.g., medical or text data) to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate performance under realistic network conditions with packet loss and latency
3. Conduct extensive security analysis against gradient reconstruction and model inversion attacks
