# Simulating a Bias Mitigation Scenario in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14438
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14438
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces a causal-model-based mitigation algorithm designed to reduce bias across multiple sensitive attributes, such as gender and occupation, simultaneously in large language models.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a causal-graph-based algorithm to mitigate bias in large language models across multiple sensitive attributes. The approach identifies and intervenes in bias sources through causal modeling, generating fair training data while preserving predictive performance. Experiments on the Bias in Bios dataset demonstrate significant reductions in demographic parity and equalized odds differences while maintaining high accuracy and macro-F1 scores. Post-processing equalized odds calibration achieved the best balance between fairness and performance metrics.

## Method Summary
The paper employs BERT fine-tuning on the Bias in Bios corpus with four mitigation conditions: baseline, oversampling using RandomOverSampler, loss-weighting with class-weighted cross-entropy, and post-processing Equalized Odds calibration. The causal-model-based approach uses causal graphs to identify and intervene in bias sources, generating fair training data that preserves predictive performance. Preprocessing includes null removal, text normalization, and label mapping. Training uses AdamW optimizer with linear warmup and decay, batch size 16, and early stopping on dev macro-F1.

## Key Results
- Post-processing equalized odds calibration achieved the best fairness-accuracy trade-off (DPD 0.32-0.40, EOD 0.34-0.43)
- Causal-based fair data generation and oversampling significantly reduced demographic parity differences
- All mitigation methods maintained high accuracy (>93%) and macro-F1 scores (>92%)
- The approach successfully addressed bias across both gender and profession classification tasks simultaneously

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Causal Graph-Based Data Intervention
Bias mitigation at the data level via causal modeling can reduce discriminatory correlations without significant accuracy loss. Causal graphs represent relationships between sensitive attributes and target predictions, with interventions severing spurious paths from sensitive attributes to outcomes while preserving legitimate predictive signals. The mitigated joint distribution is sampled to generate fair training data. This assumes correct causal structure specification and domain expert identification of unfair correlations.

### Mechanism 2: Class-Balanced Training via Oversampling and Loss Weighting
Rebalancing class exposure during training reduces disparate impact by equalizing gradient signals from minority and majority groups. Random oversampling increases minority class frequency in training batches, while class-weighted loss up-weights minority class loss terms. Both reduce the model's incentive to favor majority patterns. This assumes class imbalance drives measured bias and that rebalancing doesn't introduce overfitting to synthetic samples.

### Mechanism 3: Post-Hoc Equalized Odds Calibration
Threshold optimization on model outputs can achieve the best fairness-accuracy trade-off without modifying the model. Post-processing adjusts per-group decision thresholds to equalize true positive and false positive rates, decoupling fairness from model training. This assumes base model score distributions are separable enough that threshold adjustments don't catastrophically reduce accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Demographic Parity and Equalized Odds** - These are the core fairness metrics (DPD, EOD) used to evaluate all mitigation strategies. Why needed: Understanding these metrics is essential for interpreting fairness results. Quick check: If a model achieves DPD = 0.10 and EOD = 0.15, is it necessarily "fair" in all contexts?

- **Concept: Class Imbalance vs. Bias** - The paper's oversampling and loss-weighting mechanisms assume imbalance drives measured bias. Why needed: Understanding this link is critical for interpreting results. Quick check: Does balancing class distribution guarantee reduction in stereotype-based bias (e.g., "doctor" associated with male)?

- **Concept: Causal Graphs and Intervention** - The paper's core contribution uses causal modeling. Why needed: Without this foundation, the mechanism is opaque. Quick check: In a simple causal graph where Gender → Occupation → Bio Text, what intervention would remove gender influence on predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Preprocessing -> RandomOverSampler -> BERT tokenization -> BERT fine-tuning -> Equalized Odds calibration -> Evaluation
- **Critical path**: 1) Load and preprocess Bias in Bios data 2) Apply oversampling or causal-based fair data generation to training set only 3) Tokenize and batch 4) Fine-tune BERT with optional class weights 5) Predict on held-out test set 6) Optionally apply post-hoc Equalized Odds calibration 7) Compute accuracy, macro-F1, DPD, EOD
- **Design tradeoffs**: Oversampling vs. loss weighting (oversampling gave better fairness improvement), post-processing vs. in-training (post-processing achieved best fairness-accuracy balance), causal modeling vs. simpler methods (causal approach is interpretable but requires correct graph specification)
- **Failure signatures**: High accuracy but DPD/EOD near 1.0 (model exploiting spurious correlations), macro-F1 drops after oversampling (possible overfitting), post-processing thresholds become extreme (poor score calibration)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce baseline: Train BERT on raw Bias in Bios (no mitigation) 2) Apply oversampling: RandomOverSampler on training set only 3) Add post-processing: Apply Equalized Odds calibration via fairlearn

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can automated methods reliably identify sensitive attributes without domain expert input, and what accuracy threshold is needed for practical deployment? Current practice relies on domain experts with no general automatic standard.

- **Open Question 2**: How does the causal-model-based mitigation framework perform on unstructured modalities such as raw text and images? The study only validated on structured biography data with discrete labels.

- **Open Question 3**: What are the computational and fairness trade-offs when scaling to non-binary gender categories and multi-class sensitive attributes? The paper acknowledges applicability beyond binary cases but all experiments used binary gender.

## Limitations
- Causal modeling approach lacks detailed specification of graph construction and validation process
- Evaluation limited to single dataset (Bias in Bios), raising generalizability concerns
- Doesn't address potential trade-offs between different sensitive attributes when mitigating bias simultaneously

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Claims about baseline performance and post-processing Equalized Odds effectiveness
- **Medium confidence**: Causal modeling mechanism's effectiveness (limited by methodology specification)
- **Medium confidence**: Class imbalance mitigation through oversampling and loss weighting

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce with multiple random seeds to establish confidence intervals around fairness metrics
2. Cross-dataset validation using different bias dataset (e.g., Civil Comments)
3. Sensitivity analysis of causal graph specification by varying assumed causal structure
