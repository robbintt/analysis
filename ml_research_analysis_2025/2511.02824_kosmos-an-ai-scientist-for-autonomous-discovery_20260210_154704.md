core_contribution: Kosmos is an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery
  through iterative cycles of parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis
  generation. Unlike prior systems, it uses a structured world model to share information
  between agents, enabling up to 200 agent rollouts, 42,000 lines of code, and 1,500
  papers read per run.

# Kosmos: An AI Scientist for Autonomous Discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.02824
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02824
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AI scientist performing autonomous discovery with traceable reasoning, achieving 79.4% accuracy and 6 months equivalent research time per run

## Executive Summary
Kosmos is an autonomous AI scientist that performs iterative cycles of parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation to produce scientific discoveries. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos employs a structured world model to coordinate multiple agents across extended runs (up to 200 rollouts), enabling coherent long-horizon reasoning. Expert evaluations found 79.4% of Kosmos statements accurate, with the system demonstrating ability to reproduce unpublished findings and generate novel discoveries across metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.

## Method Summary
Kosmos takes a research objective and dataset (up to 5GB) as input and executes up to 20 cycles of parallel task execution. Each cycle spawns up to 10 instances of two specialized agents: a data analysis agent that generates and executes code producing Jupyter notebooks, and a literature search agent that reads papers and extracts claims. All outputs are stored in a structured world model, which is then queried to propose subsequent tasks. The system synthesizes 3-4 discovery reports with every statement citation-linked to either code notebooks or primary literature sources.

## Key Results
- 79.4% statement accuracy (85.5% for data analysis, 82.1% for literature review, 57.9% for interpretation)
- Expert-estimated 4.1-6.14 months equivalent research time per 20-cycle run
- Linear scaling of valuable findings with runtime (tested up to 20 cycles)
- Independently reproduced three unpublished findings and generated four novel discoveries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured World Model as Shared Memory
A structured world model enables coherent agent coordination across extended runs by acting as centralized, structured memory. Each cycle, task outputs are written to the world model, which is then queried to propose subsequent tasks, ensuring continuity despite LLM context limits.

### Mechanism 2: Parallel Multi-Agent Task Execution
Parallel execution of specialized agents (data analysis and literature search) increases exploration breadth without sacrificing depth. Each discovery cycle spawns multiple parallel instances of two agent types, with tasks assigned specific sub-objectives aligned with the overarching research goal.

### Mechanism 3: Traceable Citation-Linked Outputs
Mandating citations for every report statement enforces traceability and enables independent validation. Each statement is programmatically linked to its provenance—either a specific Jupyter notebook trajectory (for data analysis claims) or a literature citation (for literature claims).

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-Agent Coordination via Shared State**: Why needed here—Kosmos's world model is essentially a shared state coordination layer. Quick check: Can you explain how a shared blackboard differs from each agent maintaining its own memory in a multi-agent system?

- **LLM Context Window Limitations**: Why needed here—The world model exists specifically because LLMs cannot maintain coherent long-horizon chains of reasoning without external state. Quick check: What happens to an LLM agent's coherence when asked to perform 200 sequential operations without external memory?

- **Scientific Workflow Components (Hypothesis → Analysis → Synthesis)**: Why needed here—Kosmos operationalizes the classic scientific cycle. Quick check: In a single research cycle, what is the logical order and feedback loop between these three components?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: User provides objective + dataset → Orchestrator initializes world model → Per cycle: Orchestrator proposes tasks → spawns parallel agents → agents execute → outputs written to world model → World model queried for next-cycle task proposals → After N cycles: synthesizer generates reports with citation-linked statements

- **Critical path**: 1) User provides objective + dataset 2) Orchestrator initializes world model 3) Per cycle: Orchestrator proposes tasks → spawns parallel agents → agents execute → outputs written to world model 4) World model queried for next-cycle task proposals 5) After N cycles or objective completion, synthesizer generates reports 6) Human evaluates

- **Design tradeoffs**: Parallelism vs. coherence (more parallel agents increase breadth but require sophisticated world model aggregation); Structure vs. flexibility (highly structured world model improves retrieval but may miss emergent cross-domain insights); Automation vs. human-in-loop (runs autonomously per cycle, trading course-correction for scale)

- **Failure signatures**: World model schema too rigid (novel cross-domain hypotheses not captured); Poor task scoping (agents duplicate work or pursue conflicting hypotheses); Citation/linking failures (statements lack traceable provenance); Data quality issues (poorly formatted input data leads to irrelevant analyses); Interpretation overreach (LLMs conflate statistical significance with scientific importance)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce a finding: Run Kosmos on a dataset with known ground-truth discovery and verify report accuracy and traceability 2) Ablate the world model: Replace structured world model with simpler log; measure coherence degradation across cycles 3) Stress-test task scoping: Provide ambiguous research objectives; observe whether agents diverge, duplicate work, or produce conflicting claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. Does the linear relationship between Kosmos runtime (cycles) and the number of valuable scientific findings persist beyond the tested 20-cycle limit?

2. How can the evaluation of Kosmos discoveries be automated to determine accuracy, novelty, and significance without time-intensive human expert review?

3. To what extent do independent Kosmos runs converge on the same scientific discoveries when provided with identical inputs?

## Limitations

- World model schema is underspecified, making it unclear how cross-domain hypotheses are captured or how task conflicts are resolved
- System's reliance on high-quality, labeled datasets and access to full-text literature limits generalizability to domains with scarce data
- No automated evaluation of novelty or scientific significance exists; all claims of "valuable findings" rely on subjective expert estimation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Parallel multi-agent execution and citation-linked outputs are clearly specified and verifiable
- **Medium Confidence**: World model's role in maintaining coherence across 200+ agent rollouts is plausible but schema and retrieval logic are underspecified
- **Low Confidence**: Claims of linear scaling of valuable findings with runtime and 6 months equivalent research time are based on expert estimates without systematic validation

## Next Checks

1. **Schema Validation**: Implement minimal world model and test its ability to maintain coherent task proposals over 50+ cycles on simple dataset; measure coherence degradation compared to unstructured memory baseline

2. **Task Scope Stress Test**: Provide Kosmos with intentionally ambiguous research objective and document whether agents generate redundant analyses, conflicting hypotheses, or irrelevant findings

3. **Citation Traceability Audit**: Run Kosmos on dataset with known discovery and verify that every statement in final report can be traced to either specific Jupyter notebook or primary literature source without ambiguity
