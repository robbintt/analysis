# AI-Generated Compromises for Coalition Formation: Modeling, Simulation, and a Textual Case Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05983
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05983
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AI-mediated coalition formation enables majority-supported document convergence in collaborative text editing through LLM-generated compromises

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an AI-mediated framework for coalition formation in collaborative text editing tasks. The authors extend traditional coalition formation theory by allowing agents to move to smaller coalitions and make probabilistic decisions, capturing bounded rationality. They develop a mediator that uses large language models and natural language processing to generate compromise proposals in a semantic metric space of text documents. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach enables convergence to majority-supported documents, significantly reducing iterations needed for consensus while minimizing distance between final compromises and individual agent preferences.

## Method Summary
The framework combines coalition formation theory with AI mediation in a metric space where agents have ideal text documents. A mediator selects two coalitions using centroid-distance scoring, generates compromise proposals via GPT-3.5-turbo, and agents vote probabilistically based on their preferences. The process iterates until a majority coalition forms around a compromise document. The method uses Universal Sentence Encoder embeddings, softmax-based coalition selection, and temperature-controlled LLM generation with 50 repetitions per configuration across varying agent counts (10-1000) and rationality parameters.

## Key Results
- AI-mediated compromise generation reduces iteration counts needed for majority coalition formation compared to traditional methods
- Probabilistic agent behavior (σ>0) with coalition discipline enables convergence where deterministic agents fail
- The approach scales to large agent populations (n=1000) while maintaining convergence properties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by combining metric-based coalition selection with AI-generated compromises that bridge semantic gaps between agent preferences. The mediator's centroid-distance scoring identifies coalitions with complementary viewpoints, while LLM-generated proposals create documents that minimize weighted distance to coalition embeddings. Probabilistic voting with coalition discipline prevents deadlocks by allowing flexible decision-making, and the embedding space provides a continuous representation for compromise navigation.

## Foundational Learning
- Coalition formation theory: Why needed - Provides mathematical foundation for agent grouping and preference aggregation
  Quick check - Verify agents can join smaller coalitions and move between coalitions
- Metric space embeddings: Why needed - Enables quantitative comparison of textual preferences
  Quick check - Confirm Universal Sentence Encoder produces meaningful document distances
- Probabilistic voting models: Why needed - Captures bounded rationality and prevents deterministic deadlocks
  Quick check - Test convergence with varying σ values and coalition discipline settings

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Agents -> Mediator -> LLM Generator -> Coalition Selection -> Agents (iterative loop)
- Critical path: Mediator selects coalitions → LLM generates compromises → Agents vote → Coalition updates → Check majority
- Design tradeoffs: Probabilistic voting enables convergence but introduces stochasticity; embedding-based preferences simplify text comparison but may not capture all nuances
- Failure signatures: Non-convergence with deterministic agents and strict majority; incoherent LLM outputs when coalitions have conflicting preferences
- First experiments: 1) Test mediator with synthetic coalitions and fixed ideal documents, 2) Validate LLM compromise generation with known coalitions, 3) Verify voting dynamics with controlled preference distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Does AI-mediated coalition formation converge under relaxed rationality with provable theoretical guarantees on stability and fairness?
2. How do strategic agents who misreport preferences affect convergence and outcomes?
3. Does Euclidean distance in embedding space reliably reflect human preferences for textual compromise?
4. How does AI-induced bias in LLM-generated proposals affect fairness and legitimacy?

## Limitations
- Status quo initialization method not fully specified, potentially affecting convergence
- 10,000 iteration limit may truncate convergence in large agent populations
- Embedding-based preferences may not capture full semantic complexity of text documents

## Confidence
- High: Core mediator framework and compromise generation pipeline
- Medium: Agent voting dynamics and constitution application
- Low: Exact simulation termination conditions and statistical analysis procedures

## Next Checks
1. Test sensitivity to status quo initialization by comparing convergence with empty string, generic prompt, and random agent sentences
2. Verify agent voting behavior by running deterministic (σ=0) simulations with relaxed majority thresholds
3. Benchmark computational scaling by measuring iteration counts and runtime for n=100 and n=1000 agent populations
