core_contribution: This paper presents a categorical framework to analyze how humans
  and large language models (LLMs) transform content into truth-evaluated propositions
  about possible worlds, and uses this framework to argue that LLMs circumvent rather
  than solve the symbol grounding problem. The authors model the human epistemic path
  (experience and interpretation of grounded content) and the LLM path (prompting,

# A Categorical Analysis of Large Language Models and Why LLMs Circumvent the Symbol Grounding Problem

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.09117
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09117
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Key outcome:** The paper presents a categorical framework modeling human and LLM epistemic paths as relations in Rel, using entailment-commutativity to define soundness. It argues LLMs circumvent rather than solve the symbol grounding problem by operating exclusively on pre-grounded human content.

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a categorical framework to analyze how humans and large language models transform content into truth-evaluated propositions about possible worlds. Using the category Rel where morphisms are relations, it models the human epistemic path (experience and interpretation) and the LLM path (prompting, evaluation, and interpretation). The framework defines success as entailment-commutativity: the LLM's output set must be a subset of the human ground-truth set for each epistemic situation. The central thesis is that LLMs circumvent rather than solve the symbol grounding problem by operating exclusively on pre-grounded human content, lacking unmediated access to the world and instead detecting statistical patterns in human language about the world.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a categorical framework using the category Rel, where objects are sets and morphisms are binary relations. They define two epistemic paths: the human path (H→C→Pred(W)) mapping content to propositions via experience, and the AI path (H→C'→G×C'→O→Pred(W)) processing prompts through tokenization, inference, and interpretation. Soundness is defined as entailment-commutativity: for each epistemic situation h, the AI's output proposition set PAI(h) must be a subset of the human ground-truth set Phuman(h). The soundness set H* contains all queries where this criterion holds. Hallucinations are characterized as entailment failures where the AI produces propositions not supported by reliable content.

## Key Results
- The framework successfully distinguishes syntax from semantics by mapping content/outputs to propositions about possible worlds rather than comparing raw strings
- LLMs circumvent rather than solve the symbol grounding problem by relying on statistical patterns in pre-grounded human content without direct world access
- Multimodal architectures still operate on representations rather than direct world engagement, thus failing to solve grounding
- Refusals to answer are classified as valid sound states since the empty set is a subset of any proposition set

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Epistemic Parasitism via Pattern Inheritance
- **Claim:** LLMs produce semantically coherent outputs not by solving the symbol grounding problem, but by detecting statistical patterns in pre-grounded human content.
- **Mechanism:** The framework models the LLM path as H→C'→G×C'→O→Pred(W). Because this path lacks the direct experience relation x: H→W present in the human path, the system relies entirely on the training corpus C (tokenized as C'). Semantic competence is "inherited" from the grounding already established by human authors in C.
- **Core assumption:** The training corpus C contains sufficient statistical regularities that reflect the semantic structure of the world W, allowing the model to approximate grounded responses without direct access to W.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "LLMs circumvent rather than solve the symbol grounding problem by operating exclusively on pre-grounded human content."
  - [Section 8]: "The LLM detects second-order regularities—patterns in how humans describe patterns—without accessing the first-order regularities that ground human descriptions."
  - [Corpus]: Related work (e.g., The Mechanistic Emergence of Symbol Grounding) debates whether grounding can emerge, but this paper asserts it is circumvented. Corpus support for the specific "parasitism" mechanism is theoretical/philosophical rather than empirical.
- **Break condition:** If the prompt h requires knowledge of a domain W where human content C is absent, sparse, or statistically misleading, the inheritance mechanism fails, likely resulting in hallucination.

### Mechanism 2: Entailment-Commutativity (Soundness Criterion)
- **Claim:** Reliability is defined as the LLM's output proposition set being a subset of the human ground-truth set.
- **Mechanism:** The framework utilizes the category Rel where morphisms are relations. Instead of requiring strict equality of outputs (standard commutativity), it uses "entailment-commutativity" (lax commutativity). For a human epistemic situation h, the AI path is sound if PAI(h) ⊆ Phuman(h).
- **Core assumption:** The "human route" (g∘c), which maps content to propositions, serves as a valid ground-truth benchmark.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "Defines success as soundness (entailment): the success set H*⊆ where the AI's output set PAI(h) is a subset of the human ground-truth set Phuman(h)."
  - [Section 2]: "This shift replaces the usual requirement of path equality with the inclusion of relations."
- **Break condition:** The mechanism breaks when PAI(h) contains any proposition p not present in Phuman(h) (PAI(h) ⊈ Phuman(h)). The paper classifies this strictly as a "hallucination" or entailment failure.

### Mechanism 3: Refusal as Valid Empty-Set Resolution
- **Claim:** An LLM refusal to answer is not a failure but a valid sound state under this framework.
- **Mechanism:** A refusal is modeled as the AI path yielding the empty set of propositions (PAI(h) = ∅). Since the empty set is a subset of every set (∅ ⊆ Phuman(h)), this satisfies the entailment-commutativity condition.
- **Core assumption:** "Epistemic humility" (refusing to answer) is a desirable feature of a system that lacks access to W.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4]: "A 'refusal to answer' for a given h is modelled as the AI path yielding the empty set of propositions... this condition is always true."
- **Break condition:** This mechanism technically "works" (satisfies soundness) universally, provided the interpretation of the refusal is indeed an empty set of claims about W.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Category of Relations (Rel)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the mathematical substrate of the paper. Unlike standard functions which map one input to one output, relations map one input to a *set* of outputs, essential for modeling ambiguity in prompting and interpretation.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the paper uses subset inclusion (⊆) rather than equality (=) to define the success of a diagram in Rel?

- **Concept: The Symbol Grounding Problem (Harnad)**
  - **Why needed here:** The central thesis revolves around this problem. You must understand the distinction between manipulating symbols based on syntactic rules vs. connecting them to real-world referents.
  - **Quick check question:** According to the paper, why does adding multimodal capabilities (vision) fail to solve the grounding problem?

- **Concept: Model-Theoretic Semantics (Possible Worlds)**
  - **Why needed here:** The framework maps content to Pred(W)—propositions about a state space of possible worlds W. This distinguishes the *syntactic* output (O) from its *semantic* interpretation.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the role of the interpretation morphism r: O→Pred(W), and who performs it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - H: Human epistemic situation (user context)
  - C: Human-authored content (training corpus)
  - C': Tokenized strings (machine-readable input)
  - G: The trained model (weights)
  - W: The space of possible worlds (reality/truth-makers)
  - Pred(W): Propositions about the world (meanings)

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Human Path:** H →c C →g Pred(W). (Consult content, interpret meaning)
  2. **AI Path:** H →p C' →ig₀ G×C' →e O →r Pred(W). (Prompt, pair with model, evaluate, interpret)
  3. **Comparison:** Check if PAI(h) ⊆ Phuman(h)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Soundness vs. Completeness:** The framework prioritizes soundness (entailment). An incomplete answer (PAI ⊂ Phuman) is valid; an over-complete answer (PAI ⊈ Phuman) is a hallucination.
  - **Idealization:** The model assumes a single human agent and a static "ground truth" set Phuman(h), abstracting away messy human disagreement.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Tokenization Distortion (s):** Loss of meaning converting C→C'
  - **Inference Stochasticity (e):** Random sampling generates incorrect tokens despite correct weights
  - **Interpretation Failure (r):** The human interpreter misattributes meaning to the output string O

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Entailment Mapping:** Select a dataset of queries h. For each, manually construct Phuman(h) from trusted documents and compare it against PAI(h) to quantify the size of the "Soundness Set" H*.
  2. **Refusal Analysis:** Test the framework's prediction that refusals are sound. Configure an LLM to refuse "unknown" queries and verify if PAI(h) = ∅ consistently maps to soundness (h ∈ H*).
  3. **Failure Source Tracing:** Take instances of hallucination (h ∉ H*) and attempt to trace the failure back to specific morphisms: was the prompt ambiguous (p), or did the inference drift (e)?

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Is soundness a topologically stable property (an "open set" in H) or is it empirically brittle?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4: "Is 'soundness' a stable property (an 'open set' in H)? Or is it, as empirical evidence suggests, 'brittle' (a subset that is not open)?"
- **Why unresolved:** The authors suggest a sheaf-theoretic reformulation but do not formalise or test stability conditions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical or formal analysis showing whether small perturbations to h ∈ H typically preserve membership in H*.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How much of a hallucination is attributable to stochastic sampling versus interpretive ambiguity?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4: The authors note a hybrid Markov–Rel framework would "disentangle and quantify the sources of failure (i.e., to measure how much of a hallucination is due to stochastic sampling vs. interpretive ambiguity)."
- **Why unresolved:** The current Rel-based framework flattens all non-determinism into undifferentiated relations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A probabilistic extension measuring relative contributions of e (inference stochasticity) vs. r (interpretation ambiguity) to entailment failures.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the soundness set H* grow or shrink with scale and multimodal training?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper argues multimodal training enriches C without closing the grounding gap, but provides no measurement framework for tracking H* across model iterations.
- **Why unresolved:** No methodology is given for empirically bounding H* as architectures evolve.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic benchmarking of PAI(h) ⊆ Phuman(h) across model scales and modalities.

## Limitations
- The framework is highly abstract and lacks empirical validation on concrete datasets or LLM instantiations
- The definition of entailment-commutativity relies on human-annotated ground-truth sets that are not operationalized
- The claim that LLMs "circumvent" rather than "solve" the grounding problem is philosophical rather than empirically demonstrated
- The assumption of a single ground-truth set Phuman(h) abstracts away from real-world disagreement and ambiguity

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The categorical modeling framework (Rel category, morphism composition) is mathematically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The distinction between "circumventing" vs "solving" the grounding problem is logically coherent
- **Low confidence**: Empirical claims about hallucination detection and the universality of the soundness criterion

## Next Checks
1. **Operationalize the framework** on a concrete domain (e.g., factual QA) by creating human-annotated ground-truth sets and testing actual LLM outputs for entailment relationships
2. **Test the refusal prediction** by measuring whether LLM refusals consistently satisfy the soundness criterion across multiple domains and model configurations
3. **Trace failure modes** in real hallucinations to determine if failures stem from tokenization, inference, or interpretation as the framework predicts
