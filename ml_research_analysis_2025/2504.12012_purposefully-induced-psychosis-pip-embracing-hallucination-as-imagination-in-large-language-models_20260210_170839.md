## Executive Summary
The paper reframes LLM hallucinations from errors into a deliberate tool for computational creativity, introducing the Purposefully Induced Psychosis (PIP) framework. PIP fine-tunes models to encourage surreal, metaphorical, and speculative outputs, treating these "lies" as imaginative sparks rather than flaws. Inspired by the consensual illusions in theater and stage magic, PIP situates hallucinations in contexts where factual accuracy is secondary to creative exploration, such as speculative fiction, interactive storytelling, and mixed-reality simulations. The system uses LoRA fine-tuning on models like Llama-3.2b-instruct, trained on a synthetic dataset (PIP-One) of 5,000 creative instruction pairs designed to elicit metaphorical and poetic responses. A mixed-reality XR application integrates real-time AI-generated text, 3D meshes, and spatial audio to immerse users in hallucinatory environments. Preliminary user studies (n=10) suggest PIP hallucinations can increase engagement and creative risk-taking by prompting unexpected ideas. Ethical safeguards include clear user consent and mode-based toggles to distinguish creative from factual outputs. Future work includes refining user interfaces and evaluating creative and social impact.

## Method Summary
The PIP framework fine-tunes LLMs to amplify hallucinatory outputs for creative applications using LoRA adaptation on a synthetic dataset of 5,000 metaphor-heavy instruction pairs. The method trains a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model with LoRA adapters to produce surreal, speculative responses while maintaining base capabilities. Outputs are parsed and converted to 3D assets for XR integration. Ethical design includes explicit mode toggling between "Imaginative" and "Factual" outputs with clear consent framing. Preliminary qualitative testing with 10 users suggests increased creative engagement, though no formal metrics are provided.

## Key Results
- Preliminary user studies (n=10) suggest PIP hallucinations can increase engagement and creative risk-taking by prompting unexpected ideas
- LoRA fine-tuning successfully shifts model output distribution toward speculative responses without destroying base capabilities
- XR application integrates real-time AI-generated text, 3D meshes, and spatial audio to immerse users in hallucinatory environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LoRA fine-tuning on metaphor-heavy data shifts model output distribution toward speculative responses without destroying base capabilities
- Mechanism: Low-Rank Adaptation adds small trainable matrices to attention layers, learning to amplify metaphorical/surreal patterns in the PIP-One dataset while keeping pretrained weights frozen
- Core assumption: The synthetic dataset patterns generalize to new creative prompts (not validated beyond preliminary sessions)
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] states "Our method fine-tunes LLMs to encourage speculative, metaphorical, and surreal outputs"; [section 2.1] explains LoRA application; related work (DHI, arXiv:2601.01156) uses hallucination induction for contrastive factuality control, not creativity amplification
- Break condition: LoRA rank too high → catastrophic forgetting of general language abilities; rank too low → insufficient style shift

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Surreal outputs act as cognitive perturbations that disrupt habitual thinking patterns, prompting users toward novel associations
- Mechanism: Hallucinations introduce semantic/syntactic divergence from expected outputs (visualized as sparse, fragmented embedding distributions in Figure 3b). Users report these as "collaborative misfires" that open new creative paths rather than noise
- Core assumption: The creative value comes from human interpretation of AI outputs, not inherent quality of hallucinations themselves
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.1] reports users described experience as "unsettling in a generative way... those riddles sparked something"; [section 4] states "These illusions challenge habitual thought patterns, sometimes clarifying truths through abstraction"; "Are Hallucinations Bad Estimations?" (arXiv:2509.21473) formalizes hallucinations as unlinkable estimates—suggests potential utility lies in interpretation, not accuracy
- Break condition: If hallucinations become incoherent (pure noise), users cannot extract meaning; if too structured, they don't disrupt thinking

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explicit mode toggling and consent framing allows safe deployment of unreliable outputs in creative contexts
- Mechanism: Interface design segregates "Imaginative Mode" from "Factual Mode" with clear labeling, mimicking theatrical "willing suspension of disbelief"—users consent to being deceived within bounded contexts
- Core assumption: Users will reliably recognize mode boundaries and not transfer expectations across contexts
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] identifies "Ethical safeguards include clear user consent and mode-based toggles to distinguish creative from factual outputs"; [section 5] emphasizes "Designers must label creative illusions distinctly, so users understand the shift in norms"
- Break condition: Mode confusion or insufficient labeling → users apply creative outputs in factual contexts, undermining trust

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: Enables style/task specialization without full model retraining; critical for understanding how PIP modifies behavior while preserving base capabilities
  - Quick check question: If you freeze all original weights and only train rank-8 matrices, what happens to the model's factual knowledge?

- Concept: LLM hallucination taxonomy
  - Why needed here: PIP reframes hallucinations as features, not bugs—requires understanding what hallucinations are (probability-driven divergences from training distribution) before intentionally amplifying them
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between a confabulation (coherent but false) and incoherent output, and which does PIP target?

- Concept: Embedding space visualization
  - Why needed here: Figure 3 contrasts structured vs. hallucinatory outputs via word embedding density—understanding vector representation helps diagnose output quality
  - Quick check question: What would dense vs. sparse embedding clusters tell you about response coherence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User speech → SST → PIP model → surreal text response → parsing LLM → JSON → Meshy API → 3D object → XR environment (with simultaneous TTS playback)

- Critical path: User speech → SST → PIP model → surreal text response → parsing LLM → JSON → Meshy API → 3D object → XR environment (with simultaneous TTS playback). Latency at any stage breaks immersion

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Small model (1B params) enables real-time inference but limits output complexity
  - Synthetic dataset (5K samples) is small; may overfit to specific metaphor styles
  - Two-LLM pipeline (generation + parsing) adds latency but enables structured 3D output

- Failure signatures:
  - PIP outputs too incoherent → parsing LLM fails to extract JSON → no 3D generation
  - Mode confusion → users cite PIP outputs as facts in external contexts
  - LoRA weights not loading → model reverts to base factual behavior

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Generate 50 responses with PIP vs. base Llama-3.2-1B on identical prompts; rate coherence, creativity, and hallucination intensity to quantify style shift
  2. Mode-switching stress test: Have users alternate between Imaginative and Factual modes every 5 minutes; measure error rates in applying outputs to wrong context
  3. Embedding divergence analysis: Visualize output embeddings for prompts of varying surrealism; test hypothesis that PIP produces more sparse/fragmented distributions (as claimed in Figure 3) vs. base model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- What quantitative metrics can effectively measure the creative utility of "hallucinations" compared to standard LLM outputs? The paper states the need for "conducting more structured experiments to measure user satisfaction, creativity, and the social implications of such illusions" but relies on preliminary qualitative observations from a small sample (n=10) without formal metrics or control groups. Large-scale user studies utilizing established scales like the Creativity Support Index (CSI) to compare PIP against baseline models would resolve this.
- How can interface design effectively segregate "Imaginative" and "Factual" modes to prevent the erosion of user trust? The paper identifies the risk that normalizing illusions may "inadvertently undermine trust" and proposes "mode-based toggles" as a necessary area for refinement, but doesn't validate the efficacy of specific design interventions. Usability studies measuring user error rates in distinguishing fact from fiction across different interface toggle designs would resolve this.
- Does the PIP approach generalize to larger model architectures, or is the "hallucination" control dependent on the specific Llama-3.2b-instruct configuration? The method is implemented on a specific model with a relatively small synthetic dataset (5,000 samples), leaving the scalability of the "psychosis" induction untested. It is unclear if the desired surreal behavior is a robust feature of the training method or an artifact of the specific model size and dataset pairing. Benchmarks applying the PIP-One dataset to larger parameter models (e.g., Llama-70B) to evaluate consistency in hallucination control would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The 5,000-sample PIP-One dataset may provide insufficient diversity to reliably shift the model's output distribution without overfitting
- The preliminary user study (n=10) provides only suggestive evidence of creative benefit, lacking statistical power or control conditions
- The claim that PIP hallucinations "increase engagement and creative risk-taking" rests entirely on qualitative user feedback rather than systematic measurement

## Confidence
- High confidence: LoRA fine-tuning can modify model behavior toward metaphorical outputs (established ML technique with predictable mechanics)
- Medium confidence: Surreal outputs can prompt creative thinking in users (supported by preliminary qualitative feedback but lacks systematic validation)
- Low confidence: PIP hallucinations reliably increase creative engagement (based on tiny n=10 study with no control conditions)

## Next Checks
1. Quantitative creativity measurement: Conduct a controlled study (n≥30) comparing creative output quantity and originality between PIP model, base model, and human writers on identical creative prompts, using standardized creativity metrics (fluency, flexibility, originality scores)
2. Mode confusion empirical test: Design an experiment where participants interact with both modes across multiple sessions, measuring error rates in applying outputs to incorrect contexts and tracking trust degradation over time
3. Embedding distribution validation: Generate 1,000 responses from PIP and base models on matched prompt sets, visualize embedding density/sparsity using t-SNE or UMAP, and statistically test whether PIP outputs show significantly more fragmented distributions as claimed in Figure 3
