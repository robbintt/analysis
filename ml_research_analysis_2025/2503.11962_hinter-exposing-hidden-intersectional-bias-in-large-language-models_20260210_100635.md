## Executive Summary
HInter is an automated testing technique that exposes hidden intersectional bias in large language models (LLMs) by combining mutation analysis, dependency parsing, and metamorphic oracles. The method systematically generates and validates test inputs to detect intersectional bias (involving multiple sensitive attributes) and identify hidden intersectional bias (cases where atomic bias testing fails). Evaluated on 18 LLM models across six architectures using five datasets, HInter uncovered that 14.61% of generated inputs expose intersectional bias, with 16.62% of these being hidden (not detected by atomic testing). The dependency invariant check significantly reduced false positives by an order of magnitude, and generated inputs were as grammatically valid as human-written text. These results demonstrate that intersectional bias testing is essential and complements traditional atomic bias testing.

## Method Summary
HInter detects intersectional bias in LLMs through a three-step black-box testing process. First, it generates higher-order mutants by simultaneously replacing two sensitive words from a bias dictionary containing word pairs for race, gender, and body attributes. Second, it validates mutants using a dependency invariant check that compares POS tags and dependency parse tree structures to the original input, discarding structurally dissimilar mutants. Third, it applies a metamorphic oracle that compares LLM outputs on original versus mutant inputs, flagging differences as potential bias. Hidden intersectional bias is identified when atomic mutations show no bias but their intersectional combination does. The approach was evaluated across 18 LLM models using five datasets, demonstrating that intersectional testing uncovers bias missed by atomic testing.

## Key Results
- HInter uncovered that 14.61% of generated inputs expose intersectional bias across 18 LLM models
- Of intersectional biases detected, 16.62% were hidden (not detected by atomic testing alone)
- Dependency invariant check reduced false positives by an order of magnitude, with 90.71% of generic mutations being invalid
- Generated mutants achieved grammatical validity scores of 79.5%, comparable to human-written text at 78.7%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Simultaneously mutating multiple sensitive attributes exposes intersectional biases that atomic (single-attribute) mutations cannot detect.
- Mechanism: HInter replaces words in original text with bias-prone word pairs from a dictionary, applying mutations for two attributes at once to generate higher-order mutants.
- Core assumption: Intersectional bias emerges from non-additive interactions between attributes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "generates test inputs by systematically mutating sentences using multiple mutations"
  - [Section 5, RQ4.1]: "atomic bias testing misses about five times (5X) as many bias-inducing mutants as intersectional bias testing (57,160 vs. 11,705)"
  - [corpus]: Related work confirms intersectional bias compounds in complex ways but doesn't validate HInter's specific mutation strategy.
- Break condition: If intersectional effects are fully predictable from atomic effects, higher-order mutation adds no marginal value.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dependency parse tree comparison between original and mutant sentences preserves semantic validity and dramatically reduces false positives.
- Mechanism: For each mutant, HInter generates dependency trees and compares POS tags and dependency relations to the original; mutants exceeding tolerance thresholds are discarded.
- Core assumption: Syntactic/structural similarity correlates with semantic preservation for bias testing purposes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "dependency invariant check significantly reduced false positives by an order of magnitude"
  - [Section 5, RQ3.2]: "90.71% (7,604,247/8,383,471) errors produced by generic mutations are fake"
  - [corpus]: Machine translation testing literature uses similar structural invariants for different tasks.
- Break condition: If grammatically valid mutants still introduce semantic shifts that confound bias attribution.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Metamorphic oracles detect bias by comparing LLM outputs on original vs. mutated inputs—differences indicate potential bias when inputs should be task-equivalent.
- Mechanism: Feed original and mutant inputs to the LLM separately; if outputs differ (and invariant passes), flag as bias. Hidden bias is detected when atomic mutants show no bias but their intersectional combination does.
- Core assumption: Fair models should produce identical outputs for inputs differing only in sensitive attribute values (individual fairness principle).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "detects biases by checking the LLM response on the original and mutated sentences"
  - [Section 3, Algorithm 1 lines 22-24]: Metamorphic oracle compares M(m) ≠ O[c] to flag bias
  - [corpus]: MT-NLP validates metamorphic testing for atomic bias in NLP; corpus evidence for intersectional metamorphic testing is limited.
- Break condition: If legitimate task-relevant output differences are indistinguishable from bias signals.

## Foundational Learning

- **Intersectional vs. Atomic Bias**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central claim is that atomic testing alone is insufficient; understanding this distinction is prerequisite to grasping "hidden" bias.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model show no bias when testing "race" alone or "gender" alone, but show bias when testing "Black woman" vs. "white man"?

- **Metamorphic Testing**
  - Why needed here: HInter's oracle relies on metamorphic relations—comparing outputs across related inputs without ground truth.
  - Quick check question: If f(x) = "positive" and f(mutant(x)) = "negative," under what conditions does this indicate bias vs. a legitimate task difference?

- **Dependency Parsing / Syntax Trees**
  - Why needed here: The invariant check filters invalid mutants using POS tags and dependency relations.
  - Quick check question: Would "The man walked" and "The woman walked" have identical dependency structures? Would "The man walked" vs. "Him walked the"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. **Bias Dictionary** (SBIC-extracted word pairs per attribute: race, gender, body)
  2. **Mutation Engine** (generates atomic and 2nd-order intersectional mutants)
  3. **Dependency Parser** (validates structural similarity via parse tree comparison)
  4. **Metamorphic Oracle** (compares LLM outputs: original vs. mutant)
  5. **Test Suite Aggregator** (collects valid mutants, flags bias instances, identifies hidden cases)

- **Critical path:**
  Original input → Scan for bias-prone words → Generate atomic + intersectional mutants → Dependency invariant check → LLM inference (original + each mutant) → Oracle comparison → Classify (benign / atomic bias / intersectional bias / hidden bias)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - 2nd-order vs. higher-order mutations: Paper limits to N=2 due to computational cost; extending to 3+ attributes increases coverage exponentially but becomes intractable.
  - Dependency tolerance level: Stricter thresholds reduce false positives but may discard valid edge-case mutants.
  - Temperature = 0 vs. sampling: Zero temperature ensures determinism but may underrepresent model variability.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - False positive spike → dependency invariant too permissive or parser errors on domain-specific text
  - Zero hidden bias found → mutation coverage insufficient or bias dictionary incomplete
  - Inconsistent reproductions → LLM temperature > 0 or API version drift

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce RQ1 baseline:** Run HInter on GPT-3.5 with IMDB dataset; verify intersectional bias rate ≈7% and hidden bias ≈28%.
  2. **Ablate dependency invariant:** Disable InvCheck and measure false positive increase (expect ~10x per RQ3.2).
  3. **Extend to new attribute:** Create a bias dictionary for "age" using a relevant corpus; run HInter on one legal dataset and compare intersectional vs. atomic bias rates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited attribute coverage: The method tests only three attributes (race, gender, body) with binary word pairs, potentially missing complex intersectional effects involving more nuanced or continuous attributes.
- Parser dependency: The dependency invariant check relies on syntactic similarity, but structurally valid mutants could still introduce semantic shifts that confound bias attribution.
- LLM-specific validation: Hidden bias detection assumes atomic testing comprehensively captures all atomic biases; if atomic testing misses biases, the hidden bias metric may be inflated.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The dependency invariant effectively reduces false positives by an order of magnitude, as evidenced by quantitative results (90.71% of generic mutations discarded).
- **Medium confidence**: The 5X higher bias detection rate for intersectional vs. atomic testing, given the computational constraints and potential overlap between testing methods.
- **Medium confidence**: The metamorphic oracle reliably detects bias through output comparison, though legitimate task differences vs. bias signals remain challenging to disentangle.

## Next Checks
1. **Replicate hidden bias detection**: Run HInter on a legal dataset (e.g., ECtHR) with GPT-3.5; verify the ~28% hidden bias rate among intersectional biases.
2. **Test parser robustness**: Disable the dependency invariant check and measure false positive rate increase; compare with paper's reported 10x reduction.
3. **Extend attribute coverage**: Create a bias dictionary for a fourth attribute (e.g., age); run HInter and measure whether intersectional bias rate increases beyond the reported 14.61%.
