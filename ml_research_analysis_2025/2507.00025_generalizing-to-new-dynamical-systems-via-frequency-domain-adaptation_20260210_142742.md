# Generalizing to New Dynamical Systems via Frequency Domain Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.00025
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00025
- Reference count: 40
- Method introduces FNSDA for efficient adaptation to new dynamical systems with significantly fewer parameters than existing approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FNSDA, a novel method for generalizing neural network surrogates to new dynamical systems. The approach addresses the challenge of modeling physical systems by characterizing commonalities and discrepancies among dynamical environments in the frequency domain. FNSDA employs a learnable filter to partition Fourier modes into shared dynamics and system-specific components, then uses low-dimensional latent parameters to efficiently adjust system-specific components. This enables rapid adaptation to new environments while requiring significantly fewer parameter updates compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
FNSDA leverages frequency domain analysis to separate shared and system-specific dynamics in dynamical systems modeling. The method introduces a learnable filter that partitions Fourier modes into components representing common dynamics across systems and components capturing system-specific discrepancies. Low-dimensional latent systematic parameters are then used to efficiently adjust these system-specific components, enabling rapid adaptation to new environments. This approach significantly reduces the number of parameters needed for adaptation compared to traditional methods while maintaining or improving performance across various dynamical systems including ODEs (Lotka-Volterra, Glycolytic Oscillator) and PDEs (Gray-Scott, Navier-Stokes).

## Key Results
- FNSDA achieves superior or competitive performance on both inter-trajectory and extra-trajectory adaptation tasks
- Requires only a fraction of parameter updates needed by baseline methods
- Demonstrates effectiveness across four representative dynamical systems including ODEs and PDEs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method's effectiveness stems from its frequency domain adaptation approach that separates shared dynamics from system-specific variations. By partitioning Fourier modes through learnable filters, FNSDA can identify and exploit commonalities across different dynamical systems while efficiently adapting to unique characteristics. The use of low-dimensional latent parameters for system-specific adjustments enables rapid adaptation without the computational burden of updating all model parameters, making the approach both efficient and scalable.

## Foundational Learning
- Fourier Analysis - why needed: To decompose system dynamics into frequency components for effective separation of shared and system-specific characteristics
- Neural Surrogate Modeling - why needed: To approximate complex dynamical system behaviors without solving differential equations directly
- Latent Variable Models - why needed: To represent system-specific variations in a compressed, learnable format that enables efficient adaptation
- Learnable Filters - why needed: To dynamically partition frequency components based on the specific characteristics of the dynamical systems being modeled
- Fast Adaptation Techniques - why needed: To enable rapid adjustment to new systems with minimal parameter updates
- Frequency Domain Adaptation - why needed: To leverage spectral properties of dynamical systems for more effective generalization across different environments

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Input Data -> Fourier Transform -> Learnable Filter -> Shared Components + System-Specific Components -> Latent Parameter Adjustment -> Output Prediction
- Critical Path: The learnable filter and latent parameter adjustment modules are critical, as they enable the separation of shared and system-specific dynamics and facilitate efficient adaptation
- Design Tradeoffs: Reduced parameter count vs. potential loss of fine-grained system-specific details; computational efficiency vs. model complexity in the frequency domain analysis
- Failure Signatures: Poor performance on chaotic systems, overfitting to training environments, failure to capture non-stationary dynamics
- First Experiment 1: Test FNSDA on chaotic dynamical systems (e.g., Lorenz system) to evaluate performance under extreme conditions
- First Experiment 2: Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component to overall performance
- First Experiment 3: Compare FNSDA's adaptation speed and accuracy against recent meta-learning approaches on a benchmark suite

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness on complex, chaotic, or high-dimensional dynamical systems remains untested
- Assumes system-specific dynamics can be captured through low-dimensional latent parameters, which may not generalize to systems with complex frequency characteristics
- Computational efficiency relative to traditional physics-informed approaches not thoroughly examined

## Confidence
- Performance claims: High (well-supported by experimental results)
- Parameter efficiency claims: Medium (requires more comprehensive comparison with recent methods)
- Generalizability claims: Low (limited testing on diverse dynamical systems)
- Computational efficiency claims: Low (insufficient examination of overhead)

## Next Checks
1. Test FNSDA on chaotic dynamical systems (e.g., Lorenz system) to evaluate performance under more extreme conditions and sensitivity to initial conditions
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (Fourier mode partitioning, latent parameters, learnable filters) to overall performance
3. Compare FNSDA's adaptation speed and accuracy against recent meta-learning approaches on a benchmark suite of dynamical systems to establish its relative efficiency in practical applications
