## Executive Summary
This paper presents a simulation framework using LLM agents with different personas to study reviewer dynamics in conference peer review under Elo-ranked systems. The authors compare baseline peer review with conditions incorporating Elo ratings and reviewer memory, using 150 papers from ICLR 2025 submissions. Their results show that Elo-based ranking improves Area Chair decision accuracy from 0.55 to 0.70 while also revealing that visible Elo incentives can lead reviewers to adapt strategically to improve ratings rather than enhance review quality. The study highlights a trade-off between stability and diversity in rank-based incentives.

## Method Summary
The authors use Gemini-2.5-Flash to simulate 6 reviewer personas (Expert, Critic, Bluffer, Optimist, Harmonizer, Skimmer) and an Area Chair agent across 30 rounds. Each round involves initial reviews, second reviews with peer visibility, AC decisions, and Elo adjustments (+100/0/-100 for top/middle/bottom ranks). Three conditions are tested: Baseline (no Elo), AC Access (Elo visible to AC), and Full Access (Elo visible to both AC and reviewers). Reviewers maintain memory modules that inform future prompts based on Elo feedback.

## Key Results
- Elo-based ranking improves Area Chair decision accuracy from 0.55 to 0.70 (baseline to full access)
- Expert persona consistently accumulates highest Elo scores; Skimmer persona is strongly penalized
- Visible Elo incentives lead reviewers to adapt strategically rather than improve substantive review quality
- Clear stratification emerges within first few rounds with reviewer trajectories separating into high/low-performing groups

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Elo-based cumulative feedback stratifies reviewer quality over multiple rounds, enabling better differentiation than single-round evaluation.
- Mechanism: Each round, reviewers receive +100/0/−100 Elo adjustments based on AC quality rankings. Small performance differences amplify across rounds, creating trajectory separation. Expert persona accumulates highest Elo; Skimmer is penalized consistently.
- Core assumption: AC quality ratings correlate with actual review quality, and persona behaviors remain stable enough for Elo to reflect underlying effort/competence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "incorporating Elo-based ranking improves Area Chair decision accuracy from 0.55 to 0.70"
  - [section 4.2] "Clear stratification emerges as early as the first few rounds, with reviewer trajectories separating into high- and low-performing groups"
  - [corpus] Related work on reviewer quality metrics is thin; corpus papers focus on LLM-assisted review generation rather than rating systems.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Visible Elo scores incentivize strategic adaptation—reviewers optimize for rating improvement without substantive quality gains.
- Mechanism: When reviewers access their Elo changes (Full Access), they update a textual memory module that informs future review prompts. Critic and Bluffer personas partially recover Elo by adjusting tone and confidence, not by deeper engagement.
- Core assumption: LLM agents' memory-based strategy updates approximate human strategic behavior under incentive visibility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "reviewers' adaptive review strategy that exploits our Elo system without improving review effort"
  - [section 4.2] "adjustments are primarily reflected in changes in tone, selectivity, or confidence, rather than consistent improvements in substantive review quality"
  - [corpus] No corpus papers test incentive visibility effects directly.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: AC access to reviewer Elo acts as a quality-weighting signal, improving paper decision accuracy.
- Mechanism: AC uses reviewer Elo as auxiliary meta-information when synthesizing three reviews into a final decision. Higher-Elo reviewers' opinions carry implicit weight, filtering low-quality or superficial evaluations.
- Core assumption: Elo correlates with review informativeness; AC can integrate numeric ratings without over-reliance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] Table 1: Baseline accuracy 0.55, AC Access 0.67, Full Access 0.70
  - [section 4.3] "AC weighting of reviewer opinions based on Elo effectively filters noisy evaluations without changing reviewer behavior"
  - [corpus] Related work (e.g., "Can LLM feedback enhance review quality?") studies LLM review assistance but not Elo-based meta-weighting.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Elo rating system basics (zero-sum, relative ranking, cumulative adjustment)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a simplified Elo variant; understanding how small differences compound explains stratification dynamics.
  - Quick check question: If three reviewers have Elo 1500 and rank 1st/2nd/3rd in a round, what are their new ratings?

- Concept: LLM agent personas as behavioral priors
  - Why needed here: The simulation's validity depends on personas capturing realistic reviewer archetypes (Expert vs. Skimmer).
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a Bluffer from an Expert in review behavior?

- Concept: Multi-agent simulation with memory/state
  - Why needed here: Reviewers update memory across rounds; this enables strategic adaptation.
  - Quick check question: How does the memory module influence the next round's review prompt?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Reviewer Agents (6 personas) -> Review Generation -> Memory Update -> Elo Engine
  - Area Chair Agent -> Review Synthesis -> Quality Ratings -> Elo Engine
  - Elo Engine -> Elo Adjustments -> Reviewer Agents (feedback loop)
  - Paper Pool -> Sampling -> Reviewer Assignment
  - Memory Module -> Textual Summary -> Review Prompts

- Critical path:
  1. Sample papers → assign reviewer triplet
  2. Initial reviews generated (Stage 1)
  3. Second reviews with peer visibility (Stage 2)
  4. AC decision + quality ratings (Stage 3)
  5. Elo update + memory update (Stage 4)
  6. Repeat for 30 rounds

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Baseline vs. AC Access vs. Full Access: Tests where Elo visibility matters
  - Zero-sum Elo (+100/0/−100): Simple but may not reflect real-world rating variance
  - No author rebuttal: Focuses on reviewer dynamics; may miss real process complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Elo scores converge (no stratification) → check if AC quality ratings have variance
  - Personas don't differentiate → verify prompt design enforces behavioral constraints
  - Memory updates don't change behavior → inspect memory text integration

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Baseline vs. AC Access: Confirm accuracy lift (0.55 → 0.67) with your LLM
  2. Ablate memory module: Does strategic adaptation disappear without memory updates?
  3. Increase rounds to 100: Test if stratification stabilizes or if Elo becomes gameable long-term

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the long-term convergence properties and equilibrium behaviors of reviewer Elo ratings under persistent feedback, and do ratings stabilize or continue to diverge over extended time horizons?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state their study is "limited by the small number of review rounds conducted due to computational and resource constraints, which restricts our ability to analyze long-term convergence or equilibrium behavior under Elo-based feedback."
- Why unresolved: Only 30 simulation rounds were conducted, insufficient to determine if observed stratification patterns stabilize, reverse, or lead to pathological equilibria.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running simulations with 100+ rounds across multiple random seeds to analyze whether Elo trajectories reach stable equilibria or exhibit cyclical/divergent behavior.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can alternative Elo system designs (e.g., decay mechanisms, quality-weighted adjustments, or bounded rating ranges) mitigate strategic adaptation while preserving the benefits of reviewer accountability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows reviewers "optimize their behavior to improve or maintain their Elo rather than committing effort to engage with the paper," and uses a simple +100/0/−100 reward scheme without exploring alternatives.
- Why unresolved: The current design creates incentives for superficial strategy optimization; whether different rating mechanisms could align reviewer incentives with substantive quality remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments with alternative Elo variants measuring both rating dynamics and independent review quality assessments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How well do LLM agent reviewer dynamics generalize to human reviewer behavior in real conference settings, and what calibration is needed between simulated and actual peer review outcomes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors emphasize "the proposed Elo-based framework is explored as an analytical tool rather than a prescriptive policy recommendation, and any real-world deployment would require careful consideration of transparency, fairness, and potential unintended consequences."
- Why unresolved: LLM personas are designed approximations of human behavior patterns; the validity of simulation-to-reality transfer remains unestablished.
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation studies comparing simulation predictions against historical review data from conferences with reviewer rating systems, or controlled human experiments using similar Elo mechanisms.

## Limitations
- The 30-round simulation horizon may be insufficient to observe long-term equilibrium effects or identify whether strategic gaming eventually dominates substantive review quality
- The absence of author rebuttal removes a critical dynamic that influences reviewer behavior and decision quality in actual conferences
- The Elo rating system's zero-sum nature (+100/0/−100) creates artificial constraints that may not reflect real-world rating distributions or variance

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The Elo stratification mechanism (Mechanism 1) is well-supported by the empirical trajectory data showing clear separation between personas. The mathematical properties of cumulative ranking systems make this finding robust.
- **Medium Confidence**: The strategic adaptation mechanism (Mechanism 2) is plausible given the memory module implementation, but relies on assumptions about LLM strategic behavior that require validation with human subjects.
- **Medium Confidence**: The AC decision accuracy improvements (Mechanism 3) are statistically supported, but the practical significance depends on the magnitude of real-world decision errors and whether Elo weighting introduces new biases.

## Next Checks

1. **Human Validation Study**: Replicate the simulation with human reviewers to test whether the strategic adaptation effects observed in LLM agents hold with actual human cognitive processes and motivations.

2. **Longitudinal Stability Analysis**: Extend the simulation to 100+ rounds to assess whether Elo stratification remains stable, converges to new equilibria, or becomes dominated by strategic gaming patterns.

3. **Ablation of Rating Constraints**: Test alternative Elo adjustment schemes (e.g., continuous ratings, asymmetric adjustments) to evaluate sensitivity of stratification effects to the zero-sum constraint.
