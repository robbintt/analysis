# VoxRole: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Speech-Based Role-Playing Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.03940
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03940
- **Reference count**: 2
- **Primary result**: First comprehensive benchmark for speech-based Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs), introducing VoxRole with 13,335 dialogues (65.6 hours) from 1,228 characters across 261 movies.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark for speech-based Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). The authors develop a two-stage automated pipeline that extracts speaker-annotated dialogues from movies and employs an LLM to generate multi-dimensional character profiles. The resulting benchmark includes 13,335 dialogues (65.6 hours) from 1,228 characters across 261 movies. Evaluation of leading spoken dialogue models shows that while coherence is consistently strong, paralinguistic appropriateness remains a universal challenge. Open-source models notably underperform in personality consistency and relational coherence compared to proprietary models, with parameter count not correlating directly with performance. Human evaluation confirms strong alignment (Pearson correlation of 0.762) between LLM-based and human assessments.

## Method Summary
The VoxRole benchmark is built through a two-stage automated pipeline. First, an audio-script alignment process extracts speaker-annotated dialogues: movie audio is denoised, transcribed, and word-level aligned to scripts using minimum edit distance and semantic validation with MPNet similarity threshold of 0.8. Second, an LLM distills multi-dimensional character profiles by segmenting scripts by scene, summarizing events, aggregating per-character events to infer personality and relationships, collecting direct dialogue for linguistic style, and extracting discretized acoustic features (pitch, energy, speech rate). The evaluation framework uses both metric-based scores (Rouge-L, Meteor, BertScore-F1, UTMOSv2) and LLM-based assessment on six dimensions (Human-Likeness, Personality Consistency, Linguistic Fidelity, Relational Coherence, Contextual Coherence, Paralinguistic Appropriateness) with Gemini-2.5-flash as judge.

## Key Results
- Open-source models significantly underperform proprietary models in Personality Consistency (15.2% gap) and Relational Coherence (15.6% gap) dimensions
- GPT-4o achieves highest overall performance (5.20/6.00) but still struggles with Paralinguistic Appropriateness (3.82/6.00)
- Parameter count does not correlate directly with performance: 7B Qwen2.5-Omni outperforms 132B Step-Audio in speech naturalness
- Human evaluation confirms strong alignment (Pearson correlation of 0.762) between LLM-based and human assessments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Stage Audio-Script Alignment Pipeline
The pipeline chains denoising (Resemble) → transcription with timestamps (Whisper-large-v3 + Wav2Vec2.0 forced alignment) → minimum edit distance matching between transcript and script → semantic validation (MPNet similarity ≥0.8 threshold). This compensates for actors' improvisations by accepting semantic rather than lexical matches. Core assumption: Script-to-performance divergence is semantic rather than structural; paraphrases preserve meaning sufficiently for persona extraction.

### Mechanism 2: Event-Based LLM Persona Distillation
Rather than direct LLM extraction from raw screenplays, the pipeline: (1) segments by scene, (2) LLM summarizes core events per segment, (3) aggregates events per character to infer personality/relationships, (4) separately collects all dialogue lines for linguistic style summarization, (5) extracts acoustic features (pitch, energy, speech rate) and discretizes into High/Medium/Low categories. Core assumption: Event-level summarization preserves personality-relevant signals while filtering noise; dialogue style is better captured from direct utterance collection than event summaries.

### Mechanism 3: Acoustically-Augmented LLM Evaluation
Model's spoken response is transcribed (Whisper-3-Large) → acoustic features extracted (Emotion2Vec for emotion labels; mean pitch/energy/rate discretized into categorical bins) → concatenated multimodal representation fed to LLM judge (Gemini-2.5-flash) → scored on 6 dimensions including paralinguistic appropriateness. Core assumption: Discretized acoustic features capture sufficient paralinguistic information for LLM judgment; transcription does not lose critical prosodic signals that the acoustic features fail to recover.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Forced Alignment (Wav2Vec2.0)**
  - Why needed here: The audio-script alignment mechanism depends on obtaining word-level timestamps to map transcribed speech back to scripted dialogue
  - Quick check question: Given a 10-second audio clip and its transcript, can you explain why forced alignment might fail if the speaker has significant pauses mid-sentence?

- **Concept: Semantic Similarity Thresholding (MPNet/Sentence-BERT)**
  - Why needed here: The 0.8 threshold determines which script-transcript pairs are accepted
  - Quick check question: If you raise the threshold from 0.8 to 0.9, what happens to precision and recall of matched dialogue pairs?

- **Concept: LLM-as-Judge Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The entire evaluation framework relies on Gemini-2.5-flash as judge
  - Quick check question: What systematic biases might an LLM judge have when evaluating open-source vs. proprietary model outputs, and how would you detect them?

- **Critical path**: Audio-script alignment quality determines downstream persona quality; semantic validation threshold is the key tuning knob. If alignment fails (<5 min matched audio), the movie is filtered out. Persona extraction depends on sufficient character dialogue (≥10 matched dialogues threshold).

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Threshold vs. Coverage**: Higher MPNet threshold (0.8) improves match precision but excludes movies with significant improvisation
  - **Discretization granularity**: Acoustic features binned into 3 categories (High/Medium/Low) lose fine-grained prosodic control but enable LLM-readable evaluation inputs
  - **Context window**: Ablation (Table 4) shows non-monotonic performance with context length (4→10), suggesting an optimum exists

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Low alignment coverage**: Movies with extensive ad-libbing show <10 min matched audio; check script-to-final-cut fidelity before processing
  - **Sparse character profiles**: Characters with <10 dialogues are filtered; expect weaker personality consistency scores for borderline characters
  - **Acoustic evaluation ceiling**: All models score 2.90-3.82 on Acoustic dimension despite varying sizes; this may indicate evaluation granularity limits

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Reproduce alignment pipeline on 5 sample movies**: Run the full audio-script alignment pipeline, manually verify 20 random matched dialogues against ground truth audio, measure precision@0.8 threshold and report coverage variance across genres
  2. **Ablate semantic validation threshold**: Test MPNet thresholds [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9] on a held-out movie subset; plot coverage vs. human-judged match quality to validate the 0.8 design choice
  3. **Validate LLM judge calibration**: Run the 6-dimensional LLM evaluation on 50 dialogues with both Gemini-2.5-flash and an alternative judge (e.g., Claude), compute inter-judge agreement, and identify dimensions with highest variance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: What specific architectural or training modifications are required to overcome the universal deficiency in paralinguistic appropriateness?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors identify "Paralinguistic Appropriateness" as a "universal challenge," noting that even top-performing models like GPT-4o score significantly lower (3.82) in acoustic dimensions compared to coherence (4.48).
- **Why unresolved**: Current models appear to prioritize semantic correctness over the nuance of vocal delivery (emotion, prosody), resulting in a consistent bottleneck across the industry.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: The development of a model that achieves high semantic scores while simultaneously matching or exceeding human-level performance in acoustic feature alignment on the VoxRole benchmark.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: To what extent do training methodologies or data optimization override raw parameter count in speech-based role-playing?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The results show the 7B Qwen2.5-Omni model substantially outperformed the 132B Step-Audio model in speech naturalness, leading the authors to conclude that factors other than scale are "more influential than raw parameter scale."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper identifies this non-linear relationship but does not isolate the specific variables (e.g., architecture vs. training data quality) that caused the smaller model to excel.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Ablation studies controlling for parameter count while varying specific architectural traits or datasets to replicate the performance inversion observed between Qwen2.5-Omni and Step-Audio.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can targeted fine-tuning enable open-source models to bridge the gap in "Personality Consistency" and "Relational Coherence" observed against proprietary models?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The evaluation reveals a "critical divergence" where open-source models underperform by over 15% in personality and relationship dimensions. The conclusion suggests future work should focus on "fine-tuning large speech models."
- **Why unresolved**: It is undetermined if the performance gap is a fundamental limitation of model size/open weights or simply a lack of specialized role-playing instruction tuning in current open-source releases.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An open-source model fine-tuned on the VoxRole dataset demonstrating statistically equivalent scores to GPT-4o in the "Personality Consistency" dimension.

## Limitations

- **Alignment Pipeline Robustness**: The 0.8 MPNet semantic threshold may systematically exclude highly improvisational dialogue or struggle with genre-specific language patterns.
- **Persona Extraction Generalizability**: The event-based distillation framework depends heavily on the undisclosed LLM used and may yield unreliable personality inferences for characters with sparse dialogue.
- **Acoustic Feature Granularity**: Discretizing continuous acoustic features into three categorical bins may oversimplify prosodic nuances critical for paralinguistic appropriateness evaluation.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The benchmark construction methodology (automated audio-script alignment + LLM persona distillation) is technically sound and reproducible given access to scripts and movie files.
- **Medium Confidence**: The 0.8 semantic threshold and 10-dialogue minimum are reasonable design choices based on corpus analysis, but their optimality varies by movie genre and dialogue style.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific LLM models and prompt templates used for persona extraction and the exact implementation details of the dynamic matching algorithm remain unknown.

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Calibration Study**: Systematically test MPNet thresholds [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9] on a genre-balanced subset of 20 movies, measuring both coverage rates and human-judged match quality to validate the 0.8 design choice and identify genre-specific optimal thresholds.

2. **Judge Calibration and Bias Analysis**: Run the 6-dimensional LLM evaluation on 100 randomly selected dialogues using both Gemini-2.5-flash and an alternative judge (e.g., Claude-3.5-sonnet), computing inter-judge agreement, analyzing systematic biases between proprietary and open-source model assessments, and identifying dimensions with highest variance.

3. **Acoustic Feature Granularity Impact**: Re-run paralinguistic appropriateness evaluation using four-category discretization (adding "Very High/Very Low" bins) and compare results to the current three-category system, measuring whether finer-grained acoustic features improve model discrimination and reduce the universal challenge ceiling.
