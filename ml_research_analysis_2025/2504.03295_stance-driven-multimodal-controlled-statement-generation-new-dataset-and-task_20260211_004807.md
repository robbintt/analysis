# Stance-Driven Multimodal Controlled Statement Generation: New Dataset and Task

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.03295
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03295

- Primary result: Introduces StanceGen2024 dataset and SDMG framework for multimodal stance-controlled text generation in political discourse

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces StanceGen2024, the first dataset for multimodal stance-controlled text generation in political discourse. The dataset contains 1,039 Twitter posts from Kamala Harris and Donald Trump with 25,025 associated comments, each annotated with stance labels ("favor" or "against"). The authors propose the Stance-Driven Multimodal Generation (SDMG) framework, which integrates weighted fusion of multimodal features and stance guidance to improve semantic consistency and stance control. Experiments show that the fine-tuned LLaVA-SDMG model achieves high stance controllability (0.9257 controllability score) while maintaining fluency and relevance, outperforming pure text or visual baselines.

## Method Summary
The method involves fine-tuning LLaVA-v1.5-7b on the StanceGen2024 dataset using LoRA with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 optimization. The SDMG framework employs Task-Sensitive Attention (TSA) for weighted multimodal feature fusion, combining visual features from CLIP ViT with textual features from CLIP Text. The model is trained on an 8:2 split with a learning rate of 2e-4, batch size of 16, and maximum sequence length of 2048. Stance guidance is provided through instruction fine-tuning, where the model learns to generate stance-aligned responses given multimodal inputs and stance labels.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned LLaVA-SDMG achieves 0.9257 controllability score, significantly outperforming text-only and visual-only baselines
- Multimodal input improves stance controllability but increases perplexity compared to text-only models
- The SDMG framework demonstrates strong semantic consistency and relevance in generated responses
- Visual modality provides primarily topic context rather than stance signal in the dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Task-Sensitive Attention (TSA) improves stance controllability by dynamically weighting cross-modal features based on stance relevance.
- Mechanism: Cross-modal attention computes Query from visual features (V) and Key from textual features (T), then generates weighted visual features that are fused with text. This allows the model to prioritize stance-critical modality information during generation.
- Core assumption: Visual and textual modalities contribute unequally to stance expression, and dynamic weighting captures this variation better than static fusion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "integrates weighted fusion of multimodal features and stance guidance to improve semantic consistency and stance control"
  - [section 5.3] "TSA utilizes cross-modal attention to model the relationships between visual and textual modalities"
  - [corpus] Related work on multimodal stance detection (PolitiSky24, Twitter Stance Election 2020) suggests cross-modal integration improves stance tasks, but specific TSA mechanism evidence is limited to this paper
- Break condition: If visual content in the dataset predominantly provides topic context rather than stance signals (as authors note), TSA's dynamic weighting may not yield gains over simpler fusion.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Instruction fine-tuning with LoRA on LLaVA transfers stance control capabilities more effectively than zero-shot prompting.
- Mechanism: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes a small subset of parameters while preserving pretrained knowledge, learning the mapping between (multimodal input + stance label) → stance-aligned response from the StanceGen2024 training split.
- Core assumption: The dataset contains learnable patterns connecting multimodal context to stance expression that generalize within the political domain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "fine-tuned LLaVA-SDMG model achieves high stance controllability (0.9257 controllability score)"
  - [section 6.3] "LoRA fine-tuning enables the model to learn real social media commenting styles"
  - [corpus] Cross-topic generalization concerns noted in related work (Understanding and Mitigating Political Stance Cross-topic Generalization in LLMs) suggest fine-tuning on narrow domains may not transfer broadly
- Break condition: If training data stance annotations contain systematic bias or noise (Cohen's Kappa = 0.719 indicates ~28% disagreement area), LoRA may amplify annotation artifacts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CLIP-based visual encoding with target prompt vectors focuses attention on stance-relevant image regions.
- Mechanism: A learnable target prompt vector (P_V) is inserted into the ViT input sequence, guiding the visual encoder to attend to specific targets (e.g., political figures) rather than background elements.
- Core assumption: Politically salient visual features (candidate faces, campaign imagery) carry stance signals that complement text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "target prompt vector P_V is introduced as a learnable parameter to help the model focus on specific targets within the image"
  - [section 6.4.2] "images in the candidates' posts within our dataset predominantly convey the topic, with minimal impact on stance"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on prompt-guided visual encoding for stance; this appears novel to this framework
- Break condition: The authors' own analysis suggests visual content provides topic context more than stance signal, potentially limiting the marginal contribution of sophisticated visual encoding.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Cross-Modal Attention**
  - Why needed here: TSA mechanism uses scaled dot-product attention between visual Query and textual Key vectors; understanding attention weight computation is prerequisite to debugging fusion quality.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the attention weight is computed as QK^T/√d rather than raw dot product?

- Concept: **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - Why needed here: Fine-tuning uses LoRA with rank decomposition; understanding how LoRA modifies weight updates versus full fine-tuning is essential for hyperparameter selection.
  - Quick check question: What is the trade-off between LoRA rank size and knowledge retention from pretraining?

- Concept: **Stance Detection vs. Stance-Controlled Generation**
  - Why needed here: This paper addresses generation (producing stance-aligned text), not classification; confusion between tasks leads to inappropriate evaluation metrics.
  - Quick check question: Why is accuracy an insufficient metric for controlled generation tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (Text, Image, Stance Label) → Visual Encoder (CLIP ViT + Target Prompt P_V) → V ∈ R^dv → Textual Encoder (CLIP Text) → T ∈ R^dt → TSA Module (Q=W_q·V, K=W_k·T, V_f=W_v·V) → Attention Weight (softmax(QK^T/√d)·V_f) → Multimodal Fusion (Concat(V_f, T) or V_f + T) → LLaVA Backbone (with LoRA adapters) → Output (Stance-aligned response text)

- Critical path: Image → ViT patches → Target Prompt integration → TSA cross-modal attention → Fused features → LLaVA generation. Errors in prompt vector initialization or attention scaling propagate directly to controllability.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Concatenation vs. addition fusion: Concat preserves modality boundaries but doubles dimension; addition is parameter-efficient but may cause signal interference.
  - Visual encoding depth: Deeper ViT layers capture semantics but may overfit to dataset-specific visual patterns (candidates' faces).
  - LoRA rank: Higher rank improves adaptation but risks catastrophic forgetting of general VL capabilities.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low controllability (<0.7) with high perplexity: TSA not learning cross-modal dependencies; check attention weight distributions.
  - High controllability but low relevance: Model overfits to stance token; reduce stance guidance weight or increase diversity penalty.
  - CMSS near zero: Visual features not integrated; verify TSA projection matrices are updating during training.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation on fusion strategy**: Compare Concat(V_f, T) vs. V_f + T vs. V_f only vs. T only on controllability and relevance metrics to quantify modality contributions.
  2. **Target prompt initialization sensitivity**: Initialize P_V with zeros, random normal, and CLS token embedding; measure impact on CMSS and controllability to validate visual encoding contribution.
  3. **Annotation noise robustness**: Train on subsets with progressively noisier stance labels (simulate by flipping 10-30% of labels) to establish reliability bounds given Kappa = 0.719.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper explicitly notes in its Limitations section that the StanceGen2024 dataset focuses on the 2024 U.S. presidential election, limiting its generalizability to other political contexts or topics. This constraint raises questions about cross-domain applicability and the framework's performance in non-U.S. political discourse or non-political domains.

## Limitations
- Dataset scope is limited to two U.S. political candidates from a single election cycle, raising generalization concerns
- Visual modality provides primarily topic context rather than stance signal, potentially undermining multimodal claims
- Annotation quality shows moderate inter-annotator disagreement (Cohen's Kappa = 0.719)
- Lack of human evaluation for nuanced aspects like argument quality and political sophistication

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Technical implementation of Task-Sensitive Attention and LoRA fine-tuning is well-specified with clear equations and reproducible details.
**Medium Confidence**: Empirical results showing improved controllability (0.9257) are supported by data, but dataset limitations and annotation quality concerns temper generalizability.
**Low Confidence**: Claims about multimodal integration's superiority are undermined by authors' finding that visual content provides minimal stance signal.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Topic Transfer Experiment**: Evaluate the fine-tuned model on stance generation tasks for political figures from different countries or historical periods to test whether stance control capabilities transfer beyond the Harris-Trump domain.
2. **Visual Ablation Study**: Conduct systematic experiments removing images from the input while varying the proportion of stance-relevant vs. topic-relevant visual content to quantify the actual contribution of the visual modality to stance control performance.
3. **Annotation Reliability Analysis**: Perform uncertainty quantification on stance labels by training multiple models with different annotation subsets and measuring variance in controllability scores to establish confidence intervals for the reported 0.9257 metric.
