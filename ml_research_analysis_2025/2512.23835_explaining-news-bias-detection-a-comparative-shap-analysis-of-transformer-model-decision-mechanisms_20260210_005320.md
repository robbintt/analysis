## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comparative interpretability analysis of two transformer-based bias detection models for news text using SHAP-based explanations. The study finds that while both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model exhibits a reversal in attribution strength where false positives show higher SHAP magnitude than true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness that contributes to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63% fewer false positives. The analysis reveals that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues, highlighting the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) with TextExplainer and Text masker to generate token-level attributions for two transformer models on news bias detection. The methodology uses stratified sampling (100 instances each for TP, FP, TN, FN) from a 26,237-instance test set, aggregates token-level attributions to word-level using tokenizer boundary markers, and analyzes attribution patterns through mean absolute SHAP comparisons. Statistical validation uses McNemar's test for model comparison, and the analysis examines how evaluative language is contextualized differently between the baseline bias detector and domain-adaptive pre-trained model.

## Key Results
- Domain-adaptive model (DA-RoBERTa-BABE-FT) produces 63% fewer false positives than bias detector
- Bias detector shows reversed attribution pattern where FP instances have higher SHAP magnitudes than TP instances
- Both models attend to similar evaluative language, but differ in contextual integration and framing interpretation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Domain-adaptive pre-training produces better calibration between feature attribution strength and prediction correctness.
- Mechanism: DA-RoBERTa-BABE-FT exhibits attribution patterns where correct predictions show stronger SHAP magnitudes than errors, while bias-detector shows the opposite pattern—a reversal indicating strong but misleading internal signals.
- Core assumption: SHAP magnitudes faithfully reflect model decision processes rather than explanation artifacts.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "The bias detector model exhibits a reversal in attribution strength where false positives show higher SHAP magnitude than true positives"; [section 4.2]: "This pattern of bias-detector indicates that incorrect predictions (false positives) exhibit stronger individual word signals than correct predictions"; [corpus]: Limited direct corpus evidence on SHAP-based bias detection comparisons; related work (Krieger et al., 2022) shows domain-adaptive pre-training improves media bias tasks generally.
- Break condition: If SHAP values don't faithfully represent model decision-making (per Jain & Wallace 2019 debate on attention-explanation), this mechanism may not generalize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Architectural and training differences affect how evaluative language is contextualized in bias judgments.
- Mechanism: Both models attend to evaluative language, but DA-RoBERTa-BABE-FT interprets expressions in relation to framing and attribution patterns, while bias-detector treats evaluative language as standalone bias evidence.
- Core assumption: The behavioral difference stems from domain-adaptive pre-training exposure to journalistic text patterns.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions"; [section 4.4]: "DA-RoBERTa-BABE-FT assigns relatively greater importance to framing and reporting verbs"; [corpus]: Weak direct corpus evidence on mechanism; Krieger et al. (2022) cited for domain-adaptive approach but without interpretability analysis.
- Break condition: If the difference arises from random initialization or fine-tuning dynamics rather than domain pre-training.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: False positive errors arise from discourse-level ambiguity (context insensitivity) rather than explicit bias cue detection.
- Mechanism: Function words and temporal markers show higher attribution in false positives, indicating models struggle with contextual interpretation when explicit semantic bias cues are limited.
- Core assumption: Word-level SHAP aggregation captures the relevant linguistic features for error analysis.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues"; [section 4.4]: "DA-RoBERTa-BABE-FT's errors arise in structurally or discourse-level ambiguous cases where explicit semantic bias cues are limited"; [section B.0.2]: "Function and temporal words dominate false positives, with intensifiers ('highly', 'very') showing positive signals"; [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence on discourse-level ambiguity in bias detection errors.
- Break condition: If discourse-level features are proxies for other linguistic phenomena not captured by word-level analysis.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations)**
- Why needed here: Core interpretability method; understanding marginal contribution attribution is essential for interpreting the paper's claims.
- Quick check question: If a word has SHAP value 0.14 for the bias class, what does this tell you about its contribution relative to other words in the sentence?

**Concept: False Positive Rate vs. Precision Tradeoff**
- Why needed here: The paper reports 63% fewer false positives for DA-RoBERTa-BABE-FT; understanding this metric is critical for deployment decisions in editorial contexts.
- Quick check question: Why might higher precision (fewer false positives) be preferred over higher recall in journalistic bias detection, even if overall F1 is lower?

**Concept: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training**
- Why needed here: Key architectural difference between the two models that may explain attribution alignment differences.
- Quick check question: What additional signal does domain-adaptive pre-training on news text provide beyond standard task-specific fine-tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
SHAP TextExplainer with Text masker → token-level attributions → token-to-word aggregation pipeline → stratified sampling framework (TP/FP/TN categories, max 100 each) → statistical testing layer (McNemar's test for model comparison)

**Critical path:**
1. Tokenize input with model-specific tokenizer (max 256 tokens)
2. Generate SHAP values via TextExplainer with background dataset (subset of test set)
3. Aggregate token-level to word-level using tokenizer boundary markers
4. Analyze by prediction category with mean absolute SHAP comparisons

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Token vs. word-level: Aggregation preserves additivity but may obscure subword patterns; necessary for interpretability
- Sample size: 100 instances per category balances coverage vs. computational cost (SHAP is expensive)
- Background dataset selection: Affects baseline expectations and attribution magnitudes

**Failure signatures:**
- Reversed attribution: FP SHAP magnitude > TP magnitude indicates systematic over-flagging
- Category invariance: Similar lexical patterns between TP and FP suggests context-insensitive decision boundary
- Function word dominance in FP: Indicates discourse-level confusion rather than semantic bias detection

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Replicate SHAP analysis on held-out instances to verify attribution patterns generalize beyond sampled subset
2. Compare token-level vs. word-level aggregation to quantify information loss from aggregation
3. Test whether calibration-aware training (temperature scaling) reduces attribution reversal in bias-detector

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent do context-sensitive modeling architectures reduce the conflation of emotional evaluative language with actual social bias?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that "Future work should explore context-sensitive modeling approaches" because current models often treat evaluative language as sufficient evidence for bias, leading to errors.
- Why unresolved: Current transformer models struggle to distinguish between legitimate reporting of emotional events and subjective biased framing, particularly in neutral journalistic content.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of a context-aware model that maintains high recall while significantly reducing false positives on sentences containing emotional descriptors in neutral contexts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can calibration-aware training strategies correct the observed "reversal in attribution strength" where false positives exhibit higher SHAP magnitudes than true positives?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly suggest "calibration-aware training strategies" in the conclusion as a path to improving robustness and fixing the misalignment between prediction correctness and internal evidence strength.
- Why unresolved: The study finds that standard training causes models to assign stronger internal evidence (SHAP values) to incorrect predictions than correct ones, indicating overconfidence in errors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating that calibrated models produce SHAP distributions where true positives yield consistently higher attribution magnitudes than false positives.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do alternative explanation methods that capture non-linear interactions outperform word-level SHAP in diagnosing discourse-level ambiguity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The appendix notes that "word-level SHAP cannot capture" non-linear interactions or missing contextual features, limiting the ability to fully explain why specific function words trigger false positives.
- Why unresolved: The current analysis relies on additive feature attribution, which may miss complex linguistic dependencies that drive errors in ambiguous discourse contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study using hierarchical explainability methods or interaction detection on the same false positive instances to reveal hidden linguistic triggers.

## Limitations

- **SHAP explanation fidelity**: Reliance on SHAP values as faithful representations of model decision-making is uncertain given the Jain & Wallace (2019) debate on attention-explanation correspondence.
- **Sample size and selection bias**: 100 instances per category from 26,237 total may not generalize to broader distribution of bias detection errors.
- **Linguistic analysis granularity**: Word-level attribution may miss important discourse-level phenomena that operate at phrase, sentence, or document level.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Claims about relative model performance (63% fewer false positives for DA-RoBERTa-BABE-FT) and the general observation that attribution strength differs between correct and incorrect predictions.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim about domain-adaptive pre-training producing better calibration between attribution and prediction correctness is plausible but depends on the assumption that SHAP values accurately reflect decision processes.

**Low Confidence**: The specific mechanism claiming that false positives arise from "discourse-level ambiguity" rather than explicit bias cues is speculative and may be an overgeneralization from word-level patterns.

## Next Checks

1. **Held-out instance replication**: Apply the SHAP analysis to a separate, randomly selected subset of 100 instances per category from the test set (not used in the original analysis) to verify that the attribution patterns are stable and not artifacts of the initial sampling strategy.

2. **Cross-model comparison on shared errors**: Identify instances where both models make the same prediction (TP, FP, TN, or FN) and compare their SHAP attribution patterns to determine whether the attribution differences are consistent across prediction outcomes or specific to particular linguistic contexts.

3. **Human validation of SHAP attributions**: Conduct a small-scale human evaluation where journalists or domain experts review the top-K words by SHAP magnitude for false positive instances and rate whether these attributions align with their judgment of why the model incorrectly flagged neutral content.
