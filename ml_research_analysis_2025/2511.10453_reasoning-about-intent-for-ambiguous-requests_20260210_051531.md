# Reasoning About Intent for Ambiguous Requests
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10453
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10453
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: Proposed approach achieves 78.1% recall and 61.0% full coverage on ambiguous questions in Abg-CoQA, and 82.4% recall with 74.1% full coverage on Ambrosia

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of ambiguity in natural language queries where users omit critical details, causing large language models to implicitly commit to single interpretations that may frustrate users or create safety risks. The authors propose a novel approach that generates multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single response, with each interpretation explicitly disambiguating the original question. By training with reinforcement learning using customized reward functions, the method optimizes for comprehensive coverage of valid interpretations while maintaining precision on unambiguous queries. The approach demonstrates strong performance on both conversational QA and text-to-SQL parsing tasks, showing significant improvements over baseline methods in capturing valid answers.

## Method Summary
The proposed method tackles ambiguous natural language queries by generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single response, where each interpretation explicitly disambiguates the original question. The approach is trained using reinforcement learning with customized reward functions that optimize for recall on ambiguous questions and precision on unambiguous ones. The method processes queries to identify potential ambiguities and generates corresponding interpretations that clarify the user's intent, followed by answers for each interpretation. This structured output approach promotes transparency through explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and produces structured outputs suitable for downstream applications. Experiments on conversational QA and text-to-SQL parsing demonstrate that the approach achieves higher coverage of valid answers compared to baseline methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves 78.1% recall and 61.0% full coverage on ambiguous questions in Abg-CoQA
- Achieves 82.4% recall with 74.1% full coverage on Ambrosia dataset
- Human evaluation shows over 90% alignment accuracy between predicted interpretations and their answers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method succeeds by explicitly modeling the ambiguity in natural language queries rather than committing to a single interpretation. By generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs, it captures the full space of possible user intents. The reinforcement learning framework with customized rewards ensures the model balances between comprehensive coverage of valid interpretations and precision on unambiguous queries. The explicit disambiguation in interpretations provides transparency to users about how their ambiguous questions were interpreted, while the structured output format enables downstream applications to handle multiple possible interpretations systematically.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning with Custom Rewards**: Used to train the model to balance recall on ambiguous questions with precision on unambiguous ones. Needed to optimize the trade-off between comprehensive coverage and accuracy. Quick check: Verify reward function weights properly balance precision and recall objectives.
- **Explicit Disambiguation Generation**: The model generates interpretations that explicitly clarify ambiguous queries. Needed to provide transparency and enable users to understand how their questions were interpreted. Quick check: Measure interpretation clarity and alignment with answers through human evaluation.
- **Structured Output Generation**: Produces interpretation-answer pairs in a structured format. Needed to enable systematic handling of multiple interpretations by downstream applications. Quick check: Validate structured output format compatibility with downstream systems.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Query -> Ambiguity Detection -> Interpretation Generation -> Answer Generation -> Multiple Interpretation-Answer Pairs
**Critical Path**: The core pipeline processes ambiguous queries through interpretation generation followed by answer generation for each interpretation, with reinforcement learning optimizing the entire process.
**Design Tradeoffs**: Single-step generation provides efficiency but may limit the depth of disambiguation compared to multi-step approaches. The approach trades some precision for comprehensive coverage of valid interpretations.
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on highly complex ambiguity scenarios with multiple ambiguous entities or relationships; sensitivity to reward function hyperparameters; potential degradation when scaling to very large ambiguity spaces.
**First Experiments**:
1. Test performance on synthetic ambiguous data with known ground truth interpretations
2. Evaluate human alignment accuracy between generated interpretations and their corresponding answers
3. Measure coverage of valid answers compared to baseline methods on benchmark datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The reinforcement learning setup's sensitivity to reward function hyperparameters is not thoroughly explored
- Performance on real-world ambiguous queries remains to be validated, as evaluation primarily focuses on synthetic ambiguous data
- Scalability to more complex ambiguity scenarios with multiple ambiguous entities or relationships is unclear

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core methodology of generating multiple interpretations with explicit disambiguation is technically sound and well-executed
- **Medium confidence**: The empirical results on benchmark datasets are convincing, but generalizability to production scenarios requires further validation
- **Medium confidence**: The human evaluation methodology appears rigorous, though the sample size and diversity of evaluators could be expanded

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a user study with real-world ambiguous queries to assess the practical utility and user satisfaction with the multiple-interpretation responses
2. Test the method's performance on datasets with naturally occurring ambiguity rather than synthetic ambiguity injection
3. Evaluate the approach's robustness when deployed as a service under varying load conditions and with diverse user populations
