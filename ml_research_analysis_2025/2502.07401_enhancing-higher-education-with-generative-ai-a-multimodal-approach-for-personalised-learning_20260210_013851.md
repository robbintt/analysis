# Enhancing Higher Education with Generative AI: A Multimodal Approach for Personalised Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.07401
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07401
- **Reference count:** 11
- **Key outcome:** None specified

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multimodal generative AI system for higher education that combines text-based Q&A, image-based diagram interpretation, and file-based sentiment analysis. The architecture leverages ChatGPT API for text interactions, Google Bard for image analysis and diagram-to-code conversion, and NLP/ML models for processing course evaluations. The system aims to address the limitations of unimodal chatbots by handling diverse educational content formats while reducing instructor workload through automated feedback analysis.

## Method Summary
The system implements three distinct modules: a text-based chatbot using ChatGPT API fine-tuned on course materials (past exams and quizzes in JSONL format), an image-based module using Google Bard API for visual interpretation and diagram-to-code conversion, and a file analyzer for sentiment analysis, emotion classification, keyword extraction, and summarization of course evaluations. The interface is built with Gradio, supporting text input, image upload, and PDF upload functionality. The architecture routes different input types to specialized models and synthesizes outputs for the user.

## Key Results
- Proof-of-concept demonstration of multimodal educational chatbot architecture
- Implementation of diagram-to-code conversion capability (ERD to SQL)
- Automated sentiment and emotion analysis of course evaluations
- Integration of three specialized modules via Gradio interface

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Multimodal input processing expands the range of addressable educational queries beyond unimodal chatbots
- **Mechanism:** Architecture routes different input types to specialized models (ChatGPT for text, Bard for images) then synthesizes outputs
- **Core assumption:** Students encounter non-textual educational content requiring interpretation
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Leveraging ChatGPT API for nuanced text-based interactions and Google Bard for advanced image analysis"
- **Break condition:** If image-to-code conversion accuracy degrades across diverse diagram styles/formats

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Fine-tuning on course-specific materials improves response relevance for domain-specific queries
- **Mechanism:** Supervised fine-tuning with prompt-completion pairs from anonymized course data
- **Core assumption:** Course materials contain stable patterns that can be captured through fine-tuning
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.1] "data drawn from past exams and classroom quizzes... are used to train the model"
- **Break condition:** If fine-tuning data is too sparse, outdated, or biased toward specific formats

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Automated sentiment analysis reduces instructor cognitive load and surfaces actionable feedback patterns
- **Mechanism:** NLP/ML pipeline extracts sentiment scores, emotion distributions, keyword frequency from uploaded PDFs
- **Core assumption:** Student feedback contains consistent sentiment signals that can be reliably detected
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.3] "key indicators such as emotional distribution, sentiment scores... can be extracted from student feedback"
- **Break condition:** If sentiment models misclassify domain-specific academic language

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multimodal model routing**
  - **Why needed here:** System dispatches inputs to different APIs based on modality; essential for debugging and extending architecture
  - **Quick check question:** Given a user upload containing both an image and a text question, which model handles the query and how is the response synthesized?

- **Concept: Fine-tuning data formatting**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper uses JSON-style prompt-completion pairs; incorrect formatting causes training failures
  - **Quick check question:** What is the required structure for each training example in the ChatGPT fine-tuning pipeline?

- **Concept: Sentiment analysis limitations**
  - **Why needed here:** File analyzer relies on sentiment detection, which struggles with negation, sarcasm, and domain-specific jargon
  - **Quick check question:** How might the phrase "This assignment was sick" be misclassified by a standard sentiment model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Frontend (Gradio) -> Text module (ChatGPT API) -> Image module (Google Bard API) -> File analyzer (NLP/ML pipeline)
- **Critical path:** User submits input via Gradio → Input type detected → Routed to appropriate API → API response returned → Displayed in interface → (For files) Analyzer pipeline runs → Metrics and summary generated
- **Design tradeoffs:** External APIs reduce development overhead but introduce latency, cost, and privacy concerns; fine-tuning improves domain relevance but requires maintenance; diagram-to-code works for ERDs but accuracy varies across styles
- **Failure signatures:** Image module returns generic descriptions for unfamiliar diagram styles; file analyzer produces inconsistent sentiment scores; text module generates formulaic responses to novel questions
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Upload 20 diverse ERDs from different diagramming tools; measure syntactic correctness and semantic fidelity of generated SQL
  2. Run file analyzer on 100 manually labeled student comments; compute precision/recall for sentiment classification
  3. Compare response quality between fine-tuned and base ChatGPT model on held-out course questions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How robust is the diagram-to-code conversion feature when handling diverse visual styles and notations?
- **Basis in paper:** Authors acknowledge "diversity in style, format, and detail of diagram produced by different software tools" makes uniform processing "technically difficult"
- **Why unresolved:** Proof-of-concept provides single ERD example without quantitative accuracy metrics across varied datasets
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmark evaluation testing conversion accuracy using diagrams from different software tools and STEM disciplines

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the multimodal chatbot yield measurable improvements in student learning outcomes?
- **Basis in paper:** Abstract claims tool contributes to "improved educational outcomes" but lacks pedagogical experiments or user studies
- **Why unresolved:** Research focuses on system architecture rather than measuring actual educational impact
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Controlled study comparing assessment performance and engagement levels between multimodal chatbot users and control group

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What are the privacy and data security implications of uploading sensitive student evaluations to third-party APIs?
- **Basis in paper:** File analyzer processes course evaluations but lacks discussion on data governance or risks of sending sensitive data to external models
- **Why unresolved:** Methodology describes PDF upload capability without addressing privacy maintenance or API provider data retention
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Security and privacy risk analysis detailing data handling protocols, anonymization techniques, and compliance with educational data protection standards

## Limitations
- No quantitative evaluation or empirical validation of system performance
- Heavy reliance on external APIs without disclosing performance characteristics or privacy considerations
- Fine-tuning approach lacks details on dataset size, preprocessing, and comparative analysis
- Sentiment analysis and diagram-to-code conversion capabilities asserted but not validated against ground truth data

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Multimodal architecture concept and division of labor between specialized models is technically sound
- **Medium confidence:** Practical utility of multimodal input processing for educational contexts based on stated need for handling non-textual content
- **Low confidence:** Claims about sentiment analysis accuracy, fine-tuning effectiveness, and diagram-to-code conversion reliability due to lack of empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Quantitative evaluation design:** Develop comprehensive framework measuring response accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction across all modules with comparison to unimodal baselines
2. **Cross-diagram style robustness test:** Systematically evaluate diagram-to-code conversion accuracy across 50+ diverse diagram types from different tools and formats
3. **Fine-tuning effectiveness study:** Conduct ablation study comparing fine-tuned vs. base ChatGPT performance on course-specific questions using automated metrics and human expert evaluation
