# Encouraging Good Processes Without the Need for Good Answers: Reinforcement Learning for LLM Agent Planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19598
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19598

- Primary result: RLTR achieves 8%-12% improvement in planning performance through tool-use completeness rewards

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of optimizing LLM agent planning capabilities in industrial settings where traditional end-to-end reinforcement learning fails due to unreliable rewards and credit assignment issues. The authors introduce RLTR (Reinforcement Learning with Tool-use Rewards), a framework that decouples planning from summarization and focuses on optimizing the planning module using tool-use completeness as a single reward signal. This approach eliminates the need for verifiable final answers, providing more reliable training signals for complex planning tasks.

The key insight is that by treating planning as a separate objective and using tool-use completeness as the reward, the framework can effectively train agents to generate better intermediate plans without requiring perfect final outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that RLTR outperforms end-to-end baselines by 8%-12% in planning performance, with this improvement translating to 5%-6% better final response quality. The method shows robust performance across different reinforcement learning algorithms including PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++.

## Method Summary
RLTR addresses the limitations of end-to-end reinforcement learning for LLM agent planning by decoupling the planning and summarization modules. The framework optimizes only the planning module using a single reward signal based on tool-use completeness, which measures whether the agent successfully invokes the required tools in the correct sequence. By eliminating the need for verifiable final answers, RLTR provides more reliable training signals in scenarios where evaluating final responses is challenging. The method treats the summarization module as a fixed component during training, focusing all optimization efforts on improving the planning capability through better tool invocation patterns.

## Key Results
- RLTR achieves 8%-12% improvement in planning performance compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning baselines
- The enhanced planning capability translates to 5%-6% increase in final response quality
- Performance improvements are consistent across different reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, GRPO, REINFORCE++)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by recognizing that planning quality can be effectively evaluated through tool-use patterns rather than final outputs. By decoupling planning from summarization, RLTR isolates the learning signal to focus on whether the agent correctly identifies and sequences tool invocations. The tool-use completeness reward provides a more granular and reliable signal than end-to-end evaluation of final answers, which may be influenced by factors unrelated to planning quality such as summarization errors or domain-specific knowledge gaps.

## Foundational Learning
- Reinforcement Learning Basics: Understanding policy optimization, value functions, and exploration-exploitation tradeoffs is essential for grasping how RLTR trains the planning module. Quick check: Can identify the role of the policy gradient in updating the planning component.
- Tool-use Completeness Metrics: The framework relies on measuring whether required tools are invoked in correct sequences. Quick check: Can explain how tool-use completeness differs from traditional success metrics.
- Module Decoupling Principles: Understanding why separating planning from summarization improves learning stability. Quick check: Can articulate the credit assignment problem that RLTR solves.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Planning Module -> Tool-use Evaluation -> Reward Signal -> Policy Update

**Critical Path:** The agent generates a plan → tools are invoked according to the plan → tool-use completeness is evaluated → reward signal guides planning module updates

**Design Tradeoffs:** RLTR sacrifices end-to-end optimization for more reliable intermediate rewards, accepting that perfect final answers may not be achievable during training in exchange for better planning capabilities.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor tool-use completeness scores despite syntactically correct plans indicate the need for better tool selection strategies; high tool-use completeness but poor final answers suggest summarization module issues.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare planning module performance with and without decoupling from summarization
2. Test different reward formulations (binary vs. graded tool-use completeness)
3. Evaluate generalization across different tool ecosystems and API structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness depends on the assumption that tool-use completeness reliably indicates planning quality
- Performance gains from the ToolBench benchmark may not fully generalize to complex real-world industrial settings
- The approach does not adequately address scenarios with ambiguous tool-use patterns or multiple valid tool sequences

## Confidence
**High confidence:** Core methodological contribution, technical implementation, and theoretical justification for module separation

**Medium confidence:** Performance claims based on ToolBench benchmark, generalizability to real-world industrial settings

**Low confidence:** Performance in scenarios with ambiguous tool-use patterns, scalability to domains with hundreds of heterogeneous tools

## Next Checks
1. Deploy RLTR in an industrial setting with non-standard APIs and complex tool interactions to verify practical utility gains

2. Evaluate performance across diverse tool environments beyond ToolBench, particularly those with ambiguous tool-use patterns

3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate RLTR's ability to distinguish between complete and effective tool use in challenging scenarios
