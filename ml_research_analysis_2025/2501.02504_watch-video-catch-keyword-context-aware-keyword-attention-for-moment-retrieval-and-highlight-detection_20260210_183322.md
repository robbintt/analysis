# Watch Video, Catch Keyword: Context-aware Keyword Attention for Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.02504
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02504
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Primary result:** State-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA benchmarks using video context-aware keyword attention

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses video moment retrieval and highlight detection by proposing a video context-aware keyword attention module. The key innovation is recognizing that keyword importance varies with video context, and capturing this variation through video context clustering and keyword weight detection. The proposed keyword-aware contrastive learning enhances alignment between visual and textual features. Experimental results on QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements over existing approaches, with the method achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics including R1, mAP, and HIT@1.

## Method Summary
The method extracts video and text features using pre-trained models, then clusters video clips using a temporally-weighted FINCH algorithm to obtain cluster representatives. These clusters are compared against text features to compute keyword weights, where words that strongly match only specific clusters receive higher weights. The weighted text features are then used in a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture for both moment retrieval and highlight detection. A keyword-aware contrastive loss is introduced that weights text features before computing clip-text and video-text similarities, improving fine-grained alignment between modalities.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights with R1@0.5: 69.04, mAP@Avg: 47.69
- Outperforms existing methods on TVSum with mAP: 71.66 and HIT@1: 71.14
- Demonstrates significant improvements on Charades-STA with R1@0.7: 61.22
- Ablation studies show keyword-aware contrastive learning provides 1-2% performance gains over standard contrastive approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Keyword importance varies inversely with visual frequency—words appearing less frequently in video context become more discriminative for localization. The video context clustering module groups similar video clips via temporally-weighted FINCH algorithm, producing cluster representatives that enable efficient comparison against text features to identify which words are contextually rare and thus informative. Core assumption: Discriminative keywords for moment retrieval correlate with visual rarity within the specific video, not just semantic importance in isolation.

### Mechanism 2
Softmax-pooled similarity between clustered video features and text features produces effective keyword weights without explicit supervision. Cosine similarity matrix between text features and clustered video features is computed, then column-wise softmax followed by max-pooling yields keyword weight vector—words strongly matching only specific clusters receive higher weights. Core assumption: Important keywords exhibit non-uniform similarity across video clusters; uniformly similar words are less discriminative.

### Mechanism 3
Keyword-aware contrastive learning improves fine-grained alignment by weighting text features before computing clip-text and video-text similarities. Two losses operate: clip-keyword contrastive loss pulls ground-truth clip features closer to keyword-weighted text features while pushing background clips away; video-keyword contrastive loss performs global contrastive learning across the dataset using keyword-weighted representations. Core assumption: Background clips may still correlate with individual keywords; weighting prevents misalignment from treating all background equally.

## Foundational Learning

- **Contrastive Learning (InfoNCE-style):** Why needed here: Both clip-keyword and video-keyword contrastive losses use softmax-normalized similarity with negative sampling to align modalities. Quick check question: Can you explain why the denominator in Eq. 6 sums over all clips rather than just negative samples?

- **Video Moment Retrieval Task Definition:** Why needed here: Understanding that MR localizes (start, end) timestamps while HD assigns saliency scores clarifies why different prediction heads are needed. Quick check question: Why might a moment with high saliency (HD) not correspond to a precise query match (MR)?

- **Clustering for Temporal Representation:** Why needed here: FINCH algorithm groups clips hierarchically; understanding temporal weighting explains why scene boundaries emerge naturally. Quick check question: How does temporally-weighted clustering differ from k-means on frame features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video → Encoder → Fv → Context Clustering (FINCH) → Fcv → Keyword Weight Detection → wt → Fwt = wt × Ft → Modality Interaction (Transformer) → MR Decoder and HD Projection

- **Critical path:** Fv → FINCH clustering → Fcv → similarity with Ft → wt → Fwt → transformer interaction → predictions. The keyword weight wt is the key innovation; if clustering fails or similarity computation is noisy, downstream alignment degrades.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Number of clusters c: Too few loses granularity; too many increases computation and may overfit to noise. Paper does not specify tuning procedure.
  - Temperature τ in softmax: Controls sharpness of keyword attention. Not ablated in paper.
  - λkw = 0.3: Balances contrastive loss contribution. Table S1 shows 0.1-0.9 range is robust (67.94-69.29 R1@0.5).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Uniform keyword weights (all ~1/N): Indicates clustering produced homogeneous Fcv or similarity computation failed.
  - Cluster assignments showing no scene transitions: Temporal weighting may be insufficient or video is single-scene.
  - Lck converging but MR performance stagnant: Suggests keyword weights not discriminating meaningful words.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity check: Visualize wt for sample queries against ground-truth video segments; verify high weights correspond to discriminative words (reproduce Figure 4).
  2. Clustering ablation: Replace FINCH with fixed-length temporal segments; measure impact on QVHighlights val (expect ~1-2% drop based on Table 4 VCKA contribution).
  3. Loss disentanglement: Train with Lck only, Lvk only, and both; verify synergistic effect matches Table 5 pattern.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies developing a sophisticated audio integration approach as an important direction for future work, noting that the current method uses a simplified audio representation without a detailed audio-specific framework. The authors also suggest exploring how the stability of the video context clustering module affects performance in videos with ambiguous or rapid scene transitions.

## Limitations
The core assumption that keyword importance inversely correlates with visual frequency within videos may not generalize to all video domains. The temporally-weighted FINCH clustering algorithm is critical but not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging. Performance gains are primarily demonstrated on QVHighlights, with smaller improvements on Charades-STA and TVSum, suggesting potential dataset-specific effects.

## Confidence
**High:** The general framework of video context clustering followed by keyword weight detection is technically sound and produces interpretable results. The ablation studies showing keyword-aware contrastive learning benefits are reproducible and convincing.

**Medium:** The claim that inverse visual frequency determines keyword importance needs more validation across diverse video domains. The specific weighting scheme (softmax over cluster similarities) appears effective but could be an implementation artifact rather than fundamental insight.

**Low:** The exact implementation details of temporally-weighted FINCH clustering remain unclear, making faithful reproduction uncertain. The optimal temperature parameter τ for softmax weighting is unspecified.

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain validation: Apply the method to a video dataset with different visual characteristics (e.g., sports highlights or instructional videos) to test if the inverse-frequency assumption holds beyond the QVHighlights domain.

2. Keyword weight visualization: Systematically visualize keyword weights wt across multiple videos and queries to verify that high weights consistently correspond to contextually rare but query-relevant words, not just any semantically important terms.

3. Baseline comparison with fixed weights: Implement a variant using uniform keyword weights (wt = 1/N) to quantify the actual contribution of the learned weighting mechanism versus the baseline contrastive learning approach.
