# Regret Lower Bounds for Decentralized Multi-Agent Stochastic Shortest Path Problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.04594
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04594
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Establishes first Ω(√K) regret lower bounds for Dec-MASSP problems under linear function approximation

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes the first regret lower bounds for decentralized multi-agent stochastic shortest path (Dec-MASSP) problems with linear function approximation. The authors construct hard-to-learn instances where optimal policies remain tractable, overcoming challenges of exponential state spaces, coupled agent dynamics, and intractable value functions. They prove that any decentralized learning algorithm suffers Ω(√K) regret over K episodes, matching existing upper bounds up to constant and logarithmic factors. This work characterizes the fundamental learning complexity in decentralized control and provides theoretical insights for designing efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a novel construction of hard-to-learn instances for Dec-MASSP problems that maintain tractability of optimal policies. They address the exponential state space challenge through careful design of transition dynamics and reward structures. The analysis incorporates coupled agent dynamics and accounts for the inherent complexity of value functions in multi-agent settings. By establishing lower bounds through information-theoretic arguments and carefully constructed adversarial instances, they demonstrate that decentralized algorithms cannot achieve better than Ω(√K) regret, regardless of the specific algorithmic approach used.

## Key Results
- First regret lower bounds established for Dec-MASSP problems under linear function approximation
- Proves Ω(√K) regret lower bound for any decentralized learning algorithm over K episodes
- Lower bound matches previously reported upper bounds up to constant and logarithmic factors
- Recovers single-agent results as a special case, demonstrating increased difficulty in multi-agent settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying this work relies on constructing adversarial instances that are simultaneously hard to learn but tractable for optimal policy computation. By exploiting the coupled nature of multi-agent dynamics and the exponential growth of state space, the authors create scenarios where decentralized agents must make exploratory decisions that inherently incur regret. The linear function approximation framework allows for precise control over the information available to learning algorithms while maintaining computational tractability for optimal solutions.

## Foundational Learning
- Stochastic Shortest Path Problems: Why needed - forms the underlying decision-making framework; Quick check - verify transition dynamics satisfy stochastic shortest path properties
- Decentralized Multi-Agent Control: Why needed - models the collaborative setting without central coordination; Quick check - confirm each agent operates with local information only
- Linear Function Approximation: Why needed - provides tractable representation while maintaining expressiveness; Quick check - verify feature matrix has full column rank
- Regret Analysis: Why needed - quantifies learning efficiency over time; Quick check - ensure regret accumulates sublinearly with episodes
- Information-theoretic Lower Bounds: Why needed - establishes fundamental limits on learning performance; Quick check - verify application of change-of-measure arguments

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Dec-MASSP instance construction -> Linear function approximation setup -> Information-theoretic analysis -> Regret lower bound derivation

Critical Path:
The critical path flows from problem instance construction through to the final regret bound. Each component builds upon the previous: the instance construction must enable tractable optimal policies, the function approximation must preserve problem structure, the information-theoretic analysis must capture decentralized learning challenges, and the regret derivation must properly account for coupled agent dynamics.

Design Tradeoffs:
The construction trades between instance hardness and tractability of optimal policies. Making instances too easy would yield trivial lower bounds, while making them too hard would prevent analytical tractability. The linear function approximation balances representational power against computational feasibility.

Failure Signatures:
- If optimal policies become intractable, the lower bound construction fails
- If linear approximation loses critical problem structure, the bounds may not apply
- If information-theoretic arguments don't properly capture decentralized constraints, the regret bounds may be loose

First Experiments:
1. Verify tractability of optimal policy computation on constructed instances
2. Test whether decentralized algorithms actually achieve Ω(√K) regret on these instances
3. Confirm that single-agent special case recovers known lower bounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- The hard-to-learn instances, while claimed tractable, may have unclear practical feasibility for real-world verification
- Exponential state space challenge is addressed theoretically but may pose computational barriers in implementation
- Exact constant factors and their dependence on problem parameters are not precisely characterized

## Confidence
High: Theoretical proofs are rigorous and mathematically sound
Medium: Practical implications and real-world applicability remain to be validated empirically

## Next Checks
1. Implement the constructed hard instances to verify tractability claims and measure computational complexity
2. Conduct empirical studies comparing different decentralized algorithms against the theoretical lower bounds
3. Extend the analysis to settings with communication constraints between agents to better reflect practical limitations
