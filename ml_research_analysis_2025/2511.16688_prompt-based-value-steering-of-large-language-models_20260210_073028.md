# Prompt-Based Value Steering of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.16688
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16688
- **Reference count:** 39
- **Primary result:** Value steering through prompts alone is feasible, with a baseline prompt yielding 0.57 alignment score versus 0.83 for an explicit value-conditioned prompt.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method to evaluate how well a prompt can steer a language model toward specific human values, using Schwartz's theory of basic values. The approach uses a value classifier to measure the presence of values in both input text and model-generated responses, computing a score based on gains, losses, and retention of values. This allows comparing prompt candidates systematically without modifying the model. The method was tested on a Wizard-Vicuna variant, using the Commonsense-Dialogues dataset and the ValuesNet DeBERTa v3 classifier. A baseline prompt yielded a value alignment score of 0.57, while an explicit value-conditioned prompt achieved 0.83, showing that value steering through prompts alone is feasible. The framework is general and can be adapted to different value theories and applications.

## Method Summary
The method evaluates prompt-based value steering by comparing a baseline prompt ("You are having a conversation. Generate a short response.") with a candidate prompt that explicitly conditions on target values ("You are having a conversation, your responses are based on a specific value. Generate a short response that aligns with the value '<VALUE>'."). For each dialogue and target value, the method extracts initial values from the last two turns using a value classifier, generates a response with the prompt candidate, extracts values from the response, and computes gains, retains, losses, and neutrals. The final score is an arithmetic mean of normalized per-value scores, accounting for the initial value distribution in the dataset.

## Key Results
- Baseline prompt alignment score: 0.57
- Explicit value-conditioned prompt alignment score: 0.83
- Improvement range across values: 0.10 (conformity) to 0.27 (self-direction)
- Values showing strongest improvement: universalism, achievement, security, self-direction, stimulation, hedonism
- Values showing weakest improvement: conformity, tradition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Explicitly conditioning prompts on target values increases the presence of those values in generated outputs without modifying model weights.
- **Mechanism:** The prompt candidate encodes the target value as a semantic instruction ("Generate a short response that aligns with the value '<VALUE>'"), which the LLM's attention mechanisms prioritize during token generation. The instruction becomes part of the context window, biasing the probability distribution toward tokens associated with the specified value.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-trained model has already internalized value-relevant patterns from its training corpus and can retrieve them when prompted.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts"
  - [section 4] The candidate prompt improved from score 0.57 (baseline) to 0.83, with gains increasing and losses decreasing across all values
  - [corpus] VISPA (arXiv:2601.12758) similarly explores pluralistic alignment via "value selection and activation" without model modification, suggesting prompt-based value conditioning is a recognized approach
- **Break condition:** If the model lacks sufficient pre-training exposure to a value concept, or if the value is too abstract for the model to operationalize (e.g., "conformity" showed weakest improvement at ΔS_v = 0.10), the mechanism degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The scoring methodology disentangles value gains from retention, enabling unbiased comparison across datasets with different initial value distributions.
- **Mechanism:** By computing Gains (value absent in input → present in output), Retains (present → present), Losses (present → absent), and Neutrals (absent → absent) separately, the score S_v accounts for the baseline value frequency. Normalization (Ŝ_v) maps scores to [0,1] using theoretical min/max bounds.
- **Core assumption:** The value detector reliably identifies value presence; its validation F1 of 0.66 (Table 2) means ~34% of classifications may be incorrect.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2] Equations 1-8 formalize the decomposition into Gains, Retains, Losses, Neutrals with coefficients α=β=1, γ=-1, δ=-0.5
  - [section 7] "this measure takes into account the values present in an initial text from a dataset... thus remaining unbiased by the initial value distribution"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison for this specific scoring decomposition found
- **Break condition:** If the value detector has systematic bias (e.g., higher accuracy for "conformity" at 0.82 vs. "security" at 0.51), cross-value score comparisons become unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Values that are concrete and action-oriented are more steerable than abstract or socially-contextual values.
- **Mechanism:** Concrete values (e.g., "achievement," "security") have more explicit behavioral manifestations in training data, creating stronger associations in the model's representation space that can be triggered by prompts. Abstract values require broader contextual inference.
- **Core assumption:** The relationship between value concreteness and steerability is causal, not correlational.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4] "Certain values, such as universalism, achievement, and security, benefited more from the candidate prompt. This may be due to their more concrete or action-oriented nature"
  - [section 4] "values like conformity showed less improvement, possibly due to their abstract or socially contextual nature"
  - [corpus] EVALUESTEER (arXiv:2510.06370) similarly finds varying steerability across different value dimensions, though without the concreteness hypothesis
- **Break condition:** This is a post-hoc interpretation, not directly tested. If concreteness were manipulated experimentally and failed to predict steerability, the mechanism would break.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values
  - **Why needed here:** This provides the taxonomy of 10 values (benevolence, universalism, self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement, power, security, conformity, tradition) that the entire evaluation framework operates over. Without understanding that values are organized in a circular structure reflecting compatibilities and conflicts, you cannot interpret why certain values might be harder to steer simultaneously.
  - **Quick check question:** If a prompt asks a model to maximize both "stimulation" and "security," what does Schwartz's theory predict about the difficulty?

- **Concept:** Token-level Probability Conditioning in LLMs
  - **Why needed here:** The mechanism assumes that prompts shift the probability distribution of generated tokens. Understanding that LLMs are next-token predictors with attention over the full context explains why adding "align with value X" to the prompt can systematically change outputs without weight updates.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model's training corpus rarely discussed "tradition," would you expect the prompt "align with tradition" to be effective? Why or why not?

- **Concept:** Classifier-based Evaluation of Generative Outputs
  - **Why needed here:** The entire scoring system depends on a value classifier (ValuesNet DeBERTa v3) that operates independently of the target LLM. Understanding that this introduces a second model's biases—and that its F1=0.66 validation score means substantial measurement error—is critical for interpreting results.
  - **Quick check question:** If the value classifier has 70% accuracy and you observe a 26-point score improvement (0.57 → 0.83), what portion of that improvement might be classifier noise vs. real steering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** [Test Dataset D] -> [Value Detector] -> Initial value labels E_v; [Prompt Candidate C(v,d)] + [Target LLM] -> Generated response; [Value Detector] -> Response value labels; [Score Calculator] -> Gains, Retains, Losses, Neutrals -> S_v -> Final Score S

- **Critical path:**
  1. Validate the value detector on a held-out test set before running the procedure (paper achieved F1=0.66 on ValueNet test set)
  2. Extract initial values from dataset using only the final turns (paper used last 2 turns to weight generated content while retaining context)
  3. Generate responses with temperature=0 for reproducibility
  4. Apply same value extraction to responses
  5. Compute S_v per value, then aggregate to final S

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Temperature=0 vs. >0:** Paper uses temperature=0 for reproducibility, but this may underestimate steerability in more creative/open-ended contexts
  - **Last 2 turns vs. full dialogue:** Focusing on last 2 turns increases signal from generated text but may lose context needed for some values (e.g., "tradition" may require longer context)
  - **Treating neutral + misaligned as equivalent:** The paper collapses "neutral" and "opposed to value" into one category (Eval_v = 0), losing signal about negative steering

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Score S_v ≈ random baseline: Prompt is not being attended to; check prompt template formatting for the specific LLM
  - High Losses_v: Model is overwriting input values; prompt may be too directive or conflict with input
  - Score variance across values: May indicate value detector accuracy differences (check Table 2) rather than true steerability differences
  - Score doesn't improve across prompt iterations: Value detector may be unreliable, or model lacks capacity for that value

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Run the exact procedure with the baseline prompt ("You are having a conversation." / "Generate a short response.") on a 100-sample subset of Commonsense-Dialogues to verify your pipeline produces similar per-value scores to Table 3
  2. **Value detector ablation:** Test whether the choice of extraction window (last 2 turns vs. full dialogue vs. generated text only) changes the final score by >0.05 to quantify sensitivity
  3. **Cross-model transfer:** Apply the same candidate prompt to a different LLM (e.g., Llama-3 or Mistral) to test the claim that the procedure is "model-agnostic"—expect different baseline scores but similar relative improvement if the mechanism generalizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How does explicitly maximizing a single target value affect the expression of other compatible or conflicting values within Schwartz's circular structure?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "It is also possible to study the effect of maximising one value across all the others, possibly using numerical data for the labels instead of categorical ones."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current methodology aggregates results into a single score per value, masking the potential trade-offs or correlations between values (e.g., maximizing "security" might suppress "self-direction").
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A correlation analysis of value scores when the model is conditioned on individual values, quantifying how steering affects the broader value profile.

- **Question:** Does distinguishing between neutral and actively misaligned outputs improve the reliability of the prompt steering score?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note a limitation: "the evaluation method treats neutral and misaligned outputs equally. Further work could treat misalignment with a value as a separate label."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current binary classification (presence vs. absence) treats a neutral response the same as an opposing one, potentially conflating lack of relevance with active value violation.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Re-evaluating the prompt scores using a three-class classifier (aligned, neutral, opposed) to see if the ranking of prompt candidates changes significantly.

- **Question:** To what extent does the framework generalize to other LLM architectures without requiring recalibration of the scoring coefficients?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors claim the procedure is "model-agnostic," but the Limitations section admits "The analysis focuses on a single model."
  - **Why unresolved:** The scoring weights ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$) were set intuitively, and it is unproven whether these specific parameters remain optimal across different model sizes or architectures.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying the identical procedure and coefficients to diverse model families (e.g., GPT, Llama, Mistral) to verify if the steering scores remain consistent and interpretable.

## Limitations

- **Measurement error:** The value classifier's F1=0.66 validation score means substantial noise in value detection, creating a lower bound on detectable steering effects.
- **Context window limitations:** Using only the last two turns of dialogues may systematically underrepresent values requiring longer context (e.g., "tradition").
- **Cross-value comparison reliability:** Per-value classifier accuracy ranges from 0.50-0.82, making observed steerability differences potentially attributable to measurement error rather than true differences.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism that explicit value conditioning in prompts increases value-aligned outputs (score improvement from 0.57 to 0.83). This is directly measurable and the experimental design is straightforward. The scoring decomposition (Gains, Retains, Losses, Neutrals) is mathematically sound given the assumptions about classifier reliability.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that concreteness/action-orientation predicts steerability. This is an interpretive conclusion drawn from observed patterns (universalism, achievement, security improved more than conformity) but not directly tested. The mechanism assumes causal relationships between value properties and model representations without experimental manipulation of value properties.
- **Low Confidence:** Cross-value comparisons of steerability. Given the ValuesNet accuracy differences (0.50-0.82 across values), observed differences in score improvements (ΔS_v ranging from 0.10 to 0.27) cannot be confidently attributed to true steerability differences versus classifier bias. Any claim that "value X is harder to steer than value Y" requires either (a) value-independent classifier validation or (b) acknowledgement that measurement error may dominate observed differences.

## Next Checks

1. **Classifier Error Sensitivity Analysis:** Using the 10K-test split with human-annotated values (where available), compute the expected score distribution under random generation versus perfect steering, accounting for classifier F1=0.66. Determine the minimum detectable steering effect (e.g., must be >2× the classifier's false positive rate to be statistically significant).

2. **Cross-Model Generalization Test:** Apply the same candidate prompt to a different LLM architecture (e.g., Llama-3-8B or Mistral-7B) using identical Commonsense-Dialogues samples and value extraction procedure. Compare the relative improvement (baseline → candidate) across models—if the mechanism is truly prompt-based rather than model-specific, the improvement magnitude should be similar despite different absolute scores.

3. **Value Property Manipulation Experiment:** Design controlled prompts that manipulate concreteness (e.g., "respond with specific actions that show [value]" vs. "respond in a way that reflects [value]") while keeping the target value constant. Test whether concreteness manipulation predicts steerability differences within the same value category, directly validating or falsifying the concreteness hypothesis.
