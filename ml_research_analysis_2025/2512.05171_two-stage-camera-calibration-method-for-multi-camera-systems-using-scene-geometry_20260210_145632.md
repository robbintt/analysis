# Two-Stage Camera Calibration Method for Multi-Camera Systems Using Scene Geometry

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05171
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05171
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Two-stage method enables multi-camera calibration without floor plans, physical access, or synchronized video using single static images and scene geometry

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of calibrating multi-camera systems in real-world conditions where traditional methods fail due to lack of accurate floor plans, inability to place calibration patterns, or lack of synchronized video streams. The proposed two-stage method uses visible scene geometry (parallel, perpendicular, vertical lines, and equal-length segments) annotated by an operator on single static images from each camera. In Stage 1, partial calibration estimates roll, pitch, and focal length from geometric primitives, projecting the Effective Field of View (EFOV) into a base 3D coordinate system. In Stage 2, the operator interactively adjusts EFOV polygon position, scale, and rotation to align with a floor plan or virtual calibration elements, determining the remaining extrinsic parameters (camera position and yaw). The method requires only static images, eliminates the need for physical access or synchronized video, and provides high accuracy with visual control.

## Method Summary
The two-stage approach calibrates multi-camera systems using single static images and operator-annotated scene geometry. Stage 1 estimates roll from vertical line vanishing points and determines pitch and focal length through numerical optimization that enforces geometric constraints on annotated lines. This produces a perspective-corrected EFOV polygon in the base coordinate system. Stage 2 uses interactive polygon manipulation where scaling determines camera height, translation provides position, and rotation yields yaw. The method works without floor plans by using virtual calibration elements projected across cameras for cross-validation.

## Key Results
- Enables calibration without floor plans, physical access, or synchronized video
- Uses only single static images per camera with operator annotation
- Provides high accuracy with visual verification through interactive polygon manipulation
- Web service implementation enables practical deployment
- Comparative analysis confirms applicability in previously infeasible scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Vertical line vanishing points directly determine camera roll angle without requiring any scene metric information.
- **Mechanism:** Multiple lines that are parallel in 3D space (vertical architectural elements like wall corners, doorframes) converge to a single vanishing point in the 2D image. The vector from the image center to this vanishing point encodes the roll rotation around the optical axis. This is computed via standard projective geometry: vertical lines in the base coordinate system should appear parallel after compensating for roll.
- **Core assumption:** The operator correctly identifies truly vertical elements in the scene (walls, columns, doorframes).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "partial calibration...based on an operator's annotation of natural geometric primitives (parallel, perpendicular, and vertical lines...)"
  - [Section III, Stage 1]: "Since both annotation options involve outlining several lines on the image that are vertical in space (and thus parallel to each other), these lines will have a vanishing point on the image. By finding this vanishing point, the desired roll rotation angle can subsequently be computed"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus validation found; vanishing point methods are standard in calibration literature but not explicitly compared in neighbors.
- **Break condition:** If no true verticals exist in the scene (e.g., irregular architecture, outdoor natural environments), or if radial distortion corrupts straight lines before correction, roll estimation fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pitch and focal length can be jointly estimated by enforcing geometric constraints on projected lines without known scene dimensions.
- **Mechanism:** After roll removal, the optimizer searches for pitch and focal values that make annotated lines satisfy their stated spatial relationships when back-projected to the horizontal plane. The cost function measures deviation from: parallelism, perpendicularity, or equal length preservation. Numerical optimization (likely gradient-based via Scipy) finds the parameter combination where projected geometry matches the operator's intent.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: The default initialization (camera at 3m height, origin position, zero yaw) is close enough for the optimizer to converge to the correct local minimum.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "This allows estimating key parameters (roll, pitch, focal length) and projecting the camera's Effective Field of View (EFOV) onto the horizontal plane"
  - [Section III, Stage 1]: "the pitch rotation angle and the focal length focal can be determined by solving an optimization problem using numerical optimization methods"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus connection; neighboring papers (Calib3R, Omni-LIVO) address calibration but use different approaches (deep learning, sensor fusion).
- **Break condition:** If the cost function has multiple local minima (ambiguous scene geometry), or if annotation errors violate the geometric assumptions significantly, optimization converges to incorrect parameters.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** EFOV polygon scale manipulation corresponds linearly to camera height estimation, enabling full extrinsic calibration from 2D interactive adjustments.
- **Mechanism:** Stage 1 produces a perspective-corrected EFOV polygon but with unknown absolute scale and position. When the operator scales the polygon, the scaling factor directly maps to camera height: if polygon is scaled by 1.5×, the default 3m height becomes 4.5m. Translation provides (x0, y0); rotation provides yaw. This decoupling works because perspective distortion was already removed.
- **Core assumption:** The EFOV polygon accurately represents the true field of view boundary on the floor plane (operator traced it correctly).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The operator adjusts their position, scale, and rotation to align them with the floor plan or, in its absence, using virtual calibration elements"
  - [Section III, Stage 2]: "the scaling factor applied to the polygon during the operator's scaling action is determined, and the mounting height is multiplied by this same factor"
  - [corpus]: No corpus papers use this specific EFOV-polygon-scale-to-height mapping approach.
- **Break condition:** If the floor is not flat (ramps, stairs), or if the camera tilts significantly (non-horizontal principal ray), the EFOV polygon projection becomes invalid.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pinhole Camera Model**
  - Why needed here: This is the mathematical foundation linking 3D world coordinates to 2D pixel coordinates through intrinsic (focal length) and extrinsic (position, rotation) parameters.
  - Quick check question: Given a 3D point at (1, 2, 0) in world coordinates and a camera at (0, 0, 3) looking straight down with focal length 500px, where does it project on the image?

- **Concept: Vanishing Points**
  - Why needed here: Stage 1 relies on detecting vanishing points from vertical lines to compute roll angle—the first parameter estimated in the pipeline.
  - Quick check question: If three lines in an image converge to point (320, 120) and the image center is (640, 360), what does this suggest about camera orientation?

- **Concept: Perspective-Corrected Projection**
  - Why needed here: The EFOV polygon must be "undistorted by perspective" (as stated in the paper) for the scale-to-height mapping in Stage 2 to be valid.
  - Quick check question: Why can't you determine absolute distance from a single 2D image without additional constraints like known object size or known camera height?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Frontend (React/JS): Image annotation interface for drawing geometric primitives and EFOV polygons; 2D polygon manipulation controls; multi-camera visualization dashboard
  - Backend (Django + NumPy + Scipy + OpenCV): Vanishing point computation; numerical optimizer for pitch/focal; coordinate transformation functions (`f_3d→pix`, `f_pix→3d`); distortion correction module
  - Storage: Camera model parameters (7 values per camera: x0, y0, z0, roll, pitch, yaw, focal); annotation data (line segments, polygons)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Distortion correction (preprocessing, required before any line annotation)
  2. Line annotation → vanishing point → roll
  3. Optimization loop → pitch + focal
  4. EFOV annotation → perspective-corrected polygon projection
  5. Interactive polygon manipulation → (x0, y0, z0, yaw)
  6. Validation via virtual calibration elements

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Two-stage separation enables operation without floor plans but requires more operator interaction than fully automatic methods
  - Using default height (3m) for Stage 1 optimization reduces DOFs but assumes installation follows common practices
  - Virtual calibration elements allow plan-free calibration but require overlapping coverage or recognizable scene features across cameras
  - Single-image requirement minimizes data needs but prevents temporal consistency checks

- **Failure signatures:**
  - EFOV polygon appears distorted (not rectilinear) after Stage 1 → pitch/focal optimization failed or distortion correction incomplete
  - Virtual calibration elements don't align across cameras → Stage 2 extrinsic estimation has errors; check polygon placement consistency
  - Vertical lines don't converge to single vanishing point → radial distortion not corrected, or lines aren't truly vertical in scene
  - Tracked objects appear at wrong floor positions → calibration drift; likely height (z0) or yaw error

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate Stage 1 on synthetic data: Generate images with known camera parameters, annotate lines, verify roll/pitch/focal recovery accuracy within reported tolerance.
  2. Height estimation sensitivity: Systematically vary operator scaling inputs and compare estimated heights against ground truth (measure actual camera mounting heights).
  3. Multi-camera consistency test: Use virtual calibration element placement in overlapping regions of 3+ cameras; measure reprojection error across all views to quantify full-system accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the quantitative accuracy of the proposed method in terms of reprojection error and 3D position error, and how does it compare to pattern-based calibration under controlled conditions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims "high accuracy" and "precise multi-camera tracking" but relies primarily on visual verification through demonstration videos rather than rigorous quantitative metrics such as mean reprojection error (pixels) or ground-truth position deviation (meters).
- Why unresolved: No numerical error analysis or benchmark comparison against established calibration methods (e.g., Zhang's checkerboard method) is provided in the text.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments with known ground-truth camera parameters, reporting standard metrics (RMS reprojection error, position/rotation errors) compared to pattern-based calibration.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does operator annotation variability affect calibration accuracy, and what annotation precision is required for acceptable results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Adherence to the geometric rules in space is ensured by the operator's skill" but does not quantify sensitivity to annotation errors or inter-operator variability.
- Why unresolved: No error propagation analysis or user study examining how small deviations in line annotation (angle, position) affect estimated parameters (roll, pitch, focal length).
- What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis varying annotation perturbations systematically, plus multi-operator studies measuring calibration variance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Which annotation option (parallel/perpendicular lines vs. equal-length segments) provides more robust and accurate calibration, and under what scene conditions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Two distinct annotation options are described with different geometric primitives, but no comparative analysis of their relative accuracy, convergence properties, or applicability to different scene types is provided.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents both options equivalently without empirical comparison.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments across diverse indoor scenes, measuring calibration accuracy and failure rates for each annotation option.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How sensitive is the two-stage calibration to residual radial distortion, and what level of distortion correction is required before Stage 1?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes "radial image distortion must be eliminated before applying this method" and briefly mentions tangential distortion, but does not quantify acceptable distortion thresholds or failure modes.
- Why unresolved: No analysis of how residual distortion after correction affects vanishing point estimation and subsequent parameter optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with varying residual distortion levels, measuring degradation in calibration accuracy.

## Limitations
- Geometric assumption fragility: Relies heavily on accurate operator annotation of geometric primitives, which may not exist in scenes lacking clear parallel/perpendicular structures
- Missing implementation details: Critical mathematical formulations are omitted, including vanishing point-to-roll conversion formula and optimization initialization strategy
- Scale ambiguity resolution: Depends on operator's ability to correctly scale the EFOV polygon, which may be challenging without metric reference points

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The vanishing point mechanism for roll estimation is well-established in computer vision literature and mathematically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The optimization approach for pitch and focal length estimation is plausible but lacks detailed formulation; convergence to global optimum is not guaranteed in ambiguous scenes
- **Low confidence**: The EFOV-polygon-to-height mapping is innovative but untested in varied real-world scenarios; accuracy depends heavily on operator skill and scene geometry

## Next Checks
1. **Synthetic data validation**: Generate synthetic camera images with known parameters, apply the full two-stage pipeline, and quantify parameter recovery accuracy across varying scene complexities
2. **Operator skill impact study**: Compare calibration accuracy across operators with different experience levels using the same scene to measure the method's sensitivity to annotation quality
3. **Multi-camera consistency stress test**: Deploy the system in a challenging environment (e.g., outdoor parking lot with minimal geometric primitives) and evaluate cross-camera alignment accuracy using virtual calibration elements
