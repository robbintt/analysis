# LLaMA-Based Models for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08649
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08649
- Reference count: 10
- Fine-tuned Orca 2 13B achieves state-of-the-art performance across all ABSA tasks, surpassing previous benchmarks by up to 8%

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning large language models for compound aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks. The study evaluates LLaMA 2 and Orca 2 models across four ABSA tasks and eight English datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot, and fully fine-tuned settings. The fine-tuned Orca 2 model, particularly its 13B parameter version, achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks and datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over previous benchmarks. The research highlights the substantial performance gap between fully fine-tuned models and few-shot approaches, while also identifying opinion term prediction as the most challenging aspect for these models.

## Method Summary
The study employs LLaMA 2 and Orca 2 models for ABSA tasks, evaluating them across zero-shot, few-shot, and fully fine-tuned settings. Four compound ABSA tasks are examined: aspect sentiment classification (ASC), aspect opinion co-extraction (AOCE), aspect-based sentiment triplet extraction (ABST), and aspect sentiment opinionated term triplet extraction (ASOT). The evaluation uses eight English datasets covering restaurant and laptop reviews. Fine-tuning is performed with task-specific prompts and labeled data, while zero-shot and few-shot experiments use prompt engineering with varying numbers of demonstrations. The models are compared against established ABSA benchmarks to assess performance improvements.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Orca 2 13B achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four ABSA tasks and eight datasets
- Fully fine-tuned models outperform zero-shot and few-shot approaches by substantial margins
- Opinion term prediction emerges as the most challenging aspect, showing higher error rates than other ABSA subtasks
- Performance improvements reach up to 8% over previous state-of-the-art benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Fine-tuning large language models for ABSA tasks enables the models to learn domain-specific linguistic patterns and sentiment expressions that are not captured in general pretraining. The compound nature of the tasks requires understanding relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities, which the large model capacity of Orca 2 can represent effectively when trained on task-specific data. The superior performance of the 13B parameter model suggests that model scale is crucial for capturing the nuanced semantic relationships required for accurate ABSA. The task-specific fine-tuning allows the models to develop specialized attention patterns for identifying aspect-opinion pairs and their corresponding sentiment orientations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA)**: Why needed - to understand sentiment at the aspect level rather than document level; Quick check - can identify "food was excellent" vs "service was poor" in same review
- **Fine-tuning vs few-shot learning**: Why needed - to understand when large amounts of labeled data are necessary; Quick check - compare performance with 100 vs 1000 labeled examples
- **Zero-shot prompting**: Why needed - to establish baseline capabilities without task-specific training; Quick check - test model on unseen ABSA tasks with only natural language instructions
- **Compound ABSA tasks**: Why needed - to handle real-world scenarios requiring multiple ABSA subtasks simultaneously; Quick check - verify model can extract aspect, opinion, and sentiment in single pass
- **Model scaling laws**: Why needed - to understand relationship between parameter count and task performance; Quick check - compare 7B vs 13B parameter models on same tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input Text -> Tokenizer -> LLaMA/Orca Model -> Task-Specific Head -> ABSA Output

**Critical Path**
Text encoding → Transformer layers → Attention mechanism → Classification head → Sentiment/aspect extraction

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Model size vs computational efficiency: 13B parameters offer best performance but require significant resources
- Zero-shot vs fine-tuning: No training data needed for zero-shot but performance suffers dramatically
- Compound vs individual tasks: Joint training captures task relationships but increases complexity

**Failure Signatures**
- Opinion term prediction errors indicate difficulty with nuanced language understanding
- Zero-shot performance drops reveal limitations of prompt engineering alone
- Cross-dataset performance variations suggest domain sensitivity

**3 First Experiments**
1. Compare zero-shot performance across all four ABSA tasks to establish baseline capabilities
2. Evaluate few-shot learning with 5, 10, and 20 examples per task to measure sample efficiency
3. Test fine-tuned models on out-of-domain datasets to assess generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to English datasets, limiting multilingual applicability
- Comparison focuses primarily on LLaMA 2 and Orca 2 without extensive benchmarking against other contemporary LLMs
- High computational resources required for fine-tuning large models may limit practical deployment

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Fine-tuned Orca 2 13B outperforms previous SOTA models by up to 8% across multiple datasets and tasks
- **Medium Confidence**: Opinion term prediction identified as most challenging aspect based on error analysis
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to non-English languages or unseen domains remains speculative

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multilingual evaluation using the DimABSA dataset and other non-English ABSA benchmarks
2. Implement ablation studies to isolate contributions of different architectural components to performance gains
3. Test models on out-of-domain datasets and adversarial examples targeting opinion term detection weaknesses
