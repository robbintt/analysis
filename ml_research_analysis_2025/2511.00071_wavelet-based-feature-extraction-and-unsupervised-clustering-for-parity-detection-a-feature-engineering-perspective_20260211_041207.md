# Wavelet-Based Feature Extraction and Unsupervised Clustering for Parity Detection: A Feature Engineering Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.00071
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00071
- Reference count: 10
- This study investigates whether wavelet-based feature extraction and unsupervised clustering can detect number parity (odd/even) without using modular arithmetic.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether wavelet-based feature extraction and unsupervised clustering can detect number parity (odd/even) without using modular arithmetic. Integers are converted to binary signals, decomposed using the Haar wavelet transform, and three statistical features (energy, L2 norm, mean absolute value) are extracted at multiple decomposition levels. Each feature is clustered using k-means (k=2), and an oddness score is derived from cluster assignments to classify numbers. Experiments on integers 0–10,000 achieve a maximum accuracy of 69.67%, significantly above the 50% random baseline. Results indicate that structural differences in binary representations are partially captured by wavelet features, revealing latent patterns correlated with parity, though the approach cannot fully replace symbolic arithmetic reasoning.

## Method Summary
The methodology converts integers to binary signals, applies Haar wavelet transform, extracts statistical features (energy, L2 norm, mean absolute value) at multiple decomposition levels, and uses k-means clustering (k=2) to derive oddness scores for parity classification. The approach processes integers 0-10,000 through this pipeline and evaluates classification accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieved maximum accuracy of 69.67% on parity detection task
- Performance significantly exceeds 50% random baseline
- Wavelet features partially capture structural differences in binary representations correlated with parity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Wavelet decomposition reveals structural patterns in binary representations that correlate with parity. The Haar wavelet transform captures both frequency and location information in the binary signal, while statistical features extract relevant patterns at different scales. These patterns are then clustered to identify latent structures that distinguish odd from even numbers.

## Foundational Learning
- Binary signal representation: Understanding how integers map to binary signals is fundamental to applying wavelet transforms to discrete mathematical concepts
- Wavelet transform basics: Knowledge of how Haar wavelets decompose signals into approximation and detail coefficients is essential for feature extraction
- Statistical feature extraction: Energy, L2 norm, and mean absolute value calculations provide compact representations of wavelet coefficients
- K-means clustering: Understanding unsupervised clustering mechanics is crucial for grouping similar feature patterns
- Oddness scoring: The method of deriving classification scores from cluster assignments bridges unsupervised learning to supervised-like evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Integer -> Binary Signal -> Haar Wavelet Transform -> Feature Extraction -> K-means Clustering -> Oddness Score -> Classification
Critical path: The wavelet transform and feature extraction stages are critical, as they directly determine the quality of input to clustering
Design tradeoffs: The choice of Haar wavelet versus other wavelet families, and the selection of statistical features versus alternative feature types, represent key design decisions that impact performance
Failure signatures: Sub-50% accuracy would indicate that the approach fails to capture any meaningful patterns in binary representations
First experiments:
1. Validate wavelet decomposition on known binary patterns
2. Test clustering performance on synthetic binary signals with embedded structure
3. Evaluate individual feature contributions through ablation studies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Cannot fully replace symbolic arithmetic reasoning for parity detection
- Limited to binary signal domain, may not generalize to other discrete problems
- Moderate performance suggests incomplete capture of parity-indicating patterns

## Confidence
High: methodology and core findings
Medium: broader claims about signal-processing techniques in discrete symbolic domains

## Next Checks
1. Test the methodology on additional discrete classification tasks (e.g., primality, divisibility) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the relative importance of each feature and decomposition level
3. Compare performance against alternative feature extraction methods (e.g., Fourier transforms, statistical moments) to benchmark wavelet-based approaches
