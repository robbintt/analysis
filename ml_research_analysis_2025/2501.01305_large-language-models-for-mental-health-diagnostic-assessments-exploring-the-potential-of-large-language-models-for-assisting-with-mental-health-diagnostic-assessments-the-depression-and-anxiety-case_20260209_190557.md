# Large Language Models for Mental Health Diagnostic Assessments: Exploring The Potential of Large Language Models for Assisting with Mental Health Diagnostic Assessments -- The Depression and Anxiety Case

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.01305
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01305
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LLMs approach human annotation quality in mental health diagnostic assessments for depression and anxiety using PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for assisting with mental health diagnostic assessments, specifically for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using standardized questionnaires (PHQ-9 and GAD-7). The research explores both prompting and fine-tuning techniques to guide proprietary and open-source LLMs in adhering to clinical assessment procedures. The study introduces a fine-tuned model, DiagnosticLlama, and provides annotated datasets evaluated by expert clinicians. Results show that LLMs approach human annotation quality in both prompting and fine-tuning settings, with proprietary models (GPT-4o-mini) and open-source models (mixtral-8x7b) performing comparably. However, fine-tuning LLMs for this task proves challenging and requires significant resources. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs for mental health diagnostic assistance while highlighting the need for further development to match clinician reasoning and ensure safe integration into healthcare settings.

## Method Summary
The study uses exemplar-based prompting and supervised fine-tuning to guide LLMs in extracting text spans from social media posts that align with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 symptom criteria. The PRIMATE dataset of social media posts serves as input, with GPT-4o used to generate initial annotations that are then validated by expert clinicians to create ground truth datasets. Both proprietary models (GPT-4o-mini) and open-source models (mixtral-8x7b, DiagnosticLlama) are evaluated using hits@k metrics and standard classification metrics. The fine-tuned DiagnosticLlama model is created by fine-tuning Mentalllama on expert-validated datasets using Hugging Face AutoTrain.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o-mini and mixtral-8x7b achieve ~0.92-0.93 F1-scores using exemplar-based prompting
- Proprietary and open-source models perform comparably in diagnostic span extraction
- Fine-tuning LLMs for this task proves challenging and requires significant resources
- Mentalllama initially "reiterates the input verbatim" but improves after fine-tuning to DiagnosticLlama
- Expert clinicians validate model outputs to create high-quality "silver standard" datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
In-context learning via exemplar-based prompting enables LLMs to map unstructured patient text to structured diagnostic criteria (PHQ-9/GAD-7) with high accuracy. By providing the model with explicit symptom definitions and input-output examples in the prompt, the model conditions its attention mechanism to identify specific text spans relevant to the questionnaire items, rather than relying solely on general pre-training.

### Mechanism 2
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert-validated datasets aligns open-source models with the specific output schema required for clinical annotation, though it is resource-intensive. SFT adjusts model weights to minimize loss on the specific task of extracting symptom spans, theoretically allowing a smaller, specialized model to mimic the behavior of larger proprietary models within a narrow domain.

### Mechanism 3
A "Human-in-the-Loop" validation mechanism stabilizes the ground truth, allowing models to approximate expert consensus rather than raw statistical likelihoods. Expert clinicians filter model-generated annotations, creating a high-quality "silver standard" dataset that serves as the optimization target for both evaluation and fine-tuning, anchoring the model's behavior to clinical logic.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: PHQ-9 and GAD-7 Diagnostic Scales**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire architecture is built around mapping text to these specific 9-item (depression) and 7-item (anxiety) questionnaires. Understanding the specific symptom clusters is required to interpret the model's output spans.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between the PHQ-9 symptom "Little interest or pleasure in doing things" and the GAD-7 symptom "Not being able to stop or control worrying"?

- **Concept: Span Extraction vs. Classification**
  - **Why needed here:** The task is not just "Is this person depressed?" (classification) but "Which specific sentences indicate depression?" (span extraction). This distinction dictates the choice of evaluation metrics and output formats.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model correctly predicts "Depression" but highlights the wrong sentence as evidence, which evaluation metric would penalize it most: F1-score or Hits@k?

- **Concept: Prompt Engineering (Exemplar-based)**
  - **Why needed here:** The study highlights that zero-shot prompting fails to adhere to clinical procedures, while exemplar-based prompting significantly improves performance.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might providing a "chain-of-thought" or "reasoning" prompt potentially improve the clinical validity of the output compared to a direct instruction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Social media posts (PRIMATE dataset) -> LLMs (GPT-4o, Mixtral, Llama-3.1) -> Exemplar-based prompts (JSON formatted) containing PHQ-9/GAD-7 definitions + few-shot examples -> Expert clinicians (Ground Truth creation) -> Hits@k/F1 metrics

- **Critical path:**
  1. Dataset Curation: PRIMATE posts -> GPT-4o annotation -> Clinician Agreement (This is the bottleneck for data quality)
  2. Inference: New Post + Prompt -> LLM -> JSON Output (Symptom: [Text Span])
  3. Evaluation: Compare Output Spans vs. Ground Truth Spans using Cosine Similarity (Hits@k)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Proprietary vs. Open-Source: Proprietary models offer higher ease-of-use and performance via prompting, whereas open-source models require complex fine-tuning but offer better data privacy for clinical settings
  - Prompting vs. Fine-tuning: Prompting is cheaper and faster to iterate on; Fine-tuning is required for specialized behavior but risks "reiterating input verbatim" if misconfigured

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Verbatim Repetition:** The Mentalllama model failed by echoing the input instead of analyzing it. Fix: Requires rigorous fine-tuning (DiagnosticLlama approach)
  - **Zero-shot Drift:** Models struggle to strictly follow questionnaire logic without examples. Fix: Always use exemplar-based prompts
  - **Hallucinated Spans:** Models may invent text not present in the source post. Fix: Implement post-processing to verify extracted spans are verbatim substrings

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Reproduction: Replicate the GPT-4o-mini prompt structure on 5 sample posts to verify you can extract valid JSON symptom spans
  2. Metric Sensitivity Check: Evaluate a set of outputs using both "Standard Classification Metrics" and "Hits@k" to understand how span retrieval differs from simple binary classification
  3. Fine-tuning Stress Test: Attempt to inference with the base Mentalllama model vs. the DiagnosticLlama model on a noisy input to observe the "verbatim reiteration" failure mode firsthand

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can LLMs effectively navigate non-linear, flowchart-based diagnostic assessments (e.g., CSSRS) with the same success rate as linear questionnaires?**
  - The paper states the authors are "expanding our datasets and results to include... non-linearly structured questionnaires (example flowcharts) such as the CSSRS."
  - This remains unresolved as the current study only validated LLM performance on linear questionnaires (PHQ-9 and GAD-7).

- **How can "restricted terminology" constraints be reliably enforced in LLM outputs through paraphrasing without losing diagnostic precision?**
  - The authors list incorporating "additional constraints, such as restricted terminology (e.g., non-toxic terminology), by paraphrasing the LLM outputs" as a future objective.
  - While diagnostic accuracy was measured, the safety and tone of the output language were not rigorously controlled or evaluated in this study.

- **Can fine-tuning techniques be stabilized to outperform prompting methods in specialized diagnostic tasks without requiring prohibitive resource expenditure?**
  - The paper notes that "fine-tuning LLMs for this task proves challenging and requires significant resources," often underperforming compared to prompting.
  - The results indicate that fine-tuning is unstable and resource-heavy compared to the robust performance of few-shot prompting.

## Limitations

- The human-in-the-loop validation process lacks detailed inter-annotator agreement data at the individual symptom level, raising uncertainty about the reliability of the "silver standard" ground truth
- The study focuses exclusively on English-language social media data from Reddit, limiting generalizability to other languages, cultural contexts, or clinical settings
- The computational resource requirements for fine-tuning are substantial but not quantified in detail, making it difficult to assess practical scalability

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The finding that exemplar-based prompting significantly outperforms zero-shot prompting for this task is well-supported by the experimental results, with F1-scores of 0.92-0.93 between GPT-4o-mini and mixtral-8x7b demonstrating robust performance across model families.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that fine-tuning is "challenging and requires significant resources" is supported by the observation that the base Mentalllama model initially echoed input verbatim, but the paper lacks detailed failure analysis or ablation studies to understand exactly what makes fine-tuning difficult for this task.

**Low Confidence:** The assertion that LLMs "approach human annotation quality" lacks sufficient statistical backing, as the paper does not provide confidence intervals, statistical significance tests, or comparisons of individual clinician performance against model performance.

## Next Checks

1. **Ground Truth Validation:** Re-annotate a 10% random sample of the dataset by three independent clinicians and calculate inter-rater reliability at the symptom level to quantify the noise in the silver standard.

2. **Cross-Domain Transfer Test:** Evaluate the best-performing model (GPT-4o-mini with exemplar prompting) on clinical interview transcripts or clinical notes from electronic health records, rather than social media data, to test transfer from informal to formal clinical language contexts.

3. **Resource Cost Analysis:** Document the exact computational resources (GPU hours, memory usage, wall-clock time) required for fine-tuning DiagnosticLlama on the full dataset and compare this with the cost of using GPT-4o-mini via API for the same task over multiple inference batches.
