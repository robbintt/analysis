# DatasetAgent: A Novel Multi-Agent System for Auto-Constructing Datasets from Real-World Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.08648
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08648
- Reference count: 40
- DatasetAgent autonomously constructs high-quality image datasets from real-world images using a multi-agent system with MLLMs

## Executive Summary
DatasetAgent introduces a novel multi-agent system that autonomously constructs high-quality image datasets from real-world images, addressing the inefficiency of manual dataset construction and limitations of synthetic data. The system coordinates four specialized agents—Demand Analysis, Image Processing, Data Label, and Supervision—equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and a Tool Package for image optimization. DatasetAgent handles image collection, processing, cleaning, and annotation based on user requirements, supporting classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks.

## Method Summary
DatasetAgent employs a coordinated multi-agent architecture where four specialized agents work together to automate the dataset construction process. The Demand Analysis Agent interprets user requirements and translates them into actionable tasks. The Image Processing Agent handles collection, optimization, and cleaning of real-world images. The Data Label Agent performs annotation for classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. The Supervision Agent oversees the entire process, ensuring quality control and coordination between agents. All agents are powered by Multi-modal Large Language Models and leverage a comprehensive Tool Package for image optimization. The system can both expand existing datasets and create new ones from scratch while maintaining high-quality standards through automated validation metrics.

## Key Results
- Constructed datasets achieve high quality metrics with Class Balance Index below 0.021 and SSIM above 0.94
- Downstream model evaluations show consistent performance improvements, with image classification accuracy reaching up to 98.90%
- Object detection mAP increased by 2.95% when using datasets constructed by DatasetAgent
- Annotation Label Reliability exceeds 98.8% in constructed datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DatasetAgent leverages the complementary strengths of specialized agents coordinated through a multi-agent framework. The Demand Analysis Agent ensures alignment with user requirements, while the Image Processing Agent handles the technical challenges of real-world image optimization. The Data Label Agent provides accurate annotations across multiple task types, and the Supervision Agent maintains quality control throughout the pipeline. By integrating MLLMs with domain-specific tools, the system can reason about complex image processing tasks while maintaining the precision needed for high-quality dataset construction.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: These models process both text and image inputs, enabling the agents to understand visual content and generate appropriate responses. Required for tasks involving image understanding and reasoning. Quick check: Can the model correctly identify objects and their relationships in diverse images.

**Tool Package for Image Optimization**: A collection of specialized tools for image enhancement, cleaning, and processing. Essential for improving real-world image quality before annotation. Quick check: Does the tool package effectively handle common image issues like noise, lighting variations, and occlusions.

**Agent Coordination Framework**: The system architecture that enables seamless communication and task delegation between the four specialized agents. Critical for maintaining workflow efficiency and quality control. Quick check: Can agents successfully collaborate on complex multi-step dataset construction tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Demand Analysis Agent -> Image Processing Agent -> Data Label Agent -> Supervision Agent (feedback loop)

**Critical Path**: User requirements → Demand Analysis → Image collection & processing → Data annotation → Quality validation → Final dataset output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes quality over speed, using MLLMs for their reasoning capabilities despite higher computational costs. The multi-agent approach adds complexity but enables specialized handling of different dataset construction stages.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor image quality may cascade through the pipeline, leading to inaccurate annotations. Miscommunication between agents could result in inconsistent dataset structure or missing labels.

**First Experiments**: 1) Construct a small dataset from scratch for a simple classification task. 2) Expand an existing dataset with new images and verify label consistency. 3) Test the system's ability to handle a challenging image processing scenario like low-light conditions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on downstream task performance rather than direct dataset quality validation
- System's dependence on MLLMs introduces potential model-specific biases not explicitly addressed
- Claims about filling a critical gap lack comprehensive benchmarking against alternative automated dataset construction methods

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The system architecture and agent coordination mechanism are clearly described and technically sound.

**Medium Confidence**: The reported performance improvements and quality metrics, though promising, lack detailed methodology and independent validation.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about filling a critical gap in the field are overstated without sufficient comparative analysis.

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce quality metric calculations: Independently verify the methodology for computing Class Balance Index, SSIM, and Annotation Label Reliability on a held-out dataset.

2. Benchmark against alternative methods: Compare DatasetAgent's performance with other automated dataset construction tools on identical tasks and datasets.

3. Test on novel domains: Evaluate DatasetAgent's effectiveness in constructing datasets for entirely new, unseen domains beyond CIFAR-10 and PASCAL VOC.
