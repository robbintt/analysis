# Factual and Musical Evaluation Metrics for Music Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05550
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05550
- Reference count: 24
- Current music language model evaluations rely on NLP metrics that reward linguistic fluency over factual correctness.

## Executive Summary
Current evaluation metrics for music language models (LMs) are inadequate because they measure linguistic fluency rather than musical information extraction. Standard NLP metrics like BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore fail to distinguish between correct and random audio responses, and cannot identify adversarially altered but fluent answers. This paper introduces CLAPText, a metric based on CLAP embeddings that successfully discriminates between correct and incorrect audio responses by measuring semantic similarity in a music-specific embedding space. Additionally, a factual question-answering framework converts model outputs into structured labels, enabling evaluation with interpretable precision, recall, and F1 scores. Experiments across multiple models and tasks demonstrate that music LMs capture some factual content but often underperform compared to what fluency-focused metrics suggest.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two complementary evaluation approaches for music language models. CLAPText computes cosine similarity between CLAP text embeddings of candidate and reference answers, leveraging a music-text embedding space trained on music-audio pairs. The factual QA framework uses a structured keyword extraction protocol: a strong LLM (ChatGPT-4.1-mini) extracts explicit labels from model outputs under strict rules (no inference, exact mentions only), which are then compared to ground-truth labels to compute precision, recall, and F1 scores. The evaluation is conducted on MusicQA (free-form QA) and FMA/MusicNet (factual QA) datasets across multiple music LM architectures including LTU-AS, MU-LLaMA, LLaMA-Adapter, and SALMONN.

## Key Results
- Standard NLP metrics (BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore) show near-zero gap between correct and random audio baselines, failing to measure musical information extraction
- CLAPText is the only metric that correctly orders adversarial rewrites below correct paraphrases, while other metrics score them higher
- Factual QA framework reveals that music LMs capture some factual content but often underperform compared to fluency-focused metrics, with F1 scores significantly above random baselines but below perfect

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Standard NLP metrics (BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore) fail to measure musical information extraction because they conflate linguistic fluency with factual correctness. These metrics compute surface-level or general semantic similarity between candidate and reference text, rewarding lexical overlap and grammatical structure without encoding musical domain knowledge. Factually incorrect but lexically similar responses score highly, while correct paraphrases can score lower. Core assumption: Models can produce fluent, lexically similar text that is musically incorrect, and this fluency is what NLP metrics primarily capture.

### Mechanism 2
CLAPText better captures audio information use by measuring semantic similarity in a music-specific audio-text embedding space. CLAPText projects both candidate and reference text into a shared CLAP embedding space trained on music-audio pairs. Cosine similarity in this space reflects musical semantics, enabling it to distinguish musically consistent paraphrases from adversarial but incorrect text. Core assumption: The CLAP embedding space meaningfully encodes musical semantics and transfers to text-text similarity comparison.

### Mechanism 3
A factual evaluation framework converts free-form text into structured labels, enabling interpretable correctness measurement. A strong LLM extracts explicit, normalized labels from model outputs under strict rules (no inference, exact mentions only). Extracted labels are compared to ground-truth labels, yielding Precision/Recall/F1 scores independent of linguistic style. Core assumption: Keyword extraction with strict rules is reliable, deterministic, and bias-free; the extraction LLM can perform this accurately without hallucination.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal alignment (audio-text embedding spaces)
  - Why needed here: CLAPText relies on contrastive learning to align audio and text modalities; understanding this is core to interpreting why CLAPText works and its limitations
  - Quick check question: In CLAP, what training objective encourages audio and text representations to be close in embedding space?

- Concept: Evaluation metric robustness to adversarial inputs
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly constructs adversarial examples to demonstrate metric failure; recognizing this pattern is critical for designing or evaluating any generative metric
  - Quick check question: If an adversarial response "makes minor edits to completely change meaning," should a robust metric assign it a higher or lower score than a correct paraphrase?

- Concept: Information extraction vs. inference
  - Why needed here: The factual framework's keyword extraction rules are strictly non-inferential; understanding this distinction is necessary to implement and audit the extraction protocol correctly
  - Quick check question: If a model output says "the rhythm is swing-like," should the extractor return "jazz" as an inferred label? (Correct answer: No, by Rule 2 in Appendix B.1.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Music LM (LTU-AS, MU-LLaMA, LLaMA-Adapter, SALMONN) -> Free-Form QA Pipeline (Dataset -> Music LM -> Candidate Text -> Metrics vs. Reference Text) -> Factual QA Pipeline (Dataset -> Music LM -> Free-form Text -> Keyword Extraction -> Extracted Labels -> Compare to Ground-Truth -> Precision/Recall/F1)

- Critical path:
  1. Load dataset (MusicQA, FMA-Small, MusicNet)
  2. Free-Form QA: Pass (audio, question) to Music LM; get free-text response; compute metrics against reference
  3. Factual QA: Pass (audio, factual question) to Music LM; get free-text response; call extraction LLM with rule-based prompt; normalize extracted labels; compare to ground-truth; compute Precision/Recall/F1

- Design tradeoffs:
  - CLAPText vs. Factual QA: CLAPText is a drop-in metric but less interpretable; Factual QA is interpretable but requires labeled datasets and extraction LLM, limiting task scope
  - Prompting strategies: Explicitly listing options confuses models (high recall, low precision). Natural language prompts perform better but are less controlled
  - Chunked vs. unchunked models: Chunked models (60s segments) produce multiple outputs, requiring aggregation strategies (any-true vs. majority)

- Failure signatures:
  - NLP metrics show near-zero gap between correct and random audio baselines (e.g., BLEU difference < 0.02)
  - Adversarial prompts score higher than skyline prompts on NLP metrics
  - BERTScore consistently high (>0.88) even for incorrect outputs
  - Explicit option listing causes very high recall but very low precision in factual tasks
  - Random audio baseline yields F1 near chance (e.g., ~0.125 for 8-class genre)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline/random experiments on MusicQA-Jamendo with BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore, and CLAPText for a single Music LM (e.g., MU-LLaMA). Confirm near-zero gap for NLP metrics and positive gap for CLAPText
  2. Run adversarial vs. skyline comparison on a small subset (100 QA pairs) using Table 1 transformations. Verify that only CLAPText orders them correctly
  3. Implement factual QA for genre classification on FMA-Small subset (e.g., 1000 clips) with a chosen Music LM. Use the extraction prompt in Appendix B.1 and compute Precision/Recall/F1 for correct vs. random audio. Confirm significant gap (F1 > random baseline)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the proposed Factual QA framework be effectively extended to other multimodal domains (e.g., video or medical imaging) beyond music? The paper hopes the framework can be extended beyond music but only validates it within the music domain using datasets like MusicNet and FMA. Application to distinct multimodal domains demonstrating maintained high correlation with ground truth would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Why does explicitly providing a closed vocabulary of valid labels in the prompt degrade the performance of Music Language Models? The paper observes that explicitly enumerating possible instruments or genres confuses every tested music language model, causing over-prediction (high recall, low precision), but does not provide a definitive explanation for this counter-intuitive behavior.

### Open Question 3
Does the CLAPText metric correlate more strongly with human expert judgment of musical correctness than standard NLP metrics? While CLAPText correctly orders correct vs. adversarial responses, it remains unproven whether cosine similarity in the CLAP embedding space is a reliable proxy for human perception of semantic accuracy in music description.

### Open Question 4
How sensitive is the Factual QA framework's precision and recall to the choice of the Large Language Model used for keyword extraction? The methodology relies on ChatGPT-4.1-mini, but different models may interpret "explicit mention" or "canonical form" rules differently, potentially introducing variance into the evaluation metrics.

## Limitations
- CLAPText performance depends on the generalization ability of CLAP embeddings to text-only similarity tasks, which remains uncertain
- Factual QA framework's reliability depends heavily on the extraction LLM's ability to perform exact keyword matching without inference, which may vary across model versions
- Adversarial examples represent only a subset of possible fluency-deception scenarios, leaving open the question of metric robustness to other forms of linguistic manipulation

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Standard NLP metrics fail to distinguish between correct and random audio responses and score adversarial rewrites higher than correct answers
- Medium Confidence: CLAPText is the only metric that correctly orders correct, skyline, and adversarial responses (ordering may depend on CLAP checkpoint choice)
- Medium Confidence: Factual QA framework measures actual information extraction via Precision/Recall/F1 (validity depends on extraction LLM performance)

## Next Checks
1. Verify the exact CLAP model identifier and training corpus used for CLAPText, testing whether a different music-trained CLAP checkpoint produces similar ordering of correct vs. adversarial responses
2. Systematically test the keyword extraction prompt with known correct and incorrect responses to quantify false positive and false negative rates, comparing results across different extraction LLM versions
3. Design and test additional adversarial transformations beyond those in Table 1 to assess whether CLAPText and the factual QA framework maintain their discriminative ability
