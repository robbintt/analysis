# Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC): A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Safe Agentic AI in 5G Autonomous Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.20275
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20275
- Authors: Divya Vijay; Vignesh Ethiraj
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Zero safety violations achieved in 5G autonomous network simulation using graph-symbolic validation

## Executive Summary
G-SPEC addresses the safety risks of using LLM agents for autonomous 5G network management by enforcing deterministic verification on probabilistic planning. The framework combines a telecom-adapted LLM agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints to create a governance triad that prevents both hallucinated and policy-violating actions. Evaluation on a simulated 450-node 5G Core showed 94.1% successful remediation versus 82.4% baseline, with zero safety violations and only 0.2% hallucination detection rate. The approach scales to 100K nodes with 142ms overhead, suitable for SMO-layer orchestration.

## Method Summary
G-SPEC implements a three-layer governance architecture: (1) a telecom-adapted LLM agent that generates remediation plans with Chain-of-Thought traces, (2) a Network Knowledge Graph that maintains authoritative network state with freshness tracking, and (3) SHACL-based validation policies that enforce 3GPP constraints. The system operates by extracting relevant subgraphs, generating plans, simulating actions on hypothetical graph states, and validating against 88 SHACL policies before execution. The blast radius limiter prevents catastrophic changes by rejecting plans that exceed 20% capacity changes. Ablation studies showed graph grounding contributes 68% of safety gains, with NKG validation being the dominant factor.

## Key Results
- Zero safety violations achieved against defined ontology in 450-node 5G Core simulation
- 94.1% successful remediation rate vs 82.4% baseline (25.4% relative improvement)
- 142ms overhead scales to 100K nodes with O(k^1.2) complexity
- NKG validation contributed 68% of safety gains in ablation studies
- 0.2% hallucination detection rate with ghost node identification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph grounding is the dominant factor in safety gains, contributing 68% of observed improvements.
- Mechanism: The Network Knowledge Graph (NKG) functions as an "Authoritative State Ledger," forcing the LLM to reference only entities that exist in the current graph state. Hallucinated nodes are caught when `targets(a_i) ⊄ V(G_sim)`, blocking referential integrity violations before execution.
- Core assumption: The NKG remains synchronized with physical network state within the freshness window (default: 15 seconds).
- Evidence anchors: "Ablation studies showed NKG validation contributed 68% of safety gains" and ghost references caught when agent "issued a command to migrate traffic to a gNB_ID decommissioned in a previous epoch."
- Break condition: If NKG synchronization lag exceeds ∆safe during rapid topology changes, false negatives may occur.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-execution SHACL validation converts stochastic LLM outputs into deterministic policy compliance.
- Mechanism: Each proposed action generates a "Hypothetical Graph State" G' that is validated against SHACL policies before any physical execution. If `violations ≠ ∅`, the entire plan is rejected atomically.
- Core assumption: SHACL policies correctly encode 3GPP constraints and contain no specification errors.
- Evidence anchors: "zero safety violations against the defined ontology" and four policy classes: Topological, Resource, State, and Temporal constraints.
- Break condition: If policies are underspecified or contain bugs, invalid actions may pass validation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Blast radius limiting prevents cascading failures even when topologically valid actions would cause excessive disruption.
- Mechanism: The `δ(S_t, S_{t+1})` change delta function rejects any plan that changes slice capacity by >θ (default: 20%) in a single epoch.
- Core assumption: The 20% threshold appropriately balances operational flexibility against catastrophic risk.
- Evidence anchors: "prevents catastrophic cascades or adversarial wipeout commands" and zero safety violations achieved with this mechanism active.
- Break condition: If multiple independent actions each approach the threshold, cumulative effects may still exceed safe bounds.

## Foundational Learning

- **SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)**: W3C standard for validating RDF graphs; G-SPEC uses it to encode 3GPP constraints as executable policies.
  - Quick check: Can you write a SHACL shape that validates an AMF must connect to SMF (not directly to UPF)?

- **3GPP TS 28.623 Network Resource Model**: The NKG schema maps directly to this ontology; understanding class hierarchy is required for policy design.
  - Quick check: What are the standard 5G Core network functions and their reference point interfaces (N1, N2, N3, N11)?

- **O-RAN SMO Layer Latency Budgets**: G-SPEC's 142ms overhead is evaluated against SMO-layer budgets (~5s), not real-time schedulers (<1ms).
  - Quick check: Why is 142ms acceptable for slice instantiation but unacceptable for MAC scheduling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: NKG (Neo4j graph database) -> TSLAM-4B (telecom-adapted LLM) -> Governance (SHACL validator with 88 policies)

- **Critical path**: 1. Extract subgraph relevant to intent (BFS from affected entities), 2. TSLAM generates remediation plan with reasoning trace, 3. Simulate each action on hypothetical graph G', 4. SHACL validates G' against all 88 policies, 5. If valid, execute; if any violation, reject entire plan atomically

- **Design tradeoffs**: Latency vs. Safety (142ms overhead enables zero violations but restricts use to SMO layer), Policy Count vs. Expressiveness (88 SHACL shapes via class inheritance vs. O(N) imperative rules), Freshness vs. Availability (15-second staleness threshold prevents stale decisions but may reject valid actions during sync delays)

- **Failure signatures**: Ghost Node hallucination (agent references decommissioned node → caught by NKG entity lookup), Ontological violation (UPF→AMF direct connection → caught by SHACL topological constraint), Stale telemetry decision (Action based on >15s old data → caught by temporal consistency policy), Capacity shock (>20% slice change → caught by blast radius limiter)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Baseline hallucination test: Run TSLAM without NKG validation on 50 scenarios; measure ghost node rate (expect ~8-14%), 2. NKG-only validation: Enable graph grounding but disable SHACL; measure residual policy violations (expect ~2-8%), 3. Latency scaling probe: Test subgraph extraction on 10K→100K node synthetic topologies; verify O(k^1.2) scaling claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can G-SPEC maintain zero safety violations and low latency when deployed on production-grade, multi-vendor 5G networks with 100K+ nodes?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 7.2 identifies "Production Deployment" as a specific future work item to "Validate G-SPEC with Tier-1 carriers on real 5G networks."
- **Why unresolved:** Current results are derived from a simulated Open5GS environment, which lacks the undocumented behaviors and complex interdependencies of vendor-specific hardware.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical safety and latency metrics collected during a live pilot with a Tier-1 carrier.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can active topology monitoring effectively mitigate the "blind interval" caused by synchronization latency between physical network state and the NKG?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 7.2 proposes "Active Topology Monitoring" to address the "Topology Drift" and synchronization lag risks discussed in Section 5.9.3.
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation relies on static freshness guardrails (15s limit), but does not yet implement the proposed on-demand probes to verify edge existence.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparison of false negative rates (accepting invalid actions based on stale data) with and without active reconciliation mechanisms.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the SHACL-based governance layer robust against adversarial operator intents specifically designed to evade validation?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 7.2 lists "Adversarial Robustness" as a future goal to "test against malicious operators attempting to craft intents that evade validation."
- **Why unresolved:** The evaluation assumes well-formed, non-adversarial intents (Section 5.9.4), leaving the system's resistance to crafted malicious inputs untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Red-teaming results quantifying the success rate of adversarial intents bypassing the SHACL constraints.

## Limitations
- **Model Generalization**: TSLAM-4B performance on real 5G networks with complex multi-vendor configurations remains untested.
- **SHACL Policy Completeness**: 88 policies may miss emergent failure modes and manual authoring introduces human error risk.
- **Real-time Constraints**: 142ms validation overhead precludes Near-RT RIC applications despite SMO-layer suitability.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Graph grounding safety gains (68%), zero safety violations with full stack, and ablation study methodology. These are directly measured from controlled experiments.

**Medium Confidence**: Blast radius limiter effectiveness and 94.1% success rate. These depend on simulator fidelity and may not generalize to all 5G failure modes.

**Low Confidence**: TSLAM-4B adaptation quality and SHACL policy completeness. No direct comparison with baseline LLM performance, and policy coverage cannot be exhaustively verified.

## Next Checks
1. **Multi-vendor interoperability test**: Deploy G-SPEC across heterogeneous 5G equipment from different vendors to validate policy portability and NKG schema compatibility.

2. **Adversarial robustness evaluation**: Systematically inject malicious LLM outputs (ghost nodes, privilege escalation attempts) to verify all 88 SHACL policies catch intended violations.

3. **Production-scale performance**: Test on 50K+ node synthetic topology with realistic churn patterns to validate O(k^1.2) scaling and identify validation bottlenecks.
