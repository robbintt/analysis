# Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.11558
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Introduces ST-VFM, achieving over 10% improvement in MAE and RMSE on average across 10 spatio-temporal datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ST-VFM, the first framework to systematically reprogram Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. It addresses the dual challenges of lacking temporal modeling capacity and the modality gap between visual and spatio-temporal data. The method employs a dual-branch architecture that integrates raw spatio-temporal inputs with lightweight auxiliary flow inputs, which capture temporal differences as dynamic spatial cues. Two dedicated reprogramming stages are used: (1) a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter that projects inputs into VFM-compatible token spaces with embedded temporal context, and (2) a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module that enables dynamic interaction between branches via prompt-based conditioning.

## Method Summary
ST-VFM introduces a systematic framework for reprogramming vision foundation models for spatio-temporal forecasting. The method addresses two key challenges: vision models' lack of temporal modeling capacity and the modality gap between visual and spatio-temporal data. The approach employs a dual-branch architecture that processes raw spatio-temporal inputs alongside lightweight auxiliary flow inputs that capture temporal differences as dynamic spatial cues. Two dedicated reprogramming stages are implemented: a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter that projects inputs into VFM-compatible token spaces with embedded temporal context, and a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module that enables dynamic interaction between branches via prompt-based conditioning. Extensive experiments on ten diverse spatio-temporal datasets across traffic, mobility, crowd flow, and cellular usage domains demonstrate consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 10% improvement in MAE and RMSE on average across 10 spatio-temporal datasets
- Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple domains including traffic, mobility, crowd flow, and cellular usage
- Demonstrates effectiveness across different VFM backbones (DINO, CLIP, DEIT) without requiring task-specific pretraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by bridging the fundamental gap between visual and spatio-temporal data modalities through a dual-branch architecture. The Temporal-Aware Token Adapter effectively transforms spatio-temporal inputs into token representations that vision models can process while preserving temporal context. The Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination enables dynamic information exchange between branches, allowing the model to leverage both raw spatial patterns and temporal flow information. This approach transfers general visual knowledge to spatio-temporal tasks without requiring domain-specific pretraining, making it broadly applicable across diverse forecasting scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)**: Pre-trained models like DINO, CLIP, and DEIT that capture general visual representations - needed because they provide rich visual feature extractors without requiring domain-specific pretraining - quick check: verify which VFM backbones are supported
- **Spatio-temporal data**: Data with both spatial and temporal dimensions (grids, sequences) - needed as the target domain for forecasting - quick check: confirm data formats handled (grids, sequences)
- **Temporal flow inputs**: Auxiliary representations capturing temporal differences as spatial cues - needed to bridge the temporal modeling gap in VFMs - quick check: validate flow computation method
- **Token adapter**: Mechanism to project spatio-temporal inputs into VFM-compatible token spaces - needed because VFMs expect specific input formats - quick check: examine projection dimensionality
- **Prompt-based conditioning**: Technique for dynamic interaction between model branches - needed to coordinate information flow between temporal and spatial processing - quick check: verify conditioning mechanism
- **Cross-modal forecasting**: Task of predicting future values in one modality using knowledge from another - needed as the core challenge being addressed - quick check: assess forecasting horizon capabilities

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input data -> Temporal-Aware Token Adapter -> Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination -> VFM Backbone -> Forecast Output

**Critical Path:** Spatio-temporal input + Flow input → Token Adapter → Cross-Prompt Coordination → VFM → Prediction

**Design Tradeoffs:** The dual-branch approach balances complexity against performance gains, with the flow auxiliary inputs providing temporal information without requiring architectural modifications to the base VFM. The prompt-based coordination enables dynamic interaction but adds computational overhead compared to single-branch approaches.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation may occur when temporal dynamics are not well-captured by flow-based representations, or when the modality gap between visual and spatio-temporal data is too large for the token adapter to bridge effectively.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test ST-VFM on a simple traffic forecasting dataset with known temporal patterns to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate performance using different VFM backbones (DINO, CLIP, DEIT) on the same dataset to assess backbone independence
3. Conduct ablation study removing the Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination to measure its individual contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The observed improvements may stem primarily from the dual-branch reprogramming approach rather than other potential temporal adaptation strategies, as ablation studies isolating individual component contributions were not conducted
- The claim that ST-VFM transfers "general visual knowledge" effectively lacks analysis of which specific visual features prove most transferable across the ten datasets tested
- The methodology assumes flow-based auxiliary inputs adequately capture temporal dynamics without validating whether alternative temporal encoding strategies might perform comparably or better

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- ST-VFM enables VFM reprogramming for spatio-temporal forecasting (supported by systematic evaluation across multiple backbones and diverse domains)
- No task-specific pretraining is required (reflects the methodology rather than comprehensive comparison)

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- ST-VFM achieves consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines (demonstrated but could be strengthened through more extensive ablation and sensitivity analyses)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the Temporal-Aware Token Adapter and Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination modules to overall performance improvements
2. Test the robustness of ST-VFM by training and evaluating on multiple random data splits for each dataset to establish confidence intervals around reported metrics
3. Compare ST-VFM against temporal adaptation approaches that use alternative methods for incorporating temporal information (e.g., temporal convolutions, attention mechanisms) rather than the flow-based auxiliary inputs
