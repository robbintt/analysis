# XMTC: Explainable Early Classification of Multivariate Time Series in Reach-to-Gasp Hand Kinematics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.04398
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04398
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Interval-based DrCIF ensemble enables early prediction of reach-to-grasp intention with interpretable trade-offs between earliness and accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of early prediction in multivariate time series classification for reach-to-grasp hand kinematics, aiming to anticipate user intention during interaction. The authors employ an ensemble approach based on Diverse Representation Canonical Interval Forest (DrCIF), an interval-based classifier that extracts features from randomly selected intervals across three time-series representations. To enable interpretability, they develop XMTC, a visual analytics tool featuring coordinated multiple-view visualizations including temporal accuracy plots, confusion matrix heatmaps, temporal confidence heatmaps, and partial dependence plots. The method is applied to three real-world human-computer interaction experiments with hand-tracking data. Results show that good classification accuracy can be achieved early in the time series, with the proposed tool enabling identification of optimal trade-off points between early prediction and accuracy, analysis of confusing classification conditions, and investigation of feature impacts on predictions.

## Method Summary
The approach uses DrCIF, an interval-based classifier that extracts features from randomly selected intervals across three representations (base series, first-order differences, periodograms) combined with 29 statistical features. Models are trained on incrementally increasing window sizes from 10 to full series length, enabling early prediction. The XMTC visual analytics tool provides coordinated views including temporal accuracy plots, confusion matrices, temporal confidence heatmaps, and partial dependence plots to support interpretability and trade-off analysis.

## Key Results
- Good classification accuracy (up to 85.4%) can be achieved well before grasp completion in reach-to-grasp tasks
- Optimal trade-off points between early prediction and accuracy can be identified through temporal accuracy curves
- The tool enables analysis of confusing classification conditions and investigation of feature impacts on predictions
- User-specific patterns affect generalization, with leave-one-out testing revealing performance variance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interval-based feature extraction across multiple time-series representations enables discriminative pattern detection for early classification.
- Mechanism: DrCIF constructs an ensemble of decision trees by extracting features from randomly selected intervals across three representations—base series, first-order differences, and periodograms—combined with 29 statistical features (mean, std, slope, median, IQR, min, max, catch22 set). Each tree receives a unique combination of intervals and features, with the final prediction via majority voting.
- Core assumption: Discriminatory features for reach-to-grasp intention exist within temporal intervals rather than requiring full-series processing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DrCIF, an interval-based classifier that extracts features from randomly selected intervals across three time-series representations"
  - [section 4] "DrCIF constructs an ensemble of time-series trees by extracting diverse features from randomly selected intervals across three distinct representations... combining them with a candidate pool of 29 statistical features"
  - [corpus] ProtoTSNet (arxiv 2511.02152) uses prototypical parts for interpretable MTSC, suggesting interval/segment-based approaches are a recognized strategy.
- Break condition: If discriminatory patterns only emerge at full-series granularity (not within intervals), accuracy will degrade for early windows.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Incremental window-based training enables prediction at progressively earlier time points with measurable accuracy-earliness trade-offs.
- Mechanism: Models are trained on window sizes [0,10], [0,20], [0,30]... up to full series length. Each window produces an independent model, allowing users to identify when accuracy stabilizes (e.g., window 640 in Experiment 3 vs. 360 for earlier-but-less-accurate prediction).
- Core assumption: User intention becomes distinguishable before action completion; prehensile kinematics encode object information during reach phase.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "identification of optimal trade-off points between early prediction and accuracy"
  - [section 4] "we employed a moving window approach with an initial window size of 10 time steps, which then is incrementally increased in steps of 10"
  - [corpus] TimeSliver (arxiv 2601.21289) addresses temporal segment influence on predictions but uses post-hoc decomposition; XMTC's forward-window approach differs.
- Break condition: If intention is only determinable at grasp contact (not during reach), early windows will perform near chance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Coordinated multiple-view visualizations with partial dependence plots provide global, post-hoc, model-agnostic explainability.
- Mechanism: XMTC links four views—accuracy plots (global performance over time), confusion matrices (class-level errors), temporal confidence heatmaps (per-instance prediction evolution), and PDPs (feature-class relationships). PDPs show marginal feature impact by varying one feature while averaging others.
- Core assumption: Global post-hoc explanations sufficiently capture model behavior for user trust and debugging.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "visual analytics tool featuring coordinated multiple-view visualizations including temporal accuracy plots, confusion matrix heatmaps, temporal confidence heatmaps, and partial dependence plots"
  - [section 5.2] "To examine the global behavior of the model and identify distinguishable input features (Task T5), the Partial Dependence Plot for input features of the selected model is plotted"
  - [corpus] Counterfactual XAI (arxiv 2511.13237) offers counterfactual explanations for MTSC; PDPs provide marginal dependence but not counterfactuals. Weak corpus support for PDP-specific validation in MTSC.
- Break condition: If feature interactions dominate (PDPs assume independence), marginal plots will mislead about actual feature importance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Interval-based time series classification**
  - Why needed here: DrCIF extracts features from random intervals rather than full series; understanding this distinguishes it from sequence models.
  - Quick check question: Given a 1000-step series with 10 intervals of 50 steps each, can you explain why the classifier might miss long-range dependencies?

- Concept: **Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)**
  - Why needed here: PDPs are the primary global explainability method; interpreting them requires understanding marginal vs. conditional effects.
  - Quick check question: If a PDP shows feature X increases class A probability, but X correlates with feature Y, can you trust that X alone causes the increase?

- Concept: **Accuracy-earliness trade-off in streaming classification**
  - Why needed here: The core application requires deciding when to commit to a prediction; this involves reading temporal accuracy curves.
  - Quick check question: At window 380 (no grasps completed yet), Experiment 1 achieves 71.9% accuracy. What information would you need to decide if this is an acceptable trade-off?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw sensor data -> Aperture computation -> Normalization to [0,1] -> Window-specific datasets -> DrCIF training -> Probability outputs -> XMTC visualization

- Critical path: Raw sensor → aperture computation → normalization → window-specific dataset → DrCIF training → probability outputs → XMTC visualization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - DrCIF vs. HIVE-COTE2: Authors found DrCIF received highest weight in full ensemble; using it alone saved computation with no accuracy loss in their data. Assumption: This generalizes beyond their datasets.
  - 10-step window increments: Granularity choice affects both compute cost and temporal resolution for trade-off identification.
  - PDPs vs. SHAP/LIME: Authors chose PDPs for global explainability; local methods would add per-instance insight but less overview.

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy plateauing early (Experiment 2 at ~60%) suggests classes lack discriminable kinematics.
  - High confusion between similar objects (bottle/cup, knife/pen) indicates aperture features insufficiently capture shape differences.
  - Leave-one-out accuracy drop (71% → 61%) signals user-specific patterns; model may not generalize to unseen users.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce accuracy curves**: Load Experiment 1 data, train DrCIF at windows [10, 50, 100, 200, 380], plot accuracy. Compare to reported 35.4%→85.4% trajectory.
  2. **Inspect confusion patterns**: At window 380, verify left/right discrimination precedes object discrimination (confusion matrix should show left objects confused with left, not right).
  3. **Validate PDP interpretability**: Select r_cup vs. r_knife, confirm x-direction features (tmax, trax, tlax) show diverging patterns while y-direction features (tiay, tmay, tray) show similar patterns as reported.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How well does the XMTC framework generalize to domains beyond HCI, such as healthcare or finance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly calls for evaluating performance across diverse domains to demonstrate generalization capability.
- Why unresolved: The current validation is restricted to reach-to-grasp hand kinematics data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application and evaluation of XMTC on multivariate time series from non-HCI datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the system accurately predict the specific *action* (e.g., grasp vs. touch) before it is performed, rather than just the intended object?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "advancing action prediction" as a goal for future research, noting its value in time-critical applications.
- Why unresolved: Experiment 2 (action classification) failed due to participant behavior, and the primary focus was object classification.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled study showing high accuracy in classifying specific grasp types or touch interactions early in the time series.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the model mitigate performance drops caused by outlier user behaviors (e.g., User 22) in leave-one-out testing?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The leave-one-out test revealed significant variance and sensitivity to specific users, with User 22 causing a substantial accuracy drop.
- Why unresolved: The current model does not address inter-user variability sufficiently to ensure reliable predictions for unseen, atypical users.
- What evidence would resolve it: An adaptive model that maintains consistent accuracy across all held-out users regardless of behavioral outliers.

## Limitations
- Results depend on specific experimental conditions (Polhemus sensors, controlled lab reach-to-grasp tasks) that may not generalize to real-world HCI scenarios
- The choice of DrCIF over full HIVE-COTE2 ensembles is justified but not empirically validated across diverse MTSC problems
- Partial dependence plots assume feature independence, which may not hold for correlated aperture measurements

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The interval-based feature extraction mechanism works for early classification in reach-to-grasp kinematics (supported by multiple experiments showing clear accuracy-earliness trade-offs)
- **Medium confidence**: The coordinated visualization tool effectively supports the claimed analytical tasks (validation through use cases but no formal user study)
- **Low confidence**: PDPs provide sufficient interpretability for understanding feature-class relationships in this domain (PDPs are a weak corpus match for MTSC explainability, and their assumptions may not hold for correlated sensor data)

## Next Checks

1. Test model generalization by training on participants 1-20 and evaluating on 21-29 to quantify user-specific pattern dependency
2. Compare DrCIF-alone accuracy against full HIVE-COTE2 ensemble performance on these datasets to verify claimed computational benefits
3. Generate local explainability (SHAP values) for the same predictions where PDPs show strong effects to assess whether marginal relationships hold in context
