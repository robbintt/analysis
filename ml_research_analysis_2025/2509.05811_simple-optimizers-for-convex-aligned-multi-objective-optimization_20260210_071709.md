# Simple Optimizers for Convex Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05811
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05811
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces Maximum Gap (MG) metric and MG-AMOO algorithm for convex aligned multi-objective optimization, achieving convergence rates independent of objective count

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-objective optimization (MOO) where objectives share a common optimal solution (AMOO). The authors identify a critical flaw in naive Equal-Weights (EW) approaches that converge at rates polynomial in the number of objectives. They introduce the Maximum Gap (MG) metric as a suitable measure for AMOO convergence and develop PAMOO, a theoretically sound algorithm with objective-independent convergence rates. The key innovation is MG-AMOO, a meta-algorithm that leverages any single-objective optimizer to solve AMOO problems efficiently. Experiments demonstrate MG-AMOO achieves faster convergence than EW while avoiding PAMOO's computational overhead, with momentum-enhanced versions performing nearly as well as PAMOO at much lower cost.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a framework for solving convex aligned multi-objective optimization problems where all objectives share a common optimal solution. The key innovation is the Maximum Gap (MG) metric, which measures the maximum difference between objective values at the current iterate and the optimal point. The authors first analyze the limitations of naive Equal-Weights (EW) approaches, showing they converge at rates polynomial in the number of objectives. They then introduce PAMOO, an algorithm based on parameter averaging that achieves objective-independent convergence rates. The main contribution is MG-AMOO, a meta-algorithm that wraps around any single-objective optimizer (gradient descent, Polyak step-size, or online learners) to solve AMOO problems. The method maintains a single point in the product space and uses a weighting scheme to track progress toward the common optimum.

## Key Results
- EW algorithm convergence rate is Ω(√mG‖x₁-x⋆‖/√K), polynomial in number of objectives m
- PAMOO achieves MG ∈ O(G‖x₁-x⋆‖/√K) for Lipschitz functions and MG ∈ O(β‖x₁-x⋆‖/K) for smooth functions, both independent of m
- MG-AMOO matches PAMOO's convergence rates while using any single-objective optimizer
- Experimental results show MG-AMOO with momentum performs nearly as well as PAMOO at much lower computational cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Maximum Gap (MG) metric provides a principled way to measure progress in AMOO settings by focusing on the maximum deviation from optimal objective values. The MG-AMOO algorithm works by maintaining a single point in the product space and using a weighting scheme that dynamically adjusts based on progress. By leveraging existing single-objective optimizers, MG-AMOO inherits their favorable convergence properties while adapting them to the multi-objective setting. The momentum variant further accelerates convergence by incorporating velocity terms, bridging the gap with more computationally expensive methods like PAMOO.

## Foundational Learning

**Convex optimization fundamentals**: Understanding convex functions, gradients, and optimal solutions is essential for grasping the theoretical analysis. Quick check: Verify that the common optimal solution assumption holds for your problem domain.

**Multi-objective optimization basics**: Familiarity with Pareto optimality, weighted sum methods, and trade-offs between objectives provides context for AMOO. Quick check: Identify whether your objectives share a common optimal solution.

**Convergence rate analysis**: Knowledge of Big-O notation and convergence bounds is necessary to interpret the theoretical results. Quick check: Compare the stated convergence rates with those of your current optimization methods.

**Parameter averaging techniques**: Understanding how averaging iterates can improve convergence helps explain PAMOO's effectiveness. Quick check: Experiment with averaging in your single-objective optimization to see its impact.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Single-objective optimizer -> MG-AMOO wrapper -> AMOO solution
**Critical path**: Initialize weights -> Optimize single objective -> Update weights based on MG -> Repeat
**Design tradeoffs**: MG-AMOO trades off between computational efficiency (using existing optimizers) and solution quality (through careful weight updates)
**Failure signatures**: Poor convergence may indicate objectives don't truly share a common optimum or inappropriate choice of single-objective optimizer
**First experiments**:
1. Test MG-AMOO with gradient descent on a simple convex AMOO problem
2. Compare MG-AMOO with EW on a neural network multi-task learning problem
3. Evaluate momentum-enhanced MG-AMOO against PAMOO on a benchmark AMOO task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations

- The theoretical analysis assumes convex objectives with a common optimal solution, which may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Experimental validation is primarily focused on neural network training tasks, limiting generalizability
- The paper doesn't explore the behavior of MG-AMOO in non-convex settings or when the alignment assumption is relaxed
- Detailed analysis of computational overhead trade-offs across different problem sizes and dimensionalities is limited

## Confidence

High confidence in the theoretical analysis and convergence rate claims, as they are rigorously derived and proven. Medium confidence in the practical effectiveness across diverse problem domains, given the limited experimental scope focused primarily on neural network tasks.

## Next Checks

1. Test MG-AMOO on a wider variety of multi-objective optimization problems beyond neural network training tasks to assess its generality.
2. Investigate the performance of MG-AMOO in non-convex settings or when the alignment assumption is relaxed to evaluate its robustness.
3. Conduct a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between convergence speed and computational cost of MG-AMOO across different problem sizes and dimensionalities.
