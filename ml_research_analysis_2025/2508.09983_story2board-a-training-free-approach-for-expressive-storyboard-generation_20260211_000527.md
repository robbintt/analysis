# Story2Board: A Training-Free Approach for Expressive Storyboard Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.09983
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09983
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Training-free framework using Latent Panel Anchoring and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing to maintain character consistency and layout diversity in storyboard generation

## Executive Summary
Story2Board presents a novel training-free approach for generating expressive storyboards from natural language narratives. The method introduces two key mechanisms - Latent Panel Anchoring and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing - that operate on token-level features within diffusion transformers to maintain character consistency while preserving layout diversity and background richness. The framework achieves this without requiring fine-tuning or architectural modifications to existing models. To evaluate performance, the authors introduce the Rich Storyboard Benchmark and Scene Diversity metric, demonstrating strong results across prompt alignment, character consistency, and scene diversity compared to baselines on both new and existing datasets.

## Method Summary
Story2Board leverages existing diffusion transformer models through two innovative mechanisms that manipulate token-level features. Latent Panel Anchoring ensures character consistency across storyboard panels by anchoring character representations in the latent space, while Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing preserves layout diversity and background richness through bidirectional attention mechanisms. The framework operates entirely at inference time without requiring any model training or architectural changes, making it broadly applicable to existing diffusion models. The approach is evaluated using newly introduced benchmarks and metrics specifically designed to assess expressive visual storytelling capabilities.

## Key Results
- Story2Board outperforms baselines on both the new Rich Storyboard Benchmark and DS-500 dataset
- Strong performance across prompt alignment, character consistency, and scene diversity metrics
- User study confirms overall preference for Story2Board storyboards due to their balance of coherence, visual richness, and narrative fidelity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Story2Board achieves its results by operating at the token-level feature space within diffusion transformers, allowing for fine-grained control over character consistency and layout diversity without modifying the underlying model architecture. The Latent Panel Anchoring mechanism maintains consistent character representations across storyboard panels by leveraging the inherent properties of diffusion transformers' attention mechanisms. Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing enables bidirectional feature propagation that preserves both layout flexibility and background richness while maintaining narrative coherence. These mechanisms work synergistically to produce expressive storyboards that faithfully represent the input narrative while avoiding the common pitfalls of character drift and monotonous layouts in generated storyboards.

## Foundational Learning

### Diffusion Transformers
- **Why needed**: Core architecture for image generation that Story2Board builds upon
- **Quick check**: Understand attention mechanisms and latent feature manipulation

### Token-level Feature Manipulation
- **Why needed**: Enables fine-grained control without architectural changes
- **Quick check**: Grasp how token features influence generated output

### Attention Mechanisms in Visual Generation
- **Why needed**: Fundamental to both proposed mechanisms
- **Quick check**: Understand bidirectional attention propagation

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
- Input Narrative -> Diffusion Transformer -> Token-level Feature Manipulation -> Latent Panel Anchoring -> Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing -> Storyboard Panels

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from the input narrative through the diffusion transformer's latent space, where both Latent Panel Anchoring and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing operate on token features before final image generation. The mechanisms work in parallel during the inference process, with character consistency maintained through anchoring while layout diversity is preserved through reciprocal attention mixing.

### Design Tradeoffs
The training-free approach trades off potential optimization for specific storytelling tasks against broad applicability and zero training cost. While this limits fine-tuning capabilities, it enables immediate deployment across any diffusion transformer model. The token-level manipulation approach provides fine-grained control but may be limited by the quality of underlying attention mechanisms in the base model.

### Failure Signatures
Potential failure modes include character consistency breakdown when narratives involve complex transformations or occlusions, layout diversity collapse in scenarios requiring highly specific spatial arrangements, and background richness degradation when prompts demand highly detailed environmental contexts. The framework may also struggle with abstract or highly stylized narratives that fall outside the training distribution of the base diffusion model.

### 3 First Experiments
1. Character consistency test across multiple panels with varying poses and expressions
2. Layout diversity evaluation using prompts requiring different spatial arrangements
3. Background richness assessment with prompts specifying complex environmental details

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance heavily dependent on quality and generalization of underlying diffusion transformer models
- Evaluation focused on specific storytelling prompts; broader narrative content remains untested
- New benchmark and metrics not yet validated across independent studies or compared against established protocols

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Introduction of Latent Panel Anchoring and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing mechanisms is well-supported by experimental results and ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims of outperforming baselines are supported but may not generalize to all narrative domains
- **Medium Confidence**: User study preference results are methodologically sound but sample size and diversity are unspecified

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Across Domains**: Validate performance on broader narrative prompts including abstract and highly stylized storytelling
2. **Comparison with Established Metrics**: Evaluate using widely accepted visual storytelling and consistency metrics to corroborate new benchmark effectiveness
3. **User Study Replication**: Conduct larger, more diverse user study to confirm subjective preferences and rule out demographic biases
