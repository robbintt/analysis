# VisuCraft: Enhancing Large Vision-Language Models for Complex Visual-Guided Creative Content Generation via Structured Information Extraction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.02890
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02890
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** VisuCraft achieves Visual Grounding scores of 0.825 (story) and 0.810 (poetry), Creativity scores of 0.810 (story) and 0.805 (poetry), and Instruction Adherence scores of 0.830 (story) and 0.815 (poetry) on ImageStoryGen-500K.

## Executive Summary
VisuCraft enhances Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for complex visual-guided creative content generation by integrating a multimodal structured information extractor and a dynamic prompt generation module. The framework transforms raw visual inputs into explicit, structured textual representations, which are then combined with user instructions to create optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs. Evaluated on the self-constructed ImageStoryGen-500K dataset, VisuCraft significantly outperforms baseline LVLMs across tasks like story generation and poetry composition, demonstrating marked improvements particularly in creativity and instruction adherence.

## Method Summary
VisuCraft processes image-instruction pairs through a two-stage pipeline. First, a Multimodal Structured Information Extractor (E) distills fine-grained visual attributes into structured JSON representations (objects, attributes, relations). Second, a Dynamic Prompt Generation Module (G) integrates this structured visual information with user instructions to generate an optimized prompt. This prompt is then fed to a frozen pre-trained LVLM to produce the final text output. The framework was evaluated using custom VisuGen Metrics on a self-constructed ImageStoryGen-500K dataset of 500K image-instruction pairs.

## Key Results
- VisuCraft achieves Visual Grounding scores of 0.825 (story) and 0.810 (poetry)
- Creativity scores reach 0.810 (story) and 0.805 (poetry)
- Instruction Adherence scores achieve 0.830 (story) and 0.815 (poetry)
- Ablation studies show removing Module G causes Instruction Adherence to drop from 0.830 to 0.820 in StoryGen

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Converting raw visual inputs into explicit, structured textual representations (JSON) reduces semantic ambiguity in downstream language models more effectively than relying on internal latent embeddings. The Multimodal Structured Information Extractor (E) bypasses the potential "black box" visual encoding of the base LVLM by forcing visual data into discrete, human-readable attributes (e.g., "soft evening light," "rough texture"), providing the LLM with "grounded tokens" that act as explicit constraints, reducing the probability of hallucination.

### Mechanism 2
Dynamic prompt synthesis improves Instruction Adherence by actively prioritizing visual cues that align with the user's creative intent. The Dynamic Prompt Generation Module (G) acts as a semantic filter, weighing visual details against the user's prompt (e.g., emphasizing "atmosphere" for poetry vs. "objects" for stories), preventing the base model from being overwhelmed by irrelevant visual noise.

### Mechanism 3
High-fidelity visual grounding serves as a scaffold for creativity rather than a constraint by providing specific semantic hooks for metaphorical reasoning. By extracting abstract attributes (Level 3 info like "emotional atmosphere") alongside physical objects, the system provides the LLM with "raw material" for metaphor. Generic visual inputs lead to generic tropes; specific visual inputs (e.g., "flickering," "desolate") trigger specific, higher-quality associations in the LLM's weights.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Structured Visual Representations (Scene Graphs/JSON)**
  - **Why needed here:** The core innovation of VisuCraft relies on Module E transforming an image into a structured format (objects + attributes + relations). Understanding how to represent unstructured images as structured data is critical.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a JSON structure `{"object": "cliff", "attribute": "desolate"}` is more useful for a text generator than a 1024-dim embedding vector?

- **Concept:** **Prompt Engineering & In-Context Learning**
  - **Why needed here:** Module G is essentially an automated prompt engineer. You must understand how different prompt structures (e.g., few-shot vs. instruction-based) influence LVLM behavior to debug G.
  - **Quick check question:** How does "simple concatenation" differ from "contextualized integration" in the context of multimodal prompts?

- **Concept:** **Ablation Studies**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper validates its design by removing components (w/o E, w/o G). Understanding how to isolate variables is necessary to interpret the results in Section IV.C.
  - **Quick check question:** If removing Module G causes Instruction Adherence to drop but Visual Grounding stays high, what does that imply about G's function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input: Image ($I$) + User Instruction ($U$) → Extractor (E) → Generator (G) → Base LVLM (M) → Output: Text ($T$)
- **Critical path:** The Extractor (E) is the bottleneck. If E fails to capture "Level 3" granularity (abstract attributes/emotions), the Generator (G) has nothing to work with, and the final output reverts to generic generation.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Latency vs. Quality:** Adding two pre-processing modules (E and G) before the main LVLM (M) significantly increases inference time compared to a baseline LVLM.
  - **Specificity vs. Generality:** E is trained on specific datasets (ImageNet/COCO with augmented tags). It may struggle with domains outside its training data (e.g., abstract art not represented in COCO).
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"Generic Loop":** Output is coherent but boring and visually vague. *Likely cause:* E is outputting Level 1 (Basic Objects) data only.
  - **"Confabulation":** Output is creative but ignores the image. *Likely cause:* G failed to integrate $V$ into prompt $P$, or prioritized $U$ too heavily over $V$.
  - **"Format Error":** Output is a list of attributes rather than a story. *Likely cause:* G failed to contextualize the instruction, passing raw JSON to M.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Unit Test E:** Pass 10 diverse images through the Extractor. Manually verify if output contains Level 3 attributes (emotions/atmosphere) or just object labels.
  2. **Ablation G:** Run the same prompt with "Simple Concatenation" vs. "Dynamic Prompting." Measure the difference in Instruction Adherence scores.
  3. **Granularity Stress Test:** Force E to output only Level 1 data and run generation. Confirm if Creativity scores drop as predicted in Table III.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can VisuCraft be effectively adapted for video and audio modalities to support richer creative generation? The authors plan to explore integration with other modalities such as video or audio to enable even richer multimodal creative generation. This remains unresolved because the current framework is designed primarily for static image inputs and does not account for the temporal or acoustic complexities of video and audio data.

### Open Question 2
What are the computational latency and scalability constraints of the VisuCraft framework in real-time or high-resolution scenarios? The conclusion identifies investigating efficiency and scalability for real-time applications and extremely high-resolution visual inputs as a key future direction. This is unresolved because the paper evaluates output quality but does not report on the inference time or computational overhead added by the sequential processing of the Extractor (E) and Prompt Generator (G) modules.

### Open Question 3
How can adaptive learning be implemented within the Extractor (E) and Generator (G) to enable automatic style transfer and domain adaptation? The authors suggest that further research into adaptive learning mechanisms could allow for automatic style transfer and domain adaptation. This remains unresolved because the current implementation relies on specific training on datasets like ImageNet and COCO, lacking a demonstrated mechanism to dynamically adapt to unseen domains without manual fine-tuning.

### Open Question 4
Does VisuCraft maintain its performance advantage when evaluated on standardized public benchmarks outside of the self-constructed ImageStoryGen-500K dataset? The evaluation relies entirely on the self-constructed dataset and custom metrics, leaving the framework's generalizability to established external benchmarks unverified. This is unresolved because while the custom metrics focus on "Creativity" and "Instruction Adherence," it is unclear if the framework's structured extraction approach degrades performance on standard vision-language tasks that prioritize factual accuracy over creative generation.

## Limitations

- The exact architecture and weights of the Multimodal Structured Information Extractor (E) and Dynamic Prompt Generation Module (G) are not disclosed, making exact replication impossible
- The ImageStoryGen-500K dataset is self-constructed and not publicly available, preventing independent evaluation
- The VisuGen Metrics automated evaluation pipeline implementation details (prompts, scoring rubrics) are not specified

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the measured improvements over baseline LVLMs on the reported metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity, Instruction Adherence)
- **Medium confidence** in the stated mechanisms (structured extraction reducing ambiguity, dynamic prompting improving adherence, visual grounding enabling creativity) due to lack of ablation studies on individual mechanisms
- **Low confidence** in the generalisability of results without access to the evaluation dataset and implementation details

## Next Checks

1. Implement a simplified version of Module E trained to output Level 3 attributes and verify if creativity scores improve as predicted when forced to use only Level 1 output
2. Replicate the ablation study by removing Module G and measuring the specific drop in Instruction Adherence versus Visual Grounding to confirm G's prioritization function
3. Test the complete pipeline on a public image-instruction dataset (e.g., COCO with text prompts) to verify if improvements transfer beyond the constructed evaluation set
