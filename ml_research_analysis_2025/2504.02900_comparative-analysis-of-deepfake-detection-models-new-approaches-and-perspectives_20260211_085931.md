# Comparative Analysis of Deepfake Detection Models: New Approaches and Perspectives

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.02900
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02900
- Authors: Matheus Martins Batista
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: GenConViT achieves 93.82% accuracy on DeepSpeak dataset, outperforming other deepfake detection models in the DeepfakeBenchmark

## Executive Summary
This study investigates deepfake detection methods, introducing GenConViT - a hybrid architecture combining Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer components. The model was evaluated against established architectures in the DeepfakeBenchmark using datasets like WildDeepfake and DeepSpeak. Results demonstrate that GenConViT achieves superior performance with 93.82% accuracy on DeepSpeak after fine-tuning, establishing a new benchmark for deepfake detection. The work highlights the effectiveness of hybrid architectures in capturing both spatial and temporal features essential for detecting manipulated video content.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates multiple deepfake detection architectures within the DeepfakeBenchmark framework, with particular focus on the novel GenConViT model. GenConViT employs a hybrid approach combining feature extraction from multiple architectures - Autoencoder, VAE, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer - to detect deepfakes through comprehensive feature analysis. The evaluation compares GenConViT against established models including Xception, EfficientNet, and SPSL across different datasets. Performance metrics are measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with special attention to the model's ability to generalize across diverse deepfake generation techniques and real-world scenarios.

## Key Results
- GenConViT achieved 93.82% accuracy on the DeepSpeak dataset after fine-tuning, surpassing all other benchmark models
- The hybrid architecture combining multiple feature extraction methods demonstrated superior performance in capturing complex deepfake patterns
- Model evaluation across WildDeepfake and DeepSpeak datasets showed consistent performance improvements over traditional single-architecture approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- Deepfake detection fundamentals: Understanding video manipulation techniques and their visual artifacts is essential for developing effective detection methods. Quick check: Can identify common deepfake artifacts like facial inconsistencies and unnatural movements.
- Hybrid architecture benefits: Combining multiple neural network architectures can capture diverse feature representations, improving detection robustness. Quick check: Understands how different architectures complement each other in feature extraction.
- Transfer learning in computer vision: Pre-training on large datasets and fine-tuning on specific tasks enables better performance with limited data. Quick check: Can explain the process of adapting pre-trained models to new detection tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Autoencoder -> VAE -> ConvNeXt -> Swin Transformer -> Classification Layer

Critical Path: Input video frames → Autoencoder/VAE feature extraction → ConvNeXt spatial feature processing → Swin Transformer temporal feature analysis → Concatenated features → Classification layer → Deepfake probability output

Design Tradeoffs: The hybrid approach maximizes detection accuracy but increases computational complexity and inference time. Single-architecture models offer faster processing but sacrifice detection performance. The balance between accuracy and efficiency must be determined based on deployment requirements.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance on unseen deepfake generation techniques, reduced accuracy with low-quality or heavily compressed videos, and potential overfitting to specific manipulation patterns in training data.

First Experiments:
1. Test GenConViT on a small subset of WildDeepfake dataset to verify basic functionality
2. Compare feature extraction outputs from individual components (Autoencoder, ConvNeXt, Swin Transformer) to understand their contributions
3. Evaluate model performance on synthetic deepfakes with known manipulation patterns to establish baseline detection capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the GenConViT architecture perform when formally integrated into the DeepfakeBenchmark framework compared to its standalone implementation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly suggest "adapt[ing] GenConViT for integration into DeepfakeBenchmark" as a primary direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current study evaluated GenConViT separately using custom scripts and compared the results against benchmark outputs, rather than running the model within the unified benchmark infrastructure.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of GenConViT metrics when executed within the DeepfakeBenchmark pipeline versus its independent execution on the DeepSpeak dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can benchmark models improve detection accuracy on WildDeepfake by utilizing the dataset's native preprocessing methods rather than the benchmark's standard alignment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors recommend "obtaining and training the benchmark models using the original WildDeepfake dataset" to facilitate standardized preprocessing.
- Why unresolved: WildDeepfake was only tested with GenConViT; other benchmark models were not evaluated on this dataset, leaving their performance on "in-the-wild" data with standard preprocessing unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics of Xception, EfficientNet, and UCF models on the WildDeepfake dataset using its native face extraction methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the exclusion of data augmentation strategies limit the generalization capability of the Meso4Inception model on modern deepfake datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors attribute Meso4Inception's poor performance (69.29% accuracy) partly to its training configuration, noting it was the only model that did not employ data augmentation.
- Why unresolved: The paper compared models based on their provided configurations in the benchmark without isolating the specific impact of the augmentation strategy on the underperforming model.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation study results showing Meso4Inception performance on DeepSpeak after retraining with the same data augmentation pipeline used by high-performing models like SPSL.

## Limitations
- Performance metrics focus primarily on accuracy without extensive analysis of false positive rates or computational efficiency requirements
- Evaluation is limited to specific deepfake generation techniques, with uncertain generalization to emerging manipulation methods
- The hybrid architecture's computational complexity may limit practical deployment on resource-constrained devices

## Confidence
- Model architecture innovation: Medium
- Benchmark performance claims: Medium-High
- Practical deployment considerations: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate model performance across diverse deepfake generation methods and quality levels beyond the DeepfakeBenchmark datasets
2. Conduct comprehensive computational efficiency analysis, including inference time and resource requirements for deployment scenarios
3. Test robustness against adversarial attacks and emerging deepfake generation techniques not represented in current benchmark datasets
