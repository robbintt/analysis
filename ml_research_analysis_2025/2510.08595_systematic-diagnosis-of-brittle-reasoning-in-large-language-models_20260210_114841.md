core_contribution: This paper introduces a systematic framework for diagnosing specific
  failure points in LLM mathematical reasoning. The approach involves generating structured
  reasoning traces from gpt-3.5-turbo on GSM8K, then using gpt-4o-mini to categorize
  errors and perform unsupervised clustering of reasoning sentences to identify distinct
  "reasoning modes." The analysis reveals a stark contrast between highly reliable
  procedural modes (achieving 100% correctness in tasks like sequential calculation)
  and exceptionally brittle modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions
  (e.g., 0% correctness in calculating topping combinations with constraints).

# Systematic Diagnosis of Brittle Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08595
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08595
- Reference count: 9
- Key outcome: This paper introduces a systematic framework for diagnosing specific failure points in LLM mathematical reasoning, revealing stark contrast between highly reliable procedural modes and exceptionally brittle combinatorial reasoning modes.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic framework for diagnosing specific failure points in LLM mathematical reasoning. The approach involves generating structured reasoning traces from gpt-3.5-turbo on GSM8K, then using gpt-4o-mini to categorize errors and perform unsupervised clustering of reasoning sentences to identify distinct "reasoning modes." The analysis reveals a stark contrast between highly reliable procedural modes (achieving 100% correctness in tasks like sequential calculation) and exceptionally brittle modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions (e.g., 0% correctness in calculating topping combinations with constraints). This non-human-like brittleness—showing both absolute mastery and total failure on closely related concepts—provides a granular method for evaluating mathematical comprehension and offers a precise roadmap for developing more robust AI reasoners.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves three main stages: first, generating structured reasoning traces by prompting gpt-3.5-turbo to solve GSM8K problems step-by-step; second, using gpt-4o-mini to automatically categorize each reasoning error into specific types (calculation, logic, setup, etc.); and third, applying unsupervised clustering to group reasoning sentences into distinct "modes" based on their semantic similarity. The clustering algorithm identifies patterns in how LLMs approach different types of mathematical problems, distinguishing between procedural reasoning (step-by-step calculations) and combinatorial reasoning (handling multiple constraints and possibilities). This framework enables precise localization of where and why reasoning breaks down, moving beyond aggregate accuracy metrics to understand the specific cognitive processes that succeed or fail.

## Key Results
- LLM reasoning modes show extreme contrast: some achieve 100% correctness while others score 0% on closely related problems
- Procedural modes (sequential calculation, comparison) demonstrate near-perfect reliability
- Combinatorial modes with constraints (topping combinations, subset selections) show complete failure
- The brittleness pattern is non-human-like, exhibiting both absolute mastery and total failure on closely related concepts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing complex reasoning into granular sentence-level units, then clustering these units to reveal distinct cognitive modes. The unsupervised clustering captures semantic patterns in how models approach different problem types, while gpt-4o-mini's error categorization provides a structured taxonomy of failure modes. This multi-layered analysis exposes the discontinuity in LLM reasoning capabilities that aggregate metrics would obscure.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Error Categorization Taxonomy**: A structured system for classifying reasoning errors (calculation, logic, setup, etc.) - why needed: enables systematic analysis of failure patterns; quick check: compare error distributions across different problem types

2. **Sentence-Level Reasoning Decomposition**: Breaking down problem-solving into individual reasoning steps - why needed: reveals granular failure points; quick check: verify that each sentence corresponds to a distinct reasoning action

3. **Unsupervised Clustering for Mode Identification**: Grouping similar reasoning patterns without predefined labels - why needed: discovers natural cognitive modes; quick check: examine cluster coherence through manual inspection

4. **GSM8K Dataset Structure**: Curated collection of grade school math word problems - why needed: provides standardized benchmark; quick check: analyze problem distribution across mathematical concepts

5. **Reasoning Trace Generation**: Systematic prompting for step-by-step solutions - why needed: captures complete reasoning process; quick check: verify trace completeness and logical flow

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: GSM8K problems -> gpt-3.5-turbo (reasoning traces) -> gpt-4o-mini (error categorization) -> Unsupervised clustering (mode identification) -> Performance analysis

**Critical Path**: Problem generation → Reasoning trace extraction → Error classification → Mode clustering → Performance evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses gpt-4o-mini for error categorization (cost vs. accuracy tradeoff) rather than human annotation; relies on unsupervised clustering (discovering patterns vs. interpretability tradeoff)

**Failure Signatures**: Complete success in procedural modes (100% accuracy) vs. complete failure in combinatorial modes (0% accuracy); errors concentrated in constraint-handling and possibility enumeration

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Apply error categorization to reasoning traces from different model versions to track improvements
2. Test mode identification on expanded GSM8K variants with modified constraints
3. Compare LLM reasoning modes with human problem-solving patterns on identical tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Error categorization reliability depends on gpt-4o-mini's accuracy, introducing potential bias
- GSM8K dataset may not generalize to more complex or open-ended reasoning tasks
- Analysis treats errors as isolated events without accounting for cascading effects
- Limited sample sizes within modes may inflate "100% correctness" claims

## Confidence
- High confidence: The observed contrast between procedural and combinatorial reasoning modes is well-supported by the data
- Medium confidence: The clustering methodology appears sound, though boundaries between modes could benefit from additional validation
- Low confidence: The claim of "non-human-like brittleness" requires further empirical comparison with human performance

## Next Checks
1. Validate the error categorization pipeline by having human annotators independently classify reasoning errors and compare against gpt-4o-mini's outputs
2. Test the identified reasoning modes on a broader range of mathematical reasoning datasets beyond GSM8K
3. Conduct controlled experiments comparing LLM performance patterns with human solvers on the same problem sets
