# VCBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Venture Capital

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14448
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14448
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: GPT-4o achieves 25.1 F0.5 score, 3.2x improvement over market baseline in predicting founder success

## Executive Summary
VCBench introduces the first standardized benchmark for predicting founder success in venture capital using anonymized founder profiles. The dataset contains 9,000 profiles with a 9% baseline success rate, created through a multistage anonymization pipeline that reduced re-identification risk by over 90% while preserving predictive signal. Nine state-of-the-art LLMs were evaluated, with GPT-4o achieving the highest performance at 25.1 F0.5 score. Most models outperformed human benchmarks, demonstrating that anonymized founder profiles contain sufficient signal for accurate early-stage startup prediction.

## Method Summary
The benchmark employs a multistage anonymization pipeline that processes founder profiles to remove personally identifiable information while preserving key success indicators. The dataset consists of 9,000 anonymized founder profiles with associated success labels, where success is defined by venture capital industry standards. Models are evaluated using F0.5 score to balance precision and recall appropriately for the venture capital context. Performance is benchmarked against both market baseline (9% success rate) and human expert evaluations.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieved the highest F0.5 score of 25.1, representing a 3.2x improvement over the market baseline
- Most evaluated LLMs outperformed human benchmarks in predicting founder success
- Anonymization pipeline reduced re-identification risk by over 90% while maintaining predictive signal

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from the preservation of predictive founder attributes during anonymization while removing direct identifiers. The multistage pipeline successfully extracts signal-rich features such as educational background, professional experience patterns, and startup history indicators that correlate with venture success. By maintaining these structural patterns while eliminating PII, the dataset captures the essential characteristics VCs evaluate while protecting individual privacy. The use of F0.5 score emphasizes precision over recall, aligning with venture capital's high-cost false positive scenario where funding unsuccessful founders wastes resources.

## Foundational Learning
- Venture capital success prediction: Understanding what factors VCs consider when evaluating founders
  - Why needed: Provides context for feature engineering and model interpretation
  - Quick check: Compare model predictions with actual VC investment decisions
- Anonymization techniques: Methods for removing PII while preserving predictive signal
  - Why needed: Ensures privacy compliance while maintaining dataset utility
  - Quick check: Measure information loss versus privacy gain
- F-score metrics: Weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall
  - Why needed: Balances false positives and false negatives in imbalanced datasets
  - Quick check: Compare F1, F0.5, and F2 scores to understand precision-recall tradeoffs

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Dataset -> Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Evaluation -> Leaderboard
- Critical path: Profile anonymization → Feature extraction → Model inference → Performance validation
- Design tradeoffs: Privacy preservation vs. predictive accuracy, computational efficiency vs. model complexity
- Failure signatures: High false positive rates may indicate overfitting to noise, low precision suggests poor signal extraction
- First experiments:
  1. Baseline evaluation using simple heuristics (e.g., education, previous exits)
  2. Ablation study removing specific profile features to identify key predictors
  3. Cross-validation across different founder demographics and industries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How well do anonymized founder profiles capture the nuanced interpersonal dynamics that VCs evaluate in person?
- What is the optimal balance between privacy preservation and signal retention across different stages of the investment funnel?
- How can the benchmark adapt to evolving definitions of founder success as venture capital markets mature?

## Limitations
- 9% baseline success rate may not generalize across different venture capital markets or time periods
- F0.5 metric choice may not fully capture cost-benefit tradeoffs relevant to actual VC decision-making
- Reported 90% reduction in re-identification risk lacks detailed documentation on potential residual privacy vulnerabilities
- Anonymization may remove contextual information that experienced VCs use for holistic assessment

## Confidence
- High confidence: GPT-4o's superior performance over other LLMs and the market baseline
- Medium confidence: Generalization of results to other VC contexts and markets
- Low confidence: Long-term predictive validity and real-world deployment impact

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-market validation using founder profiles from different geographic regions and investment stages to assess generalizability
2. Implement longitudinal tracking to verify whether model predictions correlate with actual founder success outcomes over 3-5 year periods
3. Perform adversarial privacy testing with domain experts attempting re-identification using external data sources and professional networks
