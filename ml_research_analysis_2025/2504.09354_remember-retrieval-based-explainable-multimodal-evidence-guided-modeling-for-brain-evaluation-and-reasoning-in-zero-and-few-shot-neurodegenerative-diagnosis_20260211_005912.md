# REMEMBER: Retrieval-based Explainable Multimodal Evidence-guided Modeling for Brain Evaluation and Reasoning in Zero- and Few-shot Neurodegenerative Diagnosis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.09354
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09354
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 97.19% accuracy in binary dementia classification with explainable, retrieval-augmented multimodal MRI analysis

## Executive Summary
REMEMBER introduces a retrieval-based, explainable multimodal framework for zero- and few-shot Alzheimer's diagnosis from brain MRI scans. It combines a contrastively aligned vision-text encoder with an evidence-guided inference module that retrieves semantically similar reference cases from an expert-verified dataset and integrates their contextual information via attention-based reasoning. The model predicts abnormality types, dementia diagnosis, type, and severity while generating structured, clinically aligned reports that include retrieved references, similarity scores, and attention weights. Evaluated on a hybrid dataset, REMEMBER achieves strong performance across multiple diagnostic tasks while offering transparent, evidence-backed explanations aligned with clinical workflows.

## Method Summary
REMEMBER employs a two-stage architecture: a foundation model stage using a pretrained CLIP-based vision-text encoder to map MRI slices and clinical reports into a shared embedding space, and a diagnosis stage featuring an evidence-guided inference module that retrieves semantically similar cases from a reference dataset and applies attention-based reasoning to integrate contextual information. The framework supports zero- and few-shot learning by leveraging retrieved examples rather than requiring large labeled datasets for each new task. It generates explainable outputs including abnormality predictions, severity scores, and structured clinical reports with retrieved references and attention visualizations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 97.19% accuracy in binary dementia classification
- Achieves 90.94% accuracy in severity classification (none/mild/moderate/severe)
- Generates clinically aligned structured reports with retrieved evidence and attention weights
- Performs zero- and few-shot learning effectively across multiple diagnostic tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
REMEMBER works by combining the generalization power of pretrained multimodal encoders with the specificity of retrieval-based reasoning. The contrastive alignment between vision and text embeddings enables meaningful semantic retrieval of similar cases, while the attention-based integration of retrieved evidence allows the model to ground its predictions in clinically relevant examples. This approach addresses the data scarcity problem in medical imaging by leveraging existing expert-verified cases rather than requiring extensive new annotations.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal Contrastive Learning**
- Why needed: Enables semantic alignment between MRI images and clinical reports in shared embedding space
- Quick check: Test retrieval performance using only image-to-image or text-to-text similarity

**Attention-based Evidence Integration**
- Why needed: Allows selective incorporation of relevant retrieved cases while filtering noise
- Quick check: Compare attention weight distributions for correct vs incorrect predictions

**Zero-shot Learning via Retrieval**
- Why needed: Enables diagnosis without task-specific training data by leveraging semantically similar cases
- Quick check: Measure performance degradation when reducing number of retrieved references

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
MRI Input -> Vision Encoder -> CLIP Embedding -> Retrieval Module -> Attention Layer -> Diagnosis Module -> Output + Explanation

**Critical Path:**
MRI slice → Vision encoder → CLIP embedding → Semantic retrieval → Attention-weighted integration → Diagnostic prediction

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Retrieval vs end-to-end training: Prioritizes interpretability and zero-shot capability over potential performance gains from fine-tuning
- Single vs multiple retrievals: Uses top-K retrieved cases to balance context richness with noise reduction
- Attention vs direct averaging: Employs attention weights to dynamically weight retrieved evidence based on relevance

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor retrieval performance indicates embedding space misalignment
- Over-reliance on single retrieved case suggests attention mechanism not learning proper weighting
- High variance across folds suggests sensitivity to reference dataset composition

**First Experiments:**
1. Ablation study removing retrieval module to isolate contribution of case-based reasoning
2. Retrieval-only baseline using nearest-neighbor classification in embedding space
3. Visualization of attention weights across retrieved cases to verify meaningful evidence selection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in source material.

## Limitations
- Relies on hybrid dataset combining public MRI data with single-hospital clinical reports, creating potential data distribution bias
- Limited external validation on truly independent, multi-institutional datasets
- Explanation evaluation based on expert scoring rather than prospective clinical trials or impact studies

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical soundness of retrieval-based multimodal architecture and reported performance metrics
- **Medium confidence**: Clinical alignment and usefulness of generated explanations (expert scoring methodology)
- **Medium confidence**: Generalization to diverse clinical populations (single-hospital data source)

## Next Checks
1. External validation on independent multi-institutional datasets with diverse imaging protocols, scanner types, and patient demographics
2. Prospective clinical study comparing REMEMBER-assisted diagnosis against standard clinical workflow in terms of diagnostic accuracy, time efficiency, and inter-rater agreement
3. Ablation study isolating the contribution of the retrieval mechanism versus the core multimodal encoder to determine performance drivers
