core_contribution: The study evaluates six medical LLM benchmarks for their representativeness
  of African disease burdens. While global benchmarks like MedQA-USMLE, PubMedQA,
  and MedMCQA dominate the literature, they underrepresent high-burden African diseases
  such as malaria, TB, and sickle-cell disease, and lack alignment with local clinical
  guidelines.

# Mind the Gap: Evaluating the Representativeness of Quantitative Medical Language Reasoning LLM Benchmarks for African Disease Burdens

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.16322
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16322
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Alama Health QA benchmark, grounded in Kenyan guidelines and generated via RAG, showed highest prevalence of African disease terms and best clinical relevance scores compared to global benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates six medical LLM benchmarks for their alignment with African disease burdens, revealing significant underrepresentation of high-burden conditions like malaria, TB, and sickle-cell disease in global benchmarks. The newly developed Alama Health QA benchmark, created through a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline using Kenyan Ministry of Health guidelines, demonstrated superior coverage of neglected tropical diseases (>40% prevalence) and higher clinical relevance scores. Qualitative expert reviews confirmed Alama's better alignment with local clinical practice, guideline adherence, and cultural context. The findings highlight the critical need for regionally anchored benchmarks to ensure safe and effective LLM deployment in African health systems.

## Method Summary
The study developed Alama Health QA by extracting clinical practice guidelines from the Kenyan Ministry of Health and processing them through a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline using Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite. This generated 40,607 case-based multiple-choice questions with explanations referencing source guidelines. Five existing benchmarks (AfriMed-QA, MMLU-Medical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA, MedQA-USMLE) were used for comparison. Quantitative analysis included NTD term frequencies, disease-specific term counts (malaria, HIV, TB, sickle-cell), readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid, MTLD, TTR), and lexical diversity. Qualitative evaluation involved expert review of 25 randomly sampled questions per dataset across five dimensions: clinical relevance, guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and cultural fit, using a 5-point Likert scale.

## Key Results
- Global benchmarks (MedQA-USMLE, PubMedQA, MedMCQA) showed minimal representation of malaria, TB, and sickle-cell disease compared to Kenyan disease burden data
- Alama Health QA achieved >40% prevalence of NTD-related terms, outperforming all comparison benchmarks
- Expert qualitative scoring ranked Alama highest in clinical relevance, guideline alignment, and cultural fit, while PubMedQA scored lowest across all dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RAG-based generation ensures questions are grounded in actual clinical guidelines, capturing local disease priorities and treatment protocols that generic benchmarks miss. The combination of quantitative term frequency analysis with qualitative expert review provides both statistical and contextual validation of benchmark representativeness.

## Foundational Learning
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Why needed - grounds LLM outputs in authoritative sources; Quick check - verify generated questions cite specific guideline passages
- **NER (Named Entity Recognition)**: Why needed - extracts medical entities for term frequency analysis; Quick check - validate extracted terms against WHO NTD list
- **Readability Metrics**: Why needed - ensures questions match clinical comprehension levels; Quick check - compare Flesch-Kincaid scores against medical professional reading levels

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Kenyan Guidelines -> Text Chunking -> Vector Store -> RAG Pipeline -> Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite -> Question Generation -> Quality Assessment
- **Critical Path**: Guideline extraction → RAG-based question generation → Expert review → Comparative analysis
- **Design Tradeoffs**: RAG provides grounding but depends on guideline completeness; automated generation enables scale but requires human validation
- **Failure Signatures**: Low NTD recall indicates incomplete guideline coverage or NER model limitations; poor guideline alignment suggests insufficient prompt constraints
- **First Experiments**: 1) Validate NER model recall on WHO NTD terminology; 2) Test alternative chunking strategies for optimal retrieval; 3) Compare RAG output quality across different LLM models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single RAG pipeline with one LLM model limits generalizability of generation approach
- Expert review sample size (25 questions) may not capture full benchmark biases
- English-language focus potentially misses important local language disease terminology

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Global benchmarks underrepresent African disease burdens (supported by term frequency analysis)
- Medium Confidence: Alama Health QA better represents Kenyan disease context (supported by both quantitative and qualitative metrics)
- Low Confidence: Generalizability to other African contexts beyond Kenya (study explicitly grounded in Kenyan guidelines)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate RAG pipeline with alternative chunking strategies and retrieval configurations to verify robustness
2. Expand expert review to include disease-specific panels for malaria, TB, and NTDs
3. Apply methodology to medical guidelines from at least two additional African countries for cross-national validation
