# Humains-Junior: A 3.8B Language Model Achieving GPT-4o-Level Factual Accuracy by Directed Exoskeleton Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25933
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25933

- Key result: 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level factual accuracy (±5pp) at 19× lower cost

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Humains-Junior, a 3.8B parameter language model that achieves factual accuracy equivalent to GPT-4o on the FACTS Grounding benchmark through a novel "Exoskeleton Reasoning" framework. The key insight is that factual grounding failures stem from attention allocation problems rather than knowledge gaps, and can be addressed through directed validation scaffolds combined with behavioral fine-tuning. The approach demonstrates that small models can achieve frontier-level reliability when equipped with proper epistemic discipline, challenging the assumption that factual reliability requires frontier-scale models.

## Method Summary
The method combines behavioral fine-tuning on 300M tokens of production conversations with a minimal directed validation scaffold (Exoskeleton Reasoning). The fine-tuning teaches protocol compliance as a learned behavior without domain-specific knowledge, while the scaffold provides structured reasoning guidance through meta-cognitive prompting. The approach uses a unified prompt with few-shot examples demonstrating context adherence, and achieves results through synergistic interaction where both components are required for small models to benefit significantly.

## Key Results
- Humains-Junior achieves 72.7% accuracy vs GPT-4o's 73.5% on 500 FACTS questions (TOST p<0.001 for ±5pp equivalence)
- 19× cost reduction compared to GPT-4o in cloud deployment
- 5.1× multiplier effect: scaffold+FT improves accuracy by 17.7pp vs sum of individual effects
- Small base models require both fine-tuning and scaffolding; neither alone produces significant gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Factual grounding failures stem primarily from attention allocation, not knowledge gaps.
- Mechanism: The Exoskeleton prompt redirects model attention from "generating helpful responses" to "validating grounded responses" by explicitly requiring models to compare internal knowledge against provided context before responding.
- Core assumption: Models already possess latent error-detection capabilities that remain inactive without explicit prompting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "teaching epistemic discipline" rather than domain answers produces the gains
  - [Section 4.9] "hallucination stems from attention allocation failure, not knowledge gaps"
  - [Section 6.6] "Models already possess the capabilities to validate claims, detect missing information, and withhold unverified responses"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation for this specific attention mechanism; related work on process supervision exists but doesn't confirm this hypothesis
- Break condition: If models lack the latent capability to distinguish supported from unsupported claims, attention redirection alone cannot improve performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Protocol compliance is the primary bottleneck preventing small models from benefiting from cognitive scaffolds.
- Mechanism: Small models lack instruction-following capabilities to reliably execute multi-step reasoning protocols. Fine-tuning on structured reasoning dialogues (without domain-specific knowledge) teaches protocol execution as a learned behavior.
- Core assumption: Fine-tuning transfers reasoning patterns across domains without requiring domain overlap with the target task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 5.1] Scaffold-only on base Phi-3.5: +3.5pp (p=0.08, not significant); FT+scaffold: +17.7pp (p<0.001) — 5.1× multiplier
  - [Section 5.1] "Fine-tuning alone provides no benefit: Humains-Junior without scaffolding performs identically to base Phi-3.5 (55.0%)"
  - [Section 4.6] Training data contained zero exposure to FACTS benchmark or similar tasks
  - [corpus] Weak external validation; corpus does not contain studies replicating this protocol-compliance bottleneck finding
- Break condition: If fine-tuning data contains task-relevant knowledge (contamination), improvements could stem from knowledge transfer rather than protocol learning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-judge evaluation with per-judge averaging cancels individual model biases.
- Mechanism: Individual judges show systematic preferences (Claude favors GPT-4o; GPT favors Humains-Junior; Gemini neutral). Three-judge averaging with response anonymization causes opposing biases to cancel.
- Core assumption: Judge biases are approximately symmetric and cancel rather than compound.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 5.2] McNemar tests: Claude χ²=30.28 (p<0.001, favors GPT-4o); GPT χ²=11.78 (p=0.0006, favors HJ); Gemini χ²=0.31 (p=0.576, no preference)
  - [Section 5.0.1] Aggregate difference: +0.8pp with permutation p=0.72 despite individual judge biases
  - [Section 5.0.1] "Judge bias cancellation... empirically validating the multi-judge benchmark design"
  - [corpus] No corpus papers validate this specific bias-cancellation mechanism for this judge configuration
- Break condition: If judge biases become asymmetric (e.g., all judges favor one model type), cancellation fails and aggregate scores become unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **TOST (Two One-Sided Tests) equivalence testing**
  - Why needed here: Standard significance tests can only detect differences; TOST formally tests whether two systems are equivalent within a margin, which is required to claim "GPT-4o-level" performance.
  - Quick check question: Why does failing to find a significant difference (p>0.05) not prove two models are equivalent?

- Concept: **Synergistic interaction vs additive effects**
  - Why needed here: The 5.1× multiplier (scaffold+FT effect vs sum of individual effects) indicates the interventions are complementary enablers, not independent improvements. This informs deployment decisions (both required for small models).
  - Quick check question: If scaffold-only adds +3.5pp and FT-only adds +0pp, what would an additive model predict for combined effect? What does the observed +17.7pp imply?

- Concept: **Context-dominant vs balanced authority deployment modes**
  - Why needed here: Exoskeleton Reasoning explicitly instructs models to follow context even when incorrect, which is dangerous in safety-critical domains. Mode selection is a safety-critical deployment decision.
  - Quick check question: In what deployment scenarios would Mode 1 (context-dominant) be dangerous, and what modification does Mode 2 add?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base model (Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) -> Phase 1 fine-tuning (300M tokens) -> Phase 2 fine-tuning (LoRA rank=1) -> Exoskeleton scaffold (Analysis/Response prompt) -> Three-judge evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Behavioral fine-tuning (Phase 1) enables protocol execution capability
  2. Exoskeleton scaffold at inference provides structured reasoning guidance
  3. Both components required — neither alone produces significant gains for small models
  4. Temperature 0.3 for small models; unified prompt for reproducibility

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Unified vs optimized prompts**: Unified (1-shot for most models, 3-shot for GPT-4o/Claude 3.5) prioritizes reproducibility; model-specific prompts achieve higher absolute scores but reduce comparability
  - **±5pp vs ±3pp equivalence margin**: Wider margin establishes practical equivalence; stricter margin (±3pp) not achieved (90% CI upper bound 4.1% exceeds 3%)
  - **Context-dominant behavior**: Required for benchmark compliance and trusted RAG, but shifts verification responsibility to context provider and risks harm with incorrect context

- Failure signatures:
  - **Scaffold-only degradation**: Base GPT-4o-mini with scaffold shows -5.0pp (67.3%→62.3%) — indicates protocol compliance failure, not scaffold ineffectiveness
  - **High variance at small n**: Base models show σ=3.2% vs Exoskeleton σ=2.4% — inconsistent protocol execution
  - **Judge unanimity gap**: GPT-4o baseline 59.4% unanimity vs Humains-Junior 74.6% — indicates less predictable response quality

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce ablation on Q1-500**: Run all four conditions (±FT × ±scaffold) with identical prompts and temperature settings. Verify: scaffold-only ~+3.5pp (n.s.), FT-only ~0pp, combined ~+17.7pp (p<0.001). This validates the synergistic mechanism claim.
  2. **Test scaffold transfer to untrained small models**: Apply unified Exoskeleton prompt to a different small model (e.g., Qwen-2.5-3B) without fine-tuning. Expected: minimal improvement (~+2-4pp, likely n.s.) due to protocol compliance bottleneck. Confirms generalizability of the bottleneck finding.
  3. **Judge panel sensitivity analysis**: Re-score 100 questions with a non-overlapping panel (replace GPT-4o judge with Claude 3.5). Measure: does aggregate score shift >2pp? This tests the robustness of bias-cancellation claims.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the reported accuracy improvement stem from genuine factual grounding or merely from increased epistemic restraint (e.g., refusing to answer difficult questions)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.3, "Incomplete Analysis of Abstention Behavior," states the authors did not measure response length, partial answer rates, or confidence calibration curves.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation follows FACTS methodology, which marks responses as "ineligible" only by unanimous judge agreement, potentially masking a trade-off where models achieve high accuracy by providing less information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Accuracy vs. coverage plots, response length distributions, and separate analysis of "full answer" vs. "explicit abstention" categories.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the statistical equivalence between Humains-Junior and GPT-4o be maintained across the full FACTS benchmark and the private split?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7.1 notes that experiments were conducted on sequential subsets (n=500) rather than the complete benchmark and "full-dataset validation would provide stronger confirmation."
- Why unresolved: Sequential selection of the first n questions may not capture the full difficulty distribution of the 1,719-example benchmark, and results on the private split remain unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the TOST equivalence procedure on the full 860 public examples and submission to the official leaderboard for private split evaluation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does behavioral fine-tuning on specific production domains (e.g., automotive, collections) transfer to general-purpose factual reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.6 details training on specific conversational logs, and Section 7.4 suggests the synergy relies on specific protocol compliance rather than general reasoning.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the learned "epistemic discipline" is a generalizable meta-cognitive skill or if it is overfit to the conversational styles and constraints of the specific training domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the model on benchmarks featuring domains entirely absent from the 300M token training corpus (e.g., abstract academic reasoning).

## Limitations

- Generalization concerns: Results demonstrated on single benchmark (FACTS Grounding) with specific prompting protocol
- Statistical power: ±5pp equivalence margin represents practical rather than tight performance match to GPT-4o
- Context-dominant deployment mode requires careful consideration for safety-critical applications

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The synergistic effect of fine-tuning plus scaffolding for small models (Claim: "both components required — neither alone produces significant gains for small models"). Supported by statistically significant ablation results (p<0.001) showing 5.1× multiplier effect.

**Medium Confidence**: The attention allocation hypothesis (Claim: "factual grounding failures stem primarily from attention allocation, not knowledge gaps"). Supported by qualitative evidence about latent capabilities but lacks direct measurement of attention mechanisms.

**Medium Confidence**: The judge bias cancellation mechanism (Claim: "multi-judge evaluation with per-judge averaging cancels individual model biases"). Supported by systematic bias patterns but lacks external validation with different judge panels.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Across Benchmarks**: Apply the same Exoskeleton Reasoning protocol to other factual accuracy benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA) to test whether the attention redirection mechanism generalizes beyond FACTS Grounding.

2. **Attention Mechanism Validation**: Use mechanistic interpretability techniques to directly measure whether the Exoskeleton prompt actually redirects model attention from response generation to context validation, as hypothesized.

3. **Judge Panel Robustness Test**: Re-run the FACTS evaluation with a different non-overlapping judge panel to verify that the bias-cancellation mechanism is robust to judge composition changes.
