core_contribution: This study estimates the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio
  Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. The authors examine
  how iD estimates vary with Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure
  similarity to the MiraBest subset of RGZ.

# Intrinsic Dimension Estimation for Radio Galaxy Zoo using Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11490
- Authors: Joan Font-Quer Roset; Devina Mohan; Anna Scaife
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Diffusion score vectors can estimate intrinsic dimension of radio galaxy data, with OOD sources showing higher iD values that correlate with BNN energy scores.

## Executive Summary
This study applies score-based diffusion models to estimate the intrinsic dimension of the Radio Galaxy Zoo dataset, revealing that out-of-distribution radio sources exhibit higher dimensionality than in-distribution sources. The authors develop a novel method using SVD of score matrices to identify manifold dimensionality, showing that this approach outperforms classical estimators on complex astronomical data. The work establishes a relationship between intrinsic dimension and Bayesian neural network energy scores, suggesting potential applications for anomaly detection and self-supervised representation learning in radio astronomy.

## Method Summary
The method trains a DDPM diffusion model on RGZ images (72×72, filtered for consensus ≥0.65 and angular size >20 arcsec) and an HMC-based BNN on the MiraBest Confident subset (1256 images, 150×150, binary FRI/FRII classification). For each RGZ source, Algorithm 1 samples K=328 perturbed versions, computes score vectors via the trained DDPM, constructs a d×K score matrix, and applies SVD to identify the largest singular value gap. Intrinsic dimension is estimated as ambient dimension minus the number of large singular values. Results are compared against MLE (m=5,20), Local PCA (α=0.05), and PPCA baselines, and correlated with BNN energy score intervals, FR morphological classes, and signal-to-noise ratio.

## Key Results
- OOD radio sources exhibit higher intrinsic dimension values than in-distribution sources
- Overall RGZ iD exceeds typical values for natural image datasets (consistent with complex astrophysical structure)
- No strong relationship between FR I and FR II classes, though FR II sources tend to have higher SNR at low iD values (<100)
- Weak inverse trend between signal-to-noise ratio and intrinsic dimension across the dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Score vectors from trained diffusion models encode the local intrinsic dimension of data manifolds through their geometric concentration in normal vs. tangent space.
- **Mechanism:** When perturbing a data point with small noise, the score vector ∇ₓ ln(pₜ(x)) points toward the manifold projection. As diffusion time t → 0, score vectors concentrate in the normal space of the manifold. SVD of the score matrix reveals this: the number of large singular values corresponds to the normal space dimension. Subtracting this from ambient dimension yields intrinsic dimension.
- **Core assumption:** Data lies on a compact, smooth, embedded manifold with strictly positive, differentiable density (no zero-probability regions within the support).
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] and [section 2.1] establish theoretical foundation; [corpus] includes related work on manifold-based representation learning and diffusion model convergence.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Out-of-distribution radio sources exhibit higher intrinsic dimension than in-distribution sources, creating a measurable relationship between iD and BNN energy scores.
- **Mechanism:** The BNN (trained on MiraBest) assigns energy scores based on logit distributions across posterior samples. Higher energy indicates greater deviation from training distribution. These OOD sources show higher iD, suggesting they occupy more complex submanifolds or contain additional noise dimensions not captured in the labeled benchmark.
- **Core assumption:** OOD sources have genuinely different manifold structure rather than just different probability density on the same manifold.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] and [section 4, Figure 2] show iD increasing with energy score intervals; [corpus] includes relevant OOD detection work in radio astronomy.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A weak inverse relationship exists between signal-to-noise ratio and intrinsic dimension, though this relationship is inconsistent and should not be assumed causal.
- **Mechanism:** Higher noise levels may introduce spurious variation that inflates apparent dimensionality. At low iD values (<100), FR II sources tend to show higher SNR, suggesting cleaner signals correlate with simpler manifold structure. However, the relationship is not deterministic—high SNR does not guarantee low iD.
- **Core assumption:** Noise contributions increase manifold dimensionality rather than forming their own low-dimensional structure.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] and [section 4] describe the weak SNR-iD relationship; [corpus] includes work on noise challenges in radio astronomical image reconstruction.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Intrinsic Dimension and Manifold Hypothesis**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire method rests on understanding that high-dimensional data (72×72 = 5184 dimensions for RGZ images) typically lives on lower-dimensional submanifolds. iD quantifies the "true" degrees of freedom.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why MNIST digits might have different intrinsic dimensions, and why digit "1" would have lower iD than digit "9"?

- **Concept: Score Functions in Diffusion Models**
  - **Why needed here:** The iD estimation relies on interpreting score vectors ∇ₓ ln(pₜ(x)) geometrically, not just using them for generation.
  - **Quick check question:** What does the score vector represent geometrically at very small diffusion times t near a data point?

- **Concept: Bayesian Neural Network Energy Scores**
  - **Why needed here:** Energy scores provide the structure for analyzing how iD varies across the dataset, enabling comparison between in-distribution and OOD sources.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a BNN with HMC posterior samples provide better OOD detection than a deterministic network's softmax outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** DDPM diffusion model -> HMC-based BNN -> SVD-based iD estimator -> Baseline estimators -> Data pipeline
- **Critical path:** 1. Train BNN on MiraBest → obtain energy score intervals for RGZ sources; 2. Train diffusion model on full RGZ dataset; 3. For each RGZ source: sample K noisy versions → compute score vectors → SVD → estimate iD; 4. Correlate iD estimates with energy score intervals, FR labels, and SNR
- **Design tradeoffs:** K (number of score samples): Higher K improves SVD stability but increases compute (paper uses K=328); Diffusion time t₀: Must be small enough for theoretical guarantees but large enough for numerical stability; Energy score discretization: 8 mean intervals, 6 std intervals provide granularity but may obscure continuous relationships
- **Failure signatures:** Consistently low iD across all samples (likely score network training issue or t₀ too large); No gap in singular value spectrum (SVD-based iD estimation fails); PPCA returning "N/A" (insufficient samples per interval); iD estimates vastly exceeding ambient dimension (numerical error in SVD or score computation)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Sanity check on MiraBest: Compute iD for MiraBest training set vs. RGZ outliers, expecting lower iD for MiraBest; 2. Ablation on K: Vary K (50, 100, 200, 328, 500) to assess stability and identify minimum viable K; 3. Cross-dataset comparison: Apply identical pipeline to CIFAR-10 with known iD benchmarks (~35) to validate implementation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Manifold hypothesis may not hold for heterogeneous radio galaxy data with complex morphological classes and noise patterns
- Weak SNR-iD relationship suggests the method captures complex, non-linear structure not explained by simple noise models
- Unexplained absence of relationship between FR I and FR II classes at equivalent iD values requires further investigation

## Confidence
- **Medium** for iD-energy score correlation (lacks independent replication)
- **High** for diffusion-based iD estimation method itself (theoretically grounded, validated on baseline estimators)

## Next Checks
1. Test iD-energy correlation on an independent radio astronomy dataset to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies varying K (perturbation count) and t₀ (diffusion time) to quantify robustness
3. Apply the method to synthetic manifold data with known ground truth iD to validate implementation accuracy
