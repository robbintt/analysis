# Exploring Protein Language Model Architecture-Induced Biases for Antibody Comprehension

- Primary result: AntiBERTa naturally focuses on CDR regions while general models benefit from explicit CDR pooling strategies

## Executive Summary
This study systematically investigates how different protein language model architectures capture antibody-specific biological features through target specificity prediction tasks. Four models (AntiBERTa, BioBERT, ESM2, and GPT-2) were evaluated, revealing that antibody-specific models naturally attend to complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) while general protein models require explicit biological guidance. Transformer-based classifiers consistently outperformed simpler architectures, and CDR3 pooling significantly improved training efficiency for generalist models but provided minimal benefit for AntiBERTa due to its inherent antibody-specific training.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated four protein language models (AntiBERTa, BioBERT, ESM2, GPT-2) on antibody target specificity prediction using a dataset of 4,295 antibodies across 52 families. Models were compared using transformer, MLP, and fully connected classifiers with both full-sequence and CDR3-region pooling strategies. Attention attribution analysis was performed to examine region-specific focus, and UMAP visualizations assessed biological feature learning (V gene, SHM, isotype patterns).

## Key Results
- All PLMs achieved high classification accuracy, with transformer classifiers outperforming fully connected and MLP alternatives
- AntiBERTa naturally focused on CDRs, particularly CDR3, without explicit supervision
- CDR3 pooling significantly improved training efficiency for ESM2 and BioBERT but minimal improvement for AntiBERTa
- GPT-2 (non-biological) showed decent accuracy but failed to capture V gene/SHM/isotype patterns in UMAP analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Domain-specific pre-training induces architectural biases toward biologically relevant sequence regions. AntiBERTa's antibody-specific pre-training causes attention heads to develop stronger weights for complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), particularly CDR3, without explicit supervision. General protein models (ESM2, BioBERT) develop weaker but detectable CDR sensitivity through exposure to diverse protein sequences.

### Mechanism 2
Transformer-based classifiers outperform simpler architectures by capturing long-range dependencies across spatially distributed CDR regions. CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 are separated by framework regions in sequence space but must be jointly considered for binding specificity. Transformer self-attention enables direct modeling of these non-adjacent relationships; FC and MLP layers rely on pooled representations that may dilute regional signals.

### Mechanism 3
Explicit biological knowledge injection via targeted pooling accelerates learning for generalist models but provides diminishing returns for specialist models. CDR3 pooling restricts gradient updates to embeddings from the most functionally relevant region, reducing noise from framework regions. AntiBERTa already attends strongly to CDR3, so explicit pooling provides minimal incremental benefit. ESM2 and BioBERT benefit because their attention is distributed more uniformly.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Antibody structure fundamentals (VDJ recombination, CDRs, SHM)**
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes familiarity with why CDRs matter for binding and how SHM reflects immunological history. Without this, attention attribution interpretations are opaque.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why CDR3 receives higher attention than CDR1/CDR2 and how SHM correlates with isotype?

- **Concept: Transformer attention and [CLS] token pooling**
  - Why needed here: The mechanism analysis relies on interpreting attention attribution from [CLS] tokens across layers.
  - Quick check question: What does the [CLS] token represent in BERT-style models, and how does attention attribution extract position-specific importance?

- **Concept: Embedding pooling strategies (mean, max, token-level)**
  - Why needed here: The CDR3 pooling intervention compares against full-sequence pooling; understanding trade-offs is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why might CDR3-only pooling discard useful signal for some tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Antibody sequences -> PLM backbone (AntiBERTa/BioBERT/ESM2/GPT-2) -> Last hidden states -> Pooling (full/CDR3) -> Classifier (transformer/MLP/FC) -> Binding specificity prediction
- **Critical path:** Embed sequences through PLM backbone → extract last hidden states → apply pooling strategy (full or CDR3-specific) → pass through classifier → predict binding specificity → fine-tune classifier + last 2 PLM layers with paired metadata
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Specialist vs. generalist backbone: AntiBERTa captures antibody features natively but requires antibody-specific pre-training data; ESM2/BioBERT are transferable but benefit from explicit CDR guidance
  - Classifier complexity: Transformers outperform but add computational overhead; MLP offers middle ground
  - Pooling granularity: CDR3 pooling accelerates training for generalists but may overfit to CDR3-dominant specificities
- **Failure signatures:**
  - GPT-2 (non-biological) shows decent accuracy but fails to capture V gene/SHM/isotype patterns in UMAP
  - FC classifier underperforms across all backbones, suggesting pooling alone insufficient
  - AntiBERTa shows no gain from CDR3 pooling—already saturated
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation:** Run all 4 backbones with transformer classifier and full-sequence pooling; confirm AntiBERTa > BioBERT ≈ ESM2 >> GPT-2 on biological feature clustering (UMAP)
  2. **Ablation by classifier:** For ESM2 backbone, compare transformer vs. MLP vs. FC classifiers; quantify accuracy gap
  3. **CDR pooling intervention:** For ESM2 and AntiBERTa, compare training curves (accuracy vs. samples) with full vs. CDR3 pooling; verify ESM2 accelerates while AntiBERTa unchanged

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size (4,295 antibodies across 52 families) constrains generalizability to full antibody space
- Focus on 11-class binding specificity classification rather than continuous affinity prediction or broader functional annotation
- Attention attribution analysis relies on single-head interpretation that may not capture multi-head consensus mechanisms

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- AntiBERTa demonstrates superior biological feature learning (CDR/SHM/V gene patterns) compared to general protein models
- Transformer classifiers consistently outperform MLP and fully connected alternatives
- Domain-specific pre-training creates architectural biases toward CDR regions in AntiBERTa

**Medium Confidence:**
- ESM2 and BioBERT benefit from CDR3 pooling due to distributed attention patterns
- Attention attribution scores reliably reflect learned biological priors rather than spurious correlations
- CDR3 dominance holds across all antibody specificity classes tested

**Low Confidence:**
- GPT-2's non-biological architecture explains its weaker biological feature learning
- Attention peaks at CDR regions generalize to novel antibody-antigen interactions
- CDR3 pooling would accelerate training across all downstream antibody comprehension tasks

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization across antibody families:** Evaluate model performance on held-out antibody families not represented in the training set, particularly focusing on whether AntiBERTa's CDR3 attention bias remains beneficial for antigen classes with atypical CDR3 contributions to binding.

2. **Multi-head attention consensus analysis:** Replicate attention attribution analysis using multi-head averaging and gradient-based saliency methods to confirm that observed CDR peaks represent consensus across attention mechanisms rather than single-head artifacts.

3. **CDR pooling downstream task validation:** Test whether CDR3 pooling acceleration translates to improved performance on antibody engineering tasks (e.g., paratope prediction, immunogenicity scoring) beyond the 11-class target specificity prediction used in the current study.
