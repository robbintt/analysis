# InformGen: An AI Copilot for Accurate and Compliant Clinical Research Consent Document Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.00934
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00934
- Reference count: 40
- Generates compliant informed consent forms using LLMs with inline citations

## Executive Summary
InformGen is an AI copilot system designed to generate accurate and compliant informed consent forms (ICFs) for clinical trials. The system leverages large language models enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation to parse clinical trial protocols and regulatory guidelines, producing ICF sections with inline citations for verification. A benchmark dataset of 900 clinical trials and their corresponding ICFs was constructed to evaluate the system. InformGen achieves near-perfect regulatory compliance with FDA guidelines and outperforms baseline models by up to 30%. Human-in-the-loop refinement further improves factual accuracy to 80-95%.

## Method Summary
The InformGen system employs a retrieval-augmented generation approach using large language models to generate informed consent form sections. The system first parses clinical trial protocols and regulatory guidelines, then generates ICF content with inline citations for traceability. A benchmark dataset of 900 clinical trials and their ICFs was constructed for evaluation. The system's performance is measured against FDA compliance standards, with automated checks and human-in-the-loop refinement processes to ensure accuracy and regulatory adherence.

## Key Results
- Achieves near 100% compliance with FDA guidelines
- Outperforms baseline models by up to 30%
- Human-in-the-loop refinement improves factual accuracy to 80-95%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its retrieval-augmented generation approach, which combines the contextual understanding of large language models with targeted information retrieval from regulatory guidelines and trial protocols. The inline citation mechanism provides traceability, allowing verification of generated content against source documents. The human-in-the-loop refinement process addresses complex cases where automated systems may struggle, ensuring high standards of factual integrity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Clinical trial protocol parsing**: Understanding the structure and content requirements of trial protocols is essential for generating relevant ICF sections. Quick check: Verify system correctly extracts key protocol elements like intervention types, duration, and eligibility criteria.
- **Regulatory compliance frameworks**: Knowledge of FDA guidelines and other regulatory requirements is critical for ensuring ICF compliance. Quick check: Confirm system maintains compliance across different trial phases and study types.
- **Retrieval-augmented generation**: Combining LLMs with targeted information retrieval improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucination. Quick check: Validate citation accuracy by cross-referencing generated content with source documents.
- **Human-in-the-loop validation**: Expert review ensures quality control for complex or ambiguous cases. Quick check: Measure improvement in factual accuracy after human refinement.
- **Benchmark dataset construction**: Representative datasets are crucial for proper system evaluation and model training. Quick check: Assess dataset diversity across trial types and complexity levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Clinical Trial Protocol -> LLM with RAG -> ICF Generation -> Inline Citations -> Compliance Validation -> Human Review

**Critical Path:**
Protocol parsing and RAG retrieval -> ICF generation with citations -> Compliance validation -> Human-in-the-loop refinement

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Balance between automation and human oversight for accuracy vs. efficiency
- Inline citations add verification capability but may increase generation complexity
- Comprehensive compliance checks ensure regulatory adherence but may slow processing

**Failure Signatures:**
- Missing or incorrect inline citations indicating potential hallucination
- Compliance violations suggesting gaps in regulatory guideline integration
- Factual inaccuracies persisting after human review indicating model limitations

**First Experiments:**
1. Test system with simple trial protocols to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate compliance accuracy with protocols from different therapeutic areas
3. Measure citation accuracy by cross-referencing generated content with source documents

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on automated compliance checks rather than real-world clinical validation
- Performance with novel trial protocols outside the 900-trial training set remains unverified
- Generalizability to regulatory frameworks beyond FDA (EMA, ICH guidelines) is not demonstrated

## Confidence
- **High**: Retrieval-augmented generation approach for ICF generation; use of inline citations for verification
- **Medium**: Benchmark dataset construction and automated compliance evaluation methodology
- **Medium**: Human-in-the-loop refinement process and its impact on factual accuracy

## Next Checks
1. Conduct external validation using clinical trial protocols from different regulatory jurisdictions (EMA, ICH) to assess cross-framework compliance
2. Perform blinded human expert review comparing InformGen outputs against traditionally authored ICFs in actual clinical trial settings
3. Test system performance on novel trial designs not represented in the benchmark dataset to evaluate generalization capabilities
