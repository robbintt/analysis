# DeepRule: An Integrated Framework for Automated Business Rule Generation via Deep Predictive Modeling and Hybrid Search Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03607
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03607
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Automated business rule generation framework achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility

## Executive Summary
DeepRule addresses critical gaps in retail assortment and pricing optimization through an integrated framework that transforms unstructured business documents into actionable rules. The framework employs a tri-level architecture combining LLM-based semantic parsing for feature extraction, game-theoretic constrained optimization for multi-agent profit reconciliation, and interpretable symbolic regression for auditable business rule synthesis. Empirical validation demonstrates the framework achieves superior economic outcomes compared to systematic B2C baselines while maintaining operational feasibility.

## Method Summary
DeepRule implements a tri-level architecture: (1) LLM-based hybrid knowledge fusion engine that semantically parses unstructured text (negotiation records, approval documents) into structured features while integrating managerial expertise, (2) game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism that dynamically reconciles supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, and (3) interpretable decision distillation interface using LLM-guided symbolic regression to generate auditable business rules. The framework processes 8.6×10⁶ records, 215 SKUs, and 2362 customers, outputting binary assortment decisions and price recommendations while respecting hierarchical business constraints.

## Key Results
- Achieves higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility
- Demonstrates close-loop pipeline unifying unstructured knowledge injection, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis
- Establishes real economic intelligence through automated business rule generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: LLM-Based Semantic Parsing for Feature Extraction
Unstructured business documents can be transformed into structured feature representations for customer profiling through LLM semantic parsing that generates store affiliation priors, reward functions, and decision basis sets via sequence-to-sequence transformation. Core assumption: LLMs can accurately extract business semantics from domain-specific documents without extensive fine-tuning. Break condition: When document semantics are highly ambiguous or domain-specific jargon is prevalent without prior examples.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Symbolic Regression with LLM-Guided Structure Search
Decoupling function structure generation from parameter optimization reduces search complexity while maintaining interpretability through LLM-generated constrained symbolic structures f(x) = Σα_j h_j(x) + Σβ_p·I(x∈R_p) followed by gradient-based parameter optimization. Core assumption: Optimal rule structures exist within the LLM's prior knowledge space. Break condition: When structure search space is exponentially large with sparse valid solutions.

### Mechanism 3: Memory-Augmented Iterative Refinement
Storing optimization history enables monotonic improvement and prevents regression through a memory bank M_t = {(c_k, Δf_k, δL_k)} that retrieves relevant historical units for prompt inclusion during LLM-based rule generation. Core assumption: Error patterns recur across iterations and can be generalized via semantic similarity. Break condition: When customer segments are highly heterogeneous with non-overlapping error patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Symbolic Regression Fundamentals**: Why needed: The framework uses symbolic regression to discover interpretable pricing functions f: R^n → {0,1} × R+ without presupposing functional forms. Quick check: Can you explain why symbolic regression differs from neural network regression in terms of interpretability and search complexity?

- **Multi-Armed Bandit Regret Analysis**: Why needed: Baseline comparisons (low-rank bandit, online clustering) are evaluated via regret bounds (e.g., Õ(√mT), O(d√T)). Quick check: What does sublinear regret imply about an algorithm's long-term performance?

- **Game-Theoretic Utility Functions**: Why needed: Bilateral utility functions model manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution under hierarchical constraints. Quick check: How would you formulate a Nash equilibrium condition for a two-agent pricing game?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw documents → LLM semantic parsing → customer features f_k + SKU encodings e_SKU → DNN prediction ŷ_units → rule fusion a_final → symbolic rule generation f* → constrained optimization output

- **Critical path**: Raw documents → LLM semantic parsing → customer features f_k + SKU encodings e_SKU → DNN prediction ŷ_units → rule fusion a_final → symbolic rule generation f* → constrained optimization output

- **Design tradeoffs**: LLM choice shows <5% performance gap between fine-tuned and untuned models; 300 iterations yield ~2% improvement over 100 iterations with diminishing returns; rules partitioned into Γ_strict (hard constraints) and Γ_soft (recommendations) with dynamic weighting

- **Failure signatures**: High constraint-violating customer count indicates rule fusion weight α_t miscalibration; MAE plateau suggests memory saturation or insufficient diversity in rule structure search; sales-profit tradeoff inversion indicates penalty coefficient η too low

- **First 3 experiments**: (1) Validate feature extraction by comparing LLM-extracted priors p_prior against manually labeled customer affiliations on held-out documents (target: >80% agreement); (2) Ablate rule search methods by running Evolutionary, RL, GPT+MCTS, and LLM+Optimizer on identical sales forecasting task with N=50 iterations and tracking MAE convergence rate; (3) Deploy full pipeline against low-rank bandit baseline on historical data subset and verify constraint violation reduction while maintaining profit improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Core claims rely on strong assumptions about LLM performance in domain-specific semantic parsing without extensive fine-tuning
- Memory-augmented iterative refinement lacks corpus validation with only internal experimental evidence
- Validation is limited to specific dataset and document types used in experiments

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Overall architecture design and mathematical formulation of constrained optimization (Bₜ, Pₜ thresholds, allocation bounds) are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: DNN prediction module with dual-tower encoding and rule-prior fusion has clear specifications, though exact architecture parameters remain unknown
- **Low confidence**: LLM-guided symbolic regression mechanism and memory-augmented refinement lack sufficient empirical validation across diverse business domains and document types

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain document testing: Validate LLM feature extraction performance on negotiation documents from different retail sectors (e.g., electronics vs. apparel) to assess generalizability beyond the original dataset
2. Memory bank diversity analysis: Quantify the semantic diversity of stored optimization experiences and measure negative transfer rates when retrieving dissimilar historical units
3. Constraint relaxation sensitivity: Systematically vary the strictness of business constraints (e.g., 0.9Aᶜ≤Xᶜ≤1.1Aᶜ vs 0.95Aᶜ≤Xᶜ≤1.05Aᶜ) to identify breaking points where rule feasibility degrades significantly
