# Sovereign AI: Rethinking Autonomy in the Age of Global Interdependence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.15734
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15734
- Reference count: 3
- This paper develops a conceptual and formal framework for understanding sovereign AI as a continuum rather than a binary condition, balancing autonomy with interdependence.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a formal framework for sovereign AI that balances national autonomy with managed global interdependence. The model identifies four sovereignty pillars (data, compute, models, norms) and introduces policy heuristics for budget allocation and openness decisions. Applied to India and the Middle East, the framework demonstrates how countries can optimize AI sovereignty through strategic investments and calibrated openness policies rather than pursuing complete isolation or unrestricted access.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a constrained optimization framework where a planner maximizes national AI welfare by allocating a fixed budget across four sovereignty pillars (data, compute, models, norms) and setting an optimal openness level. The model uses saturating exponential capacity functions for each pillar, with autonomy gains subject to diminishing returns. Optimal policy requires equalizing marginal sovereign returns across pillars and setting openness where global benefits equal exposure risks. The framework is applied analytically to India and the Middle East using qualitative parameter estimates.

## Key Results
- Sovereignty is maximized when marginal returns per budget unit are equalized across data, compute, models, and norms pillars
- Model autonomy depends on complementarity between data and compute investments, requiring paired spending for optimal outcomes
- Optimal openness is an interior solution where marginal global benefit equals marginal exposure cost, not full autarky or unrestricted access
- India shows strong footholds in data, compute, and norms but weaker model autonomy, recommending coupled Data×Compute investment and ModelOps governance
- Middle East's high sovereignty weights and strong Data×Compute complementarities support interior openness settings with guardrails

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sovereignty is maximized when marginal returns per budget unit are equalized across the four pillars (data, compute, models, norms).
- Mechanism: The first-order conditions from the Lagrangian optimization require α·∂S/∂xi = μ for each pillar. Since returns follow saturating exponentials (1 - e^(-ax)), early investments yield large capacity gains; later investments flatten. Budget flows first to low-xi pillars where marginal returns are highest.
- Core assumption: Diminishing returns hold for each sovereignty pillar; absorptive capacity parameters (ai) are relatively stable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "identifying two policy heuristics: equalizing marginal returns across the four sovereignty pillars"
  - [section 5] "Policy makers must allocate their budget in such a way that each pillar (data, compute, models, norms) has equal marginal sovereign returns per unit of budget."
  - [corpus] Not directly validated; neighbor papers focus on feasibility (Brazil/Mexico) and ontological foundations, not optimization heuristics.
- Break condition: If any pillar exhibits increasing returns (e.g., network effects in data), the equalization heuristic fails and corner solutions emerge.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model autonomy depends on the complementarity between data and compute investments, captured by parameter θ.
- Mechanism: Model autonomy M(xM; D, C) = min{1, 1 - e^(-aM·xM) + θ·D(xD)·C(xC)}. If either D or C lags, the θ term collapses, making model sovereignty harder regardless of direct model spending. Joint investment unlocks non-linear gains.
- Core assumption: Complementarity is multiplicative (D×C), not additive; institutions can coordinate paired investments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "sovereignty requires managed interdependence... pairing data with compute investments"
  - [section 5] "Sovereignty is best maximized when governments spend in tandem on data and compute infrastructure, as reflected in the complementarity term θ."
  - [corpus] "The Feasibility of Training Sovereign Language Models in the Global South" notes structural asymmetries in compute access, indirectly supporting complementarity concerns.
- Break condition: If θ is near zero (data and compute are substitutable), paired investment offers no advantage; standalone model spending suffices.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Optimal openness O* is an interior solution where marginal global benefit equals marginal exposure cost.
- Mechanism: From ∂L/∂O = 0, we get O* = max{0, min[1, ((1-α)g)/(λp) - 1]/k}. Neither full autarky (O=0) nor full openness (O=1) is optimal; managed interdependence emerges from balancing spillovers against dependency risks.
- Core assumption: Benefits G(O) have diminishing returns (logarithmic); exposure costs P(O) are linear or convex.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "setting openness where global benefits equal exposure risks"
  - [section 7] "The G42–Microsoft deal... includes an inter-governmental assurance agreement... reduce exposure risk λP(O) while preserving global benefits"
  - [corpus] Weak direct validation; corpus papers don't test openness tradeoffs empirically.
- Break condition: If exposure costs are near-zero (trusted partners) or benefits plateau early, corner solutions (O=0 or O=1) may become optimal.

## Foundational Learning

- **Marginal returns and diminishing returns**
  - Why needed here: The model assumes exponential saturation (1 - e^(-ax)) for capacity gains; decisions hinge on comparing marginal returns, not total returns.
  - Quick check question: If xD doubles from 1 to 2, does D(xD) double? (Answer: No—returns diminish.)

- **Constrained optimization with shadow prices**
  - Why needed here: The budget constraint introduces μ (shadow price of public funds); programs must clear the μ/α bar to justify spending.
  - Quick check question: If μ = 2.5 and α = 0.7, what minimum marginal return must a project deliver? (Answer: ~3.57.)

- **Complementarity in production functions**
  - Why needed here: Model autonomy depends on D×C interaction; understanding multiplicative complementarity is essential for prioritization.
  - Quick check question: If D=0.9 but C=0.1, what happens to the θ·D·C term? (Answer: It collapses to near-zero regardless of θ.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Four sovereignty pillars: Data (D) -> Compute (C) -> Models (M) -> Norms (N)
  - Capacity functions: Exponential saturation with absorptive capacity parameters (ai)
  - Complementarity layer: θ·D·C feeds into Model autonomy
  - Openness module: G(O) benefits vs. P(O) exposure costs
  - Budget constraint: Total B with shadow price μ

- **Critical path:**
  1. Estimate current capacity levels (D, C, M, N) from baseline spending
  2. Calibrate absorptive capacity parameters (ai) using historical utilization data
  3. Set policy weights (wi) and sovereignty weight (α) via structured scoring
  4. Compute marginal returns for each pillar; allocate to equalize
  5. Set openness O* using benefit–exposure ratio

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - High α (sovereignty priority) → lower O*, more spending on pillars
  - High μ (tight fiscal) → fewer pillars funded, higher bar for approval
  - High θ (strong complementarity) → paired D×C investment essential
  - Assumption: ai and θ are estimable; if not, sensitivity analysis required

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Stranded compute: GPU utilization <50% with no dataset-backed bookings
  - Orphaned data: Datasets without downstream use or provenance cards
  - Model drift: No ModelOps gates (change logs, audits) on public-facing models
  - Openness miscalibration: Exposure cost > benefit for incremental partnerships

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Build a quarterly marginal returns dashboard: Track ∂S/∂xi for each pillar using utilization metrics (e.g., GPU hours booked, dataset reuse counts).
  2. Pilot joint D×C OKRs: Require target GPU utilization (>75%) tied to Indic/Arabic dataset bookings for one government AI program.
  3. Implement ModelOps gates for one high-risk public service: Link deployment to pre-deployment cards, change logs, and bias/safety audits; measure compliance rates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**
  - **Question:** How can "sovereignty metrics" be standardized to quantify data usability, provenance, and reusability beyond simple dataset counts?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state: "Future work must develop sovereignty metrics that measure not only dataset counts but usability, provenance, and reusability."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current assessments (e.g., Bhashini) rely on volume metrics, lacking the granular quality indicators necessary to accurately gauge the marginal returns on data investment proposed by the model.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A validated framework of data quality indicators correlated with downstream model autonomy and performance outcomes.

- **Open Question 2**
  - **Question:** What is the contemporary marginal cost of public funds (μ) for India's AI sector, and how does it alter the optimal μ/α investment threshold?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper relies on 1987 estimates (1.54–2.17) because "In the absence of more recent empirical estimates," creating uncertainty in the "bar that marginal returns must clear."
  - **Why unresolved:** The shadow price of public funds is a critical variable for the planner's model, yet current, specific data for Indian technology infrastructure is missing.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Current econometric estimates of the marginal cost of public funds specific to India's digital infrastructure investments.

- **Open Question 3**
  - **Question:** Can a "quarterly marginal returns dashboard" effectively operationalize the theoretical model and demonstrate convergence toward managed interdependence?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion notes that "Building a simple quarterly dashboard... would allow the sovereign AI model to be empirically tested and iteratively refined."
  - **Why unresolved:** The model is currently a theoretical construct; the real-world feasibility of measuring marginal sovereignty returns (∂S/∂xi) dynamically is unproven.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Pilot studies from IndiaAI or Middle Eastern initiatives showing dashboard implementation leading to optimized resource re-allocation.

## Limitations
- Parameter calibration: The model requires absorptive capacity parameters (ai) and complementarity weight (θ) for realistic sovereign assessments, but these are not empirically calibrated in the paper.
- Openness calibration: Optimal openness O* depends on benefit/risk scaling constants (g, k, λ) that are left undefined, preventing verification of specific numerical solutions.
- External validity: The model is not validated against actual sovereignty outcomes in any country; neighboring papers focus on feasibility studies rather than testing the optimization heuristics empirically.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The optimization framework (equalizing marginal returns, setting openness where benefits equal risks) is internally consistent and follows standard constrained optimization logic.
- **Medium confidence:** The four-pillar sovereignty architecture is plausible and well-motivated by the literature, but the specific exponential saturation forms and complementarity assumptions need empirical grounding.
- **Low confidence:** The quantitative applications to India and Middle East lack the calibrated parameters needed to reproduce specific policy recommendations.

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter sensitivity analysis:** Systematically vary absorptive capacities (ai) and complementarity (θ) to identify which parameters most affect sovereignty outcomes and openness settings.
2. **Historical calibration:** Use past government AI spending data to back-estimate ai parameters by fitting the exponential saturation curves to observed capacity utilization rates.
3. **Empirical case study:** Apply the calibrated model to a country with detailed sovereignty metrics (e.g., EU AI Act compliance data, national compute capacity reports) to test whether the optimization heuristics predict actual policy allocations.
