# AMS-IO-Bench and AMS-IO-Agent: Benchmarking and Structured Reasoning for Analog and Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuit Input/Output Design

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.21613
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21613
- Reference count: 6
- This paper presents an LLM-based agent that achieved over 70% DRC/LVS pass rates for AMS I/O ring design, reducing design turnaround time from hours to minutes.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AMS-IO-Agent, a large language model-based agent that automates analog and mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuit input/output (I/O) subsystem design. The agent uses structured reasoning by converting informal user specifications into verifiable intermediate representations before generating executable electronic design automation (EDA) scripts. A new benchmark, AMS-IO-Bench, was created to evaluate I/O ring generation performance. The agent achieved over 70% design rule check (DRC) and layout versus schematic (LVS) pass rates, reducing design turnaround time from hours to minutes. Notably, an agent-generated I/O ring was successfully fabricated in a real 28-nm CMOS tape-out, marking the first reported instance of an LLM-based agent completing a nontrivial AMS IC design task used in silicon.

## Method Summary
The AMS-IO-Agent employs a three-component architecture: (1) Design Intent Structuring converts natural language pin specifications into a structured JSON intent graph; (2) an Intent Graph Adaptor (Python middleware) handles constraint resolution, geometric calculations, and DSL script generation; and (3) a compact domain knowledge base (~6k tokens) provides in-context rules for device selection and naming conventions. The system uses LLM APIs (GPT-4o, Claude-3.7, DeepSeek-V3) without fine-tuning, relying on in-context learning. The agent interfaces with Cadence Virtuoso and Siemens Calibre via SSH to generate schematics and layouts, validated through DRC/LVS checks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 76.67% DRC+LVS pass rate on 30 benchmark cases, reducing design turnaround time from hours to minutes
- Successfully fabricated an agent-generated I/O ring in a real 28-nm CMOS tape-out, the first LLM-based agent to complete a nontrivial AMS IC design task used in silicon
- Showed clear performance scaling: 100% pass rate on simple cases, 66.67% on medium cases, and 30-40% on hard cases with staggered pads and custom cells

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Decomposing natural language specifications into a structured intermediate representation (Intent Graph) improves generation robustness compared to direct code generation.
- **Mechanism**: The agent first maps ambiguous user intent to a JSON-based graph (defining nodes, spatial positions, and electrical connections). This decouples semantic understanding from syntactic code generation, allowing the LLM to operate on structured data where "position encoding follows the I/O ring layout."
- **Core assumption**: LLMs are more reliable at generating structured data formats (JSON) that align with physical layout logic than they are at generating complex, low-level EDA scripting code (SKILL) directly from text.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] Mentions "design intent structuring, which converts ambiguous user intent into verifiable logic steps."
  - [Method > Design Intent Structuring] States the graph "serves as the basis for middleware processing" and preserves "physical organization."
  - [corpus] "AutoSizer" and "AnaFlow" support the general trend of agentic workflows in AMS design, but specific evidence for the "Intent Graph" mechanism is isolated to this paper.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Using deterministic Python-based middleware (Intent Graph Adaptor) to bridge the LLM and EDA tools mitigates the lack of domain-specific language (DSL) training data.
- **Mechanism**: Instead of asking the LLM to write SKILL scripts directly (which suffers from "sparse pre-trained data"), the system uses the LLM to output the Intent Graph. A separate, deterministic Python adaptor then parses this graph to handle "constraint resolution, geometric calculations, and DSL script generation."
- **Core assumption**: The constraints and geometric logic of I/O rings can be deterministically encoded in Python, and the LLM only needs to capture high-level "intent" rather than implementation details.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [Method > Intent Graph Adaptor] Notes that "Directly generating [DSL] scripts... is ineffective" and that the adaptor handles parsing to ensure "reproducible script generation."
  - [Figure 2] Contrasts "Baseline Method: Direct Code Generation" (Poor performance) with "Proposed Method" (Robust performance).
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence contradicts this, but standard agent frameworks often rely on the LLM for code generation; this hybrid approach is a specific architectural choice.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: In-context injection of a curated, lightweight knowledge base enables domain specialization without fine-tuning.
- **Mechanism**: The system utilizes a "compact size" (~6k token) repository of design rules and conventions. This allows the LLM to consume the entire context window with domain knowledge (e.g., naming conventions, voltage domains) at inference time.
- **Core assumption**: The critical domain knowledge for I/O ring design can be compressed into a context window small enough to avoid distraction but large enough to cover necessary constraints.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [Method > Domain-specific Knowledge Base] States the KB is "organized into a lightweight repository" allowing the LLM to "directly consume it without retrieval mechanisms or model fine-tuning."
  - [Figure 3] Shows "Domain-Specific Knowledge Base" feeding directly into the AMS-IO-Agent prompt.
  - [corpus] "AutoSizer" and "EEsizer" similarly employ LLMs for AMS tasks, implying general compatibility of Transformers with circuit domain knowledge, though specific context-window strategies vary.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **AMS I/O Ring Design & Constraints**
  - **Why needed here**: The agent automates the placement of I/O pads, power domains, and corner cells. Understanding the physical constraints (e.g., wirebond packaging, ESD protection) is required to interpret the "Intent Graph" and verify outputs.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why "staggered pads" (Hard cases) complicate the geometric calculations compared to single-row rings (Medium cases)?

- **Concept**: **Design Intent vs. Implementation (DSL)**
  - **Why needed here**: The architecture explicitly separates *what* the design should do (Intent Graph) from *how* it is implemented (SKILL scripts). Understanding this decoupling is vital for debugging.
  - **Quick check question**: If an agent produces a valid Intent Graph but the SKILL script fails to execute in Cadence Virtuoso, which component of the architecture is the likely bottleneck?

- **Concept**: **DRC/LVS Verification**
  - **Why needed here**: The primary success metric is the "DRC+LVS Pass Rate." Users must understand what Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) and Design Rule Check (DRC) errors look like to perform the human-in-the-loop review mentioned in the paper.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does the paper highlight a reduction in "design turnaround time" specifically citing DRC/LVS pass rates as the threshold for success?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: User Prompt -> AMS-IO-Agent (LLM + Knowledge Base) -> Intent Graph (JSON) -> Intent Graph Adaptor (Python) -> EDA Scripts (SKILL/csh) -> Cadence Virtuoso/Siemens Calibre
- **Critical path**: The generation of the **Intent Graph**. If the LLM misinterprets the signal type (e.g., analog vs. digital) or misses a custom cell requirement here, the downstream Python adaptor will deterministically generate incorrect SKILL code.
- **Design tradeoffs**: The system trades off the flexibility of fine-tuned models for the stability of a deterministic adaptor. It sacrifices the ability to handle entirely novel layout styles not covered in the 6k token knowledge base in exchange for high reliability on standard wirebond packages.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Intent Graph Parse Error**: The JSON is malformed; the Python adaptor crashes immediately. (Mitigation: Prompt engineering for strict JSON output).
  - **DRC/LVS Failure (Logic)**: The Intent Graph has correct syntax but wrong semantics (e.g., wrong power domain connections). (Mitigation: Human review of the JSON).
  - **Tool Execution Failure**: The generated SKILL script fails in Cadence due to environment pathing or API version mismatch. (Mitigation: Check adaptor compatibility).
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1.  **Baseline Validation**: Run the "Simple" benchmark (single domain) using a raw GPT-4o instance without the Knowledge Base to confirm the 0% pass rate cited in the paper.
  2.  **Ablation Study**: Remove the "Intent Graph Adaptor" and force the LLM to generate SKILL code directly to empirically verify the performance drop (from ~76% to near 0% DRC+LVS).
  3.  **Complexity Scaling**: Test the full pipeline on a "Hard" case with staggered pads to observe how the system handles implicit geometric inferences and identify the specific failure modes (e.g., overlapping cells).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: What mechanisms can improve performance on complex AMS I/O cases involving staggered pads, custom cells, and specialized power domain configurations, where current models achieve only 30-40% DRC+LVS pass rates?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Table 5 shows all models achieve 10/10 on simple cases but drop to 2-4/10 on hard cases with dual-row I/O rings and customized designs.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not analyze specific failure modes for hard cases or propose targeted improvements for handling greater structural and constraint complexity.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A detailed error taxonomy for hard-case failures combined with ablation studies testing specialized prompt strategies or hierarchical reasoning approaches for multi-row/custom configurations.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can the knowledge base and intent graph framework generalize to other packaging technologies (e.g., flip-chip) and different foundry process nodes beyond the 28-nm CMOS wirebond configuration demonstrated?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The limitations section states the approach "focuses on wirebond-packaged AMS I/O rings and relies on a domain knowledge base tailored to specific design conventions, which may limit generalization to other packaging types or foundry rules."
- **Why unresolved**: The current knowledge base encodes wirebond-specific constraints, and the adaptor generates SKILL scripts tuned to a single technology node's design rules.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Successful cross-validation on flip-chip designs or alternative process nodes (e.g., 14nm, 7nm) using modified knowledge bases, with comparable DRC+LVS pass rates.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What deeper integration mechanisms with downstream verification and routing tools would enable end-to-end AMS design automation beyond I/O ring generation?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The conclusion states: "Future work will extend this approach to more complex AMS design tasks and enable deeper integration with downstream verification and routing tools."
- **Why unresolved**: The current system stops at schematic/layout generation with DRC/LVS verification but does not interface with signal integrity analysis, parasitic extraction, or automated routing flows.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A demonstrated pipeline where agent-generated I/O rings feed directly into routing tools and post-layout simulation with closed-loop feedback for iterative refinement.

## Limitations
- The approach is optimized for wirebond-packaged AMS I/O rings and relies on a domain knowledge base tailored to specific design conventions, limiting generalization to other packaging types or foundry rules
- Performance drops significantly on complex cases with staggered pads and custom cells (30-40% DRC+LVS pass rate) compared to simple cases (100% pass rate)
- The system requires access to proprietary EDA tools (Cadence Virtuoso, Siemens Calibre) and specific PDK/design kits for the target technology node

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core architectural claim that separating intent representation (JSON graph) from implementation (SKILL scripts via Python adaptor) improves robustness compared to direct code generation
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that a 6k token knowledge base provides sufficient domain coverage for wirebond I/O ring design
- **Low Confidence**: The scalability claim to more complex packaging scenarios or technology nodes beyond the 28nm CMOS wirebond configuration

## Next Checks
1. **Knowledge Base Replication**: Attempt to recreate a minimal functional knowledge base for a different technology node (e.g., 65nm) and evaluate whether the agent can achieve comparable DRC+LVS pass rates on simple cases
2. **Direct Generation Ablation**: Implement a baseline system where the LLM generates SKILL scripts directly from natural language specifications (without the Intent Graph intermediary) and measure the performance degradation
3. **Complexity Scaling Validation**: Test the full pipeline on an I/O ring design with explicit multi-domain power requirements and staggered pad configurations not covered in the current benchmark
