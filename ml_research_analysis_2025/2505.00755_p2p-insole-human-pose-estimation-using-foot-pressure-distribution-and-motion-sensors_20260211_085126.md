# P2P-Insole: Human Pose Estimation Using Foot Pressure Distribution and Motion Sensors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.00755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00755
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: 3D human pose estimation with RMSE 48.9-75.2mm using pressure and IMU sensors

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces P2P-Insole, a novel system for estimating 3D human skeletal data using insole-type pressure sensors integrated with IMUs. The system employs 35 pressure sensors per insole fabricated with e-textile garment techniques, achieving a cost of under USD 1 per unit. By leveraging foot pressure distribution and motion sensor data processed through a Transformer model, P2P-Insole estimates human posture with RMSE values ranging from 48.9mm to 75.2mm across various movements. The inclusion of first and second derivatives in the input stream improves performance for complex motions, addressing privacy concerns associated with camera-based methods while maintaining accuracy suitable for rehabilitation, injury prevention, and health monitoring applications.

## Method Summary
P2P-Insole integrates insole-type pressure sensors with IMUs to estimate 3D human skeletal data. The system uses 35 pressure sensors per insole fabricated with e-textile garment techniques, costing under USD 1 per unit. A Transformer model processes foot pressure, acceleration, and rotation data to estimate 3D posture. The input stream includes first and second derivatives of the sensor data, which improves performance for complex motions. The system was tested with 12 participants performing various movements, achieving RMSE values ranging from 48.9mm to 75.2mm.

## Key Results
- 3D human pose estimation with RMSE 48.9-75.2mm across various movements
- 35 pressure sensors per insole fabricated with e-textile techniques
- Cost under USD 1 per insole unit
- Inclusion of first and second derivatives improved performance for complex motions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages foot pressure distribution and motion sensor data to estimate 3D human skeletal data. By integrating insole-type pressure sensors with IMUs, P2P-Insole captures comprehensive information about foot-ground interaction and body movement. The Transformer model processes this multi-modal data stream, while the inclusion of first and second derivatives captures temporal dynamics crucial for accurate pose estimation during complex movements.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Pressure Sensors -> IMU Sensors -> Transformer Model -> 3D Pose Estimation

Critical Path: Sensor Data Collection -> Preprocessing (including derivatives) -> Transformer Processing -> Pose Estimation Output

Design Tradeoffs: Low-cost e-textile fabrication vs. sensor accuracy and durability; sensor count vs. computational complexity; privacy benefits vs. potential data security concerns

Failure Signatures: High RMSE values indicating poor pose estimation; inconsistent sensor readings suggesting hardware issues; model performance degradation indicating insufficient training data

First Experiments:
1. Test individual sensor components (pressure and IMU) for baseline accuracy
2. Evaluate model performance with and without derivative features
3. Compare system accuracy across different movement types and speeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability beyond 12-participant dataset
- Privacy claims not validated for sensor data security
- Cost assertions not tested at mass production scale
- No clinical validation for rehabilitation applications
- Specific hyperparameter choices and their impact not explored

## Confidence
High confidence in methodology and sensor fabrication approach; Medium confidence in derivative feature contribution and privacy claims; Low confidence in clinical application suitability and generalizability beyond tested dataset.

## Next Checks
1. Test system across diverse participant pool including different age groups, body types, and mobility levels
2. Conduct longitudinal study to evaluate sensor durability and performance consistency over extended use
3. Perform direct comparison with camera-based pose estimation systems in real-world environments to quantify accuracy trade-offs
