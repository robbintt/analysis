# Evaluation of Polarimetric Fusion for Semantic Segmentation in Aquatic Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24731
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24731
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Polarimetric fusion improves mean IoU up to 79.0% (StitchFusion, RGBAD) on PoTATO dataset

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates polarimetric imaging for semantic segmentation of floating debris in water-rich environments. Using the PoTATO dataset, the authors benchmark three fusion architectures (CMNeXt, MMSFormer, StitchFusion) that integrate RGB with polarimetric cues (AoLP, DoLP). Results show consistent mIoU improvements over RGB alone, with StitchFusion achieving the highest gains. However, fusion models introduce increased computational load and can produce false positives when background materials exhibit similar polarimetric signatures.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate polarimetric fusion using the PoTATO-Seg dataset (1,000 train / 200 val / 300 test images) containing RGB, diffuse-only (DIF), and polarimetric pseudo-color (POL) modalities. They establish single-image segmentation baselines and benchmark three fusion architectures that integrate RGB with polarimetric cues. Training uses 2x NVIDIA RTX 3090, 50 epochs, batch size 4, 512x512 resolution, with linear warmup for first 10 epochs followed by LR scaling of 0.01.

## Key Results
- Polarimetric fusion consistently improves mean IoU compared to RGB alone across all tested architectures
- StitchFusion achieves highest gains (mIoU up to 79.0% in RGBAD configuration)
- Fusion models reduce boundary error but increase computational load and can produce false positives on similar polarimetric backgrounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Polarimetric cues improve segmentation by providing material- and geometry-based discriminants that RGB alone lacks. Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and Angle of Linear Polarization (AoLP) encode how light is polarized upon reflection. Water surface reflections (glare) are strongly polarized, while diffuse object reflections often are not. A model can learn to suppress glare and boost object contrast by conditioning on these cues.

### Mechanism 2
Architectures with explicit cross-modal fusion modules more effectively leverage polarimetric cues than simpler fusion strategies. Models like StitchFusion contain dedicated modules that learn to weight and combine information from different modalities. This allows the model to selectively rely on polarimetric cues where they are informative (e.g., at glare-obscured boundaries) and ignore them where they are noisy or misleading.

### Mechanism 3
Polarimetric information enables more precise object boundary delineation. Polarization cues can provide high-frequency edge information that complements RGB intensity edges. The model uses this to refine its predictions, producing segmentation masks that adhere more closely to the true object contour.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Stokes Vector (S₀, S₁, S₂)**
  - Why needed here: This is the fundamental physics-based representation from which the DoLP and AoLP input channels are computed. Understanding it is required to interpret what the model sees.
  - Quick check question: How are S₁ and S₂ calculated from the four raw intensity measurements (I₀, I₄₅, I₉₀, I₁₃₅)?

- **Concept: Semantic Segmentation Metrics (mIoU, Average Surface Distance)**
  - Why needed here: These are the quantitative benchmarks used to evaluate model performance. You must understand them to interpret the results tables and assess tradeoffs.
  - Quick check question: If a model has a higher mIoU but a higher Average Surface Distance (ASD) than another, what does that imply about its segmentation quality?

- **Concept: Multi-Modal Fusion Strategies (Early vs. Late, Attention-based)**
  - Why needed here: The paper benchmarks different fusion architectures (CMNeXt, MMSFormer, StitchFusion). Knowledge of general fusion paradigms is a prerequisite to understanding their differences.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model with a learnable, cross-modal attention block (like StitchFusion) outperform a simple channel concatenation strategy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Inputs: RGB (3 channels) -> DIF (1 channel, diffuse-only intensity I_dif) -> POL (3 channels, pseudo-color encoding of AoLP and DoLP) -> Final fusion inputs are combinations like RGBAD (RGB + AoLP + DoLP)
  - Models: Baselines: U-Net, DeepLabV3, SegFormer (via fusion backbone) -> Fusion Models: CMNeXt, MMSFormer, StitchFusion (all encoder-decoder style networks with modules for fusing arbitrary modalities)
  - Data Pipeline: Raw polarimetric sensor data -> Stokes vector calculation -> DoLP/AoLP derivation -> Model Input

- **Critical path:**
  1. Data Preparation: Convert raw PoTATO dataset images into the RGB, DIF, and POL modalities as described in Methodology A
  2. Baseline Validation: Train and evaluate standard models (U-Net, DeepLabV3) on single modalities (e.g., RGB, DIF) to establish a performance floor
  3. Fusion Benchmarking: Train fusion models (CMNeXt, MMSFormer, StitchFusion) with multi-channel inputs (e.g., RGBAD)
  4. Analysis: Compare mIoU and ASD metrics against baseline and analyze failure cases (e.g., false positives on shorelines)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Accuracy vs. Speed: StitchFusion (RGBAD) achieves best mIoU (79.03%) but is slowest (83.9 ms). U-Net on single DIF image is much faster (~5 ms) with only ~3% drop in mIoU
  - Accuracy vs. False Positives: While polarimetric fusion improves overall recall and boundary precision, it can introduce false positives on materials like rocks or branches that mimic polarimetric signature of floating debris
  - Model Complexity vs. Data Size: Complex fusion models may overfit on smaller datasets (PoTATO-Seg has only 1,500 images), requiring careful tuning of training epochs

- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Glare-like" Backgrounds: False positives on tree branches or rocks that exhibit polarimetric signature similar to target objects
  - Weak Polarization Regions: Missed detections on distant objects or in lighting conditions that produce weak polarimetric signals
  - Overfitting: Performance plateaus or degrades on validation set after relatively small number of epochs (~50)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Single-Modality Baseline: Train U-Net and DeepLabV3 on DIF (diffuse-only) images to quantify benefit of glare suppression alone
  2. Ablation on Input Channels: Train StitchFusion with three input configurations: RGB, RGBD, and RGBAD to measure marginal gain from each polarimetric cue (DoLP, AoLP)
  3. Contour Error Analysis: Run inference with best fusion model and baseline, then compute and compare Average Surface Distance (ASD) on set of challenging, high-glare images to quantify boundary improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can lightweight fusion modules be developed to maintain the segmentation accuracy provided by polarimetric cues while meeting the strict latency requirements of real-time autonomous systems? The conclusion explicitly identifies need for "lightweight fusion modules optimized for real-time deployment" to balance accuracy gains against observed increased computational load. Unresolved because models like StitchFusion significantly increase inference time (up to 83.9 ms) compared to single-modality baselines (approx. 5 ms).

### Open Question 2
How can fusion architectures be refined to suppress specific false positives caused by background materials that exhibit polarimetric signatures similar to target floating debris? The discussion notes that "extra channels can introduce false positives when background materials produce similar polarimetric responses," identifying this as opportunity for better fusion strategies. Unresolved because added polarimetric channels sometimes cause modern fusion models to misclassify background elements like shoreline rocks or tree branches as debris.

### Open Question 3
Do tailored pre-training strategies or transfer learning from large-scale polarimetric datasets improve feature extraction and convergence speed compared to training from scratch? The authors state that "lack of ImageNet-style pre-training forces network to learn polarimetric features from scratch" and suggest "tailored training strategies" as direction for future work. Unresolved because current experiments face slow convergence and potential overfitting due to relatively small size of PoTATO-Seg dataset.

## Limitations
- Dataset representativeness: PoTATO dataset is relatively small (1,500 training images) and may not capture full diversity of aquatic environments and debris types
- Polarization calibration assumptions: Study assumes proper polarization calibration but doesn't detail calibration procedure, which could degrade polarimetric cue quality if misaligned
- Model architecture generalization: Results specific to three fusion architectures tested; performance may differ with alternative backbones or fusion strategies

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core finding that polarimetric fusion improves mean IoU over RGB alone (supported by quantitative metrics across multiple architectures)
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that polarimetric cues enable more precise boundary delineation (ASD improvements observed but mechanism isn't fully explained)
- **Low Confidence**: Assertion that complex fusion models inherently overfit on smaller datasets (inferred from training curves rather than rigorous ablation studies)

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Expansion**: Test same fusion architectures on larger, more diverse aquatic dataset to verify if polarimetric gains scale with data volume and variety
2. **Polarization Quality Assessment**: Conduct controlled experiments with calibrated vs. uncalibrated polarimetric sensors to quantify impact of polarization signal quality on segmentation performance
3. **Architecture Ablation**: Perform systematic ablation study comparing different fusion strategies (early vs. late fusion, attention-based vs. concatenation) across three architectures to isolate which components drive performance gains
