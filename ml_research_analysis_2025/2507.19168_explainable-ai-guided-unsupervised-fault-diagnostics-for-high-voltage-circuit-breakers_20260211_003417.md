# Explainable AI guided unsupervised fault diagnostics for high-voltage circuit breakers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.19168
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19168
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: The framework achieves 98.21% fault detection accuracy with CAE and K-means clustering scores exceeding 0.9 (ARI, homogeneity, completeness, v-measure), demonstrating effective unsupervised fault diagnostics using multi-sensor vibration and acoustic signals.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the critical challenge of unsupervised fault diagnostics for high-voltage circuit breakers (CBs) by leveraging vibration and acoustic signals for non-intrusive, online condition monitoring. The proposed framework integrates a convolutional autoencoder for fault detection, unsupervised clustering for fault segmentation, and an explainable AI approach for fault interpretation. Validated on an experimental dataset with healthy and artificially introduced fault conditions, the method demonstrates high accuracy in detecting and classifying faults without requiring CB disconnection. The multi-sensor approach combining three accelerometers and one microphone yields optimal performance, while the XAI-guided interpretation provides valuable insights into potential fault types through classifier-based attribution analysis.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework consists of three key components working in sequence. First, a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) learns the healthy data distribution from vibration and acoustic signals, enabling fault detection by identifying deviations from normal patterns. Second, K-means clustering segments the detected faulty samples into distinct clusters without requiring labeled data. Third, an explainable AI approach using a classifier and Integrated Gradients attribution method interprets these clusters to identify potential fault types. The framework processes multi-sensor data from three accelerometers and one microphone, with an influence study confirming that using all four sensors together achieves the best clustering performance. The experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of this unsupervised approach for real-time CB condition monitoring.

## Key Results
- CAE achieves 98.21% accuracy in fault detection by learning healthy data distribution
- K-means clustering achieves high performance with ARI, homogeneity, completeness, and v-measure scores all exceeding 0.9
- XAI approach successfully identifies potential fault types through classifier and Integrated Gradients attribution
- Multi-sensor configuration (three accelerometers and one microphone) yields optimal clustering performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by learning the healthy data distribution through the convolutional autoencoder, which captures the normal vibration and acoustic patterns of circuit breakers. When faults occur, they manifest as deviations from this learned distribution, enabling detection without labeled fault data. The unsupervised clustering then groups similar fault patterns together based on their acoustic and vibration signatures, while the XAI interpretation provides insight into what distinguishes these fault types through feature attribution analysis.

## Foundational Learning
- **Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)**: A neural network that learns compressed representations of healthy circuit breaker data, needed to establish normal operating patterns for anomaly detection. Quick check: Validate reconstruction error increases significantly for faulty samples versus healthy ones.
- **Integrated Gradients**: An XAI method that attributes importance to input features, needed to explain which sensor signals and which time segments contribute most to fault classification. Quick check: Confirm attributions highlight physically meaningful fault signatures rather than noise.
- **K-means Clustering**: An unsupervised algorithm that groups similar fault patterns, needed to segment different fault types without requiring labeled training data. Quick check: Evaluate clustering metrics (ARI, homogeneity, completeness) to ensure meaningful fault separation.
- **Multi-sensor Fusion**: Combining vibration and acoustic data from multiple sensors, needed to capture comprehensive fault signatures that single sensors might miss. Quick check: Compare clustering performance with different sensor combinations to quantify contribution of each sensor type.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Vibration/Acoustic Sensors -> Convolutional Autoencoder -> Fault Detection -> K-means Clustering -> Fault Segmentation -> Classifier + Integrated Gradients -> Fault Interpretation

**Critical Path**: The most critical path is Sensor Data -> CAE -> K-means Clustering -> XAI Interpretation, as each step depends on the successful completion of the previous one for accurate fault diagnostics.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades labeled fault data (unsupervised approach) for interpretability through XAI, while balancing model complexity against real-time deployment feasibility. The choice of K-means over more complex clustering algorithms prioritizes computational efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include: (1) CAE fails to capture true healthy distribution leading to false positives, (2) Clustering algorithm cannot separate overlapping fault patterns, (3) XAI attribution method produces ambiguous or non-physical explanations, (4) Sensor noise overwhelms fault signatures, and (5) Model overfitting to experimental conditions.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test CAE reconstruction accuracy on held-out healthy data versus faulty data to establish detection baseline
2. Run K-means clustering with varying numbers of clusters (k=2 to k=10) to find optimal segmentation
3. Perform ablation study by removing one sensor at a time to quantify each sensor's contribution to overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental dataset may not fully represent real-world operational conditions and fault scenarios
- Framework generalizability to different circuit breaker types and operating environments remains unverified
- Computational efficiency for real-time deployment has not been evaluated
- Sensitivity to parameter choices (CAE architecture and clustering hyperparameters) requires further investigation

## Confidence

**High**: CAE fault detection accuracy (98.21%), K-means clustering performance metrics (>0.9 for ARI, homogeneity, completeness, v-measure)

**Medium**: Practical applicability due to limited experimental scope and lack of field testing

**Medium-High**: XAI interpretation capability given systematic approach but limited validation of fault type identification

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on field data from operational circuit breakers under varying environmental conditions to validate real-world performance

2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of individual sensor contributions and CAE architecture choices on overall system performance

3. Implement real-time performance evaluation to assess computational requirements and latency for online monitoring applications
