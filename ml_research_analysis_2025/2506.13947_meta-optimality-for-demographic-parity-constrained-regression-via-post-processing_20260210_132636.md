# Meta Optimality for Demographic Parity Constrained Regression via Post-Processing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.13947
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13947
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** A post-processing method for fair regression that achieves minimax optimality under demographic parity constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel post-processing framework for fair regression under demographic parity. The method decomposes the problem into a standard regression task followed by a distribution-alignment step using optimal transport maps. The key theoretical contribution is a meta-theorem showing that the fair regression error can be bounded by the sum of conventional regression error and transport map estimation error, allowing the method to inherit the optimality of the base regressor.

## Method Summary
The approach splits the data into two halves. First, a minimax optimal regressor is trained on one half to predict the target variable. Second, transport maps are estimated on the remaining half by minimizing multiple correlation between transformed predictions, which enforces demographic parity by aligning output distributions to a Wasserstein barycenter. The final predictor composes the regressor with the transport map. The method achieves minimax optimality by separating the learning of regression and fairness components.

## Key Results
- Establishes a meta-theorem showing fair minimax optimal regression can be achieved through post-processing
- Derives convergence rates for the transport map estimator under Lipschitz and Poincaré-type assumptions
- Demonstrates that fair regression error decomposes into regression error plus transport estimation error
- Provides a practical algorithm for enforcing demographic parity via Wasserstein barycenter alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The method relies on the decomposition of fair regression into standard regression followed by transport alignment. Theorem 1 establishes that the fair Bayes-optimal regressor is the composition of the standard Bayes regressor and an optimal transport map. The algorithm trains a standard regressor, then estimates a transport map to shift predictions to a shared barycenter across groups, satisfying demographic parity. This works when the underlying transport maps are Lipschitz and strictly increasing, and the standard regressor is sufficiently accurate.

### Mechanism 2
The fair error rate is bounded by the sum of conventional regression error and transport map estimation error. By treating the problem as a meta-theorem, the algorithm minimizes standard regression error using half the data, then estimates the transport map with the remaining data. The error decomposition allows the system to inherit the optimality of the standard regressor. This mechanism succeeds when the sample size for transport estimation is adequate relative to the complexity of the distributions.

### Mechanism 3
Demographic parity is enforced by estimating congruent potentials rather than directly modeling transport maps. The algorithm solves for potential functions that minimize multiple correlation, with the gradient of these potentials yielding the required transport maps. This formulation enables the application of sieved M-estimation techniques for convergence rates. The mechanism works when the measures admit densities and satisfy Poincaré-type inequalities, though enforcing exact congruency is computationally challenging.

## Foundational Learning

- **Demographic Parity (Statistical Parity):** Requires output distribution of regressor to be independent of sensitive group attribute. Needed as the fairness constraint defining "fairness" in the paper. Quick check: Does the algorithm aim to equalize prediction accuracy or distribution of prediction values across groups? (Answer: Distribution of values).

- **Wasserstein Barycenter:** Moves output distributions of all groups to a common "center" distribution that minimizes transport cost to all group distributions. Needed to align distributions while minimizing global distortion. Quick check: Why move predictions to a barycenter rather than matching one group to another? (Answer: To minimize global distortion/error across all groups).

- **Minimax Optimality:** Claims algorithm is optimal in worst-case scenario over class of data distributions. Defines theoretical limit of performance for any fair algorithm. Quick check: Does "minimax optimality" refer to average runtime or worst-case error bounds? (Answer: Worst-case expected squared error).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Splitter -> Minimax Regressor -> Potential Estimator -> Transport Composer
- **Critical path:** The Potential Estimator is the novel component. If the congruency constraint is not solved accurately here, the entire system violates the fairness constraint.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Sample Efficiency vs. Modularity (data splitting reduces effective sample size), Computational Tractability (exact congruency enforcement is hard, using penalty methods lacks convergence rate analysis).
- **Failure signatures:** Infinite Loop/Divergence in Potential Estimator, Unfair Outputs from early stopping, High Bias from poor standard regressor.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check on synthetic linear Gaussian data to verify $O(n^{-1/2})$ convergence rate
  2. Ablation study varying sample split ratio between regressor and transport estimator
  3. Stress test with violated assumptions (multi-modal distributions) to observe convergence degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can convergence rates be established for the proposed framework when using penalty methods for approximate congruency rather than exact congruency?
- What are the theoretical convergence rates for alternative optimal transport map estimators like minimax optimization or fixed-point iteration?
- Can this meta-optimality framework be generalized to other fairness definitions like equalized odds while maintaining the separation between conventional regression and fair adaptation?

## Limitations
- The specific minimax optimal regressor depends on unknown function class properties, making practical implementation challenging
- Enforcing exact congruency constraint for potentials is computationally difficult, and approximate methods lack convergence rate analysis
- The method requires splitting data between regression and transport estimation, potentially hurting performance on small datasets

## Confidence

- **High:** Theoretical framework (Theorem 1, Theorem 2, Proposition 1) and decomposition of fair regression are mathematically sound
- **Medium:** Transport map estimator convergence rate is derived but practical achievability depends on unspecified implementation details
- **Low:** Overall claim of achieving minimax optimality in practice is conditional on satisfying multiple assumptions and successful implementation of abstract components

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the potential minimization solver on synthetic data to verify it can find correct transport map and enforce congruency constraint
2. Vary sample split ratio between regressor and transport estimator to empirically determine optimal allocation on real-world dataset
3. Test algorithm on data violating key assumptions to see if convergence bounds degrade as predicted and assess robustness
