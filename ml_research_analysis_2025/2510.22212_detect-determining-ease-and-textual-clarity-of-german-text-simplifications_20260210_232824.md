core_contribution: DETECT is the first German-specific automatic text simplification
  (ATS) evaluation metric, trained entirely on synthetic LLM-generated quality scores
  without human-annotated data. It extends the LENS framework with LLM-based quality
  scoring and rubric refinement, evaluating ATS outputs on simplicity, meaning preservation,

# DETECT: Determining Ease and Textual Clarity of German Text Simplifications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.22212
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22212
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First German-specific ATS metric trained entirely on LLM-generated quality scores, achieving up to 0.68 Pearson correlation with human ratings

## Executive Summary
DETECT addresses the critical need for automatic evaluation of German text simplification by introducing a novel metric trained entirely on synthetic LLM-generated quality scores. The system extends the LENS framework with German-specific LLM-based quality scoring and rubric refinement, evaluating outputs across simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency dimensions. Tested on the largest available German human-rated ATS dataset, DETECT demonstrates substantial performance improvements over traditional metrics like BLEU, SARI, and BERTScore.

## Method Summary
DETECT is built on the LENS framework and generates synthetic training data through iterative LLM-based quality scoring and rubric refinement. The system uses German-specific LLMs to evaluate ATS outputs across three dimensions: simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency. By avoiding human-annotated training data, DETECT leverages the efficiency of synthetic supervision while maintaining evaluation quality through careful rubric development and validation against human ratings.

## Key Results
- Achieved Pearson correlation of 0.68 for meaning preservation on German human-rated dataset
- Overall correlation of 0.64 across all evaluation dimensions
- Significantly outperformed traditional ATS metrics (BLEU, SARI, BERTScore) in all measured categories
- First German-specific automatic text simplification evaluation metric to use LLM-generated synthetic quality scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DETECT leverages LLM-based quality scoring to generate synthetic training data that captures nuanced aspects of German text simplification. The iterative rubric refinement process allows the system to develop evaluation criteria that align with human judgment while avoiding the cost and time requirements of human annotation. By focusing on the three core dimensions of text simplification quality, DETECT provides a comprehensive assessment that traditional metrics cannot achieve.

## Foundational Learning
- **German text simplification**: Understanding the unique challenges of simplifying German text due to its morphological complexity and compound structures
- **LLM-based quality scoring**: How large language models can be prompted to evaluate text quality across multiple dimensions
- **Synthetic data generation**: The process of using LLM outputs to create training data without human annotation
- **LENS framework**: The underlying architecture that DETECT extends for German-specific applications
- **Evaluation metric correlation**: Understanding Pearson correlation as a measure of alignment with human judgment
- **Text simplification dimensions**: The three core aspects (simplicity, meaning preservation, fluency) that DETERCT evaluates

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Input Text -> German LLM Quality Scorer -> Dimension Scores -> Weighted Aggregation -> Final Score

**Critical path**: The LLM-based quality scoring component is the core of DETECT's evaluation capability, with the weighted aggregation layer determining how individual dimension scores combine into the final quality assessment.

**Design tradeoffs**: Using synthetic LLM-generated data provides scalability and cost efficiency but introduces uncertainty about alignment with human preferences. The three-dimension evaluation approach offers comprehensive assessment but may miss other relevant quality aspects.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance on domain-specific simplifications, sensitivity to German dialect variations, and potential misalignment between LLM judgments and actual human preferences.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test DETECT on German simplification tasks across different domains (news, literature, technical documents)
2. Compare DETECT's dimension-specific scores against human annotations for each evaluation aspect
3. Evaluate DETECT's sensitivity to German morphological variations and compound word structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic LLM-generated quality scores without human-annotated training data
- Evaluation constrained to a single German dataset, limiting generalizability
- Potential misalignment between LLM judgments and human preferences for German simplification quality

## Confidence
- High confidence: Superior performance over traditional ATS metrics demonstrated through direct correlation measurements
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of LLM-generated synthetic quality scores for German ATS evaluation
- Medium confidence: Extensibility of LENS framework to German language applications

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation using multiple German text simplification datasets with different source texts and target audiences
2. Perform ablation studies comparing DETECT's performance with varying proportions of human-annotated versus synthetic data
3. Test DETECT's sensitivity to different German dialects and register variations across the full spectrum of German language use cases
