- Primary result: LSTM model achieves 78.1% validation accuracy on MSWC dataset for 23 Kinyarwanda speech commands

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the lack of speech command models for African languages by developing a system for Kinyarwanda. The researchers built a corpus of 23 speech commands including numbers, directives, and a wake word, collecting data from multiple sources: the Multilingual Spoken Word Corpus, Google Speech Commands, and local native speakers using a custom data collection app. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was developed and trained on three datasets, achieving the highest validation accuracy of 78.1% on the MSWC dataset and 71.8% on the combined dataset. The model was successfully deployed on PC, mobile, and edge devices using Edge Impulse.

## Method Summary
The researchers collected Kinyarwanda speech command data from three sources: the Multilingual Spoken Word Corpus (MSWC), Google Speech Commands, and local native speakers via a custom Power Apps/SharePoint data collection application. They converted audio to Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and applied data augmentation (shift, zero-padding, speed modification, amplification) to 80% of training data. A PyTorch LSTM model replaced an initial CNN baseline, achieving better performance on larger datasets. The model was deployed using Edge Impulse with TensorFlow Lite quantization for edge devices including the Wio Terminal.

## Key Results
- LSTM model achieved 78.1% validation accuracy on MSWC dataset
- Combined dataset (MSWC + local + Google Speech Commands) achieved 71.8% validation accuracy
- Local-only dataset achieved 36.8% validation accuracy, significantly lower than other datasets
- CNN baseline outperformed LSTM on small datasets but underperformed on larger datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: MFCC Feature Extraction for Voice-Specific Classification
Converting raw audio to Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) improves speech command classification by compressing audio into coefficients that emphasize frequency bands relevant to human speech perception, reducing dimensionality while preserving discriminative features for word-level classification.

### Mechanism 2: Data Augmentation Reduces Overfitting in Low-Resource Settings
Augmenting 80% of the training data with shift, zero-padding, speed modification, and amplification improves generalization by expanding the effective training set and forcing the model to learn invariant representations rather than memorizing recording-specific artifacts.

### Mechanism 3: LSTM Architecture Captures Temporal Dependencies Better Than CNN for Longer Sequences
LSTM models outperform 2-layer CNN baselines for speech command recognition when dataset size increases by modeling sequential dependencies in variable-length audio through recurrent connections, whereas the CNN baseline relies on local spatial patterns in fixed spectrograms.

## Foundational Learning

- **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)**: Why needed here: The paper's LSTM model uses MFCCs as input features rather than raw audio or spectrograms. Understanding how MFCCs compress audio into perceptually-relevant coefficients is essential for debugging feature extraction pipelines. Quick check question: Given a 1-second audio clip sampled at 16kHz, approximately how many MFCC frames would be generated with standard 25ms windows and 10ms hop size?

- **Keyword Spotting vs. Automatic Speech Recognition**: Why needed here: The paper distinguishes speech commands (single words/phrases) from sentence-level ASR. This architectural choice determines model size, latency requirements, and deployment targets (edge vs. cloud). Quick check question: Why would a keyword spotting model be preferred over full ASR for a wake-word detection system on a battery-powered device?

- **Validation Accuracy Gaps Across Data Sources**: Why needed here: The paper reports 78.1% on MSWC but only 36.8% on locally collected data, then 71.8% on combined. Understanding distribution shift and dataset heterogeneity is critical for interpreting these results. Quick check question: What two factors does the paper propose as contributors to the performance disparity between MSWC and locally collected datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Ingestion -> Preprocessing -> Augmentation Pipeline -> Model Core -> Deployment Layer
- **Critical path**: Data quality at collection time → MFCC extraction parameters → LSTM hidden state dimensionality → Quantization settings in Edge Impulse
- **Design tradeoffs**: CNN vs. LSTM (faster inference vs. better accuracy), dataset combination strategy (MSWC alone vs. combined), pre-training approach (abandoned due to poor transfer)
- **Failure signatures**: Low validation accuracy on local data (36.8%) likely from distribution mismatch; pre-trained model fine-tuning failure (36.7%); false alarms in deployment requiring adversarial samples
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce baseline CNN vs. LSTM comparison on MSWC subset, 2) Isolate distribution shift by training on MSWC then evaluating on local data, 3) Implement adversarial sample injection to reduce false alarm rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: What specific data cleaning frameworks can systematically identify audio samples that most adversely affect model validation accuracy? Basis: Authors plan to develop such frameworks but haven't implemented them yet.

- **Open Question 2**: How does the distributional mismatch between MSWC and locally collected datasets drive the large accuracy gap (78.1% vs. 36.8%)? Basis: Authors identify distributional differences as a hypothesis but don't quantify or correct them.

- **Open Question 3**: Can adding adversarial (hard negative) samples to training materially reduce false-alarm rates in real-time keyword spotting for Kinyarwanda? Basis: Adversarial-negative inclusion is planned but not yet implemented or evaluated.

- **Open Question 4**: How can on-device personalization and calibration improve both robustness and user-specific performance while maintaining low compute? Basis: Personalization and calibration are proposed as future work without implementation details or evaluation.

## Limitations
- Critical LSTM hyperparameters (hidden size, layers, dropout) remain unspecified, preventing precise replication
- Training configuration details (learning rate, batch size, optimizer) are not documented
- Data quality issues in local collection (wrong words, incomplete samples, empty samples, sound overlaps) were acknowledged but not quantified
- The 36.8% accuracy on local data may reflect dataset quality issues rather than model limitations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: General approach of using LSTM with MFCCs for speech command classification; observation that local data performance lags behind MSWC due to speaker diversity and recording conditions
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that pre-trained models performed worse when fine-tuned, though this comparison lacks statistical significance testing
- **Low confidence**: Specific accuracy numbers across different dataset configurations due to underspecified implementation details

## Next Checks
1. **Architectural parameter sweep**: Systematically vary LSTM hidden size (64-512), number of layers (1-3), and dropout rates (0.1-0.5) while keeping all other parameters constant to identify optimal configuration for the 23-command task.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Train on MSWC, evaluate on local data without fine-tuning to establish the baseline domain gap, then train on local data alone to determine if the 36.8% reflects data quality or quantity issues.

3. **Adversarial sample integration**: Implement the paper's future work recommendation by adding negative samples (similar-sounding non-command words) to training data and measuring false alarm rate reduction on a held-out test set with known adversarial examples.
