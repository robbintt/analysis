# Multimodal Bayesian Network for Robust Assessment of Casualties in Mass Casualty Incidents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.18908
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18908
- **Reference count:** 20
- **Primary result:** Expert-elicited Bayesian Network improved triage accuracy from 14% to 53% across all patients in DARPA Triage Challenge field scenarios

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of reliable casualty triage in Mass Casualty Incidents by integrating multimodal perception outputs into a Bayesian Network framework. Unlike traditional data-driven approaches, the BN is constructed from expert-defined clinical rules and does not require training data, supporting robust inference even with incomplete or noisy observations. The system fuses outputs from multiple computer vision models estimating signs of hemorrhage, respiratory distress, trauma, and alertness into a unified probabilistic assessment.

During DARPA Triage Challenge field scenarios, the Bayesian Network model improved physiological assessment accuracy from 15% to 42% (Scenario 1) and 19% to 46% (Scenario 2), while overall triage accuracy increased from 14% to 53% across all patients. Diagnostic coverage expanded from 31% to 95% of cases requiring assessment, demonstrating that expert-guided probabilistic reasoning significantly enhances automated triage systems and can directly support emergency responders in high-stakes environments.

## Method Summary
The system fuses categorical outputs from multiple computer vision models (estimating hemorrhage, respiratory distress, trauma, and alertness) into a Bayesian Network that reasons about physiological states using expert-defined clinical rules. The BN is constructed without training data, using expert elicitation to define the structure and conditional probability tables. The network runs in real-time on embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi 3) with inference taking less than 1ms. The system achieved significant improvements in physiological assessment accuracy and diagnostic coverage during DARPA Triage Challenge field scenarios, demonstrating robust performance even with incomplete or noisy perception inputs.

## Key Results
- Physiological assessment accuracy improved from 15% to 42% in Scenario 1 and 19% to 46% in Scenario 2
- Overall triage accuracy increased from 14% to 53% across all patients
- Diagnostic coverage expanded from 31% to 95% of cases requiring assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Bayesian Network framework works because it provides a principled way to combine uncertain, multimodal evidence from perception systems while respecting clinical causal relationships. Unlike purely data-driven approaches, the expert-elicited structure ensures that the reasoning follows established medical knowledge, and the probabilistic nature allows graceful handling of missing or conflicting inputs. The modular integration with perception models enables continuous updates as new evidence becomes available.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Network inference**: Why needed - to combine uncertain evidence from multiple sources; Quick check - verify marginal probabilities sum to 1
- **Expert elicitation for CPTs**: Why needed - to parameterize the network without training data; Quick check - ensure elicited probabilities reflect clinical expertise
- **Multimodal sensor fusion**: Why needed - to capture different aspects of casualty status; Quick check - validate each perception model's accuracy independently
- **Real-time embedded inference**: Why needed - for field deployment in emergency scenarios; Quick check - measure inference time on target hardware

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Perception models (Hemorrhage, Respiratory Distress, Trauma, Alertness) -> Bayesian Network -> Physiological assessment outputs

**Critical path:**
Sensor data → Perception models → BN evidence nodes → Inference → Diagnostic outputs → Triage decisions

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Expert-elicited vs. data-driven CPTs: No training data required but relies on expert availability and consistency
- Real-time vs. accuracy: Optimized for <1ms inference on embedded hardware at potential cost of some precision
- Categorical vs. continuous inputs: Simpler integration but loses some information granularity

**Failure signatures:**
- Silent failures when perception outputs are missing or corrupted
- Implausible inferences from poorly calibrated CPTs
- Performance degradation when multiple perception inputs are unavailable simultaneously

**3 first experiments:**
1. Validate BN structure by testing synthetic cases with known ground truth
2. Measure inference latency on target hardware (Raspberry Pi 3)
3. Test system behavior with missing perception inputs to verify graceful degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends entirely on undisclosed perception model outputs and expert-elicited CPT values
- Only one explicit CPT probability is provided, requiring assumptions for full parameter reproduction
- Impact of missing or noisy perception data on system performance is not quantified
- Specific roles and reliabilities of the sensor suite are not detailed

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The BN framework is appropriate for integrating multimodal triage cues, and the expert elicitation methodology is valid. The reported accuracy gains and diagnostic coverage improvements are plausible given the framework.

**Medium confidence:** The specific accuracy figures are trustworthy within the DARPA Triage Challenge context, but may not generalize without the exact perception model outputs and complete CPTs.

**Low confidence:** The impact of missing or noisy perception data on system performance cannot be assessed without further testing.

## Next Checks

1. **CPT Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary CPT values within the described heuristic ranges and measure the impact on physiological assessment accuracy and diagnostic coverage.

2. **Missing Data Robustness Test:** Simulate missing perception inputs and quantify the degradation in triage accuracy and diagnostic coverage to validate graceful degradation claims.

3. **Cross-Validation with Alternative Perception Models:** Integrate the BN with a different set of computer vision models for hemorrhage and trauma detection, and compare the resulting triage performance to the reported figures.
