# VLH: Vision-Language-Haptics Foundation Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.01361
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01361
- Reference count: 24
- One-line primary result: Unified vision-language-haptic model achieving 56.7% success in aerial target acquisition with real-time 4-5 Hz force feedback.

## Executive Summary
VLH presents a novel Visual-Language-Haptic Foundation Model that unifies perception, language, and tactile feedback in aerial robotics and virtual reality. Unlike prior work treating haptics as secondary, VLH synthesizes mid-air force and vibration cues based on contextual visual understanding and natural language commands. The system uses an 8-inch quadcopter with dual inverse five-bar linkage arrays for localized haptic actuation, processed via a fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone adapted with LoRA on 450 multimodal scenarios. It outputs a 7-dimensional action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx, Hy, Hz, Hv) with real-time operation at 4-5 Hz. In 90 flight experiments, VLH achieved 56.7% success rate for target acquisition (mean reach time 21.3 s, pose error 0.24 m) and 100% accuracy in texture discrimination. Generalization tests showed 70.0% (visual), 54.4% (motion), 40.0% (physical), and 35.0% (semantic) performance on novel tasks. These results demonstrate VLH's ability to co-evolve haptic feedback with perceptual reasoning and intent, advancing expressive, immersive human-robot interactions.

## Method Summary
VLH adapts the pre-trained OpenVLA-7b model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to map dual-camera images and language instructions to a 7D action vector for drone flight and haptic feedback. The system uses an 8-inch quadcopter equipped with dual inverse five-bar linkage arrays to deliver localized force feedback. Training uses 450 multimodal scenarios with paired dual-view images, drone state, and haptic labels. The model is quantized to INT8 and deployed via a Flask API on an RTX 4090 GPU, achieving real-time operation at 4-5 Hz. Flight control uses velocity commands while a lower-level controller maintains stability, with Vicon motion capture providing precise localization.

## Key Results
- 56.7% success rate in target acquisition with 21.3 s mean reach time and 0.24 m pose error
- 100% accuracy in texture discrimination across 3 shape types and 3 texture categories
- 70.0% visual, 54.4% motion, 40.0% physical, and 35.0% semantic generalization on novel tasks
- Real-time operation at 4-5 Hz with INT8 quantization on RTX 4090

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multimodal Action Tokenization via LoRA Adaptation
Fine-tuning a pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) backbone with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) appears to enable the translation of spatial context and intent into continuous physical actions (flight and touch) without full model retraining. The system freezes the weights of the OpenVLA-7b model and injects trainable rank-decomposition matrices (LoRA). This adapts the cross-modal attention maps to associate specific visual textures (e.g., "cube," "sphere") and language commands with a novel 7-dimensional action vector (Vx-Vz, Hx-Hz, Hv), effectively mapping visual semantics to haptic dynamics. The core assumption is that the pre-trained visual-semantic features of OpenVLA are sufficiently robust to be repurposed for haptic force estimation via minimal fine-tuning, assuming visual texture correlates directly with physical interaction properties. Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "...fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone - adapted via LoRA on a bespoke dataset of 450 multimodal scenarios - to output a 7-dimensional action vector..." [section]: "...fine-tuned it using a custom dataset containing drone flight sequences paired with detailed haptic feedback... using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) scheme (rank 32)." [corpus]: Corpus evidence specifically validating LoRA for haptic generation is missing; related work focuses on VLA for navigation or standard manipulation. Break condition: If visual texture cues are ambiguous (e.g., a photo of a rough surface on a smooth object), the mechanism may decouple, generating incorrect haptic forces ("hallucinated" texture) despite correct flight navigation.

### Mechanism 2: Aerial Haptic Rendering via Inverse Linkage Kinematics
Localized force feedback is achieved by resolving model-predicted haptic vectors into mechanical joint angles on an aerial platform. The 7D action vector includes haptic components (Hx, Hy, Hz, Hv). The system interprets these as end-effector forces for the dual inverse five-bar linkage arrays. Servomotors drive the linkage geometry to apply specific normal and shear forces to the user's hand, creating the sensation of touching the virtual object "held" by the drone. The core assumption is that the drone's stability and the linkage mechanism's rigidity are sufficient to mask the inertial forces of the drone itself, ensuring the user perceives only the intended haptic feedback rather than the drone's wobbling. Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "...8-inch quadcopter equipped with dual inverse five-bar linkage arrays for localized haptic actuation..." [section]: "Six invert five-bar linkage mechanisms... actuating lightweight DMS44 and high-torque HS-70MG servomotors... enabling effective tactile force feedback..." [corpus]: Corpus papers (e.g., "Wearable Haptics...") discuss linkage mechanisms for feedback but not specifically for *aerial* applications; the specific dynamics of aerial linkage stability are not externally validated in the corpus. Break condition: If the drone requires aggressive maneuvering (high Vx/Vy accelerations), the resulting platform tilt may saturate or distort the haptic linkage outputs, causing "noise" in the tactile feedback.

### Mechanism 3: Quantized Latency Reduction for Closed-Loop Interaction
INT8 quantization is likely the critical factor enabling a 7B parameter model to run at interaction-compatible frequencies (4-5 Hz). By compressing the model weights from FP32/BF16 to INT8, the memory bandwidth requirements and compute latency are significantly reduced. This allows the system to process the dual-camera input and generate a command within ~200-250ms, maintaining the illusion of real-time contact. The core assumption is that the reduction in numerical precision does not degrade the model's ability to distinguish subtle force gradients or safety-critical flight boundaries. Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "INT8 quantization and a high-performance server ensure real-time operation at 4-5 Hz." [section]: "...VLA model is quantized to INT8, substantially reducing inference latency... sustains a 4–5 Hz update rate..." [corpus]: No specific corpus evidence provided regarding quantization effects on VLA haptic fidelity. Break condition: If the visual scene complexity spikes (e.g., cluttered background), inference time may exceed the 200ms budget, causing "stutter" where the drone continues a previous action longer than intended, potentially overshooting targets.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**
  - Why needed here: VLH is not built from scratch; it adapts OpenVLA. You must understand how Transformers map image patches and text tokens to continuous action tokens to debug the "reasoning" behind a haptic output.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a cross-attention mechanism allows a text instruction ("touch the rough sphere") to modify the visual processing of a sphere in the camera feed?

- **Concept:** **Inverse Kinematics for Haptics**
  - Why needed here: The "five-bar linkage" is the muscle of the system. Understanding how to translate a desired force vector (Hx, Hy) into motor angles is essential if the feedback feels "off" or mechanical.
  - Quick check question: Given a desired end-effector position for the haptic tip, how many solutions (configurations) exist for the five-bar linkage, and how do you choose the one that avoids the user's wrist?

- **Concept:** **Latency vs. Stability in Aerial Control**
  - Why needed here: A 4-5 Hz control loop is slow for a quadcopter (typically requires >100Hz for stability). You need to understand why VLH outputs *velocities* for high-level control while a lower-level controller handles stability.
  - Quick check question: Why does a 4 Hz high-level command rate not cause the drone to crash, given that the flight controller runs at a much higher frequency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Dual Camera (VR + Top-Down) -> OrangePi 5B (Data relay) -> RTX 4090 Server (VLH Model: OpenVLA-7b + LoRA, INT8) -> ArduPilot (Flight) + PCA9685/Servos (Haptics)

- **Critical path:** Image capture -> API Call -> Server Inference -> Action Return -> Actuator PWM update must stay < 250ms to maintain 4Hz sync.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Generalization vs. Accuracy: The model generalizes well visually (70%) but poorly semantically (35%) due to the small dataset (450 scenarios). Safety vs. Immersion: The system uses a velocity controller (Vx, Vy, Vz) rather than direct motor control to prioritize safety, limiting aggressive "snap" haptic movements.

- **Failure signatures:** Semantic Drift: If commands drift into "novel" semantic territory (e.g., "follow the man"), success rates drop to ~35%. Pose Error Accumulation: With a mean pose error of 0.24m, the drone may "touch" the air near the object rather than the object itself if the Vicon system drifts or occludes.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Static Haptic Calibration:** Place the drone in a fixed rig. Send specific haptic vectors (Hx, Hy, Hz) via the API and measure the actual force output at the end-effector using a force meter to validate the linkage kinematics.
  2. **Visual Generalization Stress Test:** Fly the drone in a "blank" room vs. a "cluttered" room with the same target. Measure the deviation in flight path to confirm the 70% visual generalization claim.
  3. **Latency Injection Test:** Intentionally delay the API response by 100ms increments to find the latency threshold where the user experiences motion sickness or the drone becomes unstable, confirming the 4-5 Hz requirement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the integration of larger language models and expanded training datasets elevate the semantic generalization success rate significantly above the current 35% baseline for novel instructions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "Future work will focus on integrating larger language models and expanding the dataset will strengthen semantic understanding."
- Why unresolved: The current 7B parameter model fine-tuned on 450 scenarios struggles with semantic novelty, but the specific impact of model scaling on this aerial-haptic domain is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative benchmarks showing semantic generalization performance improvements when substituting the backbone with a larger LLM or training on $N>450$ scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent can generative models for realistic haptic rendering address the current limitations in physical generalization (40.0% success) regarding unseen object sizes and textures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly propose "leveraging generative models for realistic haptic rendering" to "address physical generalization challenges" in future work.
- Why unresolved: The current system relies on direct correlation with training data; it is unclear if generative approaches can synthesize physically accurate haptic responses for properties not present in the training distribution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Trials using generated haptic profiles for novel physical parameters (e.g., new textures) showing improved success rates compared to the current discriminative model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the system's performance degrade when migrating from external motion capture (Vicon) and off-board high-performance computing to fully onboard visual-inertial odometry and edge computing?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.1 notes the reliance on a 14-camera Vicon system for "Precise localization" and a separate server (NVIDIA RTX 4090) for inference, implying a dependency that limits outdoor or untethered deployment.
- Why unresolved: The paper reports 0.24 m pose error and 4-5 Hz latency under controlled infrastructure; the feasibility of maintaining these metrics without external localization is unstated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Flight data and latency measurements collected using only onboard sensors (cameras/IMU) and an onboard computer (e.g., Jetson Orin) in a GPS-denied environment.

## Limitations
- Limited dataset (450 scenarios) causes significant drop in semantic generalization (35% vs 70% visual)
- Reliance on external Vicon motion capture prevents untethered deployment
- No external validation of aerial haptic rendering dynamics from corpus literature

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Hardware implementation (quadcopter + linkage arrays), quantitative performance metrics (success rates, reach times, pose errors), and the basic control architecture (dual cameras → model → flight/haptic outputs).
- **Medium confidence:** The LoRA adaptation mechanism for haptic generation, given that LoRA is well-established for parameter-efficient fine-tuning but lacks specific validation for cross-modal haptic reasoning in the corpus.
- **Low confidence:** Generalization claims across semantic tasks and the robustness of aerial haptic rendering under dynamic conditions, as both depend heavily on the limited training dataset and lack external validation.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset generalization test:** Evaluate VLH performance on a held-out dataset with different visual backgrounds, lighting conditions, and object arrangements to quantify real-world robustness beyond the controlled 450-scenario set.
2. **Haptic fidelity validation:** Use force sensors to measure actual end-effector forces against commanded haptic vectors (Hx, Hy, Hz) across the full range of motion to verify the inverse kinematics mapping is accurate and linear.
3. **Latency stress test:** Systematically increase inference latency (via artificial delay injection) while measuring both haptic rendering quality (user perception) and flight stability to identify the true operational limits beyond the claimed 4-5 Hz requirement.
