# Recommending the right academic programs: An interest mining approach using BERTopic

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.06581
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06581
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Data-driven recommender system using BERTopic achieves 98% student satisfaction and 98% program coverage for academic program selection

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge prospective students face when selecting from numerous university programs by developing a data-driven recommender system. The system mines course descriptions to generate meaningful interest topics using BERTopic, allowing students to select topics matching their interests. Programs are then recommended based on keyword overlap between student-selected topics and courses in each program using a backtracking method. The approach leverages publicly available course descriptions, making it equitable and privacy-preserving.

A case study with 65 students at a polytechnic university demonstrated the system's effectiveness. Students reported that 98% of recommendations aligned with their interests, 94% would use the tool in the future, and the system achieved 98% program coverage with a personalization score of 0.77. The system is instantaneous, dynamic, comprehensive, and supports equity by relying on publicly available data without accessing confidential student information.

## Method Summary
The study developed a recommender system that combines BERTopic topic modeling with a backtracking recommendation algorithm. Course descriptions were mined to generate interest topics using BERTopic, which clusters similar course content based on semantic similarity. Students select topics matching their interests from the generated topic list. The system then recommends programs through a backtracking method that calculates keyword overlap between student-selected topics and courses within each program. The approach uses publicly available course descriptions, eliminating the need for confidential student data and ensuring equity across different student populations.

## Key Results
- 98% of students reported that recommendations aligned with their interests
- 94% of students indicated they would use the tool in the future
- 98% program coverage achieved with personalization score of 0.77

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by leveraging semantic similarity between course descriptions and student interests. BERTopic effectively captures the latent topics within course descriptions by analyzing semantic relationships between words and phrases. When students select topics matching their interests, the backtracking algorithm identifies programs where courses share significant keyword overlap with those topics. This creates personalized recommendations that align with both the structural content of programs and individual student preferences. The use of publicly available course descriptions ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining equity across different student demographics.

## Foundational Learning

**BERTopic topic modeling** - Why needed: To extract meaningful interest topics from course descriptions; Quick check: Verify topic coherence scores exceed 0.5 threshold

**Semantic similarity analysis** - Why needed: To measure relevance between student interests and program content; Quick check: Confirm cosine similarity metrics between related topics exceed 0.7

**Backtracking recommendation algorithm** - Why needed: To systematically match student interests with appropriate programs; Quick check: Validate that recommended programs contain at least 3 courses matching selected topics

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Course descriptions -> BERTopic -> Topic list -> Student selection -> Backtracking algorithm -> Program recommendations

Critical path: Course description ingestion → BERTopic topic generation → Student topic selection interface → Backtracking matching → Program recommendation display

Design tradeoffs: Public data dependency vs. data privacy protection; comprehensive coverage vs. computational complexity; real-time recommendations vs. processing overhead

Failure signatures: Low topic coherence scores (<0.4), recommendation mismatch rates >20%, system latency >2 seconds, coverage gaps >10%

First experiments: 1) Test BERTopic on sample course descriptions to verify topic generation quality; 2) Run backtracking algorithm with simulated student selections to validate recommendation logic; 3) Measure system response time with full dataset to ensure real-time performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on small sample (65 students) from single institution, limiting generalizability
- Effectiveness metrics rely on self-reported satisfaction rather than objective accuracy measures
- Does not address potential bias in course description corpus or performance with incomplete program data

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation claims regarding BERTopic topic modeling and backtracking algorithm
- Medium confidence in reported user satisfaction metrics due to potential social desirability bias
- Low confidence in 98% program coverage claim due to incomplete methodology details

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal study tracking actual student program selection and academic performance after using the system
2. Implement cross-validation testing with course descriptions from multiple institutions to assess robustness and generalizability
3. Perform bias audit of topic modeling results to identify and mitigate potential systematic biases in program recommendations
