core_contribution: This paper addresses audio classification tasks using symbolic
  decision tree learning rather than black-box neural networks. The authors apply
  the SOLE framework to tasks like gender/age recognition, emotion detection, and
  respiratory disease diagnosis using audio features extracted from Mel-Frequency
  Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and other spectral characteristics.

# Symbolic Audio Classification via Modal Decision Tree Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.17018
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17018
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Symbolic decision trees achieve up to 99.3% accuracy on audio classification tasks while maintaining interpretability

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a symbolic AI approach to audio classification using the SOLE framework, applying modal and propositional decision trees to tasks including gender/age recognition, emotion detection, and respiratory disease diagnosis. The method processes audio features extracted from MFCCs and spectral characteristics, producing interpretable rules while achieving competitive accuracy compared to black-box neural networks. The authors demonstrate that modal decision trees can outperform propositional ones by 0.2-1.6% accuracy while using fewer rules, with some achieving 100% confidence on test data.

## Method Summary
The authors employ the SOLE framework to convert audio classification tasks into symbolic decision tree problems. Audio features are extracted from Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and other spectral characteristics, then transformed into propositional or modal representations. The framework builds decision trees and forests that generate human-interpretable classification rules. The approach is tested across 11 classification tasks, comparing propositional and modal variants of decision trees and forests, with performance measured in terms of accuracy, rule count, and interpretability.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 99.3% accuracy for respiratory disease detection
- Modal decision trees outperformed propositional trees by 0.2-1.6% accuracy in some cases
- Extracted rules were simple and human-interpretable, with some achieving 100% confidence on test data
- Modal trees used fewer rules compared to propositional trees while maintaining competitive accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by transforming continuous audio features into symbolic representations that decision trees can process effectively. Modal logic allows for richer representations that capture temporal and hierarchical relationships in audio data, enabling more nuanced decision boundaries. The SOLE framework's ability to generate interpretable rules while maintaining competitive accuracy demonstrates that symbolic AI can match neural network performance on structured audio classification tasks.

## Foundational Learning

Modal Logic: Extension of classical logic that includes modalities like necessity and possibility
- Why needed: Enables richer representation of temporal and hierarchical relationships in audio data
- Quick check: Can be validated by comparing modal vs propositional performance on tasks requiring temporal reasoning

MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients): Feature extraction method representing audio in perceptually relevant frequency bands
- Why needed: Transforms raw audio into features that capture human auditory perception characteristics
- Quick check: Standard preprocessing step in audio classification; performance degrades without it

Decision Trees/Forests: Hierarchical classification models that split data based on feature thresholds
- Why needed: Provide interpretable classification while maintaining competitive accuracy
- Quick check: Accuracy and interpretability can be measured by rule complexity and test performance

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Audio data -> MFCC extraction -> Symbolic transformation -> SOLE framework -> Decision trees/forests -> Interpretable rules

Critical path: Feature extraction (MFCC) -> Symbolic representation (propositional/modal) -> Tree construction (SOLE) -> Classification rules

Design tradeoffs: Interpretability vs accuracy (symbolic approaches sacrifice some potential accuracy for transparency), computational efficiency vs model complexity (modal trees may be more computationally intensive but use fewer rules)

Failure signatures: Poor performance on highly variable or noisy audio data, inability to capture complex nonlinear relationships that neural networks might learn, performance degradation when symbolic representations don't adequately capture audio characteristics

First experiments: 1) Test SOLE framework on larger, noisier audio datasets with more classes and real-world variability, 2) Compare performance against modern neural network architectures beyond simple benchmarks, 3) Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability for processing large volumes of audio data in real-time applications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Generalizability to more complex, real-world audio datasets with higher variability and noise levels remains unclear
- Comparison limited to propositional and modal decision trees/forests without exploring other symbolic or hybrid approaches
- Computational efficiency of modal decision trees compared to neural networks for larger-scale problems is not thoroughly examined

## Confidence

- Interpretability claims: High (extracted rules are demonstrably simple and human-readable)
- Accuracy claims: Medium (strong performance on benchmark datasets but limited testing on challenging real-world data)
- Superiority of modal over propositional trees: Low to Medium (modest performance differences may not consistently favor modal trees)

## Next Checks

1. Test the SOLE framework on larger, noisier audio datasets with more classes and real-world variability
2. Compare performance against modern neural network architectures beyond simple benchmarks
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability for processing large volumes of audio data in real-time applications
