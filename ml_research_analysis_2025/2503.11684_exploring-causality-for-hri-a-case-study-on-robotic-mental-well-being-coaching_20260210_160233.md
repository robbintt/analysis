# Exploring Causality for HRI: A Case Study on Robotic Mental Well-being Coaching

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.11684
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11684
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: Causal analysis of robotic mental well-being coaching reveals that vocal features (loudness, spectral flux) positively correlate with robot perception, while facial AUs (AU7, AU10, AU17) negatively correlate with well-being outcomes

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how causal inference methods can enhance adaptive robotic mental well-being coaching by analyzing a 4-week longitudinal study with 17 coachees using the VITA robot. The research employs both macro-level Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and micro-level Fast Causal Inference (FCI) to examine relationships between non-verbal cues (facial expressions, speech features) and coaching outcomes. Key findings reveal strong positive correlations between speech loudness, spectral flux, and positive robot perceptions, as well as negative correlations between specific facial action units and both well-being and robot perception scores. The study demonstrates that causal analysis can uncover complex relationships between behavioral cues and coaching outcomes, providing insights for improving robotic adaptability in real-world HRI applications.

## Method Summary
The study conducted a 4-week longitudinal study with 17 coachees in a workplace setting, where the VITA robot delivered positive psychology exercises weekly. Multimodal data was collected including video for facial action units (using OpenFace 2.2.0) and audio for speech features (using openSMILE). Participants completed questionnaires (PANAS, ROSAS, WAI-SR) after each session. Causal analysis was performed at two levels: macro-level using Structural Equation Modeling to examine session-level relationships between observed features and latent constructs, and micro-level using Fast Causal Inference with Kernel Conditional Independence Tests to discover turn-level causal relationships. The analysis revealed how specific facial action units and vocal features influence well-being outcomes and perceptions of the robot.

## Key Results
- Loudness (path coefficient 0.681) and spectral flux (path coefficient 0.439) show strong positive correlations with positive robot perception scores
- Facial action units AU7 (lid tightener), AU10 (upper lip raiser), and AU17 (chin raiser) show negative correlations with both well-being and robot perception metrics
- SEM models demonstrate good fit (high CFI values, low RMSEA scores) supporting the validity of identified causal relationships
- Micro-level FCI analysis reveals complex causal structures with evidence of latent confounders affecting observed relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Causal inference methods can reveal relationships between multimodal behavioral cues and coaching outcomes that correlational analysis alone would miss.
- Mechanism: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) quantifies path coefficients between observed variables (facial/audio features) and latent constructs (well-being, robot perception) by minimizing the difference between observed and model-implied covariance matrices.
- Core assumption: The linear relationships modeled accurately reflect the underlying causal structure, and observed variables are reasonable proxies for latent constructs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This research employs both macro-level (Structural Equation Modeling) and micro-level (Fast Causal Inference) analyses to examine how non-verbal cues... influence well-being and perceptions of the robot."
  - [section V] "The strong fit of the models, as inferred by the high CFI values and low RMSEA scores, supports the validity of the causal relationships identified."
  - [corpus] Related work (Lee et al. overview cited in paper) discusses causal inference methods for HRI, but this paper provides first application to behavioral cues and well-being measures.
- Break condition: If model fit indices (CFI, RMSEA, TLI) fall below accepted thresholds, the assumed causal structure is likely misspecified.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Specific facial Action Units serve as negative indicators for coaching outcomes, potentially signaling discomfort or disengagement that the robot could learn to detect and respond to.
- Mechanism: AU7 (lid tightener), AU10 (upper lip raiser), and AU17 (chin raiser) showed negative path coefficients with ROSAS, PANAS, and WAI scores, suggesting these facial configurations correlate with reduced robot perception quality, lower positive affect, and weaker therapeutic alliance.
- Core assumption: These facial action units are consistent indicators of negative emotional states across individuals and contexts, rather than idiosyncratic expressions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V-A] "AU7r (Lid Tightening) was negatively correlated with both ROSAS and WAI, indicating that facial expressions associated with tension or stress were linked to more negative perception toward the robot."
  - [section V-A] "AU10r (Upper Lip Raiser) and AU17r (Chin Raiser) also showed negative correlations with ROSAS and PANAS."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; related papers focus on privacy and behavior change strategies rather than facial expression analysis in coaching.
- Break condition: If AU-to-outcome relationships reverse or disappear in larger, more diverse samples, these cues are not reliable adaptation signals.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Vocal features (loudness, spectral flux) serve as positive engagement indicators that correlate with more favorable robot perceptions.
- Mechanism: Path coefficient analysis shows loudness (0.681) and spectral flux (0.439) have positive estimated relationships with ROSAS, suggesting participants who spoke louder and with more variable speech speed perceived the robot more positively.
- Core assumption: Increased loudness and speech variability indicate engagement rather than frustration or environmental factors (e.g., noisy room).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V-A, Table IV] "ROSAS metric was positively correlated with loudness... spectral flux—a measure of the variability in speech speed—was positively correlated with ROSAS."
  - [section IV-B] SEM employs Maximum Likelihood Estimation to model relationships subject to multivariate normal distribution assumptions.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for this specific mechanism in coaching contexts.
- Break condition: If vocal features are confounded by environmental noise or individual speaking style differences, the learned adaptation policy may not generalize.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)**
  - Why needed here: SEM enables testing hypothesized causal relationships between observed features and latent constructs (well-being, perception) using path coefficients.
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish between a correlation coefficient and a path coefficient in an SEM context?

- Concept: **Fast Causal Inference (FCI) with Latent Confounders**
  - Why needed here: FCI handles situations where unmeasured variables (e.g., daily mood, cultural norms) may influence observed relationships, which is common in real-world HRI data.
  - Quick check question: What does an edge "X ↔ Y" in an FCI output graph indicate about the relationship between variables?

- Concept: **Facial Action Units (FAUs)**
  - Why needed here: OpenFace extracts 17 AU features representing facial muscle movements; understanding which AUs relate to positive/negative affect is critical for designing reward signals.
  - Quick check question: Which AUs did the paper identify as negatively correlated with well-being outcomes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Perception Layer: OpenFace 2.2.0 (facial AUs) -> openSMILE (audio features) -> HuggingFace diarization (speaker separation)
  - State Representation: 11-element vector (rupture prediction, exercise type, speech/silence duration, previous actions)
  - Adaptation Module: Reinforcement learning policy π: st → at (follow-up questions, summaries, topic transitions)
  - Causal Analysis Layer: SEM for macro (session-level), FCI+KCIT for micro (turn-level)
  - Robot Platform: QTrobot with screen face, RGB-D camera, microphone array

- Critical path:
  1. Audio-video capture → Feature extraction (FAUs, loudness, spectral flux)
  2. State vector construction → RL action selection
  3. Post-session questionnaire administration (PANAS, ROSAS, WAI-SR)
  4. Offline causal analysis on aggregated data

- Design tradeoffs:
  - SEM assumes multivariate normality; FCI+KCIT relaxes this but produces less interpretable graphs
  - Sample size (n=17) limits statistical power; bootstrap/majority-vote approach used to stabilize FCI results
  - Factual-only data prevents counterfactual causal effect estimation

- Failure signatures:
  - Shapiro-Wilk test failure (W=0.35, p<0.01) indicates non-normality → use KCIT instead of parametric tests
  - Low CFI (<0.90) or high RMSEA (>0.08) suggests SEM model misspecification
  - Undirected edges in FCI graph indicate latent confounders preventing causal direction identification

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate macro-level SEM analysis on your own interaction data, validating model fit indices before interpreting path coefficients.
  2. Run FCI with KCIT on turn-level features, using 30 random subsamples (80% each) and majority-vote synthesis to assess stability.
  3. Test whether AU7/AU10 negative coefficients replicate across different exercise types (savoring vs. gratitude) to evaluate context-dependence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can counterfactual estimation be incorporated into HRI causal analysis to overcome the limitations of relying on purely observational data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "A key limitation is that causal effect estimation or inference is challenging because we only rely or observe the factual, but not the counterfactual outcomes."
- Why unresolved: The current study relies on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on observed data, which cannot simulate outcomes for alternative actions the robot did not take.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study utilizing interventional data or causal inference techniques (e.g., do-calculus) that successfully estimate the effects of unobserved robot actions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the causal relationships identified between non-verbal cues and coaching effectiveness generalize to different HRI domains or cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note: "Future work can address this gap and extend this methodology to other human-robot interaction setting."
- Why unresolved: The current findings are derived from a single case study with 17 participants in a specific workplace setting, limiting generalizability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the SEM and FCI analysis in distinct HRI scenarios (e.g., education, elderly care) showing similar causal structures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can latent confounders, such as user mood or social norms, be explicitly modeled to clarify ambiguous causal links in robotic coaching?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The FCI analysis results indicated that "the lack of directed edges suggests the presence of latent confounders," which obscured the causal direction between features.
- Why unresolved: The study lacked ground-truth data for internal states like "daily mood" or "cultural norms," leaving the causal graph partially undirected.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integration of additional sensor data (e.g., physiological signals) or contextual questionnaires to capture and condition upon these latent variables.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=17) limits statistical power and generalizability of findings
- Reliance on factual observations without counterfactual outcomes constrains causal inference strength
- Non-normal data distribution required non-parametric methods, potentially reducing statistical power

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Positive correlations between vocal features (loudness, spectral flux) and robot perception; negative correlations between AU7, AU10, AU17 and well-being metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: SEM model fit indices supporting the causal structure; FCI results showing stable micro-level relationships across subsamples
- **Low Confidence**: Causal direction determination in presence of latent confounders; generalizability to larger/diverse populations

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the macro-level SEM analysis on an independent dataset with ≥50 participants to verify model stability and path coefficient magnitudes
2. Test whether the identified AU-to-outcome relationships (AU7, AU10, AU17) replicate across different cultural contexts and coaching domains
3. Conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing adaptive coaching (using the identified causal relationships) versus non-adaptive baseline to measure practical impact on well-being outcomes
