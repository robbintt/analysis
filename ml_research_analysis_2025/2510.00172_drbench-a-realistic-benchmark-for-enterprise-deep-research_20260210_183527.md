# DRBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Enterprise Deep Research

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.00172
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00172
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** DRBench benchmark evaluates AI agents on complex enterprise deep research tasks requiring integration of public web and private enterprise data

## Executive Summary
DRBench is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex, open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. It introduces 15 tasks grounded in realistic personas and company contexts, requiring agents to integrate both public web data and private enterprise documents across heterogeneous formats. The benchmark evaluates agents on insight recall, distractor avoidance, factuality, and report quality. Experiments with diverse models show that while agents are effective at avoiding distractors and producing structured reports, they struggle to consistently extract decision-critical insights. Larger, more advanced models perform better overall, and adaptive planning improves insight recall but may reduce factual accuracy. The work highlights the need for more targeted innovation in enterprise deep research.

## Method Summary
The benchmark provides 15 deep research tasks in a simulated enterprise environment with heterogeneous data sources (PDFs, emails, chats, spreadsheets) and enterprise applications (Nextcloud, Mattermost, Roundcube, FileBrowser). Agents use a four-stage architecture: Research Planning (decomposing questions), Action Planning (creating prioritized tool-using plans), Adaptive Research Loop (executing actions and filling gaps), and Report Writing (synthesizing findings with citations). The DRBench Agent (DRBA) baseline uses GPT-4o or GPT-5 as backbone LLMs. Evaluation employs LLM-as-judge to score reports on Insight Recall, Distractor Avoidance, Factuality, and Report Quality against ground-truth insights extracted from source materials.

## Key Results
- Agents excel at distractor avoidance (achieving 99.06% on average) but struggle with insight recall (averaging 16.92%)
- Adaptive Action Planning improves insight recall from 16.92 to 20.56 but reduces factuality when combined with other planning strategies
- Larger models (GPT-5) outperform smaller models (GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini) across all metrics
- No agent successfully sourced external knowledge from the open web despite tasks requiring public web data integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Source Integration for Realistic Enterprise Research
- Claim: Combining public web data with private enterprise documents creates a more ecologically valid benchmark for evaluating deep research agents.
- Mechanism: The benchmark synthesizes ground-truth insights by extracting factual claims from authoritative, dated public URLs and injecting complementary company-specific insights into private enterprise files (PDFs, emails, chats, spreadsheets). Agents must retrieve and integrate both source types to address open-ended research questions grounded in realistic personas and organizational contexts.
- Core assumption: Real enterprise research requires heterogeneous, fragmented data integration, not web-only synthesis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "require identifying supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base"
  - [section 3] "The Enterprise Search Environment" describes heterogeneous search space spanning productivity software, cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web
  - [corpus] Related work on heterogeneous enterprise data search (Benchmarking Deep Search over Heterogeneous Enterprise Data) shows similar multi-source requirements
- Break condition: If public insights become stale/404, or if private insights are trivially distinguishable from distractors, the integration requirement degrades.

### Mechanism 2: Adaptive Planning Improves Insight Coverage
- Claim: Dynamic action planning based on research progress helps agents discover insights that static plans miss.
- Mechanism: The Adaptive Action Planning (AAP) module analyzes completed actions after each iteration, identifies coverage gaps (e.g., heavy reliance on external vs. internal sources), and generates 1–5 new targeted actions with strategic rationale. This allows agents to recover missed evidence and refine source usage.
- Core assumption: Research gaps can be systematically identified from prior findings and addressed through structured re-planning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "adaptive planning improves insight recall but may reduce factual accuracy"
  - [section 5.2] Table 2 shows AAP improves insight recall from 16.92 to 20.56 and harmonic mean from 41.71 to 47.43, but combining with CRP/SRP reduces factuality
  - [corpus] ResearchRubrics and related DR benchmarks emphasize planning as critical, though direct corpus evidence on adaptive planning tradeoffs is limited
- Break condition: If adaptive planning over-explores and surfaces distractors, or if gap detection is unreliable, factuality may degrade (as observed in SRP+AAP and CRP+AAP combinations).

### Mechanism 3: LLM-as-Judge Enables Scalable Multi-Dimensional Evaluation
- Claim: Automated LLM-based evaluation can assess insight recall, factuality, and report quality at scale across enterprise tasks.
- Mechanism: The evaluation framework decomposes agent reports into atomic insights with citations, compares each against ground-truth insights using an LLM judge with strict matching criteria, verifies factual grounding via retrieval against cited sources (FactScore-style), and rates overall quality across six dimensions (depth, relevance, persona consistency, coherence, contradictions, completeness).
- Core assumption: LLM judges can reliably distinguish correct insight matches, partial matches, and distractor inclusion across enterprise contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] Describes four metrics: Insight Recall, Distractor Avoidance, Factuality, Report Quality with LLM-as-judge methodology
  - [section 6] Human evaluation shows 96% approval rate (72/75 votes) on task quality and Fleiss κ = 0.67 inter-annotator agreement; human preference aligns with metric-based findings
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence on LLM-as-judge reliability for enterprise DR; this is a methodological assumption requiring caution
- Break condition: If LLM judges show systematic bias (e.g., favoring verbose outputs) or fail on nuanced factuality checks, evaluation validity degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-hop reasoning across heterogeneous sources
  - Why needed here: Enterprise research requires connecting facts across documents, emails, chats, and web sources, not just single-hop retrieval.
  - Quick check question: Can you trace a claim in a generated report back to at least two different source types (e.g., a PDF and an email)?

- Concept: Needle-in-a-haystack retrieval
  - Why needed here: Agents must find specific quantitative insights embedded in large distractor-heavy documents.
  - Quick check question: Can your system retrieve a specific metric (e.g., "8% food waste reduction in Q2 2024") from a 10-page PDF where 90% of content is irrelevant?

- Concept: Adaptive planning and gap analysis
  - Why needed here: Static plans fail when initial assumptions about information availability are wrong; agents must adapt dynamically.
  - Quick check question: After retrieving 5 external sources and 0 internal sources, can your agent recognize the imbalance and automatically query internal systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Task Context: Company profile, persona (role, responsibilities), deep research question, task URL
  - Enterprise Environment: Nextcloud (cloud file sharing), Mattermost (internal chat), Roundcube (email), FileBrowser (local filesystem), VNC desktop
  - DRBench Agent: Research Planning (CRP/SRP) → Action Planning → Research Loop (Tool Selection → Content Processing → Adaptive Action Planning → Findings Storage) → Report Writing
  - Vector Store: Stores processed content with embeddings for semantic retrieval during synthesis
  - Evaluation Pipeline: Insight extraction → LLM Judge for recall/factuality/quality scoring

- Critical path:
  1. Receive DR question and company/persona context
  2. Research Planning: Decompose into investigation areas (CRP) or subqueries (SRP)
  3. Action Planning: Generate prioritized actions with tool specifications and dependencies
  4. Research Loop: Execute highest-priority action → process content into vector store → analyze gaps → generate adaptive actions → iterate (max 15–50 iterations)
  5. Report Writing: Query vector store by theme, synthesize findings with inline citations
  6. Evaluation: Extract atomic insights from report, match against ground-truth, verify citations, rate quality

- Design tradeoffs:
  - CRP vs. SRP: CRP provides structured investigation areas with business rationale but may reduce factuality (65.17% vs. 72.09% for GPT-5); SRP is lightweight and maintains better grounding.
  - More iterations vs. focus: Increasing iterations (15→50) can improve factuality through verification but risks fragmented reasoning; Table 25 shows harmonic mean peaks at moderate counts (66.41 at 15 with CRP).
  - Enterprise vs. external source prioritization: Prioritizing internal sources (priority 0.7–1.0) improves relevance but may miss external validation context.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low insight recall + high distractor avoidance: Agent is too conservative, missing relevant embedded insights.
  - High factuality + low insight recall: Agent relies on generic prior knowledge rather than enterprise-specific data.
  - Degenerating web agent trajectories: Repeated clicks on same elements, inability to navigate unfamiliar interfaces (Table 18 shows stuck loops).
  - Missing or hallucinated citations: Report writing fails to track source attribution through the synthesis pipeline.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline establishment**: Run DRBA with GPT-4o backbone, no explicit planning, 15 iterations on MinEval subset to establish baseline scores for insight recall, factuality, distractor avoidance, and report quality.
  2. **Planning strategy ablation**: Compare Simple Research Planning (SRP) vs. Complex Research Planning (CRP) vs. Adaptive Action Planning (AAP) in isolation to identify which best balances recall and factuality for your target domain.
  3. **Iteration budget tuning**: Test with 15, 30, and 50 research loop iterations using the best planning configuration to find the sweet spot where additional exploration improves coverage without degrading focus.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can deep research agent architectures be optimized to simultaneously maximize insight recall (via adaptive mechanisms) and factual accuracy (via structured planning)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 5.2 that "adaptive mechanisms are key for improving coverage... while lightweight planning is more effective for maintaining factual grounding," and conclude that "carefully balancing the two remains an open challenge."
- Why unresolved: Current architectures exhibit a trade-off where methods that improve coverage (AAP) tend to reduce factual correctness, and vice versa.
- What evidence would resolve it: An agent architecture that achieves a harmonic mean score significantly higher than the current maximum (47.43 reported for AAP) without sacrificing factuality below the baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can agents effectively perform cross-file integration and reasoning across heterogeneous modalities such as PDFs and chat logs to improve decision-critical insight extraction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 explicitly lists future work to "extend DRBench with tasks requiring cross-file integration, reasoning across modalities such as PDFs and chats, and richer distractors."
- Why unresolved: The current benchmark and evaluation focus on specific retrieval and synthesis but do not explicitly isolate or test the difficulty of synthesizing information that requires complex cross-modal reasoning between disparate file types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance improvements on an extended version of DRBench containing tasks specifically designed to require linking evidence from modalities like PDF tables and chat conversations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What architectural modifications are required to enable agents to successfully extract relevant external knowledge from the open web, given that current agents fail to source such insights?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.3 notes that "no agent managed to successfully source external knowledge" and highlights the "difficulty of extracting relevant information... within an unboundedly large search space," implying a critical gap in current agent capabilities.
- Why unresolved: Current agents apparently rely too heavily on internal or local knowledge or fail to navigate the noise of the open web effectively for deep research tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative results showing a non-zero "external_fact" insight recall score for agents on the DRBench tasks that require public web data.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can deep research agents maintain high utility in insight extraction while adhering to strict data protection protocols in privacy-sensitive enterprise environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 7 that they aim to "add... privacy-sensitive tasks to assess data protection" as a necessary extension to move agents closer to enterprise readiness.
- Why unresolved: The current version of DRBench does not model privacy constraints or the risk of data leakage, which are critical factors in real-world enterprise deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results from a modified benchmark where agents are penalized for accessing or revealing restricted data defined by privacy policies within the task context.

## Limitations

- Evaluation methodology relies heavily on LLM-as-judge approaches with limited direct validation corpus for enterprise deep research contexts
- Benchmark contains only 15 tasks, which may not capture full diversity of enterprise research challenges
- No agent successfully sourced external knowledge from the open web despite tasks requiring public web data integration

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Multi-source integration requirement and heterogeneous data handling (well-documented in section 3 and supported by related work on enterprise data search)
- **Medium Confidence:** Adaptive planning benefits and tradeoffs (empirical results show improvements but also factuality degradation in combination with CRP/SRP)
- **Medium Confidence:** LLM-as-judge evaluation reliability (supported by human evaluation showing 96% approval and κ = 0.67 agreement, but lacks extensive validation corpus)

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate the planning strategy ablation study** comparing CRP, SRP, and AAP in isolation across multiple tasks to verify the reported tradeoffs between insight recall and factuality scores.

2. **Conduct cross-validation of evaluation metrics** by having human experts independently score a subset of reports (different from the 75 used) to assess LLM judge reliability and potential systematic biases.

3. **Test generalizability beyond the provided 15 tasks** by adapting the benchmark structure to new enterprise domains (e.g., healthcare compliance, financial analysis) and measuring whether the same agent architectures maintain performance.
