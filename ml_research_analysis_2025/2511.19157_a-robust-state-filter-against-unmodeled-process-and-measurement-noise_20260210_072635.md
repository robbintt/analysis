# A Robust State Filter Against Unmodeled Process And Measurement Noise

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.19157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19157
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: Proposes RoLF framework extending WoLF with generalized Bayesian principles and user-defined matrices for robust Kalman filtering

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Robust Loss-based Filter (RoLF) framework that addresses outliers in both process and measurement noise for Kalman filtering applications. The method builds upon the Weighted Observation Likelihood Filter (WoLF) by incorporating generalized Bayesian principles and introduces two user-defined matrices, Λ and Ω, that adaptively scale covariance propagation and process noise. The framework maintains computational efficiency by preserving the standard Kalman filter structure while providing robustness to noise misspecifications. Experimental results on a 2D GARCH process with mixture measurements demonstrate that RoLF effectively mitigates outliers and achieves superior worst-case performance compared to standard Kalman filters and WoLF.

## Method Summary
The RoLF framework extends WoLF by incorporating generalized Bayesian principles to handle both process and measurement noise outliers simultaneously. It introduces two user-defined matrices, Λ and Ω, which adaptively scale the covariance propagation and process noise, respectively. The framework maintains the computational structure of standard Kalman filters while providing robustness through a loss-based update mechanism. The method computes a robust estimate by minimizing a weighted loss function that accounts for the uncertainty in both the process and measurement models. This approach allows the filter to maintain performance even when the assumed noise distributions are misspecified or contain outliers.

## Key Results
- RoLF effectively mitigates outliers in both process and measurement noise compared to standard Kalman filters
- The framework achieves lower worst-case losses, particularly when evaluating the 5% largest losses in extreme scenarios
- Maintains computational efficiency by preserving the standard Kalman filter structure while providing robust performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RoLF framework works by extending the generalized Bayesian framework to handle uncertainty in both the process and measurement models simultaneously. The key mechanism involves using user-defined matrices Λ and Ω to adaptively scale the covariance propagation and process noise, respectively. This adaptive scaling allows the filter to downweight the influence of outliers in the update equations, preventing them from corrupting the state estimate. The loss-based formulation provides a principled way to incorporate robustness while maintaining the computational efficiency of the standard Kalman filter structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **Generalized Bayesian principles**: Why needed - to extend filtering beyond standard Bayesian assumptions when noise distributions are misspecified; Quick check - verify the mathematical derivation extends standard Kalman filtering equations
- **Weighted observation likelihood**: Why needed - to provide robustness against measurement outliers; Quick check - confirm the weighting mechanism effectively downweights extreme measurements
- **User-defined scaling matrices (Λ and Ω)**: Why needed - to adaptively control the influence of process and measurement noise on the filter; Quick check - validate that these matrices can be practically tuned for different applications

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: System model -> Process noise handling (Ω) -> Measurement model -> Measurement noise handling (Λ) -> Robust loss minimization -> State estimate update
- **Critical path**: The critical computational path follows standard Kalman filter structure with the addition of robust loss computation and scaling matrix application
- **Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades parameter selection complexity (Λ and Ω matrices) for improved robustness against noise outliers
- **Failure signatures**: Poor parameter selection for Λ and Ω matrices can lead to degraded performance or filter divergence
- **First experiments**: 1) Validate on synthetic data with known outlier characteristics, 2) Test parameter sensitivity across different Λ and Ω values, 3) Compare performance on real-world sensor data with known outlier patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework requires careful selection of user-defined matrices Λ and Ω, with no systematic guidance provided for different applications
- Experimental validation is limited to a single synthetic example using a 2D GARCH process, lacking real-world application testing
- Comparison with standard Kalman filters and WoLF does not include other state-of-the-art robust filtering approaches

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework: High - clear mathematical derivation based on established generalized Bayesian principles
- Practical utility: Medium - limited experimental scope and lack of systematic parameter selection guidance
- Computational efficiency: High - maintains standard Kalman filter structure, but requires empirical verification

## Next Checks
1. Implement systematic methods for selecting Λ and Ω matrices across different application domains and evaluate their impact on filter performance
2. Test RoLF on real-world datasets with known outlier characteristics from domains such as navigation, robotics, or financial time series
3. Compare RoLF against multiple contemporary robust filtering approaches including variational Bayes filters and particle filters under identical outlier scenarios
