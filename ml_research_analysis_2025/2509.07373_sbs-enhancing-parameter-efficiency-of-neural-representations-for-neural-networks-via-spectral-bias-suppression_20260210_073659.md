# SBS: Enhancing Parameter-Efficiency of Neural Representations for Neural Networks via Spectral Bias Suppression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.07373
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07373
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: SBS achieves 2-3× better parameter efficiency than state-of-the-art methods, reaching 69.43% ImageNet accuracy with only 15% of ResNet18's parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the spectral bias problem in implicit neural representations (INRs) used for neural network weight generation (NeRN). Standard MLPs exhibit low-pass filtering behavior, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency details in CNN kernel weights. The authors propose SBS (Spectral Bias Suppression), which introduces two key techniques: unidirectional ordering-based smoothing (UOS) for output space regularization that enforces directional smoothness along single axes of CNN kernels, and UOS-aware random Fourier features (UOS-RFF) for input space transformation that adaptively modulates frequency bandwidth based on layer-wise parameter counts. Evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet with ResNet architectures show that SBS achieves better parameter efficiency than state-of-the-art methods. For instance, with only 15% of ResNet18's parameters, SBS reaches 69.43% accuracy on ImageNet, matching NeRN's performance at 46% parameter usage, representing a 2-3× improvement in parameter efficiency.

## Method Summary
The proposed SBS framework consists of two main components designed to address the spectral bias inherent in standard MLPs used for neural representation. The first component, unidirectional ordering-based smoothing (UOS), applies output space regularization by enforcing smoothness constraints along individual axes of CNN kernel dimensions. This directional regularization prevents the low-pass filtering behavior that causes MLPs to miss high-frequency details in weight representations. The second component, UOS-aware random Fourier features (UOS-RFF), transforms the input space by incorporating Fourier features whose frequency bandwidth is adaptively modulated based on the parameter count of each layer. This adaptive modulation allows the network to capture both low and high-frequency components effectively. Together, these techniques enable more accurate reconstruction of CNN kernel weights while using significantly fewer parameters than previous approaches.

## Key Results
- SBS achieves 69.43% ImageNet accuracy using only 15% of ResNet18's parameters
- Compared to NeRN, SBS reaches the same performance level while using 46% fewer parameters
- Demonstrates 2-3× improvement in parameter efficiency across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of SBS stems from its targeted approach to mitigating spectral bias in implicit neural representations. Standard MLPs tend to exhibit low-pass filtering characteristics, which causes them to smooth out high-frequency details in CNN kernel weights during reconstruction. This spectral bias limits the representational capacity of neural representations and necessitates larger networks to capture fine-grained weight patterns. SBS addresses this by introducing directional regularization through UOS, which enforces smoothness along specific axes while preserving high-frequency information along others. The UOS-RFF component further enhances frequency representation by modulating the input space with adaptive Fourier features, allowing the network to effectively capture both low and high-frequency components in the weight space. This combination enables more accurate weight reconstruction with fewer parameters by preserving essential high-frequency details that would otherwise be lost to spectral bias.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input CNN weights -> UOS-RFF transformation -> MLP with UOS regularization -> Reconstructed CNN weights

**Critical Path**: The core computation involves transforming input coordinates with UOS-RFF, passing through the MLP with UOS regularization applied to the output space, and producing reconstructed kernel weights. The UOS regularization is critical as it prevents spectral bias from degrading reconstruction quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades increased computational complexity (due to Fourier feature transformations and regularization) for improved parameter efficiency. The adaptive frequency modulation in UOS-RFF requires careful tuning based on layer-wise parameter counts to balance low and high-frequency component capture.

**Failure Signatures**: If spectral bias is not adequately suppressed, the reconstructed CNN kernels will exhibit overly smooth patterns, missing high-frequency details necessary for accurate feature extraction. Insufficient regularization may lead to overfitting, while excessive regularization can overly constrain the model and limit its representational capacity.

**First Experiments**:
1. Ablation study comparing UOS vs UOS-RFF contributions to performance
2. Evaluation on non-ResNet architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers)
3. Computational overhead analysis measuring training time and memory usage

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope is limited to ResNet architectures and three standard image classification datasets
- Lack of extensive ablations on the relative contributions of UOS and UOS-RFF components
- Computational overhead characterization is incomplete, with training time implications not thoroughly quantified
- Long-term stability and out-of-distribution performance are not explored

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core observation about spectral bias in INRs and the general approach of using Fourier features and regularization are well-established in the literature

**Medium Confidence**: The specific implementation of UOS and UOS-RFF, and their claimed superiority over existing methods

**Medium Confidence**: The parameter efficiency improvements, though results appear robust across datasets

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the effects of UOS and UOS-RFF to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains

2. Evaluate SBS on non-ResNet architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers, ConvNeXt) and diverse task types beyond image classification

3. Measure and report the computational overhead (training time, memory usage) introduced by SBS relative to baseline NeRN methods
