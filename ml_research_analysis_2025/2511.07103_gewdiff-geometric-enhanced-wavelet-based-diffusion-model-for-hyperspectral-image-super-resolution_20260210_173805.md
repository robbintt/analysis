# GEWDiff: Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model for Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.07103
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07103
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** 4× HSI super-resolution with state-of-the-art performance (PSNR 28.86 dB, SSIM 0.71, SAM 8.43, CC 0.79, FID 44.46)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents GEWDiff, a novel diffusion model for 4× hyperspectral image super-resolution that addresses key challenges including high spectral dimensionality, geometric distortion, and slow convergence. The model introduces a wavelet-based encoder-decoder to efficiently compress HSI data while preserving spectral-spatial information, an edge-aware noise scheduler to maintain geometric integrity, and a multi-level loss function to ensure stable convergence and high reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with significant improvements in spectral and spatial quality metrics.

## Method Summary
GEWDiff uses a RWA+PCA encoder-decoder to compress 242-band HSIs to 20 latent bands, preserving spectral-spatial information through Haar wavelet decomposition and regression-based detail prediction. The compressed latent representation is processed by a 3D U-Net with Spectral Fidelity Enhancer, conditioned on edge maps and segmentation masks. Training employs EDM framework with edge-aware noise scheduling and a weighted combination of pixel, perceptual, and gradient losses. The model generates SR HSIs through DPM-Solver++ sampling, achieving superior performance on EnMAP and MDAS datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieves PSNR of 28.86 dB and SSIM of 0.71 on WDC test set
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with SAM of 8.43 and CC of 0.79
- Demonstrates robustness under imperfect conditioning and improves land-cover classification accuracy
- Encoder-decoder reconstruction reaches 53.26 dB PSNR when compressing to 20 bands

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** RWA+PCA encoder-decoder compresses 242-band hyperspectral images to ~20 latent bands while preserving spectral-spatial information for reconstruction.
- **Mechanism:** Haar wavelet decomposition extracts multi-frequency components; regression models predict high-frequency detail coefficients from low-frequency main coefficients; PCA orthogonalizes the compressed representation into dense features suitable for diffusion processing.
- **Core assumption:** Hyperspectral bands contain sufficient spectral redundancy that high-frequency wavelet coefficients can be linearly predicted from low-frequency components.
- **Evidence anchors:** Table 4 reports encoder-decoder reconstruction PSNR of 53.26 dB when compressing to 20 bands with RWA+PCA—near-lossless quality.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Reducing noise strength near detected edges during the forward diffusion process helps preserve geometric structures during reverse generation.
- **Mechanism:** A binary edge map modulates per-pixel noise—edges receive less noise via multiplicative masking—so structural information persists through the noising trajectory and guides denoising.
- **Core assumption:** Detected edges correspond to semantically meaningful boundaries (e.g., building outlines) that should be preserved, and edge detection is sufficiently accurate.
- **Evidence anchors:** Equation (10) zt = z0 + σtϵ ⊙ (1 - E(1 - σ²norm)η) defines edge-modulated noise; η = 0.5 controls perturbation strength.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A weighted combination of pixel-wise, perceptual, and gradient losses stabilizes convergence and balances spectral accuracy with spatial detail.
- **Mechanism:** Pixel loss (λ=0.8, L2 + SAM) enforces spectral fidelity; perceptual loss (λ=0.1, VGG features) aligns high-level semantics; gradient loss (λ=0.1) preserves edge structures—each addressing a distinct failure mode.
- **Core assumption:** These
