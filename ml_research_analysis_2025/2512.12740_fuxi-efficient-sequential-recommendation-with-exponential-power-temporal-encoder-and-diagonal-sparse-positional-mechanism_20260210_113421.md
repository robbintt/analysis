# FuXi-$γ$: Efficient Sequential Recommendation with Exponential-Power Temporal Encoder and Diagonal-Sparse Positional Mechanism

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12740
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12740
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 25.06% HR@10 and 42.86% NDCG@10 improvements on industrial music dataset

## Executive Summary
FuXi-γ introduces an efficient sequential recommendation framework that addresses computational bottlenecks in modeling user interests through two key innovations. The exponential-power temporal encoder uses a tunable exponential decay function inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve to capture temporal dynamics with hardware-friendly continuous memory access. The diagonal-sparse positional mechanism prunes low-contribution attention blocks based on importance scoring, significantly reducing positional attention overhead while maintaining recommendation quality.

## Method Summary
FuXi-γ employs an exponential-power temporal encoder that models user interest decay using a tunable exponential function, replacing traditional time-decay approaches with a more hardware-efficient implementation. The diagonal-sparse positional mechanism analyzes attention block contributions and selectively prunes those with minimal impact on recommendation quality, reducing computational complexity. Together, these innovations enable FuXi-γ to achieve state-of-the-art performance with substantial efficiency gains across training and inference phases.

## Key Results
- Achieves 4.74× faster training and 6.18× faster inference compared to strong autoregressive baselines
- Improves HR@10 by 25.06% and NDCG@10 by 42.86% on large-scale industrial music dataset
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art recommendation performance across four real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The exponential-power temporal encoder effectively captures the natural decay of user interests over time through an exponential function that mirrors the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, allowing the model to prioritize recent interactions while still considering historical patterns. The diagonal-sparse positional mechanism reduces computational overhead by identifying and pruning attention blocks that contribute minimally to recommendation quality, focusing computational resources on the most impactful interactions. This combination enables efficient processing of sequential user behavior while maintaining high recommendation accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- Exponential decay functions: Essential for modeling temporal dynamics in user behavior; quick check: verify decay parameters align with observed forgetting patterns in user data
- Attention mechanism pruning: Critical for reducing computational complexity; quick check: measure impact of pruning on recommendation quality metrics
- Hardware-efficient memory access: Important for practical deployment; quick check: profile memory access patterns during training and inference

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input sequence -> Exponential-Power Temporal Encoder -> Diagonal-Sarse Positional Mechanism -> Attention Blocks -> Recommendation Output

Critical path: User interaction sequence flows through the temporal encoder to capture time-decayed representations, then through the positional mechanism to identify and focus on high-importance attention blocks, ultimately producing recommendations through weighted aggregation.

Design tradeoffs: The model prioritizes computational efficiency over full attention coverage, accepting potential information loss from pruning in exchange for significant speedups. The exponential decay parameterization requires careful tuning to match specific temporal patterns in different datasets.

Failure signatures: Poor temporal decay parameter tuning can lead to overemphasis on either recent or historical interactions. Aggressive pruning in the positional mechanism may remove important context, degrading recommendation quality.

First experiments: 1) Test different exponential decay rates on a validation set to find optimal temporal encoding parameters. 2) Evaluate pruning thresholds to balance efficiency gains against recommendation accuracy. 3) Compare full vs. pruned attention mechanisms on a small dataset to verify pruning effectiveness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance improvements may be hardware-specific due to undisclosed baseline implementation details
- Exponential decay assumption may not hold for all temporal patterns and user behaviors
- Focus on accuracy metrics without thorough analysis of recommendation diversity or novelty trade-offs

## Confidence
- Technical innovation claims: High
- Performance improvement claims: Medium
- Generalization across datasets: Low

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce results on the industrial music dataset using independent implementations to verify the 25.06% HR@10 and 42.86% NDCG@10 improvements
2. Test model performance on datasets with non-exponential temporal patterns to validate temporal encoder robustness
3. Evaluate impact of diagonal-sparse positional mechanism on recommendation diversity metrics alongside accuracy measures
