# MIMII-Agent: Leveraging LLMs with Function Calling for Relative Evaluation of Anomalous Sound Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.20666
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20666
- **Reference count:** 34
- **Primary result:** LLM-driven function calling generates realistic synthetic anomalies that preserve relative detection difficulty rankings across machine types for unsupervised ASD evaluation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MIMII-Agent, a method that leverages large language models with function calling to generate machine-type-specific anomalies for evaluating unsupervised anomalous sound detection (UASD) systems. The approach interprets textual fault descriptions and automatically selects audio transformations to convert normal machine sounds into diverse, plausible anomalies without requiring real anomaly data. By operating solely on normal sound data, MIMII-Agent addresses the scarcity of anomalous sound recordings while ensuring scalability and realism. Experiments demonstrate that synthetic anomalies achieve consistent relative detection difficulty rankings compared to real anomalies across five industrial machine types, validating the method's effectiveness for relative performance evaluation of UASD systems.

## Method Summary
MIMII-Agent employs an LLM (GPT-4o) to interpret fault descriptions and select appropriate audio transformation functions (squeaking, rattling, grinding, etc.) to apply to normal machine sounds. The system uses Flan-T5 for caption generation and MIMII-Gen for normal audio synthesis. An autoencoder is trained on log-mel spectrograms from normal sounds across five machine types (bearings, gearboxes, fans, valves, slide rails). The method generates 50 synthetic anomalies per machine type by applying LLM-selected transformations, then evaluates detection performance using AUC scores with MSE and Mahalanobis distance metrics. The key innovation is achieving relative performance rankings between machine types without requiring real anomalous training data, validated through ablation studies showing LLM-based contextual understanding significantly outperforms random anomaly selection.

## Key Results
- Synthetic anomalies achieved AUC scores ranging from 0.78 to 0.92 across five machine types
- Relative detection difficulty rankings between synthetic and real anomalies showed strong consistency
- LLM-based contextual understanding significantly outperformed random anomaly selection in ablation studies
- Method successfully evaluated UASD systems trained only on normal sounds without real anomaly data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging LLMs' ability to understand natural language fault descriptions and map them to appropriate audio transformations that realistically simulate machine faults. This contextual understanding enables the generation of subtle, machine-type-specific anomalies that preserve the relative difficulty of detection across different equipment types, addressing the fundamental challenge of evaluating UASD systems when real anomaly data is scarce.

## Foundational Learning
- **Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection (UASD)**: Detecting anomalies in sound data without labeled anomalous examples; needed because real anomaly recordings are expensive and rare in industrial settings.
- **Function Calling in LLMs**: LLM capability to interpret natural language and execute predefined operations; needed to bridge textual fault descriptions with audio transformation functions.
- **Audio Transformation Functions**: DSP operations like squeaking, rattling, grinding that simulate specific fault types; needed to create realistic synthetic anomalies from normal sounds.
- **Relative Evaluation**: Comparing system performance rankings across conditions rather than absolute metrics; needed because anomaly severity affects absolute detection scores.
- **Log-Mel Spectrogram Processing**: Converting audio to frequency-domain representations for machine learning; needed for consistent autoencoder training across diverse machine sounds.
- **Mahalanobis Distance Metric**: Statistical distance measure accounting for feature correlations; needed as an alternative to MSE for anomaly detection evaluation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Fault Description -> LLM (GPT-4o) -> Audio Transformation Functions -> Synthetic Anomalies -> Autoencoder Evaluation -> AUC Scores

**Critical Path:** The core workflow involves caption generation (Flan-T5) feeding fault descriptions to the LLM, which selects transformation functions applied to normal sounds, producing synthetic anomalies evaluated by the trained autoencoder.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades absolute detection accuracy for relative ranking consistency by generating detectable but not overly severe anomalies, ensuring synthetic data preserves real-world difficulty relationships while remaining computationally feasible.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Synthetic anomalies too easy to detect (AUC consistently higher than real anomalies)
- LLM selects inappropriate transformations for machine types
- Ranking correlation fails between synthetic and real anomaly performance
- Autoencoder learns machine-specific rather than general audio patterns

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Validate LLM function selection by testing 50+ fault descriptions across all five machine types and comparing selections against expert annotations
2. Systematically vary audio transformation intensity parameters and measure impact on detection difficulty to identify optimal subtle anomaly settings
3. Evaluate ranking correlation robustness across multiple autoencoder architectures and distance metrics beyond MSE and Mahalanobis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Prompt Design Optimization:** How can structured prompt engineering and domain-specific constraints enhance anomaly realism and correlation with human expert evaluation? (Section 4.4)
- **Complex Fault Modeling:** To what extent does reliance on predefined transformation functions limit modeling of complex or novel fault characteristics not decomposable into standard sound effects? (Inferred from Section 3.1.2)
- **Absolute Performance Prediction:** Can the approach be calibrated to predict actual AUC scores rather than just relative rankings by incorporating severity parameters to match real-world anomaly distributions? (Inferred from Introduction)

## Limitations
- Implementation details for prompt templates and audio transformation parameters remain unspecified
- Method's ability to model complex or compound faults is limited by predefined transformation library
- Absolute performance metrics cannot be reliably predicted due to anomaly severity variability
- Dependence on LLM function calling introduces uncertainty in synthetic anomaly generation

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in core methodology and experimental results based on sufficient detail and consistent synthetic-real ranking correlations
- **Medium confidence** in reproducibility of audio transformation and LLM integration components due to unspecified implementation choices
- **Low confidence** in achieving identical quantitative results without exact prompt templates and transformation parameters

## Next Checks
1. Validate LLM function calling system by testing 50+ fault descriptions across all five machine types and comparing selections against expert annotations
2. Systematically vary intensity parameters of each audio transformation to identify optimal settings for subtle, detectable anomalies
3. Evaluate ranking correlation robustness across multiple autoencoder architectures and distance metrics beyond MSE and Mahalanobis
