# Development and Evaluation of HopeBot: an LLM-based chatbot for structured and interactive PHQ-9 depression screening

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.05984
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05984
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: HopeBot achieved ICC = 0.92 concordance with traditional PHQ-9 screening and 71% of users reported greater trust in chatbot-assisted assessment

## Executive Summary
HopeBot is an LLM-powered conversational chatbot designed to administer the PHQ-9 depression screening with real-time clarification and safety guidance. In a within-subject study of 132 adults, HopeBot-assisted scores showed high concordance with self-administered PHQ-9 results (ICC = 0.92; median absolute difference = 1 point). Among 75 participants comparing both formats, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot due to its clearer structure, interpretive guidance, and supportive tone. The system achieved high usability ratings across multiple dimensions including comfort (8.4), voice clarity (7.7), and handling sensitive topics (7.6), with 87.1% of participants expressing willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot.

## Method Summary
The study employed a within-subject design where participants completed both traditional self-administered PHQ-9 screening and HopeBot-assisted screening. Participants were recruited from university-affiliated communities and Amazon Mechanical Turk, with 132 adults completing the full protocol. The chatbot utilized GPT-4 to generate empathetic, conversational responses while maintaining structured screening questions. Participants' scores were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients and median absolute differences. A subset of 75 participants also provided comparative feedback on their experience with both formats through standardized usability questionnaires and open-ended responses about trust, clarity, and supportiveness.

## Key Results
- ICC = 0.92 concordance between HopeBot-assisted and self-administered PHQ-9 scores with median absolute difference of 1 point
- 71% of participants reported greater trust in chatbot-assisted assessment compared to traditional self-administration
- High usability ratings across dimensions: comfort (8.4), voice clarity (7.7), handling sensitive topics (7.6), and recommendation helpfulness (7.4)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The conversational interface of HopeBot likely reduces cognitive load during depression screening by providing real-time clarification of ambiguous questions and immediate interpretation of responses. This interactive format may help participants better understand the screening criteria and feel more supported during what can be an emotionally challenging assessment. The use of GPT-4 enables natural language processing that can adapt explanations to individual user needs while maintaining the structured format required for clinical screening accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
This work builds upon established psychological assessment principles that emphasize the importance of clear communication and respondent understanding in screening instruments. The PHQ-9's standardized format provides a reliable baseline for depression screening, while conversational AI technologies offer new possibilities for enhancing participant engagement and comprehension. Previous research on computerized adaptive testing and digital mental health interventions demonstrates the potential for technology to improve screening accessibility and participant comfort, though most prior work has focused on static interfaces rather than dynamic conversational systems.

## Architecture Onboarding
HopeBot's architecture centers on GPT-4 as the core language model, integrated with a structured conversational framework that maintains PHQ-9 screening protocol integrity. The system employs prompt engineering to ensure responses remain clinically appropriate while being conversational and supportive. Safety mechanisms are implemented through predefined response templates and guardrails that prevent inappropriate content generation. The architecture likely includes input validation to ensure responses align with PHQ-9 scoring criteria and output filtering to maintain professional clinical communication standards.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The study raises questions about the generalizability of chatbot-assisted screening to populations with varying levels of digital literacy and educational backgrounds. It also highlights the need to understand how conversational screening might affect long-term patient-provider relationships and whether the enhanced trust in chatbot assessment translates to improved clinical outcomes. The paper suggests investigating whether similar conversational approaches could enhance other standardized psychological assessments beyond depression screening, and how to optimize safety mechanisms for real-world deployment scenarios.

## Limitations
- Sample primarily consisted of educated adults (median age 26, 84% with some college education), limiting generalizability
- Convenience sampling from university communities and MTurk may introduce selection bias
- Laboratory validation doesn't fully capture real-world deployment challenges for safety mechanisms
- Focus on single screening tool (PHQ-9) may not generalize to other assessment instruments

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Technical implementation of HopeBot and its ability to administer PHQ-9 screening consistently
- High Confidence: High usability ratings and participant willingness to reuse/recommend the system
- Medium Confidence: Clinical equivalence of HopeBot-assisted screening compared to traditional self-administration
- Medium Confidence: Scalability and real-world effectiveness of safety mechanisms

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger, more diverse validation study across different age groups, education levels, and clinical settings
2. Implement longitudinal deployment study comparing screening outcomes and safety incident rates in real clinical environments
3. Evaluate system performance with multiple depression screening instruments beyond PHQ-9
