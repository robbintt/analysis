# On the Role of Priors in Bayesian Causal Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.01424
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01424
- Authors: Bernhard C. Geiger; Roman Kern
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Unlabeled cause data does not improve parameter estimation of the mechanism in Bayesian causal learning, and factorized priors over cause and mechanism parameters yield factorized posteriors.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates causal learning of independent causal mechanisms (ICM) from a Bayesian perspective, focusing on whether unlabeled cause data can improve parameter estimation of the causal mechanism. Through theoretical analysis and synthetic experiments, the authors demonstrate that when the true causal direction is known and the prior factorizes over cause and mechanism parameters, unlabeled cause realizations do not contribute additional information for learning the mechanism. The work shows that correlated priors can slow down learning in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, emphasizing the importance of choosing appropriate factorized priors, particularly in small-data regimes.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze Bayesian causal learning using a synthetic additive model y = x + η, where x ~ N(θ, σ²=3) and η ~ N(ψ, σ²=1). They employ Gaussian-Gaussian Bayesian inference with closed-form posterior updates to study three learning scenarios: (a) unsupervised learning with infinite cause samples, (b) fully supervised learning with labeled data, and (c) semi-supervised learning combining both. The theoretical analysis proves that a factorized prior p(θ, ψ) results in a factorized posterior, aligning with Kolmogorov complexity definitions of independent causal mechanisms. Synthetic experiments with 10,000 random trials validate these theoretical findings by tracking log-likelihood of true mechanism parameters and posterior mean trajectories.

## Key Results
- Unlabeled cause data does not improve parameter estimation of the causal mechanism when the true causal direction is known
- Factorized priors over cause and mechanism parameters yield factorized posteriors, supporting ICM principles
- Correlated priors can slow down learning in both supervised and semi-supervised settings
- The choice of appropriate factorized priors is crucial for efficient learning, especially in small-data regimes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The theoretical foundation rests on the principle that independent causal mechanisms should have independent parameter representations. In the Bayesian framework, this translates to priors that factorize over cause (θ) and mechanism (ψ) parameters. When this factorization holds, the posterior maintains the same structure, ensuring that learning about one mechanism doesn't depend on observations from the other. The additive Gaussian model provides a tractable setting where these independence relationships can be precisely characterized through closed-form posterior updates.

## Foundational Learning
- **Independent Causal Mechanisms (ICM)**: The principle that causal mechanisms should be independent, meaning the conditional distribution of effects given causes should not inform us about the distribution of causes
  - *Why needed*: Provides the theoretical justification for why cause and mechanism parameters should be learned independently
  - *Quick check*: Verify that p(x, ψ) = p(x)p(ψ) in the model specification

- **Bayesian Inference with Factorized Priors**: The property that factorized priors lead to factorized posteriors under certain conditions
  - *Why needed*: Explains why unlabeled cause data doesn't improve mechanism parameter estimation
  - *Quick check*: Confirm that the posterior mean and covariance factorize as shown in equations 9-10

- **Semi-supervised Learning Tradeoffs**: The balance between labeled and unlabeled data in parameter estimation
  - *Why needed*: Contextualizes when and why unlabeled data might or might not help in causal learning
  - *Quick check*: Compare learning curves for supervised vs. semi-supervised settings

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Generation -> Bayesian Inference Engine -> Posterior Analysis -> Learning Curve Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Synthetic data generation (x, η) → Model specification (Gaussian priors) → Posterior computation (closed-form updates) → Evaluation (log-likelihood tracking)

**Design Tradeoffs**: Linear-Gaussian assumptions enable exact inference but limit generalizability; synthetic experiments provide clean validation but may not capture real-world complexities

**Failure Signatures**: Correlated priors leading to slower convergence; incorrect causal direction assumption breaking the independence guarantees; non-Gaussian mechanisms invalidating the closed-form solutions

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify posterior factorization for different correlation values ρ; 2) Compare supervised vs. semi-supervised learning curves; 3) Test sensitivity to prior strength in small-data regimes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Do cause realizations improve causal learning in deep models via representation learning, despite being theoretically irrelevant for parameter estimation?
2. What architectural constraints are necessary in Bayesian deep learning to ensure that factorized priors in latent space result in factorized posteriors over high-dimensional parameters?
3. What is the formal interconnection between the ICM-based factorization results and the parameter independence of Heckerman et al.?

## Limitations
- Analysis restricted to linear-Gaussian additive models, limiting generalizability to non-linear causal mechanisms
- Focus on small-data regimes may not capture practical scenarios where large amounts of unlabeled data provide benefits through representation learning
- Theoretical results assume known causal direction, not addressing causal discovery where graph structure is unknown

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework and mathematical derivations: High
- Synthetic experimental results: Medium
- Generalizability to non-linear/non-Gaussian settings: Low

## Next Checks
1. Extend the analysis to non-linear causal mechanisms (e.g., multiplicative or exponential relationships) to test whether the factorized prior principle holds beyond linear-Gaussian models.

2. Investigate whether the theoretical guarantees extend to causal discovery scenarios where the graph structure is unknown, rather than assuming the correct causal direction is given.

3. Design experiments with real-world datasets to assess whether the theoretical insights about prior factorization translate to practical improvements in causal learning performance when dealing with empirical noise and model misspecification.
