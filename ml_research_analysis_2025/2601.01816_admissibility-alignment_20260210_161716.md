# Admissibility Alignment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01816
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01816
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: MAP-AI reframes AI alignment as distributional control via Monte Carlo evaluation of policy-induced outcomes under uncertainty.

## Executive Summary
Admissibility Alignment reframes AI alignment as a distributional property of decision-making under uncertainty, evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation of policy-induced outcomes rather than static model-level constraints. MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) operationalizes this by treating alignment as the control of admissible action selection across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling world uncertainty, value ambiguity, and governance thresholds. The framework evaluates policies via distributional metrics—expected utility, variance, tail risk, and constraint violation probability—rather than accuracy or ranking performance. In a diagnostic stress test with regime-switching uncertainty, MAP-AI revealed that policies with equivalent expected utility exhibited sharply divergent tail risk and constraint violation profiles, leading to admissibility-based policy selection reversals without modifying model internals. This establishes MAP-AI as a decision-relevant alignment control layer for agentic AI systems, enabling risk-aware governance through Monte Carlo evaluation of distributional outcomes under uncertainty.

## Method Summary
MAP-AI operationalizes alignment as the control of admissible action selection under uncertainty through Monte Carlo evaluation. The method uses a scenario generator G to sample world realizations ω, then runs N rollouts per candidate policy π to estimate distributional metrics including expected utility, variance, CVaR_α, and constraint violation probability. Policies are filtered by governance thresholds (ε, κ) on tail risk and violation probability, with decisions compiled via Proof-Carrying Admissibility Compilation (PCAC) into executable actions with certificates. The framework treats governance thresholds as first-class control parameters, enabling sensitivity analysis without retraining. A diagnostic stress test with regime-switching uncertainty demonstrates that policies with equivalent expected utility can exhibit sharply divergent tail risk profiles, leading to admissibility-based selection reversals.

## Key Results
- Policies with equivalent expected utility can exhibit sharply divergent tail risk and constraint violation profiles under regime-switching uncertainty.
- Admissibility-based policy selection can reverse expected-utility-optimal choices without modifying model internals.
- Governance thresholds directly control the admissible policy set, enabling risk-sensitive policy selection through threshold adjustment.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: If alignment is evaluated via Monte Carlo estimation of policy-induced outcome distributions, then tail risk and constraint violations become observable even when expected utility is equivalent across policies.
- Mechanism: A scenario generator G samples world realizations ω (including regime shifts, adversarial conditions). For each candidate policy π, N rollouts produce trajectories τ~P(τ|π,G). Distributional metrics—expected utility, variance, CVaR_α, and constraint violation probability—are estimated from these rollouts. Policies are filtered by governance thresholds (ε, κ) on tail risk and violation probability, not by expected utility alone.
- Core assumption: The scenario generator captures relevant uncertainty dimensions; rare but consequential events are representable within G's abstraction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MAP-AI revealed that policies with equivalent expected utility exhibited sharply divergent tail risk and constraint violation profiles, leading to admissibility-based policy selection reversals without modifying model internals."
  - [section 6.1] Demonstrates π_a and π_b with near-identical expected utility (8.753 vs 8.874) but constraint violation probabilities differing by ~4× (0.07818 vs 0.02035) and CVaR_0.05 differing by ~10 units.
  - [corpus] Related work on "Uncertainty Quantification and Causal Considerations for Off-Policy Decision Making" addresses OPE limitations but does not provide the admissibility governance layer MAP-AI introduces.
- Break condition: If G fails to include relevant rare regimes or if sampling is insufficient to estimate tail quantiles reliably, admissibility decisions may be based on incomplete tails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: If governance thresholds are treated as first-class control parameters, then admissibility regions change deterministically with threshold adjustments, enabling sensitivity analysis without retraining.
- Mechanism: Governance specification G=(H,S,≺,T) defines hard constraints (e.g., p̂_viol≤ε, CVaR_α≤κ), soft objectives, priority ordering, and tie-breaking. The admissible set A={π(k): ∀h∈H, h(m_k)=1} is computed at decision time. Threshold changes alter A directly.
- Core assumption: Institutional risk tolerance can be encoded as explicit, auditable thresholds rather than implicit optimization objectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "governance thresholds" and "admissibility-based policy selection" are central to the framework.
  - [section 6.2] "small changes in allowable violation probability or CVaR thresholds alter the set of admissible policies without changing the policies themselves."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for governance-threshold-as-control-variable in alignment; related work focuses on optimization rather than evaluation-first governance.
- Break condition: If thresholds are set without calibration to deployment context, admissibility decisions may be overly permissive or overly restrictive without systematic feedback.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: If alignment evaluation is integrated into action selection via a deterministic compiler, then decisions are auditable, replayable, and separable from model optimization.
- Mechanism: Proof-Carrying Admissibility Compilation (PCAC) takes evaluated candidate policies Π, their metric vectors {m_k}, and governance G, then deterministically outputs an action (selected policy, Escalate, or Abort) plus a certificate z encoding constraint satisfaction and comparison trace.
- Core assumption: The decision functional can be made deterministic through canonicalization and tie-breaking rules.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 7.6] PCAC algorithm specified with 6 steps: canonicalization, hard admissibility filter, governance-dominance pruning, deterministic selection, tie-breaking, certificate emission.
  - [abstract] "without modifying model internals" and "decision-relevant alignment control layer."
  - [corpus] "Learning Admissible Heuristics for A*" addresses admissibility in search but not in decision-theoretic alignment governance.
- Break condition: If the candidate policy set Π is incomplete or if metrics are miscalibrated, the compiler will produce deterministically wrong decisions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR_α)**
  - Why needed here: Primary tail-risk metric in MAP-AI; estimates expected loss in the worst α fraction of outcomes.
  - Quick check question: Given 1000 loss samples sorted ascending, how would you compute CVaR_0.05?

- **Concept: Pushforward distribution over trajectories**
  - Why needed here: Core evaluation object P(τ|π,G); alignment is assessed at this level, not at model internals.
  - Quick check question: If a policy π is deterministic but the scenario generator G is stochastic, is P(τ|π,G) deterministic or stochastic?

- **Concept: Stratified sampling and importance sampling for rare-event estimation**
  - Why needed here: Naïve Monte Carlo under-represents tail events; variance reduction techniques are required for reliable tail-risk estimates.
  - Quick check question: Why must importance-sampling-based metrics be reported under a declared evaluation distribution rather than the proposal distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Scenario generator G -> world samples ω -> trajectory rollouts τ_i -> distributional metric estimation -> admissibility filtering -> PCAC compiler -> executable action + certificate

- **Critical path**: Scenario generator specification -> rollout execution -> metric estimation -> admissibility filtering -> PCAC compilation. Errors in G propagate through all downstream components.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Higher N (rollouts) reduces estimator variance but increases latency; N=200,000 used in stress tests.
  - Stricter thresholds (lower ε, κ) reduce tail risk but may eliminate all admissible policies, forcing escalation/abort.
  - Aggressive rare-event amplification improves discovery but requires reweighting for unbiased estimation.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Policy passes expected utility but fails admissibility: Check tail risk and constraint violation metrics.
  - All candidates inadmissible: Escalate or abort; certificate enumerates violated constraints.
  - Confidence intervals overlapping between policies: Increase N or accept decision uncertainty.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate Section 6.1 regime-switching stress test with N=10,000 and N=200,000; observe estimator variance reduction and CI tightening.
  2. Modify governance thresholds (ε, κ) and record changes to admissible set A; verify threshold sensitivity without policy changes.
  3. Implement minimal PCAC for 3-action setting (Act, Escalate, Abort); test decision flip when champion policy becomes inadmissible.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What benchmark tasks and evaluation protocols should define MAPBench to enable standardized comparison of alignment under admissibility constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they "leave as future infrastructure work ('MAPBench')" the construction of "a class of alignment benchmarks defined over admissibility under uncertainty."
- Why unresolved: The paper provides the theoretical framework and a minimal diagnostic stress test, but no standardized benchmark suite exists for comparing policies across domains, uncertainty structures, and governance thresholds.
- What evidence would resolve it: A published benchmark suite with diverse scenario generators, ground-truth constraint specifications, and baseline policy results demonstrating discriminative power between aligned and misaligned policies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can scenario generators be validated or calibrated when ground-truth distributions over rare events are unobservable?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges "results are conditional on the assumed scenario distributions" and requires "calibration targets and procedures, analogous to backtesting in finance," but provides no methodology for validating generators against regimes that rarely or never occur historically.
- Why unresolved: Calibration requires comparing simulated distributions to empirical frequencies, but tail events by definition have insufficient historical data for statistical validation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Domain-specific calibration procedures with quantified calibration error bounds, or theoretical results characterizing worst-case error under generator misspecification.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can evaluator and guardrail mechanisms themselves be distributionally evaluated without circular reliance on fallible evaluators?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.3 states "evaluator error, calibration drift, blind spots, and normative ambiguity are therefore sources of system risk" and that "the effect of evaluators and guardrails be assessed empirically," but the meta-evaluation problem remains unaddressed.
- Why unresolved: Evaluating an evaluator requires a ground-truth signal, which the framework explicitly rejects as unavailable for alignment-relevant outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A meta-evaluation protocol using adversarial red-teaming, counterfactual validation, or multi-evaluator ensemble consistency checks with provable detection guarantees.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What methods enable efficient Monte Carlo estimation of constraint violation probabilities when violations are rare (e.g., p < 10⁻⁵)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges "naïve Monte Carlo sampling under-represents rare but high-impact failures" and supports importance sampling, but notes that "when likelihood ratios are not available, resulting estimates are treated as conservative upper bounds."
- Why unresolved: Standard importance sampling requires knowing likelihood ratios under the proposal distribution, which may be unavailable for complex learned simulators or adversarial scenario generators.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of rare-event estimation techniques (adaptive importance sampling, subset simulation, neural network-based surrogates) on alignment-relevant stress tests with ground-truth violation rates.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness critically depends on the scenario generator's fidelity in representing tail events and regime shifts.
- Governance threshold calibration methodology remains largely unaddressed despite demonstrated sensitivity to threshold changes.
- The computational overhead of Monte Carlo evaluation (N=200,000 rollouts demonstrated) may limit real-time applicability.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mechanism by which distributional metrics (CVaR, violation probability) reveal policy differences invisible to expected utility alone is well-demonstrated through stress test results showing clear admissibility reversals between policies with near-identical expected utility but divergent tail behavior.
- **Medium Confidence**: The governance threshold sensitivity claim is supported by demonstration but lacks systematic calibration methodology. The deterministic compiler architecture appears sound but relies on complete and accurate metric estimation.
- **Low Confidence**: The general applicability to complex, multi-stakeholder alignment problems beyond the controlled regime-switching scenario remains unproven. The framework's behavior under model misspecification or when candidate policy sets are incomplete has not been stress-tested.

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Calibration Validation**: Implement an iterative threshold-setting protocol where initial thresholds are set conservatively, then relaxed until at least one policy becomes admissible. Verify that the selected admissible policy exhibits acceptable tail risk in independent validation rollouts.

2. **Model Misspecification Stress Test**: Modify the scenario generator to exclude the Adverse regime entirely. Evaluate whether the framework correctly identifies that policies previously distinguished by tail risk are now equivalent under expected utility alone, or whether it produces spurious admissibility differences.

3. **Candidate Set Completeness Check**: Implement a simple policy discovery mechanism (e.g., random search or gradient-based policy optimization) to generate a larger candidate pool. Test whether the framework consistently identifies the best policy according to ground-truth metrics, or whether it is sensitive to the initial candidate set composition.
