# Diversity Recommendation via Causal Deconfounding of Co-purchase Relations and Counterfactual Exposure

## Quick Facts

- **Primary result**: Causal deconfounding framework improves recommendation diversity while maintaining accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving recommendation diversity while maintaining accuracy in e-commerce and streaming platforms. Existing methods relying on co-occurrence data suffer from popularity bias and confounding user attributes, leading to homogenized recommendations. The proposed Cadence framework introduces causal deconfounding through Unbiased Asymmetric Co-purchase Relationships (UACR) and counterfactual exposure to identify diverse yet relevant items, achieving significant improvements in diversity metrics without sacrificing accuracy.

## Method Summary
The Cadence framework is built on LightGCN and introduces two key innovations: UACR constructs a deconfounded directed item graph by removing popularity and user attribute biases from co-purchase relationships, and counterfactual exposure simulates interactions with diverse items to identify causally relevant alternatives. The method employs a two-stage candidate selection process that first retrieves relevant items using deconfounded embeddings, then diversifies the top candidates through counterfactual exposure simulation. This approach maintains recommendation accuracy while significantly enhancing diversity across multiple evaluation metrics.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art diversity models across multiple datasets
- Achieves both higher diversity and accuracy metrics simultaneously
- Statistical significance confirmed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
- Demonstrates effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by addressing the fundamental issue of confounding in co-purchase data. Popularity bias and user attribute correlations artificially inflate certain item relationships, leading to homogeneous recommendations. By constructing an unbiased asymmetric co-purchase graph, Cadence removes these confounding factors and reveals the true causal relationships between items. The counterfactual exposure component then simulates what would happen if users were exposed to diverse alternatives, identifying items that are both relevant and distinct from the user's typical consumption pattern.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal deconfounding**: Needed to remove spurious correlations from co-purchase data; check by verifying that popular items no longer dominate relationships
- **Asymmetric relationships**: Required because user-item interactions are inherently directional; check by confirming that the directed graph captures different influence patterns
- **Counterfactual exposure**: Essential for identifying diverse alternatives users haven't encountered; check by measuring diversity gains in top-K recommendations
- **Two-stage candidate selection**: Balances relevance and diversity; check by comparing diversity metrics at different stages of the pipeline
- **LightGCN foundation**: Provides efficient graph neural network architecture; check by benchmarking against alternative GNN backbones
- **Wilcoxon signed-rank tests**: Validates statistical significance of improvements; check by confirming p-values below conventional thresholds

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Interaction Log -> UACR Graph Construction -> LightGCN Embedding -> Counterfactual Exposure -> Candidate Selection -> Diverse Recommendations

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves constructing the unbiased co-purchase graph, generating deconfounded embeddings through LightGCN, applying counterfactual exposure to simulate diverse interactions, and performing two-stage candidate selection to balance relevance and diversity.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades additional computational overhead in the two-stage selection process for improved diversity outcomes. The counterfactual exposure simulation adds complexity but enables identification of items users would engage with if exposed to them, rather than just popular alternatives.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor diversity performance may indicate insufficient diversity in the training data, failure of the deconfounding process, or inadequate counterfactual exposure simulation. Low accuracy could suggest the deconfounding is too aggressive, removing genuine preference signals.

**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study comparing performance with and without UACR component; 2) Baseline comparison against standard LightGCN on diversity metrics; 3) Sensitivity analysis of the counterfactual exposure simulation parameters on diversity-accuracy tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on click logs and rating data assumes these signals adequately represent user preferences
- Two-stage candidate selection introduces computational overhead that could impact scalability
- Counterfactual exposure simulation depends on accurate causal assumptions about exposure mechanisms

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Technical implementation of UACR for deconfounding co-purchase relationships and overall causal framework structure
- **Medium Confidence**: Experimental results showing improved diversity metrics, but long-term effectiveness in dynamic environments remains to be seen
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim of transferability across datasets is supported but based on limited datasets

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of UACR and counterfactual exposure components
2. Test performance on larger-scale industrial datasets with millions of items to evaluate scalability
3. Implement A/B testing in live production environment to validate practical effectiveness on user engagement metrics
