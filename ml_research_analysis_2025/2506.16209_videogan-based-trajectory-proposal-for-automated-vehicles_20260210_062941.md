# VideoGAN-based Trajectory Proposal for Automated Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.16209
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16209
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Combines generative models and spatially-grounded approaches for fast trajectory proposal in automated driving

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a VideoGAN-based trajectory proposal method for automated vehicles that leverages generative adversarial networks trained on bird's-eye view (BEV) occupancy grid videos. The approach rasterizes abstract trajectory data into low-resolution BEV representations, trains a videoGAN model to generate realistic motion patterns, and extracts trajectory data using object detection and matching techniques. The method achieves fast inference times suitable for real-time applications while demonstrating realistic trajectory generation with proper distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic parameters compared to real-world data.

## Method Summary
The proposed method rasterizes abstract trajectory data into low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos, trains a videoGAN model on these videos, and extracts abstract trajectory data using single-frame object detection and frame-to-frame object matching. This approach combines the benefits of generative models with spatially-grounded representations to produce realistic trajectory proposals for automated vehicles. The pipeline demonstrates the ability to capture agent behaviors including interactions with traffic lights, maintaining appropriate inter-agent distances, and realistic speed distributions while achieving inference speeds of 20 ms for generating 15-second scenes.

## Key Results
- Achieves fast inference times of 20 ms for generating 15-second trajectory scenes
- Demonstrates realistic trajectory generation with distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic parameters compared to real data from Waymo Open Motion Dataset
- Successfully captures agent behaviors including traffic light interactions, inter-agent distance maintenance, and realistic speed distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by converting abstract trajectory data into spatially-grounded BEV occupancy grid videos, which provides the videoGAN model with visual context about the driving environment. This representation allows the generative model to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns in traffic behavior while maintaining the ability to generate trajectories that respect the physical constraints of the driving scene. The combination of videoGAN's generative capabilities with the spatial grounding of BEV representations enables the production of realistic trajectories that capture both the statistical properties of real-world motion and the spatial relationships between agents and their environment.

## Foundational Learning

**Bird's-Eye View (BEV) Representation**: A top-down view of the driving environment where vehicles and other objects are represented as occupancy grids. Why needed: Provides spatial context for trajectory generation that aligns with how autonomous vehicles perceive their environment. Quick check: Verify that the BEV resolution preserves sufficient detail for distinguishing different road elements and agent positions.

**VideoGAN Architecture**: A generative adversarial network designed to generate video sequences rather than single images. Why needed: Enables modeling of temporal dynamics and motion patterns in traffic scenarios. Quick check: Confirm that the videoGAN captures temporal dependencies between consecutive frames in generated sequences.

**Object Detection in Occupancy Grids**: Using computer vision techniques to identify and track agents from BEV representations. Why needed: Extracts meaningful trajectory information from the generated occupancy grid videos. Quick check: Validate detection accuracy across different vehicle types and occlusion scenarios.

**Frame-to-Frame Object Matching**: Algorithms that associate detected objects across consecutive frames to form trajectories. Why needed: Reconstructs complete agent trajectories from the generated occupancy grid sequences. Quick check: Assess matching accuracy, particularly for scenarios with multiple similar vehicles.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Trajectory Data -> BEV Rasterization -> VideoGAN Training -> Occupancy Grid Generation -> Object Detection -> Frame-to-Frame Matching -> Output Trajectories

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves the videoGAN inference step, which must generate occupancy grid videos in real-time for the system to be practical for automated driving applications. This step must balance generation quality with computational efficiency.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades spatial resolution for computational efficiency by using low-resolution BEV grids, which may limit the ability to capture fine-grained spatial details but enables faster inference times. The single-frame object detection approach simplifies the pipeline but may accumulate errors over longer sequences.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may produce trajectories that violate physical constraints when the videoGAN generates occupancy patterns that don't correspond to realistic vehicle motions. Object detection failures in the BEV representation can lead to trajectory fragmentation or incorrect agent associations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Generate trajectories for a simple highway scenario and verify that vehicles maintain appropriate lane positions and speeds.
2. Test the system's ability to handle traffic light interactions by generating sequences at controlled intersections.
3. Evaluate the distribution alignment of generated trajectories with real data for key metrics like inter-vehicle distances and speed distributions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on low-resolution BEV occupancy grids may result in information loss, particularly for fine-grained spatial details
- Single-frame object detection and frame-to-frame matching approach could accumulate errors over longer sequences
- Evaluation primarily focuses on distribution alignment rather than absolute trajectory accuracy metrics, making it difficult to assess practical performance in safety-critical scenarios

## Confidence
- **High**: 20 ms inference times for 15-second trajectory generation (explicit timing measurements provided)
- **Medium**: Realistic trajectory generation with distribution alignment (quantitative metrics beyond visual inspection not fully detailed)
- **Medium**: Capturing agent behaviors including traffic light interactions and inter-agent distances (limited quantitative validation of these specific behaviors)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct quantitative evaluation of trajectory prediction accuracy using established metrics (ADE, FDE) on held-out test sequences from the Waymo dataset to complement the distribution alignment analysis.

2. Test the method's robustness across diverse traffic scenarios and environmental conditions not well-represented in the training data, including adverse weather and unusual intersection layouts.

3. Implement ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each model component (videoGAN architecture, BEV representation, trajectory extraction pipeline) to overall performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
