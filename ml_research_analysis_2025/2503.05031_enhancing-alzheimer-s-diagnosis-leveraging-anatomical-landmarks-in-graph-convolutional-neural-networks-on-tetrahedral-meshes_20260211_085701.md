# Enhancing Alzheimer's Diagnosis: Leveraging Anatomical Landmarks in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks on Tetrahedral Meshes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.05031
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05031
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Achieved 91.7% accuracy in AD vs CN classification using LETetCNN on tetrahedral meshes

## Executive Summary
This study introduces LETetCNN, a transformer-based framework for analyzing tetrahedral meshes with varying sizes and topologies in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Unlike previous methods requiring fixed-size re-meshing, LETetCNN dynamically adapts to mesh variability using anatomical landmarks and relative positional encodings. The framework demonstrates superior performance in clinical classification tasks, achieving 91.7% accuracy for AD vs CN, 75.5% for AD vs MCI, and 79.4% for MCI vs CN classification. Additionally, it shows promising results in brain amyloid positivity prediction, reaching 76.5% accuracy and improving to 82.0% when combined with plasma pTau-217 biomarkers.

## Method Summary
LETetCNN addresses the challenge of analyzing tetrahedral meshes with varying sizes and topologies by introducing a transformer-based framework that dynamically adapts to mesh variability. The method leverages anatomical landmarks and relative positional encodings to enable efficient representation learning without requiring fixed-size re-meshing. This approach allows the model to handle the inherent variability in brain mesh structures across different subjects while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework was specifically designed to integrate with clinical workflows, demonstrated by its successful combination with blood-based biomarkers like plasma pTau-217 for enhanced diagnostic accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieved 91.7% accuracy in AD vs CN classification
- Reached 76.5% accuracy for brain amyloid positivity prediction, improving to 82.0% with plasma pTau-217
- Outperformed baseline methods across all classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of LETetCNN stems from its ability to handle the inherent variability in brain tetrahedral meshes without requiring fixed-size re-meshing. By leveraging anatomical landmarks and relative positional encodings, the framework can dynamically adapt to different mesh structures while preserving critical spatial relationships. This approach allows for more accurate representation of brain anatomy compared to methods that force all meshes into a uniform format, which can lead to loss of important structural information.

## Foundational Learning

**Tetrahedral Meshes**: 3D representations of volumetric data using tetrahedrons as basic elements. Needed because brain structures have complex geometries that cannot be accurately captured by simpler representations. Quick check: Verify mesh quality metrics like dihedral angles and volume ratios.

**Anatomical Landmarks**: Predefined reference points in brain anatomy used for spatial registration. Needed to establish consistent spatial relationships across different subjects' brains. Quick check: Confirm landmark detection accuracy and reproducibility across scans.

**Relative Positional Encodings**: Methods to encode spatial relationships between mesh elements relative to each other rather than absolute positions. Needed to handle variability in brain size and orientation across subjects. Quick check: Validate that positional encodings capture meaningful anatomical distances.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Meshes -> Landmark Detection -> Relative Positional Encoding -> Transformer Layers -> Classification Output

**Critical Path**: The landmark detection and positional encoding stages are critical, as errors here propagate through the entire pipeline. The transformer layers process the encoded information to extract disease-relevant features.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Dynamic adaptation vs computational complexity - the framework sacrifices some computational efficiency for the benefit of handling mesh variability without re-meshing.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor landmark detection accuracy would lead to incorrect spatial relationships and degraded classification performance. Inconsistent mesh quality across subjects could also affect results.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test landmark detection accuracy on a subset of brain scans
2. Validate relative positional encoding preserves anatomical distances
3. Compare classification performance with and without landmark-based adaptation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Generalizability to other neurological conditions beyond AD remains unproven
- Performance may vary depending on landmark detection accuracy, which was not fully explored
- Computational efficiency for large-scale clinical deployment has not been established

## Confidence
- High: Classification accuracies (91.7% AD vs CN, 75.5% AD vs MCI, 79.4% MCI vs CN)
- High: Integration with plasma pTau-217 for amyloid positivity prediction (76.5% accuracy, 82.0% combined)
- Medium: Robustness and generalizability claims due to limited cross-dataset testing

## Next Checks
1. Test LETetCNN on multi-site MRI datasets to assess robustness to scanner variability and acquisition protocols
2. Evaluate the framework's performance on other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's or frontotemporal dementia) to determine generalizability
3. Compare LETetCNN's computational efficiency and scalability against other state-of-the-art mesh-based methods in clinical settings
