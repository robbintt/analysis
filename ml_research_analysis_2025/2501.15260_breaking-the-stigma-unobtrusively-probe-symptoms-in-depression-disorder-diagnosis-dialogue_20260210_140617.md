- Key result: UPSD4 significantly outperforms baselines in both unobtrusiveness and diagnostic accuracy for stigma-aware depression diagnosis

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces UPSD4, a novel approach to address stigma in depression diagnosis by unobtrusively probing symptoms during dialogue. Unlike existing systems that directly ask sensitive questions, UPSD4 employs two interconnected modules: an Unobtrusive Probing Module (UPM) that uses psychological questioning strategies to gather information subtly, and a Conversational Diagnosis Module (CDM) that evaluates symptoms using diagnostic criteria. Evaluated on a depression diagnosis dialogue dataset with stigma-aware user simulators, UPSD4 significantly outperforms baselines in both unobtrusiveness and diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating strong potential for stigma-free, user-centric depression diagnosis.

## Method Summary
UPSD4 employs a two-module architecture for depression diagnosis dialogue. The Unobtrusive Probing Module (UPM) selects psychological questioning strategies through a two-stage process (coarse strategy selection followed by fine-grained strategy selection) to generate responses that probe for symptoms without appearing direct or stigmatizing. The Conversational Diagnosis Module (CDM) maintains a slot-filling state tracker based on ICD-11 depression criteria, updating symptom assessments as the conversation progresses and determining when sufficient information exists for diagnosis. The system adapts its probing strategy based on user stigma levels, using more indirect questioning approaches for users with higher stigma.

## Key Results
- UPSD4 achieves 3.40 average unobtrusiveness score vs 2.81 for baselines across Discreetness, Empathy, Coherence, and Fluency metrics
- Diagnostic accuracy reaches 30.30% for stigma users vs 21.97% for baselines
- Strategy distribution adapts to stigma levels, with Questioning Skill strategies (Loading Questions, Nominative Technique, Forgiving Questions) increasing from 52.69% to 71.67% when user stigma is present

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Explicit psychological questioning strategies reduce perceived stigma and increase symptom disclosure in users with stigma beliefs.
- Mechanism: The Unobtrusive Probing Module (UPM) applies strategies like Nominative Technique (referencing others' experiences first) and Forgiving Questions (non-judgmental language) to create psychological distance between the user and sensitive topics. This lowers defensive responses and increases willingness to disclose.
- Core assumption: Users with stigma beliefs will share more when questions imply the experience is common or normalized, rather than directly personal.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "UPM uses psychological questioning strategies (e.g., loading questions, nominative technique, forgiveness) to gather information subtly"; [section 4.1] "Nominative Technique eases the user into potentially sensitive topics by first discussing the experiences of others... reducing the reluctance of the user"
- Break condition: If users interpret indirect questioning as manipulative or evasive, trust may decrease rather than increase.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-stage strategy selection improves LLM decision-making under multiple strategy options.
- Mechanism: LLMs struggle with large candidate sets. UPSD4 first selects a coarse-grained category (Discreet Probing, Empathy, or Flow Management), then a fine-grained strategy within that category. This hierarchical decomposition reduces choice overload.
- Core assumption: The LLM can reliably distinguish which high-level intent is appropriate before selecting specific phrasing.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.1] "Due to the limited capacity of LLMs to handle too many choices simultaneously, the strategy selection is divided into two stages"; [section 5.2] UPSD4 outperforms UPSD4 w/o strat across all metrics
- Break condition: If the coarse-grained selection is wrong, the fine-grained choice will also be inappropriate regardless of its quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Slot-filling over ICD-11 criteria provides structured diagnostic tracking that improves completeness and accuracy.
- Mechanism: The Conversational Diagnosis Module (CDM) maintains 9 slots corresponding to ICD-11 depression criteria. Each turn updates slot values based on user responses. This explicit state tracking ensures all criteria are assessed before diagnosis.
- Core assumption: Users will provide enough information across turns to fill all slots, even with unobtrusive probing.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.2] "CDM utilizes a slot-filling mechanism, with each slot being a diagnostic criterion"; [table 2] Diagnosis Rate improves from 38.64% to 59.85% for stigma users
- Break condition: If users refuse to discuss certain symptoms, slots remain unfilled and diagnosis cannot complete.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) with Slot-Filling
  - Why needed here: Understanding how dialogue systems track information state across turns is essential for grasping CDM's diagnostic tracking mechanism.
  - Quick check question: Given a conversation where the user mentions sleep problems but not appetite changes, which slots would be updated?

- Concept: Psychological Questioning Techniques (Loading Questions, Nominative Technique)
  - Why needed here: These form the core of UPM's strategy set; understanding their theoretical basis helps evaluate when and why they work.
  - Quick check question: How does a Nominative Technique question differ from a direct question in terms of psychological distance?

- Concept: ICD-11 Depression Diagnostic Criteria
  - Why needed here: The 9 slots map directly to clinical criteria; familiarity with these determines whether the system's assessment logic makes clinical sense.
  - Quick check question: Which ICD-11 symptoms must be present for a depression diagnosis, and which are supporting but not required?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User Utterance -> CDM (Slot-filling) -> CDM (Criterion Selection) -> UPM (Coarse Strategy Selection) -> UPM (Fine Strategy Selection) -> Response Generation

- Critical path: 1. User utterance arrives; 2. CDM updates slot values based on new information; 3. CDM selects next criterion to probe (or triggers diagnosis if complete); 4. UPM performs two-stage strategy selection; 5. UPM generates response using selected strategy and target criterion

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using GPT-4 for both modules (train-free) vs. fine-tuned models: Paper chose train-free for flexibility; tradeoff is latency and cost
  - Fixed 9-slot design vs. dynamic criteria: Paper uses fixed ICD-11 slots; limits adaptability to other disorders
  - User simulators vs. real patients: Ethical choice; tradeoff is ecological validity

- Failure signatures:
  - Low Diagnosis Rate with high Accuracy: System cannot complete assessment (users refusing or slots not filling)
  - High Empathy but Low Discreetness scores: System providing emotional support but still asking directly
  - Strategy distribution stuck on one type: Hierarchical selection may be failing at coarse stage

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run UPSD4 against Non-Stigma and With-Stigma simulators separately; compare strategy distributions to verify adaptive behavior
  2. Ablate individual fine-grained strategies (e.g., remove Nominative Technique) to measure impact on Discreetness scores and Diagnosis Rate
  3. Test on held-out user profiles with varying stigma profiles to assess generalization beyond the 10 constructed stigma types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Dynamic Personalization**: Can unobtrusive probing strategies be dynamically personalized to optimize diagnosis for specific demographic groups or cultural contexts?
- **Generalization**: Does UPSD4 maintain its superior diagnostic accuracy when applied to other depression dialogue datasets or clinical contexts beyond the D4 benchmark?
- **Real-world Translation**: How does the performance of UPSD4 translate to interactions with real human patients compared to the LLM-based user simulators used in this study?

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on simulated users rather than real patients, limiting ecological validity
- Psychological questioning strategies are implemented through LLM prompting without validation of their real-world stigma reduction effectiveness
- The adaptive strategy selection mechanism for detecting and adapting to stigma is not fully specified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The architectural framework of separating unobtrusive probing from diagnostic assessment is sound and the slot-filling mechanism for ICD-11 criteria is well-defined
- **Medium confidence**: The empirical results showing UPSD4 outperforming baselines are convincing, but the simulation-based evaluation limits generalizability
- **Low confidence**: The psychological effectiveness of specific questioning strategies and the real-world impact on stigma reduction need clinical validation

## Next Checks

1. Validate strategy effectiveness by testing the same questioning strategies with actual users (with and without stigma) to measure disclosure rates and perceived stigma, not just simulator responses
2. Conduct A/B testing comparing UPSD4's strategy selection against expert human diagnosticians in real depression diagnosis dialogues to assess clinical equivalence
3. Test the system's robustness across different cultural contexts and languages to verify that unobtrusiveness translates beyond the Chinese dataset used
