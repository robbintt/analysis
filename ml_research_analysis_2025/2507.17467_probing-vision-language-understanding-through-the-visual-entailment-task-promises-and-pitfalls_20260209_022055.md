# Probing Vision-Language Understanding through the Visual Entailment Task: promises and pitfalls

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17467
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17467
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Llama 3.2 Vision fine-tuning improves VE accuracy from 41% to 83.3%, outperforming OFA-X, but shows prompt sensitivity and hallucination tendencies.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates whether the Visual Entailment (VE) task effectively probes vision-language understanding in multimodal models, using Llama 3.2 Vision 11B as a case study. The authors examine zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned performance on e-SNLI-VE, revealing that while fine-tuning yields strong accuracy (83.3%), the model is highly sensitive to prompt structure and prone to hallucination when visual input is absent. Explanations generated by the fine-tuned model are semantically similar to human references, but the findings raise concerns about whether VE truly measures multimodal reasoning or exploits linguistic priors and dataset shortcuts.

## Method Summary
The study uses Llama 3.2 Vision 11B with QLoRA fine-tuning (rank=8, alpha=16) on e-SNLI-VE (401,717 training samples). Zero-shot and few-shot (1-6 shots) inference are tested with controlled prompt variations. Explanations are evaluated using BERTScore F1 against human references. Fine-tuning runs for 1 epoch with AdamW 8-bit optimizer, batch size 2, and gradient accumulation 4.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot accuracy: ~41%, improves to ~49% with three-shot inference
- Fine-tuned accuracy: 83.3%, outperforming state-of-the-art OFA-X model
- Explanations: BERTScore F1 89.2% vs human references
- Prompt sensitivity: Accuracy varies significantly based on label order in prompts
- Hallucination: Model generates specific visual descriptions for black images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fine-tuning Alignment via Dataset-Specific Heuristics
Fine-tuning enables the model to learn decision boundaries or shortcuts present in e-SNLI-VE, improving performance from ~41% to 83.3%. This likely reflects task alignment and exploitation of dataset artifacts rather than general multimodal reasoning.

### Mechanism 2: In-Context Priming and Order Sensitivity
Few-shot inference improves performance modestly by priming the model, but is highly unstable due to order sensitivity. The attention mechanism attends to the immediately preceding context, biasing predictions toward classes that appear prominent in the prompt.

### Mechanism 3: Linguistic Prior Override (Hallucination)
The model generates explanations and predictions based on strong linguistic priors, effectively "imagining" visual evidence when actual visual input is missing. The vision adapter's signal is often treated as secondary context by the LLM backbone.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Visual Entailment (VE)
  - **Why needed here:** Core probe used in the paper; understanding VE extends Textual Entailment to Image-Text pairs is essential for interpreting results.
  - **Quick check question:** Given an image of a dog sleeping and the hypothesis "The dog is running," should the correct label be Contradiction or Neutral?

- **Concept:** Shortcut Learning (Spurious Correlations)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper argues high accuracy might be due to "shortcut learning" rather than true understanding.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model predicts "Entailment" solely because the hypothesis contains positive sentiment words, is it performing visual reasoning?

- **Concept:** Hallucination in Multimodal Models
  - **Why needed here:** Primary finding is that the model fabricates visual evidence.
  - **Quick check question:** If a model describes a "red car" in an image that is entirely black, what mechanism has failed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Llama 3.1 8B (Text LLM) -> Vision Adapter (trained separately, 6B image-text pairs) -> Visual features projected and injected into LLM context
- **Critical path:** Input: Image + Hypothesis Text -> Vision Encoding: Image processed by vision adapter -> Fusion: Visual tokens injected into text stream -> Generation: Model generates Label and Explanation based on fused context
- **Design tradeoffs:** Zero-shot vs. Fine-tuning (tests pre-trained knowledge vs. task-specific fitting, but risks overfitting); Prompt Stability (highly sensitive to formatting vs. flexibility of natural language interfaces)
- **Failure signatures:** Visual Hallucination (confidently stating "The image shows X" when input is black/unrelated); Label Bias (accuracy varying from 41% to 49% based on prompt label order); Explanation-Label Mismatch (explanation supports Class A but model outputs Class B)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Zero-Shot Baseline with Perturbation (re-run with permuted label order to quantify sensitivity); 2) Visual Ablation (Blind Test) (replace input images with black images to measure hallucination); 3) Few-Shot Order Sensitivity (test 3-shot with different first examples to confirm primacy bias)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What specific heuristics or dataset shortcuts does the model acquire during fine-tuning to explain the substantial performance gap over zero-shot inference?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state that "future work is necessary to further explore what causes the substantial difference in performance between zero-shot and fine-tuned settings and what kind of heuristics the model may be learning."
- **Why unresolved:** The study identifies a large accuracy jump (approx. 41% to 83.3%) but does not analyze the internal mechanism or data artifacts that facilitate this rapid adaptation.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mitigate the tendency to hallucinate visual evidence when visual input is absent or limited?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper suggests "integrating Chain-of-Thought prompting" as a promising direction to better use coherent explanations in predictions.
- **Why unresolved:** The authors observed that the model generates logically coherent but hallucinated explanations without visual input, but they did not test if reasoning steps improve grounding.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** At what specific point does increasing the number of in-context examples become disadvantageous due to noise or order sensitivity?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors call for "understanding the threshold beyond which providing more examples becomes disadvantageous" after finding six-shot performed worse than three-shot.
- **Why unresolved:** The experiments showed performance degradation from three-shot to six-shot, but the exact "tipping point" and the cause (noise vs. context-window issues) remain unidentified.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies solely on e-SNLI-VE dataset, which may contain biases the model exploits
- No out-of-distribution testing to determine if fine-tuning leads to overfitting
- Hallucination experiments use extreme black image case; behavior with ambiguous images unexplored
- Explanation quality assessed via BERTScore, measuring textual similarity but not factual alignment with visual input

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Quantitative results showing prompt sensitivity and hallucination tendencies are directly reproducible and well-supported
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that fine-tuning exploits dataset shortcuts rather than improving general reasoning is plausible but needs out-of-distribution testing
- **Medium Confidence:** Explanation quality assessment (BERTScore F1 of 89.2%) indicates textual similarity but doesn't establish semantic grounding

## Next Checks
1. **Out-of-Distribution Evaluation:** Test the fine-tuned model on a different VE dataset or modified e-SNLI-VE with adversarial examples to determine if performance degrades when linguistic priors are insufficient.

2. **Visual Grounding Ablation Study:** Systematically replace input images with varying levels of visual information (black images, blurred images, cropped regions) and measure correlation between visual quality and explanation hallucination rates.

3. **Cross-Modal Consistency Test:** For each test sample, swap the image with a semantically unrelated image while keeping the hypothesis constant, then measure changes in prediction and explanation to assess genuine visual reasoning.
