# DOS: Distilling Observable Softmaps of Zipfian Prototypes for Self-Supervised Point Representation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11465
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11465
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Achieves SOTA self-supervised 3D point cloud learning, reaching 95% of supervised performance under linear probing

## Executive Summary
DOS introduces a novel self-supervised learning framework for 3D point clouds that addresses key limitations in existing masked autoencoding approaches. The method combines observable self-distillation, semantic softmaps, and Zipf-Sinkhorn regularization to achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks. By supervising only visible points, DOS prevents positional leakage from masked regions, while spatial softmaps encourage richer semantic learning through inter-point competition. The Zipf-Sinkhorn regularization enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage, improving performance on imbalanced semantics.

## Method Summary
DOS builds on the DINO-style self-distillation framework, processing point clouds through two parallel views with random cropping, duplication, and augmentation. The key innovation is observable self-distillation, where the student network receives only visible points while the teacher processes the full point cloud, with gradients flowing only through observable locations. Spatial softmaps normalize prototype activations across points rather than prototypes, creating inter-point competition. Zipf-Sinkhorn regularization replaces uniform prototype balancing with a power-law prior that better matches real-world semantic distributions.

## Key Results
- Achieves 69.3 mIoU on nuScenes under linear probing, compared to 54.7 with naive masked distillation
- Reaches 72.3 mIoU on nuScenes with softmaps versus 69.3 with standard clustering
- Attains 95% of supervised performance on nuScenes under linear probing
- Improves tail-class performance on ScanNet200 from 10.6 to 13.2 mIoU with optimal Zipf parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Observable Self-Distillation Prevents Positional Leakage
The student receives only visible points while the teacher processes the full point cloud, with gradients flowing only through observable locations. This forces the student to reason about missing regions from geometry alone rather than positional cues, eliminating shortcut learning that occurs when position embeddings leak information about masked regions.

### Mechanism 2: Spatial Softmap Normalization Enables Inter-Point Competition
Standard clustering normalizes over prototypes per point, while softmaps normalize over points per prototype. This treats points as soft positives/negatives for each prototype, creating competition where each prototype must "explain" the scene spatially, yielding richer gradients and more semantically structured representations.

### Mechanism 3: Zipf-Sinkhorn Aligns Prototype Usage with Real-World Semantic Frequencies
Standard Sinkhorn-Knopp enforces uniform prototype balancing, which tends to over-segment frequent structures and assign prototypes based on low-level cues like distance. Zipf-Sinkhorn replaces this with a power-law prior where frequent prototypes activate broadly while rare prototypes remain sharp and selective, better matching real-world semantic distributions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Student-Teacher Self-Distillation with EMA**: Why needed? DOS builds on DINO framework where teacher provides stable targets. Quick check: Can you explain why EMA-updated teachers provide more stable supervision than using the student's own past checkpoints directly?

- **Optimal Transport / Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm**: Why needed? Zipf-Sinkhorn modifies Sinkhorn to enforce non-uniform marginal distribution over prototypes. Quick check: Given a similarity matrix F ∈ ℝᴺ × ᴷ, what constraints does Sinkhorn-Knopp enforce, and how does changing the column marginal from uniform to Zipfian affect the assignment?

- **Masked Autoencoding for Point Clouds**: Why needed? DOS inherits masked modeling paradigm but inverts supervision from reconstruction to distillation, and from masked to observable regions. Quick check: What specific information leakage pathways exist in masked point cloud reconstruction that don't exist in 2D image MAE?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Point Cloud P → Random Crop & Duplicate → P^(1), P^(2) → Augmentations (spatial + photometric) → Per-view Masking → P_v^(a) (visible subset) → Student Encoder (masked input) → Similarity to Q → S_S (student softmaps) → Teacher Encoder (full input, EMA of student) → Similarity to Q → S_T (teacher softmaps) → Zipf-Sinkhorn → S̃_T (regularized) → KL Divergence: L_σ = (1/K) Σ_k KL(S̃_T(:,k) || S_S(:,k))

- **Critical path**: Implement masking that produces strict index subsets (no positional token leakage) → Implement cross-point softmax normalization (NOT cross-prototype) → Implement Zipf-Sinkhorn (Algorithm 1) with configurable α → Ensure teacher processes FULL point cloud while student receives ONLY visible subset

- **Design tradeoffs**: Masking ratio: 70% for segmentation, 60% for detection; Prototype count: 1024 works well; Zipf exponent α: 1.3–1.6 optimal; Cross-view supervision: Most beneficial for dense indoor clouds (ScanNet); minimal impact on sparse outdoor (nuScenes/Waymo)

- **Failure signatures**: Prototype collapse (multiple prototypes activate identically) → check activation diversity metrics; Point-wise collapse (large scene regions unrepresented) → visualize prototype activation maps; Over-segmentation of frequent classes → verify Zipf-Sinkhorn is applied correctly; Training instability with high α → reduce α or add gradient clipping

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline sanity check: Train DOS without Zipf-Sinkhorn (α=0) and verify softmaps outperform clustering on a held-out validation set (expect ~3 mIoU gap per Table 5). 2) Observable vs. masked supervision: Compare naive masked distillation, token jitter, and observable-only. Expect large gap (+14 mIoU) confirming leakage elimination. 3) Zipf exponent sweep: Run α ∈ {0.0, 0.6, 1.3, 1.6, 2.0} on ScanNet200 and analyze head/common/tail breakdown to confirm tail-class gains without head-class degradation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can a single pretraining framework be designed to effectively unify indoor and outdoor 3D domains, which currently require separate handling due to structural differences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the "Limitations and Future Work" section: "unifying them within a single pretraining framework remains a promising direction."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation trains separate models for indoor (ScanNet) and outdoor (nuScenes/Waymo) benchmarks, likely due to significant differences in point density, sensor modalities, and required voxel resolutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A single set of pretrained weights that achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on both indoor (e.g., ScanNet) and outdoor (e.g., nuScenes) benchmarks simultaneously without domain-specific fine-tuning of the backbone.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific mechanisms are required for self-supervised learning (SSL) to strictly surpass supervised pretraining in linear probing evaluations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The "Limitations and Future Work" section notes: "although DOS closely approaches supervised performance under LP, surpassing this baseline is a challenge for future research."
- Why unresolved: While DOS matches or beats supervised performance under full fine-tuning, it only reaches approximately 95% of supervised performance in linear probing, suggesting the frozen features still lack some of the discriminative semantic separability learned from explicit labels.
- What evidence would resolve it: An SSL method that consistently yields higher linear probing accuracy (e.g., mIoU) than a supervised baseline trained on the same dataset without using labels during pretraining.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does cross-view supervision significantly improve performance on dense indoor datasets (ScanNet) but provide negligible or slightly negative gains on sparse outdoor datasets (nuScenes, Waymo)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 11 shows removing cross-view supervision causes a large drop on ScanNet but slightly improves or maintains performance on nuScenes/Waymo. The authors hypothesize this is due to point cloud density supporting spatial alignment, but do not verify the cause.
- Why unresolved: The paper observes this counter-intuitive dataset dependency but leaves the underlying cause—whether sensor sparsity, object scale, or augmentation specifics—as an open investigation.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study that varies point cloud density and overlap ratios synthetically to isolate the specific factor causing cross-view alignment to fail or succeed in outdoor scenes.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the Zipf exponent α be adapted dynamically during training to better accommodate datasets with varying semantic granularity or unknown frequency distributions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 8 shows the optimal α varies between datasets (1.3 for ScanNet vs. 1.6 for ScanNet200), and the paper notes that high values can cause instability while low values enforce uniformity.
- Why unresolved: The current method relies on a fixed hyperparameter α defined at initialization, requiring manual tuning to align the prototype prior with the specific long-tail distribution of the target dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that estimates or updates the power-law prior online during training, achieving robust performance across both coarse (20 classes) and fine-grained (200 classes) semantic distributions without manual tuning.

## Limitations

- **Dataset Generalization Gap**: Zipf-Sinkhorn mechanism's effectiveness on truly open-world or non-urban datasets remains untested, as the power-law prior may not hold for specialized domains like medical scans or industrial inspection.

- **Ablation Completeness**: The paper lacks ablation studies isolating interaction effects between observable self-distillation and Zipf-Sinkhorn, making it unclear whether Zipf provides independent benefit beyond observable-only supervision.

- **Computational Overhead**: Zipf-Sinkhorn introduces iterative normalization that adds training overhead, but the paper doesn't quantify this cost relative to accuracy gains, which becomes critical for edge deployment.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Observable self-distillation mechanism and positional leakage prevention (up to 14 mIoU improvement), spatial softmap normalization framework, and overall SOTA performance claims across benchmark datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: Zipf-Sinkhorn regularization mechanism's general applicability beyond tested datasets, and claim that it specifically improves long-tail semantic handling without degrading head class performance.

**Low Confidence**: Mechanism by which observable-only supervision prevents shortcut learning is primarily inferred from performance gaps rather than direct visualization of what the student learns versus what leaks through positional embeddings.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Zipf Validation**: Test DOS with α=1.3 on a non-urban dataset (e.g., medical 3D volumes or indoor retail scenes) and analyze whether the power-law prior still improves tail-class performance or if uniform balancing performs better.

2. **Positional Leakage Visualization**: Generate activation maps comparing student representations trained with naive masked distillation, observable-only distillation, and token jitter. Visualize whether observable-only supervision actually learns to reconstruct masked regions from geometry alone.

3. **Component Interaction Ablation**: Train variants combining observable-only + softmaps without Zipf, observable-only + Zipf without softmaps, and full DOS. Quantify whether Zipf provides independent benefit beyond observable-only supervision alone.
