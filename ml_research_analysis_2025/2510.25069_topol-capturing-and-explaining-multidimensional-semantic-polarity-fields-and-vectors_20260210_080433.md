# TOPol: Capturing and Explaining Multidimensional Semantic Polarity Fields and Vectors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25069
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Models semantic polarity as multidimensional vector fields using transformer embeddings, UMAP dimensionality reduction, and LLM-based explainability, detecting topic-level semantic shifts across contextual boundaries with statistical significance (p < 0.001).

## Executive Summary
TOPol addresses the limitation of traditional sentiment analysis by modeling semantic polarity as multidimensional vector fields rather than unidimensional scales. The framework uses transformer embeddings, UMAP dimensionality reduction, and Leiden clustering to detect topic-level semantic shifts across human-on-the-loop defined contextual boundaries. Polarity vectors are computed between regime-specific centroids and interpreted via LLM-based contrastive explainability. Experiments on U.S. central bank speeches and Amazon reviews show that TOPol reliably detects non-affective and affective polarity shifts, with statistical significance (p < 0.001) against random boundaries. Cosine similarity analysis reveals domain-specific structures: 0.66 for sentiment-dominant reviews versus 0.12 for multidimensional policy discourse.

## Method Summary
TOPol embeds documents using a transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, and clusters documents into topics via the Leiden algorithm. Contextual boundaries (CBs) partition documents into regimes A and B, and for each topic cluster, centroids are computed separately for each regime. Directional vectors between corresponding topic-boundary centroids form a polarity field, capturing semantic shifts. These vectors are interpreted using a generative LLM that contrasts extreme points to produce contrastive labels, coverage estimates, and exemplar sentences.

## Key Results
- Statistically significant detection of semantic polarity shifts (p < 0.001) against random boundary baselines
- Domain-specific cosine similarity structures: 0.66 for sentiment-dominant Amazon reviews versus 0.12 for multidimensional central bank speeches
- Robustness under embedding and clustering perturbations, with contextual boundary definition being the primary driver of variation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transformer embeddings preserve semantic structure sufficient for topic-level discourse analysis.
- Mechanism: General-purpose tLLM embeddings encode contextual semantic information in high-dimensional space; UMAP projects these to a lower-dimensional manifold preserving local topological relationships, enabling semantically similar documents to cluster together.
- Core assumption: The embedding model captures domain-relevant semantic distinctions even for specialized corpora (e.g., central bank speeches) without fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "embeds documents using a transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP projection"
  - [section: Methodology] "semantically similar documents are located near to each other, preserving discourse topology"
  - [corpus] Weak—no corpus papers directly validate tLLM-to-UMAP transfer for polarity tasks; related work on semantic fusion (arXiv:2509.13357) offers indirect support
- Break condition: Domain-specific jargon or temporal concept drift that lies outside the embedding model's training distribution; UMAP parameter misconfiguration destroying local structure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Centroid displacement vectors capture topic-specific semantic polarity across contextual boundaries.
- Mechanism: For each Leiden-detected topic cluster T_i, compute centroids μ_A and μ_B for documents in regimes A and B respectively; the polarity vector v_i = μ_B - μ_A encodes semantic displacement magnitude and direction.
- Core assumption: Topics persist across regimes (same cluster can be partitioned into A/B); centroid movement reflects aggregate semantic shift rather than noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "computes directional vectors between corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field"
  - [section: Preliminary] Definition 4 formalizes polarity vector as v_i = μ_B - μ_A
  - [corpus] No direct validation; multidimensional uncertainty quantification work (arXiv:2509.22380) suggests complementary approaches to vector-based analysis
- Break condition: Unbalanced topic clusters (one regime dominates); topic dropout (cluster absent in one regime); small cluster sizes making centroids unstable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLM-based contrastive explainability recovers interpretable polarity dimension labels.
- Mechanism: Extract document neighborhoods N_A and N_B nearest to centroids; prompt generative LLM (gemini-2.5-flash) to identify semantic distinctions, outputting pole labels, coverage estimates, and exemplar sentences.
- Core assumption: The generative LLM can reliably abstract semantic patterns from document sets; coverage estimates correlate with actual prevalence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with estimated coverage"
  - [section: Revealing TOPol Dimensions] "ratio of supporting to contradicting sentences served as a proxy for interpretability reliability"
  - [corpus] Weak—Khmer polarity classification paper (arXiv:2511.09313) addresses explainability but in a different language/context
- Break condition: LLM hallucination; inconsistent outputs across runs; documents too short or sparse to yield coherent patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Manifold Learning (UMAP)**
  - Why needed here: TOPol relies on UMAP to reduce high-dimensional embeddings while preserving local neighborhood structure; misconfiguring n_neighbors or n_components can destroy the topology needed for clustering.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why UMAP preserves local structure better than PCA for non-linear semantic relationships?

- Concept: **Community Detection (Leiden Algorithm)**
  - Why needed here: TOPol uses Leiden (not Louvain) to partition the document graph into well-connected topic clusters; understanding resolution parameter effects is critical for robustness checks.
  - Quick check question: What does the Leiden resolution parameter control, and how does lowering it from 1.5 to 1.0 affect cluster granularity?

- Concept: **Vector Space Operations (Centroid Drift)**
  - Why needed here: The core polarity computation is vector subtraction between regime-specific centroids; interpreting magnitude and cosine similarity requires fluency in vector space geometry.
  - Quick check question: If average pairwise cosine similarity among polarity vectors is 0.12 (speeches) vs 0.66 (reviews), what does this imply about the dimensionality of semantic change in each corpus?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Documents → tLLM Embedding → UMAP Projection → Leiden Clustering → Contextual Boundary (HoTL-defined) → Topic-Level Centroid Computation (μ_A, μ_B) → Polarity Vectors (v_i = μ_B - μ_A) → Generative LLM Contrastive Explainability

- Critical path: Contextual boundary definition is the primary driver of output variation (robustness checks show embedding/clustering perturbations have marginal effects); HoTL boundary selection determines what semantic shifts are detectable.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher UMAP dimensionality (d=75 vs d=50): more semantic variance captured but risk of noise
  - Larger UMAP neighborhood (k=150 vs k=100): smoother topology but blurs fine boundaries
  - Lower Leiden resolution (r=1.0 vs r=1.5): coarser clusters, potentially obscuring localized polarity shifts

- Failure signatures:
  - Low average drift magnitude (¯m) with high variance: CB may not correspond to meaningful regime shift
  - Negative or near-zero cosine similarity across all topics: multi-dimensional incoherent shift or poor CB definition
  - Excessive topic dropout: clusters unbalanced across regimes, yielding unusable polarity vectors
  - LLM returning empty responses: insufficient signal in document neighborhoods

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Random CB baseline**: Permute regime labels and compute polarity field; verify HoTL-defined CB yields statistically significant drift magnitude (p < 0.001 per paper); establish that observed shifts are non-random.
  2. **Domain contrast test**: Apply TOPol to sentiment-rich (reviews) vs sentiment-sparse (speeches) corpora; verify cosine similarity differs (0.66 vs 0.12) confirming domain-specific polarity structures.
  3. **Resolution sensitivity**: Run Leiden at r=1.5 and r=1.0; confirm drift magnitude and cosine similarity degrade at lower resolution but TOPol still distinguishes real vs random CBs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can TOPol be extended to support sequential or parallel contextual boundaries for multi-point temporal analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that "future extensions will explore sequential or parallel contextual boundaries, enabling multi-point temporal analysis or multidimensional polarity fields over 2D discourse partitions."
- Why unresolved: The current framework is demonstrated primarily on binary regime comparisons (A vs. B) and does not handle continuous time-series or multidimensional partitioning natively.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified TOPol pipeline applied to a longitudinal dataset with multiple time steps, successfully reconstructing a trajectory of semantic shifts rather than a single displacement vector.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the contrastive explainability layer be modified to ensure reproducibility despite the non-deterministic nature of Large Language Models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies "the non-deterministic nature of LLMs" as a limitation that "makes this part of the framework difficult to reproduce," noting that future work will address this.
- Why unresolved: Generating contrastive labels relies on generative models (e.g., Gemini), which produce variable outputs, undermining the stability of the interpretation phase.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of constrained decoding or temperature settings that yield identical polarity labels and coverage estimates across multiple identical runs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework be adapted to include topic clusters that are unbalanced or entirely absent in one of the discourse regimes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes the limitation that "exclusion of topic clusters that are unbalanced or entirely absent from one regime... may lead to underutilized polarity vectors or topic-level dropout."
- Why unresolved: The current centroid calculation method requires document presence in both regimes to compute a vector displacement.
- What evidence would resolve it: A methodology update that successfully computes semantic shifts for emerging or disappearing topics without relying solely on direct centroid subtraction.

## Limitations
- Reliance on human-on-the-loop defined contextual boundaries introduces subjectivity and potential bias
- Unbalanced or regime-absent topic clusters yield unusable polarity vectors without remediation strategy
- LLM-based explainability component lacks robustness validation and consistent outputs across runs

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The vector field computation mechanism (centroid displacement) and its statistical validation against random boundaries are methodologically sound and well-supported.
- **Medium confidence**: The UMAP + Leiden clustering pipeline for topic detection is standard practice, though parameter sensitivity is noted but not fully explored.
- **Low confidence**: The LLM-based contrastive explainability layer—both its prompt engineering and reliability metrics—requires further empirical validation given the weak corpus support.

## Next Checks
1. **Multi-run consistency test**: Execute the LLM explainability step 10 times with identical inputs; measure label consistency and coverage estimate stability to quantify hallucination risk.
2. **Boundary perturbation sensitivity**: Systematically shift HoTL-defined CBs by ±6 months (speeches) and ±1 rating bin (reviews); measure degradation in drift magnitude and cosine similarity to establish robustness.
3. **Embedding model ablation**: Replace `text-embedding-3-small` with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and re-run TOPol on both corpora; compare polarity field coherence and LLM explainability quality to assess embedding model dependency.
