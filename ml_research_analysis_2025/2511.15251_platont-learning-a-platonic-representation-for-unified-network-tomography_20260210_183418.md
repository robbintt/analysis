# PLATONT: Learning a Platonic Representation for Unified Network Tomography

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.15251
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15251

- Primary result: Unified framework using contrastive learning and denoising reconstruction outperforms baselines on network tomography tasks across synthetic and real-world topologies

## Executive Summary
PLATONT introduces a unified framework for network tomography by modeling diverse network indicators (delay, loss, bandwidth) as projections of a shared latent state, inspired by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. It uses contrastive learning to align multi-view representations and denoising reconstruction to improve robustness under noisy conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world topologies show PLATONT consistently outperforms baselines in link-level performance estimation, OD traffic prediction, and topology inference, with significant accuracy gains and reduced prediction bias across all tasks.

## Method Summary
PLATONT is a unified network tomography framework that models different network indicators as projections of a shared latent state. It uses indicator-specific encoders to map raw data to a common latent space, where contrastive learning aligns multi-view representations while a hybrid reconstruction loss denoises the latent state. The framework supports three tomography tasks—link performance estimation, OD traffic prediction, and topology inference—through task-specific algorithms operating on the shared representation. Training involves optimizing a composite loss combining alignment, reconstruction, and task-specific objectives.

## Key Results
- Consistently outperforms baselines across link-level estimation, OD traffic prediction, and topology inference tasks
- Achieves significant accuracy gains with reduced prediction bias across all tasks
- Demonstrates improved robustness under noisy conditions through denoising reconstruction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Indicator Contrastive Alignment
If network indicators are treated as distinct projections of a shared latent state, aligning them via contrastive learning may improve cross-task generalization. The framework encodes different indicators into a shared latent space and maximizes mutual information between representations of the same network state while minimizing it across different states. This forces the model to capture the underlying network condition rather than noise specific to one indicator. Break condition: If indicators are statistically independent, the mutual information assumption fails and alignment may force spurious correlations.

### Mechanism 2: Hybrid Denoising Reconstruction
Reconstructing clean indicators from noisy measurements using a hybrid loss function appears to filter observation noise, improving downstream task accuracy. The model uses an encoder-decoder structure with reconstruction loss that minimizes error against clean ground truth when available, and against raw noisy data otherwise. This trains the latent space to filter high-frequency noise while preserving the core state. Break condition: If clean ground truth is unavailable or unrepresentative, the model cannot learn the denoising mapping.

### Mechanism 3: Shared Subspace Gradient Reduction
Optimizing multiple tasks within a shared low-dimensional subspace may stabilize training by reducing composite gradient magnitude. Theoretical analysis suggests that when task gradients share a low-rank subspace, the effective gradient variance is controlled by the subspace dimension rather than the number of tasks, leading to a potential reduction in gradient magnitude. Break condition: If tasks are antagonistic or their gradients do not share a low-dimensional structure, interference could increase training instability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Network Tomography (NT)**
  - Why needed: NT is the inverse problem of inferring internal network states from external path measurements. PLATONT is a unified solution to this class of problems.
  - Quick check: Can you distinguish between the "routing matrix" R (known topology) and the "topology inference" problem (unknown R)?

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning (InfoNCE)**
  - Why needed: This is the mathematical engine used to align the multi-view indicators. Understanding the difference between positive pairs (same time, different view) and negative pairs is crucial.
  - Quick check: How does the temperature parameter τ affect the "hardness" of the alignment in Eq. (15)?

- **Concept: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH)**
  - Why needed: It provides the theoretical justification for why aligning disparate indicators (delay vs. bandwidth) is valid—assuming they converge to a shared model of reality.
  - Quick check: Does the paper assume the latent state z is the cause or the result of the observed indicators?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data -> Encoders -> Shared Latent Space -> Decoders -> Task Algorithms
- **Critical path**: Data → Encoders → Alignment Loss (pulls views together) + Reconstruction Loss (denoises) → Latent z → Decoders → Task Algos
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Latent Dimension (d=32): A smaller d enforces more compression but risks losing indicator-specific nuances
  - Clean Data Requirement: Performance relies on D_clean; in fully blind scenarios, the "denoising" mechanism degrades to standard autoencoding
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Mode Collapse: If alignment is too strong, all representations might converge to a constant, destroying information
  - Negative Pair Interference: If temporal sampling is too dense, "negative" pairs might actually be similar states, confusing the contrastive loss
  - Poor Denoising: If noisy loss remains high while clean is low, the model is overfitting noise
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation on L_align: Run on synthetic data with L_align=0 to verify the "Unified" aspect is actually driving performance gains
  2. Noise Sensitivity: Inject varying Gaussian noise (ε ∈ [0.05, 0.2]) and plot degradation curve against baselines (PCA/CCA)
  3. Topology Generalization: Train on small AGIS topology and test on larger Germany-50 topology without retraining

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the minimum ground-truth requirements for effective denoising, and how does performance degrade as clean sample availability decreases?
- Basis: The paper states "we assume access to a small set of high-quality ground-truth samples" without quantifying how "small" this set can be
- Why unresolved: The experimental section does not ablate the size of the clean sample set D_clean
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying |D_clean| from 1% to 100% of training data, reporting performance curves across all three tomography tasks

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can PLATONT be extended to a fully differentiable framework where task-specific losses directly optimize the shared representation?
- Basis: The authors note "these algorithms maybe are not differentiable, so task losses cannot backpropagate through the decoders"
- Why unresolved: The current design treats task-specific algorithms as black boxes that break the gradient chain
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of differentiable approximations for each tomography task algorithm

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework perform on real-world network deployments beyond simulation environments?
- Basis: All experiments use OMNeT++ simulation data; the paper lacks validation on actual production network traces
- Why unresolved: Simulation environments may not capture all real-world complexities such as routing oscillations and bursty traffic patterns
- What evidence would resolve it: Deployment studies on operational networks with comparison to simulation-based results

### Open Question 4
- Question: How sensitive is the shared latent representation dimension to the number and type of network indicators?
- Basis: The paper uses a fixed 32-dimensional latent space for three indicators
- Why unresolved: Adding more indicators may require larger latent dimensions or different architectural choices
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying both the number of input indicators (from 2 to 10+) and latent dimension (from 8 to 128)

## Limitations
- Theoretical gradient analysis relies on strict assumptions about gradient structure that may not hold in practical network conditions
- Dataset availability remains a blocker—actual dataset links are missing from the paper
- Denoising mechanism's dependence on clean ground truth data limits applicability to real-world blind scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: PLATONT's performance improvements on synthetic topologies where ground truth is available
- **Medium confidence**: Generalization to real-world topologies—Germany-50 test shows gains but real-world noise patterns may differ
- **Low confidence**: Theoretical gradient analysis in Appendix—proof assumes idealized gradient subspace structures not empirically verified

## Next Checks
1. Implement the ablation study (L_align = 0) to isolate the contribution of unified contrastive learning versus simple indicator concatenation
2. Systematically vary noise injection levels (0.05, 0.1, 0.2) and plot degradation curves against PCA/CCA baselines
3. Test cross-topology generalization by training on small topologies (AGIS) and evaluating on large ones (Germany-50) without retraining
