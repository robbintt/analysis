# A Study on Thinking Patterns of Large Reasoning Models in Code Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13758
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13758
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Analysis of 1,150 reasoning traces from five LRMs reveals human-like coding workflows with task-dependent patterns

## Executive Summary
This study systematically investigates reasoning behaviors of large reasoning models (LRMs) in code generation by developing a comprehensive taxonomy of 15 reasoning actions across four phases. The authors analyze 1,150 reasoning traces from five open-source LRMs (DeepSeek-R1-7B, Qwen3 variants, and QwQ-32B) on Python tasks from the CoderEval benchmark. Their findings reveal that LRMs generally follow a human-like coding workflow, with reasoning patterns varying by task complexity and exhibiting distinct styles between models. The study identifies strong correlations between specific reasoning actions (particularly Unit Test Creation) and functional correctness, while also demonstrating that lightweight prompting strategies can effectively guide model reasoning.

## Method Summary
The study analyzes reasoning behaviors of five open-source LRMs on Python code generation tasks from the CoderEval benchmark. Researchers developed a 15-action taxonomy spanning four phases: task comprehension, planning, coding, and verification. Using open coding with two annotators, they labeled 1,150 reasoning traces across 230 tasks. The analysis employed Cohen's Kappa for inter-rater agreement, phi-coefficient for correlation measurement, and Apriori algorithm for action combination mining. Temperature was set to 0.6 for all model runs, and the study sampled 145 tasks for annotation (95% confidence, 5% margin of error) with the remaining 85 tasks reserved for validation.

## Key Results
- LRMs exhibit distinct reasoning styles: Qwen3 models use iterative reasoning while DeepSeek-R1-7B follows linear approaches
- Unit Test Creation shows strongest correlation with functional correctness among all reasoning actions
- Task complexity influences reasoning patterns, with LRMs adapting strategies based on dependency levels
- Lightweight prompting strategies incorporating reasoning guidelines improve code generation outcomes
- The 15-action taxonomy achieved substantial inter-rater agreement (Cohen's Kappa 0.7054)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's approach works because it captures the systematic nature of human-like reasoning in code generation through a structured taxonomy. By breaking down reasoning into discrete actions across distinct phases, the methodology reveals how LRMs navigate the programming workflow. The correlation analysis between reasoning actions and functional correctness provides empirical evidence for which cognitive steps matter most for successful code generation. The observed differences between model families suggest that training data composition significantly influences reasoning behaviors, validating the approach of analyzing reasoning traces as a window into model capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reasoning trace analysis**: Understanding how to systematically dissect model outputs into meaningful cognitive actions is essential for identifying patterns and bottlenecks in code generation
- **Taxonomy construction**: Creating structured classifications of complex behaviors requires careful validation through inter-rater agreement metrics to ensure reliability
- **Correlation measurement**: Using phi-coefficient to measure relationships between discrete reasoning actions and binary outcomes provides insights into causal relationships
- **Apriori algorithm**: Mining frequent item sets from reasoning actions helps identify which combinations of cognitive steps lead to successful outcomes
- **Open coding methodology**: Qualitative analysis of model behavior requires systematic protocols and arbitrator resolution for edge cases
- **Pass@1 evaluation**: Measuring functional correctness with single-attempt evaluation provides a clear success metric for code generation tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
LRM (HuggingFace) -> CoderEval task loader -> Temperature=0.6 inference -> Reasoning trace extraction -> 15-action annotation -> Correlation analysis

Critical path:
Task loading → Model inference → Reasoning trace collection → Action annotation → Correlation computation → Pattern analysis

Design tradeoffs:
The study chose binary action annotations over continuous metrics for simplicity and clarity, accepting potential loss of nuanced behavioral information. Temperature=0.6 balances diversity and coherence in reasoning traces, while Python-only analysis ensures depth over breadth. Manual annotation provides high-quality labels but limits scalability.

Failure signatures:
- Temperature=0 timeouts causing incoherent repetitive reasoning
- Ambiguous prompts leading to circular reasoning loops
- Mathematical reasoning errors in UTC despite correct test logic
- Binary annotations missing nuanced reasoning patterns

First experiments:
1. Replicate analysis with temperature=0.3 and 0.9 to test robustness of reasoning patterns
2. Apply taxonomy to held-out validation set of 85 tasks to verify generalizability
3. Test lightweight prompting strategies on a new set of 50 Python tasks not in original study

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: Do the identified reasoning patterns generalize across programming languages beyond Python?
The study focused only on Python due to imbalanced Java task distribution in CoderEval; language-specific syntax and idioms may elicit different reasoning behaviors.

**Open Question 2**: Can Unit Test Creation (UTC) be made reliably correct to improve its correlation with functional correctness?
LRMs struggle with mathematical reasoning under direct prompting, leading to flawed test oracles even when test logic is sound.

**Open Question 3**: What specific training data characteristics cause DeepSeek-R1's linear reasoning versus Qwen3's iterative reasoning style?
The paper observes behavioral differences but does not analyze the training corpora or fine-tuning procedures that produced these distinct styles.

**Open Question 4**: Can automated classification replace manual open coding for reasoning action annotation?
Manual annotation limits scalability and may not keep pace with evolving model capabilities.

## Limitations
- Evaluation covers only Python tasks from CoderEval without testing other programming languages or real-world codebases
- Taxonomy relies on binary action annotations that may miss nuanced reasoning patterns
- Correlation analysis identifies associations but cannot establish causation between reasoning actions and code quality
- Sample size (145 annotated tasks) may not fully capture rare reasoning patterns across all task complexities

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: LRM adherence to human-like coding workflow, correlation between UTC and functional correctness, iterative vs linear reasoning differences
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of lightweight prompting strategies, task complexity impact on reasoning patterns
- **Low confidence**: Claims about causal relationships between specific reasoning actions and code quality

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the analysis with different temperature settings (0.3-0.9) to verify robustness of observed reasoning patterns
2. Test the proposed prompting strategies on a held-out validation set of 50-100 tasks not used in the original study
3. Extend the taxonomy validation by having a third annotator review 20% of traces to verify inter-rater agreement stability
