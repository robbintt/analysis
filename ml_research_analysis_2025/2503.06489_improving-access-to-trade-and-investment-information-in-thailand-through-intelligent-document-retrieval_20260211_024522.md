# Improving Access to Trade and Investment Information in Thailand through Intelligent Document Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.06489
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06489
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: 65.76% accuracy@1 on Thai document retrieval for trade queries

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an intelligent document retrieval system designed to help Thai entrepreneurs access trade and investment information through a chatbot interface. The system combines BM25 and deep learning approaches to rank documents based on semantic relevance to user queries. By integrating both content-based and heading-based strategies, the approach aims to improve accuracy in retrieving relevant trade guidebooks. The system was evaluated using real Thai queries from entrepreneurs and students, demonstrating effectiveness in navigating foreign trade and investment documentation.

## Method Summary
The system employs a hybrid ranking approach that combines BM25 scoring on content tokens with cosine similarity on Word2Vec heading embeddings, aggregated via Borda count. Thai documents (PDF guidebooks on foreign trade for Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar) are processed by extracting headings through TOC regex parsing, tokenizing Thai text, and applying ORCHID POS tagging to filter keywords. Queries undergo similar preprocessing with stop word removal and normalization. Document headings are represented as mean Word2Vec vectors using a large Thai Word2Vec model, while content is indexed for BM25 retrieval. The final ranking combines both strategies to return the most relevant documents.

## Key Results
- Achieved 65.76% accuracy@1 on Thai document retrieval tasks
- User satisfaction surveys indicated the system was helpful for navigating foreign trade information
- Hybrid approach combining content and heading strategies showed effectiveness in real-world queries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid retrieval mechanism works by leveraging complementary strengths of keyword-based and semantic matching approaches. BM25 effectively handles exact keyword matches in document content, while Word2Vec embeddings capture semantic similarity between query terms and document headings. The Borda count aggregation ensures that documents ranking highly in either measure receive appropriate consideration, preventing either approach from dominating completely. This combination addresses the limitations of pure keyword matching (missing semantically related content) and pure semantic matching (potential noise from unrelated similar terms).

## Foundational Learning
- Thai NLP preprocessing: Essential for handling Thai language's lack of whitespace; quick check: verify tokenization produces correct word boundaries
- ORCHID POS tagging: Needed to identify meaningful content words; quick check: validate POS tag accuracy on sample sentences
- Word2Vec embeddings: Required for semantic similarity matching; quick check: ensure embeddings capture domain-specific terminology
- BM25 ranking: Core retrieval method for exact matches; quick check: tune k1 and b parameters for optimal performance
- Borda count aggregation: Combines multiple ranking strategies; quick check: verify rank aggregation preserves top candidates
- Thai spelling correction: Norvig algorithm handles typos; quick check: test correction accuracy on common misspellings

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Query Preprocessing -> BM25 Scoring -> Semantic Matching -> Borda Aggregation -> Result Ranking

**Critical Path:** Document Index Construction (heading extraction + content tokenization + POS tagging + embedding generation) → Query Processing (tokenization + normalization + POS tagging) → Hybrid Ranking (BM25 + cosine similarity → Borda count) → Document Retrieval

**Design Tradeoffs:** The hybrid approach balances precision (BM25) with semantic recall (Word2Vec), but requires maintaining two separate indexing structures and computational overhead for dual scoring. The choice of Borda count for aggregation is simple but may not optimally weight the two scoring methods.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor Thai tokenization leads to incorrect keyword extraction and degraded performance; missing Word2Vec embeddings for domain-specific terms reduce semantic matching accuracy; suboptimal BM25 parameters can overly penalize long documents or fail to distinguish relevant from irrelevant matches.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test BM25-only retrieval on sample queries to establish baseline performance
2. Implement semantic matching using Word2Vec on headings only
3. Combine both approaches with simple averaging before implementing Borda count

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Key implementation details missing: BM25 hyperparameters, Thai tokenizer specification, and stop word list
- Gold standard query-document pairs (406 pairs) not released, preventing independent validation
- No comparison to strong baselines or ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions
- Evaluation relies entirely on unreleased test data and user satisfaction surveys without detailed methodology

## Confidence
- Accuracy claims: Medium (methodology clear but key parameters unspecified)
- User satisfaction findings: Medium (survey methodology not described)
- Overall system contribution: Medium (novel approach but incomplete experimental validation)

## Next Checks
1. Implement the described system using ORCHID POS tags, Thai Word2Vec embeddings, and Norvig spelling correction; compare BM25 and cosine similarity rankings with alternative weighting schemes
2. Replicate accuracy calculation using synthetic query-document pairs derived from the same guidebooks to estimate performance without access to gold standard
3. Conduct a small user study with Thai entrepreneurs using a prototype system to gather qualitative feedback on practical utility
