- Primary result: EWC significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting compared to L2 regularization and SGD on sequential MNIST tasks

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. Through controlled experiments on PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST benchmarks, EWC demonstrates superior performance in preserving knowledge across sequentially learned tasks by selectively constraining parameters based on their Fisher information. The method shows significant advantages over naive SGD and L2 regularization, though with a slight compromise in new task learning efficiency.

## Method Summary
The method implements Elastic Weight Consolidation through a two-phase approach: first training on each task to convergence, then computing the diagonal Fisher Information Matrix to quantify parameter importance; second, during subsequent task training, adding a quadratic penalty weighted by the Fisher values to preserve parameters critical for prior tasks. The study compares EWC against L2 regularization and naive SGD across sequential classification tasks using a fully connected network architecture with two hidden layers (400 units each). Cross-validation identifies optimal hyperparameters including batch size 16, momentum 0.2, and λEWC=1000 for EWC implementation.

## Key Results
- EWC significantly reduces forgetting of previously learned tasks by selectively constraining parameters based on Fisher information
- Cross-validation identified optimal hyperparameters: batch size 16, momentum 0.2, and λEWC=1000 for EWC
- EWC maintains superior performance across sequential tasks, particularly in complex rotation scenarios
- Results confirm EWC's effectiveness in preserving knowledge across tasks, though discrepancies with original paper accuracies suggest sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fisher-Weighted Selective Constraint
- Constraining parameters proportionally to their importance for prior tasks reduces catastrophic forgetting while preserving new task learning capacity.
- Core assumption: The diagonal approximation of the Fisher matrix sufficiently captures parameter importance; task optima lie in overlapping regions of parameter space.

### Mechanism 2: Importance-Gated Plasticity
- Treating parameters heterogeneously based on task-relevance outperforms uniform regularization.
- Core assumption: The Fisher information accurately identifies which parameters are critical for task performance; important parameters for different tasks partially overlap.

### Mechanism 3: Accumulated Knowledge Preservation via Sequential Fisher Accumulation
- Accumulating Fisher-weighted penalties across tasks enables retention of multiple sequentially-learned tasks.
- Core assumption: The accumulated constraint surface remains navigable; λEWC scales appropriately with task count.

## Foundational Learning

- **Catastrophic Forgetting**
  - Why needed: The core problem EWC addresses; understanding that standard SGD overwrites weights critical for prior tasks is essential.
  - Quick check: If you train a network on Task A then Task B sequentially with standard SGD, what happens to Task A accuracy?

- **Fisher Information Matrix**
  - Why needed: The mathematical foundation for measuring parameter importance; diagonal approximation is used to make computation tractable.
  - Quick check: What does a high diagonal Fisher value F_ii indicate about parameter θ_i's role in the model's predictions?

- **Regularization as Bayesian Inference**
  - Why needed: EWC derives from a Bayesian perspective where the posterior from task A becomes the prior for task B; the Fisher approximates the posterior precision.
  - Quick check: How does L2 regularization differ from EWC in terms of what the penalty encodes about parameter uncertainty?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
```
Input (784) → [Dropout 0.2] → Hidden1 (400, ReLU) → [BatchNorm] → [Dropout 0.5] → Hidden2 (400, ReLU) → [BatchNorm] → [Dropout 0.5] → Output (10)
```
Training loop: Standard SGD forward/backward pass → Compute EWC penalty using stored θ* and Fisher from prior tasks → Add to loss → Update weights

- **Critical path:**
  1. Train Task A to convergence, store θ*_A
  2. Compute diagonal Fisher F_A using labeled data from Task A (one pass, gradients squared)
  3. Begin Task B training: at each step, compute L_B + λ_EWC/2 × Σ_i F_A,i(θ_i - θ*_A,i)²
  4. After Task B, compute F_B, store θ*_B
  5. Task C: loss includes penalties from both A and B

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **λ_EWC magnitude**: Higher values → better retention, worse new-task learning; paper found 1000-20000 optimal depending on task
  - **Fisher computation timing**: Must be computed after task convergence; computing too early yields noisy importance estimates
  - **Diagonal vs. full Fisher**: Diagonal is O(n) storage and computation; full Fisher is O(n²) — intractable for large networks
  - **Early stopping patience**: Paper used patience=5, but found this triggered too early due to forgetting on validation set; recommend patience=15 or fixed epochs

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Loss divergence**: λ_EWC too high causes numerical instability (observed in cross-validation)
  - **Under-learning on new tasks**: λ_EWC too high relative to task difficulty; symptoms: new task accuracy plateaus below expected
  - **Catastrophic forgetting despite EWC**: λ_EWC too low, or Fisher computed on insufficient data
  - **Early stopping triggers prematurely**: Validation set contains prior-task data; model forgets during new-task training, triggering stop

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline verification**: Implement naive SGD on 3 PermutedMNIST tasks; confirm catastrophic forgetting occurs (Task A accuracy should drop dramatically after Task B and C training). This validates your training pipeline.
  2. **L2 vs. EWC comparison**: Implement both on 3 PermutedMNIST tasks with matched λ values. Verify EWC maintains higher Task A accuracy while achieving comparable Task B/C accuracy. This validates the Fisher-weighting mechanism.
  3. **Hyperparameter sensitivity sweep**: For EWC on PermutedMNIST, sweep λ_EWC ∈ {100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000} with fixed batch_size=64, momentum=0.6. Plot Task A accuracy vs. Task C accuracy to find the retention-plasticity tradeoff frontier. This establishes your operating range before attempting complex benchmarks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the effectiveness of Elastic Weight Consolidation scale when applied to complex, real-world datasets beyond the simple MNIST benchmarks analyzed here?
- **Basis in paper**: The conclusion states that applying these techniques "to more complex real-world datasets beyond MNIST would provide further insights into their scalability and practical usability."
- **Why unresolved**: The current study is restricted to PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST, which the authors acknowledge may not capture the difficulty of diverse, high-dimensional data.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical results from testing EWC on large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-100) in a continual learning setting.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can hybrid approaches combining Elastic Weight Consolidation with alternative strategies improve the balance between long-term knowledge retention and adaptability?
- **Basis in paper**: The authors suggest that "Future work could explore hybrid approaches, combining EWC with alternative strategies, to further improve long-term retention while maintaining adaptability."
- **Why unresolved**: This study only evaluated EWC against L2 regularization and vanilla SGD, without investigating combinations of these methods or other architectural modifications.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments demonstrating that a combined method (e.g., EWC + replay or EWC + dynamic architectures) outperforms standalone EWC on sequential tasks.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can early stopping criteria be adapted for continual learning to prevent premature termination caused by catastrophic forgetting rather than overfitting?
- **Basis in paper**: The authors observed that standard early stopping halted training after only two epochs because validation error increased due to forgetting, not overfitting, which "doesn't fully reflect a real-world scenario."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper identifies this limitation of the current setup but does not propose or test a solution to distinguish between valid convergence and performance degradation due to forgetting.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A modified early stopping algorithm that successfully allows full convergence on new tasks without triggering false stops due to the decay of old task performance.

## Limitations

- **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: EWC's performance appears highly dependent on precise λ_EWC tuning, with no discussion of stability across runs or different random seeds.
- **Scalability concerns**: The diagonal Fisher approximation and quadratic penalty may not scale effectively to larger architectures or more complex task distributions beyond MNIST variants.
- **Task similarity bias**: EWC's effectiveness is demonstrated primarily on MNIST permutations and rotations—tasks sharing the same underlying data distribution. Performance on truly dissimilar tasks remains unexplored.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: EWC outperforms L2 regularization and naive SGD on PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST benchmarks. The mechanism of Fisher-weighted selective constraint is well-supported by experimental results and mathematical derivation.
- **Medium confidence**: The optimal hyperparameters identified (batch size 16, momentum 0.2, λEWC=1000) are specific to the tested configurations and may not generalize across different network architectures or task complexities.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about EWC's long-term effectiveness across many sequential tasks are weakly supported. The 10-task experiment shows promise but doesn't address potential capacity saturation or the accumulation of constraints over extended task sequences.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-task generalization test**: Apply EWC to a sequence mixing MNIST permutations with CIFAR-10 classes. Measure whether Fisher information from MNIST remains predictive of parameter importance for unrelated image classification tasks.

2. **Long-term accumulation study**: Train EWC on 50+ sequential tasks with varying difficulty. Track per-task accuracy decay and Fisher constraint growth to identify when capacity saturation occurs.

3. **Architectural scaling experiment**: Implement EWC on a CNN architecture (e.g., LeNet-5) and compare performance against the FCN baseline. Test whether deeper architectures require different λEWC scaling or if Fisher importance patterns change fundamentally.
