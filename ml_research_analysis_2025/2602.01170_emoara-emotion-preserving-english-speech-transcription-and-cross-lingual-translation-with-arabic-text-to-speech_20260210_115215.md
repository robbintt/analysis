# EmoAra: Emotion-Preserving English Speech Transcription and Cross-Lingual Translation with Arabic Text-to-Speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01170
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01170
- Reference count: 16
- EmoAra integrates emotion detection, English speech transcription, Arabic translation, and Arabic text-to-speech synthesis

## Executive Summary
EmoAra is an end-to-end system designed to transcribe English speech, translate it to Arabic, and synthesize Arabic speech while preserving emotional context. The system combines CNN-based emotion detection, Whisper ASR, fine-tuned MarianMT translation, and MMS-TTS-Ara synthesis. Key results demonstrate high performance in emotion classification (94% F1-score) and translation quality (BLEU 56, BERTScore F1 88.7%), with 81% human evaluation score for banking-domain translations.

## Method Summary
The system employs a CNN-based emotion classifier to detect emotional states from speech, followed by Whisper ASR for English transcription. The transcribed text is then translated to Arabic using a fine-tuned MarianMT model. Finally, the Arabic text is synthesized into speech using MMS-TTS-Ara, which incorporates emotion parameters derived from the initial classification. The architecture is designed to maintain emotional fidelity across the translation pipeline.

## Key Results
- 94% F1-score for emotion classification from speech
- BLEU score of 56 and BERTScore F1 of 88.7% for Arabic translation quality
- 81% human evaluation score for banking-domain translations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages specialized components for each stage of the pipeline, ensuring high performance in emotion detection, transcription accuracy, translation quality, and speech synthesis. The integration of emotion parameters into the TTS system enables the preservation of emotional context across languages.

## Foundational Learning
- **CNN-based emotion classification**: Needed to detect emotional states from raw speech; quick check: verify classification accuracy on diverse emotional datasets
- **Whisper ASR**: Required for robust English speech transcription; quick check: measure Word Error Rate (WER) on varied accents and noise conditions
- **MarianMT translation**: Essential for high-quality English-to-Arabic translation; quick check: evaluate BLEU scores across multiple translation benchmarks
- **MMS-TTS-Ara**: Needed for natural Arabic speech synthesis with emotion control; quick check: assess naturalness and emotional expressiveness via MOS testing
- **Cross-modal emotion transfer**: Critical for maintaining emotional intent across transcription, translation, and synthesis; quick check: measure emotion consistency from input to output

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Speech -> CNN Emotion Classifier -> Whisper ASR -> MarianMT -> MMS-TTS-Ara -> Arabic Speech
**Critical Path**: Emotion detection → ASR → Translation → TTS synthesis
**Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing emotion preservation with translation fluency; choosing between model complexity and real-time performance
**Failure Signatures**: Loss of emotional nuance in translation, degraded speech naturalness, misalignment between detected and synthesized emotion
**First Experiments**:
1. Measure emotion classification accuracy on benchmark emotional speech datasets
2. Evaluate ASR transcription accuracy with varied English accents and background noise
3. Test Arabic TTS naturalness and emotional expressiveness with controlled text inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Human evaluation limited to banking domain (81% satisfaction) without broader domain testing
- Absence of emotion preservation metrics for the final synthesized Arabic speech
- No ablation study to isolate contribution of individual components

## Confidence
- High: Emotion classification performance (94% F1-score)
- Medium: Translation quality metrics (BLEU 56, BERTScore 88.7%)
- Medium: End-to-end system effectiveness due to limited evaluation scope and potential domain overfitting

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain human evaluations across healthcare, retail, and technical support scenarios
2. Implement emotion consistency metrics to quantify preservation from source English speech through synthesized Arabic output
3. Perform controlled ablation studies to determine the impact of each component on overall system performance
