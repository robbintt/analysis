- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18556
- Authors: Jingsong Xia; Siqi Wang

## Executive Summary
This study proposes SDA-QEC, a novel framework addressing class imbalance in medical image classification by combining simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. The lightweight diffusion augmentor generates high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, while a quantum feature layer embedded in MobileNetV2 enhances discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space. Experiments on coronary angiography image classification demonstrate that SDA-QEC achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming classical baselines including ResNet18, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and VGG16. Notably, the framework simultaneously attains 98.33% sensitivity and 98.33% specificity, achieving a balanced performance critical for clinical deployment.

## Method Summary
The SDA-QEC framework addresses class imbalance through a two-stage approach. First, a simplified diffusion augmentor generates synthetic minority class samples using a forward-only noise injection process (T=5 steps, β_start=0.0001→β_end=0.02) without training a reverse denoising network. Second, the augmented dataset is classified using a hybrid model that combines MobileNetV2 backbone with a quantum feature layer. The quantum layer maps 256-dimensional classical features into a 4-qubit quantum state via amplitude encoding, applies parameterized quantum circuits with entanglement, and measures Pauli-Z expectations to produce final classification probabilities.

## Key Results
- Achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score on coronary angiography classification
- Simultaneously attains 98.33% sensitivity and 98.33% specificity, demonstrating balanced performance
- Outperforms classical baselines: ResNet18 (95.00%), MobileNetV2 (94.00%), DenseNet121 (96.67%), VGG16 (96.67%)
- Reduces parameters by 96.5% compared to classical dense classification heads while maintaining expressivity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Forward Diffusion as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
The framework improves minority class recall by expanding the support of the feature distribution without training a generative model. Instead of standard reverse denoising, the study applies parameterized forward diffusion (adding Gaussian noise) to existing minority samples, acting as KDE to create "diffusion-like" variants that expand the decision boundary for rare classes. The assumption is that adding controlled noise (β_start=0.0001→β_end=0.02) over T=5 steps approximates the true underlying distribution sufficiently for the classifier.

### Mechanism 2: Hilbert Space Feature Mapping
Embedding classical features into quantum Hilbert space enhances non-linear separability for difficult boundary samples. The architecture reduces MobileNetV2 features (1280→256) and maps them into a quantum state via amplitude encoding. A parameterized quantum circuit with entanglement layers creates complex non-linear interactions before measurement, allowing construction of decision boundaries computationally harder for classical linear layers to replicate.

### Mechanism 3: Parameter-Efficient Nonlinearity
The quantum layer replaces a classical dense block with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining or improving expressivity. The study replaces a classical classification head (which would require 256×2+2=514 parameters) with a quantum layer (8 quantum parameters + 10 classical interface parameters = 18 total), reducing overfitting risks on small-sample medical datasets.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Forward vs. Reverse Diffusion** - Why needed: This paper simplifies standard diffusion by removing the "reverse" step (denoising). Quick check: If you set T=1000 (standard DDPM steps) in the SimpleDiffusionAugmentor, would it improve or break this specific workflow?

- **Concept: Amplitude Encoding** - Why needed: The interface between CNN and quantum circuit relies on encoding classical data into quantum state amplitudes. Quick check: Why does the feature vector (Eq 7) need normalization before encoding?

- **Concept: Class Imbalance Metrics** - Why needed: The paper argues standard accuracy is misleading in medical contexts. Quick check: If a model predicts "Healthy" for everyone, it might have high accuracy but 0% sensitivity. Which metric does the paper prioritize to ensure "Dual-High" performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (224×224 coronary angiography image) → SimpleDiffusionAugmentor (forward noise injection, T=5) → MobileNetV2 backbone → Global Average Pooling → 1280-d vector → Linear(1280→256) + ReLU → QuantumFeatureLayer (4 qubits, 2 layers, amplitude encoding) → Measurement (4-d vector) → Linear(4→2) → Softmax

- **Critical path:** The transition from the 256-d classical vector to the 8-qubit quantum state is the architectural bottleneck. Data compression here is critical; loss of information at this stage cannot be recovered by the quantum layer.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Speed vs. Quality (T=5 prioritizes clinical deployability over theoretical maximum quality of T=1000); Qubit Count vs. Feature Depth (4 qubits for circuit but 8 qubits for encoding amplitude vectors of size 256).

- **Failure signatures:** Mode collapse in augmentation (if β_end is too high, synthetic images become pure noise); Barren plateaus (if quantum circuit depth is increased beyond 2 layers, gradients may vanish); High FID, Low Accuracy (good image quality doesn't guarantee class discriminability).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation on T: Run augmentation with T=1, 5, 10 to verify the "sweet spot" for forward diffusion schedule
  2. Classical vs. Quantum Head: Replace QuantumFeatureLayer with standard Dense(256, 2) layer to isolate "Quantum Advantage" contribution
  3. Robustness Check: Evaluate performance on original (unbalanced) test set vs. artificially balanced test set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the SDA-QEC framework perform when deployed on actual Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware compared to classical simulation?
- **Basis in paper:** The methodology specifies quantum layer implementation via Pennylane library, implying classical simulation rather than physical quantum hardware
- **Why unresolved:** Simulations assume ideal quantum states without decoherence or gate errors, whereas real hardware introduces noise that could disrupt high-dimensional feature mapping
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks of model's accuracy and stability when running Quantum Feature Layer on physical quantum processors

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the simplified 5-step forward diffusion process limit synthesis of complex pathological features compared to full reverse-diffusion models?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 2.2.3 notes simplified method achieves FID of 28.3, significantly higher (worse) than complete DDPM FID of 22.1
- **Why unresolved:** Computational efficiency trade-off may result in synthetic samples that are lower fidelity or less diverse, potentially limiting model's ability to generalize to rare, complex cases
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative analysis using generated samples from full DDPMs vs. simplified augmentor to measure ceiling of classification performance improvement

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the framework generalizable to volumetric medical imaging data (e.g., CT/MRI) or high-resolution images beyond 2D angiography?
- **Basis in paper:** Study validates method solely on 2D coronary angiography images (224×224), leaving performance on 3D or higher-resolution modalities unverified
- **Why unresolved:** Lightweight MobileNetV2 backbone and specific dimensionality reduction (to 256 features) may lose critical spatial information required for volumetric diagnosis
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Application of SDA-QEC pipeline to 3D classification tasks, such as tumor segmentation in MRI volumes, to test architectural scalability

## Limitations

- The quantum-classical interface has a dimension mismatch: 256-dimensional features encoded into 8 qubits but processed by a 4-qubit circuit, raising questions about how encoding dimension matches circuit size
- Forward-only diffusion augmentation lacks rigorous validation that it maintains class-specific feature distributions across synthetic samples
- Results depend heavily on a specific class balance target (ρ_target=0.7) without demonstrating robustness to different imbalance ratios
- The "quantum advantage" claim lacks strong theoretical grounding given the small 4-dimensional post-measurement feature space

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Overall framework architecture (MobileNetV2 backbone + quantum feature layer) is technically coherent and reported metrics are internally consistent
- **Medium Confidence:** Diffusion augmentation mechanism as described (forward-only KDE approximation) is plausible but not rigorously validated
- **Low Confidence:** "Quantum-enhanced" claim lacks strong theoretical grounding—4-qubit measurement space provides minimal expressive power compared to classical alternatives

## Next Checks

1. **Dimension Consistency Audit:** Verify exact mapping between 256-dimensional classical features and quantum circuit (8 qubits for encoding vs 4 qubits for processing). Implement both described configuration and alternative mappings to test robustness.

2. **Classical Quantum Head Ablation:** Replace QuantumFeatureLayer with classical Dense(256, 2) layer and compare performance across all metrics. This isolates whether quantum processing provides measurable advantages beyond parameter efficiency.

3. **Noise Schedule Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary β_start, β_end, and T in diffusion augmentor (e.g., T∈{1,3,5,10}, β_end∈{0.005,0.02,0.05}) while monitoring synthetic sample quality (FID) and downstream classification metrics to identify optimal and failure conditions.
