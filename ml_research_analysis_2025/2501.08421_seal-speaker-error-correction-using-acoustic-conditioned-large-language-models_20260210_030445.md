# SEAL: Speaker Error Correction using Acoustic-conditioned Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.08421
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08421
- **Reference count**: 38
- **Key outcome**: SEAL reduces speaker error rates by 24-43% across multiple datasets using acoustic-conditioned LLMs with constrained decoding

## Executive Summary
SEAL addresses speaker error correction in diarization systems by conditioning large language models with acoustic information from speaker diarization outputs. The approach specifically targets errors during speaker transitions and overlapping speech, which are common failure modes in first-pass acoustic diarization. By integrating acoustic features with LLM capabilities and implementing constrained decoding, SEAL achieves significant error rate reductions compared to baseline acoustic diarization systems.

## Method Summary
The SEAL approach conditions LLMs with acoustic information from speaker diarization systems, using speaker scores mapped to labels and constrained decoding to prevent hallucinations. The system operates on a "Spkword" transcript format where speaker labels are prepended to words. Acoustic conditioning involves feeding speaker diarization outputs into the LLM, while constrained decoding ensures the model doesn't generate hallucinated speaker labels. The method leverages the complementary strengths of acoustic models for segmentation and LLMs for contextual correction.

## Key Results
- SEAL achieves 24-43% relative error reduction compared to first-pass acoustic speaker diarization
- Best performance observed on Fisher, Callhome, and RT03-CTS datasets
- Optimal configuration uses "Spkword" format with speaker score mapping and constrained decoding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by combining acoustic segmentation strengths with LLM contextual understanding. Acoustic models excel at detecting speech boundaries but struggle with speaker transitions and overlaps. LLMs, when conditioned with acoustic features, can leverage contextual patterns and linguistic cues to correct these errors. The constrained decoding prevents the model from generating hallucinated speaker labels, maintaining consistency with the acoustic evidence while allowing the LLM to correct systematic errors in the first-pass diarization.

## Foundational Learning

**Speaker Diarization**: The task of identifying "who spoke when" in an audio recording. Why needed: Forms the baseline system that SEAL corrects. Quick check: First-pass diarization typically uses clustering of speaker embeddings from acoustic features.

**Acoustic Conditioning**: Feeding speaker diarization outputs (scores, boundaries) into LLMs as input features. Why needed: Provides the LLM with acoustic evidence to ground its corrections. Quick check: Speaker scores are mapped to discrete labels before being fed to the LLM.

**Constrained Decoding**: Restricting LLM output to valid speaker labels and preventing hallucination of new speakers. Why needed: Ensures corrections remain consistent with acoustic evidence. Quick check: The decoder enforces that only existing speaker labels from the first pass can be used.

**Spkword Format**: Transcript format where speaker labels are prepended to words (e.g., "SPEAKER1 hello SPEAKER2 how"). Why needed: Provides explicit speaker-word alignment for the LLM to process. Quick check: This format makes speaker transitions explicit in the text input.

**Speaker Score Mapping**: Converting continuous speaker similarity scores to discrete labels for LLM conditioning. Why needed: Transforms acoustic evidence into a format LLMs can process. Quick check: Higher scores indicate greater confidence in speaker identity.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Acoustic Diarization -> Feature Extraction -> LLM Conditioning -> Constrained Decoding -> Corrected Diarization

**Critical Path**: First-pass acoustic diarization → speaker score extraction → LLM conditioning → constrained generation → final diarization output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades additional computational cost and latency for improved accuracy. Using LLMs adds significant inference overhead compared to pure acoustic approaches, but the error reduction justifies this in non-real-time applications. The choice of Spkword format versus other transcript representations affects both accuracy and processing complexity.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- The system may struggle with very short speaker segments where acoustic evidence is insufficient
- Performance depends heavily on the quality of the first-pass diarization
- May not generalize well to languages or domains not represented in training data

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare SEAL performance using different transcript formats (Spkword vs. standard text)
2. Test constrained vs. unconstrained decoding to measure hallucination impact
3. Evaluate different LLM sizes and architectures for the correction task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Evaluation limited to small-scale datasets (Fisher, Callhome, RT03-CTS), potentially limiting generalizability
- No analysis of computational costs or latency implications for real-time applications
- Focus on speaker transition and overlap errors doesn't address other diarization error types like short segments or false alarms

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Methodology for acoustic conditioning and constrained decoding is clearly described; relative error reductions are statistically significant across multiple datasets
- **Medium confidence**: Optimal configuration with "Spkword" format is well-supported by ablation studies; limited exploration of alternative conditioning strategies
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability claims to other diarization error types beyond transitions and overlaps are not substantiated

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test SEAL on additional datasets representing different conversational contexts (meetings, medical consultations, customer service calls) to assess robustness
2. **Scalability analysis**: Measure inference time and computational overhead when deploying SEAL in production environments, particularly for streaming applications
3. **Generalization to other error types**: Evaluate whether the acoustic-conditioned LLM approach improves other diarization errors such as short speaker segments, false alarms, or speaker identification confusion beyond the transition/overlap errors specifically targeted
