# ConformalSAM: Unlocking the Potential of Foundational Segmentation Models in Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Conformal Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.15803
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15803
- Authors: Danhui Chen; Ziquan Liu; Chuxi Yang; Dan Wang; Yan Yan; Yi Xu; Xiangyang Ji
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 5.14 mIOU improvement on PASCAL VOC with 1/16 labeled data and 10.04 mIOU improvement on ADE20K with 1/128 labeled data

## Executive Summary
ConformalSAM addresses the challenge of using foundational segmentation models as annotators in semi-supervised semantic segmentation by leveraging conformal prediction to calibrate and filter unreliable pixel labels. The method tackles the domain gap problem that causes foundational models like SEEM to generate low-quality masks on unlabeled data. Through a two-stage training strategy combining conformal calibration with self-reliance training, ConformalSAM significantly improves segmentation performance compared to recent SSSS methods while maintaining adaptability as a plug-in component for existing approaches.

## Method Summary
ConformalSAM employs a foundational segmentation model (specifically SEEM) as an annotator for unlabeled data in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, addressing the inherent domain gap that degrades annotation quality. The method uses conformal prediction to calibrate the foundational model and filter out unreliable pixel labels, creating high-confidence pseudo-labels. A two-stage training strategy is implemented: Stage I uses conformal prediction to generate reliable pseudo-labels from unlabeled data, while Stage II transitions to self-reliance training to prevent overfitting. The approach demonstrates superior performance on standard benchmarks and can be integrated as a plug-in component to enhance existing SSSS methods like AllSpark.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 5.14 mIOU improvement on PASCAL VOC with 1/16 labeled data
- Achieves 10.04 mIOU improvement on ADE20K with 1/128 labeled data
- Demonstrates plug-and-play adaptability by enhancing existing methods like AllSpark
- Outperforms recent SSSS methods across standard benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by addressing the fundamental challenge of domain shift between pre-trained foundational models and target datasets. Conformal prediction provides statistical guarantees about prediction reliability, allowing the system to identify and filter out uncertain predictions that would otherwise degrade training quality. The two-stage approach first establishes a reliable foundation of pseudo-labels through calibration, then gradually transitions to self-training to adapt to the target domain without overfitting to noise. This systematic approach to uncertainty quantification and progressive adaptation enables the foundational model to effectively transfer knowledge to new domains while maintaining segmentation quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal Prediction**: Statistical framework for quantifying prediction uncertainty - needed to filter unreliable pseudo-labels from foundational models; quick check: calibration curves on validation set
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Learning from both labeled and unlabeled data - fundamental framework for the problem; quick check: performance gap between fully supervised and semi-supervised variants
- **Domain Adaptation**: Bridging distribution gaps between source and target domains - addresses why foundational models fail on new data; quick check: feature distribution alignment metrics
- **Pseudo-Labeling**: Using model predictions as training labels - core technique for leveraging unlabeled data; quick check: confidence threshold optimization
- **Self-Training**: Iterative refinement using model's own predictions - enables progressive adaptation in Stage II; quick check: training stability over iterations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: SEEM -> Conformal Prediction -> Pseudo-Label Filter -> Two-Stage Trainer -> Segmentation Model

**Critical Path**: Foundational model output → Conformal calibration → High-confidence mask generation → Supervised training on pseudo-labels → Self-reliance adaptation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Heavy reliance on SEEM limits generalizability versus broader foundational model compatibility; two-stage approach adds complexity but provides better stability than single-stage methods

**Failure Signatures**: Degraded performance when domain gap exceeds calibration capacity; overfitting to noisy pseudo-labels in Stage II; calibration failure when conformal assumptions break

**First Experiments**: 1) Test with alternative foundational models (Mask2Former, DINO) to assess SEEM dependency; 2) Evaluate extreme domain shift scenarios beyond calibration thresholds; 3) Conduct ablation studies isolating conformal prediction versus two-stage training contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on SEEM as foundational model creates potential bottleneck
- Conformal prediction calibration may not generalize to significantly different data distributions
- Two-stage transition relies on empirical thresholds that may not be optimal across all datasets

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Performance improvements on PASCAL VOC and ADE20K datasets; methodology is clearly described and reproducible

**Medium Confidence**: Generalization to other foundational models beyond SEEM; plug-and-play nature with other SSSS methods

**Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of conformal prediction calibration in extreme domain shift scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Test ConformalSAM with alternative foundational segmentation models (e.g., Mask2Former, DINO) to assess dependency on SEEM
2. Evaluate performance degradation when domain shift exceeds the calibration threshold used in conformal prediction
3. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of conformal prediction versus the two-stage training strategy to quantify each component's impact
