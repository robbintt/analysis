# ActivationReasoning: Logical Reasoning in Latent Activation Spaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18184
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18184
- Reference count: 29
- One-line primary result: AR uses SAE-extracted concepts and logical rules to outperform base models and larger LLMs on reasoning benchmarks

## Executive Summary
ActivationReasoning (AR) introduces a framework that embeds explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of large language models using sparse autoencoders to extract interpretable concepts, which are then combined through logical rules to infer new propositions and steer model behavior. AR operates in three stages: finding latent representations, activating propositions, and logical reasoning. Across four benchmarks—PrOntoQA (multi-hop reasoning), Rail2Country (meta-level concept generalization), ProverQA (diverse reasoning), and BeaverTails (safety)—AR consistently outperforms base models and even much larger instruction-tuned or reasoning LLMs, achieving over 93% accuracy on multi-hop tasks and robust performance on abstract and context-sensitive tasks, demonstrating improved transparency, controllability, and reliability.

## Method Summary
AR extracts interpretable features from LLM activations using sparse autoencoders, converts these into propositions via thresholding, and applies forward-chaining logical rules to infer new concepts. The framework operates in three stages: (1) finding latent representations of concepts through labeled sequences and SAE analysis, (2) activating propositions by thresholding activation scores to create local and global activation matrices, and (3) logical reasoning through forward chaining to enrich propositions. AR can steer model behavior by modifying hidden states using the enriched activation matrix. The method is evaluated on four benchmarks with Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-9B backbones, using three representation types (Single, Multi, Relational) and automatic threshold calibration.

## Key Results
- AR achieves over 93% accuracy on 5-hop multi-hop reasoning in PrOntoQA versus 50% baseline
- On Rail2Country meta-level concept generalization, AR reaches 91-93% accuracy on similes versus 0% for vanilla SAEs
- AR outperforms much larger instruction-tuned and reasoning LLMs on safety classification tasks, with gains up to 35% over base SAEs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sparse Decomposition of Superposed Representations
SAEs extract sparse, approximately monosemantic features from entangled LLM activations, providing substrate for logical propositions. By applying sparsity constraints during encoding, SAEs push individual latent dimensions toward alignment with distinct concepts, partially reversing superposition where multiple features occupy overlapping dimensions. This yields interpretable features that can function as atomic propositions. The assumption is that SAE features sufficiently approximate discrete propositional units, though the paper acknowledges features can still be polysemous, contextually unstable, or overly low-level.

### Mechanism 2: Threshold-Based Proposition Discretization
Soft thresholding converts continuous activation scores into binary-like propositions suitable for symbolic inference. For each concept c at token t, activation a(c,t) is computed and thresholded using concept-specific threshold τc: Alocal[c,t] = max(a(c,t) - τc, 0). Activations above threshold become weighted evidence, with aggregated activations forming A_global for sequence-level concepts. The assumption is that threshold-based discretization preserves sufficient signal for reliable inference, though threshold quality depends on labeled data availability.

### Mechanism 3: Forward-Chaining Rule Application Over Activations
User-defined logical rules compose detected atomic propositions into higher-order concepts absent from the SAE feature space. Rules (e.g., Bridge ∧ SanFrancisco ∧ USA → GoldenGateBridge) are applied via forward chaining over discretized activation matrix A until a fixed point is reached, producing enriched A′ containing both detected and derived propositions. This A′ can then steer generation or inform classification. The assumption is that logical rules correctly encode domain relationships, though the system doesn't learn rules automatically (current limitation noted by authors).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**
  - Why needed here: Core substrate for extracting interpretable features; understanding encoder/decoder split, sparsity penalties, and feature interpretation is essential.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why sparsity promotes monosemanticity and what "top-k activation" means?

- **Concept: Superposition in Neural Networks**
  - Why needed here: The problem AR addresses—entangled representations obscuring conceptual structure—arises from superposition.
  - Quick check question: Can you describe why multiple features sharing dimensions limits interpretability?

- **Concept: Propositional Logic / Forward Chaining**
  - Why needed here: AR applies forward-chaining inference over detected propositions; understanding logical implication, conjunction, and fixed-point iteration is required.
  - Quick check question: Can you trace a simple forward-chaining inference with 2-3 rules?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Hidden states -> SAE Encoder -> Sparse codes -> Activation Detector -> Logic Solver -> (optional) Steering Module -> Modified hidden states

- **Critical path**: Pre-compute concept representations from labeled sequences → populate concept dictionary → at inference encode hidden states → compute sparse codes → detect activations → populate activation matrix → apply forward-chaining rules → derive enriched activation matrix → (optional) steer by injecting modifications into hidden states

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - R_single vs. R_multi vs. R_relation: Single is simplest but brittle to polysemy; multi aggregates evidence but ignores interactions; relational (decision trees) captures structure but is more complex
  - SAE layer placement: Later layers encode more semantic/monosemantic features; earlier layers capture syntax; authors note AR is layer-agnostic but use late layers (23 for Llama, 20 for Gemma)
  - Steering strength α: Too low = no effect; too high = distortion; hyperparameter ablation shows α=0.4 optimal for Gemma on PrOntoQA

- **Failure signatures**:
  1. Detection collapse on implicit cues: Vanilla SAEs achieve 0% on R2C-Meta similes; AR recovers 91-93%, but some similes remain harder
  2. Missing SAE features for abstract concepts: Safety categories like "Misinformation" show base SAE near random (50.7%); AR improves but still limited by SAE representational gaps
  3. Rule specification burden: Current version requires manual/semi-automated rules; authors note automatic rule induction as future work

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce PrOntoQA 1-hop with R_multi: Verify setup by achieving ~95% accuracy; test with varying top-k_in and steering α to calibrate thresholds
  2. Ablate SAE layer placement: Replicate layer sensitivity test (layers 18, 22 vs. default) on R2C-Mono with R_single and auto-thresholding; confirm stability across semantic layers
  3. Safety concept detection comparison: Implement R_single, R_multi, R_relation on BeaverTails subset; verify Table 2 pattern: R_relation > R_multi > R_single > base SAE across most categories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can AR be extended to automatically induce logical rules directly from data or natural language descriptions, removing the need for manual specification? The authors state that "advances in automated rule induction... can substantially increase the adaptability" and suggest LLMs could generate candidate rules. This remains unresolved as the current framework relies on user-defined rules, limiting scalability.

- **Open Question 2**: Does AR generalize effectively to vision or vision-language models using multimodal sparse autoencoders? The conclusion notes AR is "not limited to a specific modality" and suggests extending it to VLMs. This remains untested as the paper only evaluates AR on text-based LLMs.

- **Open Question 3**: Can the framework automatically select the optimal latent representation type (Single, Multi, or Relational) for specific concepts? The discussion notes AR "currently fixes the representation type per concept" and calls automatic selection a "natural extension." This requires manual tuning currently.

## Limitations

- **SAE feature quality assumptions**: AR's performance heavily depends on SAEs producing interpretable, monosemantic features, but systematic validation is lacking
- **Rule specification burden**: Manual or semi-automated rule creation doesn't scale and introduces human bias
- **Logical reasoning validation scope**: The actual logical inference quality is not independently verified; the mechanism could be functioning as sophisticated pattern matching

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Experimental methodology and implementation details are well-specified with publicly available code and reproducible benchmark results
- **Medium confidence**: Core claims about logical reasoning are supported by experimental results but rely on unexamined assumptions about SAE feature quality
- **Low confidence**: Claims about handling abstract and context-sensitive concepts should be viewed cautiously due to performance limitations on challenging categories

## Next Checks

1. **SAE feature interpretability audit**: Systematically evaluate the monosemanticity and interpretability of SAE features used in AR by human annotators across different contexts

2. **Logical reasoning ablation study**: Create controlled experiment where AR's forward-chaining rules are systematically removed while keeping all other components constant to isolate the reasoning mechanism's contribution

3. **Rule specification scalability test**: Evaluate AR's performance as the number of required rules increases exponentially to quantify practical limitations of manual rule specification
