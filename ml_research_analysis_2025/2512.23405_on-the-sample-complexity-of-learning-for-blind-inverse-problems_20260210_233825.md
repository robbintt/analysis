# On the Sample Complexity of Learning for Blind Inverse Problems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.23405
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23405
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Derived finite-sample error bounds for Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs) in blind inverse problems, showing convergence rates that explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes theoretical foundations for blind inverse problems where the forward operator is unknown or random. The authors derive explicit expressions for LMMSE estimators in this setting and prove their equivalence to Tikhonov-regularized formulations. They analyze approximation error under spectral regularization and provide finite-sample error bounds that characterize estimator performance as a function of noise level, problem conditioning, and sample count. The bounds explicitly quantify how operator randomness affects reconstruction quality and reveal convergence rates as this randomness vanishes.

## Method Summary
The method involves learning an empirical LMMSE estimator from N i.i.d. samples (x_k, y_k) where y_k = A_k x_k + ε_k. The approach computes empirical covariances C_xx and C_yy from training data, then constructs a regularized inverse (C_yy + λI)^(-1) to form the linear operator L̂λ. The theoretical analysis assumes signal distributions satisfying source conditions and operators sharing singular vectors. Error bounds balance approximation error (bias from regularization) and sampling error (variance from finite samples), with explicit dependence on noise level, operator randomness, and sample count.

## Key Results
- Established equivalence between blind LMMSE and Tikhonov-regularized formulations under mild conditions
- Derived finite-sample error bounds showing convergence rates O(1/N) for empirical estimators
- Explicitly quantified the impact of operator randomness through the coefficient of variation of singular values
- Provided theoretical framework for optimal regularization parameter selection balancing bias and variance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The optimal linear recovery in blind inverse problems is equivalent to solving a specific Tikhonov-regularized problem.
- **Mechanism:** LMMSE minimizes expected squared error; the closed-form solution is mathematically identical to minimizing a generalized Tikhonov functional where regularization depends on noise and operator covariances.
- **Core assumption:** Signal and observation distributions have invertible covariance matrices.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 5, Lemma 2.1] proves equivalence between blind LMMSE and Tikhonov solution.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Reconstruction error scales predictably with signal regularity relative to operator.
- **Mechanism:** Under Hölder-type source condition, approximation error scales as (β + λ)^(α/(α+1)), where λ trades off with sampling error.
- **Core assumption:** Signal distribution obeys source condition and operators share singular vectors.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 8, Theorem 3.3] derives explicit error bounds showing dependence on source condition parameter α.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Empirical estimator converges to theoretical LMMSE at rate O(1/N) with high probability.
- **Mechanism:** Matrix Bernstein inequalities bound deviation of empirical covariance matrices from true ones, controlling variance term.
- **Core assumption:** Bounded signals and observations almost surely.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 9, Theorem 3.4] provides high-probability bound dependent on sample count N.

## Foundational Learning

- **Woodbury Matrix Identity**
  - **Why needed here:** Proofs rely on transforming LMMSE expression into Tikhonov solution using this identity to invert complex covariance matrices.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you rewrite (A + UCV)^(-1) in terms of A^(-1)?

- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**
  - **Why needed here:** Uniquely quantifies impact of operator randomness on error bounds using squared CV of singular values.
  - **Quick check question:** How does CV = σ/μ behave as operator randomness decreases?

- **Tikhonov Regularization (Ridge Regression)**
  - **Why needed here:** Frames blind inverse problem as learning optimal Tikhonov regularizer; understanding λ's role is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does adding λI to a matrix ensure invertibility?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Generator -> Moment Estimator -> Regularized Inverter -> Linear Operator
- **Critical path:** Accurate estimation of C_yy is the bottleneck, requiring tracking interaction between signal covariance C_xx and operator covariance C_aa.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - λ Selection: Increasing λ stabilizes inversion but biases approximation; optimal λ depends on unknown regularity parameters.
  - Linearity vs. Accuracy: Sacrifices non-linear expressivity of diffusion/MAP methods for closed-form theoretical guarantees.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Ill-conditioned C_yy: Insufficient samples or low noise with high operator randomness causes inversion to explode.
  - Non-Commuting Operators: Bounds assume shared singular vectors; performance may degrade if real operators lack shared eigenbases.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate Figure 4: Vary source condition parameter α to verify theoretical error slope (β+λ)^(α/(α+1)).
  2. Replicate Figure 6: Run convergence test for varying N ∈ {500, ..., 4000} to confirm O(1/N) sampling error decay.
  3. Stress Test (Operator Variance): Fix N and noise, increase standard deviation of kernel parameters to verify linear growth in reconstruction error.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** Can theoretical analysis extend to nonlinear estimators with sparsity-promoting regularization?
- **Open Question 2:** Can LMMSE estimators be derived under matrix norms while retaining Tikhonov equivalence?
- **Open Question 3:** How do error bounds change when random forward operators don't share identical singular vectors?

## Limitations
- Assumes shared singular vectors between signal and operator covariances, which may not hold in practical scenarios
- Optimal regularization parameter λ depends on unknown problem parameters, requiring heuristic tuning
- Bounds derived under idealized conditions with i.i.d. sampling and bounded signals

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Equivalence between blind LMMSE and Tikhonov regularization (Mechanism 1) is rigorously proven
- **Medium Confidence:** Convergence rate O(1/N) for empirical estimators (Mechanism 3) is well-established
- **Medium Confidence:** Approximation error scaling with source condition regularity (Mechanism 2) depends critically on Hölder assumption

## Next Checks
1. Test theoretical bounds when shared singular vector assumption is violated by introducing operator randomness with independent eigenbases
2. Evaluate cross-distribution generalization by testing LMMSE estimator on signals different from training distribution
3. Systematically vary coefficient of variation of operator singular values to quantify linear growth in reconstruction error and identify practical thresholds
