# From Heuristics to Data: Quantifying Site Planning Layout Indicators with Deep Learning and Multi-Modal Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11723
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11723
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Introduces SPLI system integrating multi-modal urban data to systematically quantify spatial characteristics of urban sites through deep learning and five-dimensional indicators

## Executive Summary
This study introduces the Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a data-driven framework that integrates heterogeneous multi-source urban data to systematically quantify spatial characteristics of urban sites. Traditional site planning relies heavily on experiential judgment and single-source data, limiting the ability to capture complex multifunctional urban layouts. SPLI addresses this by combining OpenStreetMap, POI, building morphology, land use, and satellite imagery to provide structured spatial knowledge.

The system introduces five dimensions—hierarchical building function classification, spatial organization, functional diversity, accessibility to essential services, and land use intensity—to comprehensively characterize urban functional layouts. Data gaps are addressed through deep learning techniques, including Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Experiments demonstrate that SPLI significantly enhances functional classification accuracy, providing a standardized framework for automated, data-driven urban spatial analytics and supporting future intelligent urban planning applications.

## Method Summary
The SPLI framework integrates heterogeneous urban data sources (OSM, POI, building morphology, land use, satellite imagery) and processes them through a multi-step pipeline. Data preprocessing aligns all spatial layers to EPSG:3414 coordinate system, computes building footprints and centroids, and filters out irrelevant structures. An R-tree spatial indexing approach constructs adjacency relationships for graph construction. The core prediction engine uses Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) with multi-layer architecture for building function classification. Five parallel indicator calculators process the classified data to compute spatial organization patterns, functional diversity (Simpson Index), accessibility metrics, and land use intensity measures (FAR, BCR). Outputs are stored as GeoJSON files for GIS integration.

## Key Results
- SPLI significantly enhances functional classification accuracy through multi-modal data integration
- Five-dimensional indicator system provides standardized quantitative framework for cross-regional urban spatial comparison
- RGCN effectively handles heterogeneous urban spatial relationships for building function prediction
- Systematic integration of heterogeneous data sources enables automated, data-driven urban spatial analytics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-modal data integration improves urban functional classification accuracy compared to single-source approaches.
- Mechanism: Heterogeneous data sources (OSM, POI, building morphology, land use, satellite imagery) provide complementary spatial signals that compensate for individual data gaps and capture different aspects of urban functional complexity. The fusion creates a richer feature representation than any single source alone.
- Core assumption: The correlations between different data modalities (e.g., POI density and building function) are stable and generalizable across urban contexts.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "integrating... heterogeneous multi-source data, transforming it into structured urban spatial knowledge"; [section 4.2] "integrates land use data, building morphology data, and points of interest (POI) data, employing a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN)"
- Break condition: Classification accuracy degrades when data modalities have significant temporal misalignment (e.g., outdated POI data with recent building morphology).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) effectively handle heterogeneous urban spatial relationships for building function prediction.
- Mechanism: RGCN extends standard GNN by incorporating edge-type-specific weight matrices, allowing the model to learn distinct relationship patterns between different entity types (buildings, roads, facilities, land parcels). This enables the model to capture functional dependencies (e.g., commercial buildings near transit nodes).
- Core assumption: The spatial graph structure adequately represents functional relationships; missing or incorrect edge definitions will degrade performance.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Data gaps are addressed through deep learning techniques such as Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN)"; [section 2.2] "RGCN incorporates different types of edge weights, effectively capturing complex associations among buildings, facilities, roads, and land uses"
- Break condition: Performance plateaus or declines when graph density exceeds model capacity (too many edge types without sufficient training data per type).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The five-dimensional SPLI indicator system provides a standardized quantitative framework that enables cross-regional urban spatial comparison.
- Mechanism: By decomposing urban spatial characteristics into five orthogonal dimensions (functional typology, spatial organization, functional diversity, accessibility, land use intensity), each with defined computational methods, the system creates comparable metrics across different planning contexts and scales.
- Core assumption: The selected five dimensions capture the essential variance in urban functional layouts; omitted dimensions (e.g., temporal dynamics, socio-economic factors) do not significantly affect classification outcomes.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "introduces five dimensions... to comprehensively characterize urban functional layouts"; [section 3.4] "SPLI introduces five key dimensions... FAR and BCR... Functional Ratio (FR) and Simpson Index (SI)"
- Break condition: Indicators fail to distinguish between functionally different areas when land use types have similar morphological signatures (e.g., light industrial vs. creative office spaces).

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) fundamentals
- Why needed here: The core prediction engine uses RGCN to classify building functions. Understanding message passing, node embeddings, and graph convolution operations is essential for debugging and extending the model.
- Quick check question: Can you explain how a GNN aggregates information from neighboring nodes and why this is useful for spatial prediction tasks?

### Concept: Spatial data coordinate systems and preprocessing
- Why needed here: The paper explicitly uses EPSG:3414 (Singapore projected coordinate system) for data alignment. Multi-source integration requires consistent spatial referencing.
- Quick check question: Why must all spatial layers be transformed to a common projected coordinate system before computing spatial relationships?

### Concept: Urban planning indicators (FAR, BCR, Simpson Index)
- Why needed here: The SPLI framework outputs these standard metrics. Understanding their definitions and planning implications is necessary to validate results and communicate with domain experts.
- Quick check question: What does a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 4.0 indicate about land development intensity, and how does it differ from Building Coverage Ratio (BCR)?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Data Layer: OSM, POI, building morphology, land use, satellite imagery → preprocessing pipeline (coordinate alignment, missing value imputation) → Graph Construction: R-tree spatial indexing → adjacency relationships → heterogeneous graph (nodes: buildings/plots; edges: spatial/functional relationships) → Model Layer: RGCN with multi-layer architecture (ReLU, Dropout) → building function classification at hierarchy Level 2 → Indicator Computation: Five parallel calculators (spatial organization, functional diversity, accessibility, land use intensity) → Output: GeoJSON files integrated with GIS for visualization

### Critical path:
1. Data preprocessing (coordinate alignment is most common failure point)
2. Graph construction (spatial threshold selection determines edge density)
3. RGCN training (500 epochs with cross-validation)
4. Hierarchical refinement (Level 2 → Level 3 using rule-based geometric criteria)

### Design tradeoffs:
- Plot-level vs. building-level analysis: Paper chooses plot-level for planning relevance but may miss intra-plot functional heterogeneity.
- Static vs. dynamic indicators: Current implementation is static; temporal dynamics (land use changes over time) are not captured.
- Rule-based vs. learned spatial organization classification: Layout patterns use geometric rules; could be replaced with learned classifiers for more flexibility.

### Failure signatures:
- BCR values exceeding 1.0: Caused by data artifacts where protruding structures (porches, walkways) are counted in building footprints. Paper notes these should be excluded from analysis.
- Null Layout_Pattern values for single-building plots: Expected behavior, not a bug.
- Low PTA scores in industrial/port areas: Reflects actual transit gaps, not model failure.

### First 3 experiments:
1. Replicate the Queenstown case study: Download Singapore Master Plan 2019 data, preprocess to EPSG:3414, run the full pipeline, and compare indicator distributions against Figure 8-17.
2. Ablation study on data modalities: Train RGCN with subsets of data sources (e.g., POI only vs. POI + morphology) to quantify each modality's contribution to classification accuracy.
3. Transfer test to different urban context: Apply the trained model to a different Singapore subzone or another city with available OSM/POI data to assess generalization and identify where the five-dimensional indicators diverge from expected patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the SPLI framework be integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate spatial reasoning and natural language queries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion and Section 6.3 explicitly propose leveraging LLMs and RAG to transform SPLI data into actionable design strategies and support natural language queries (e.g., identifying plots based on criteria).
- Why unresolved: Current LLMs primarily rely on text and lack deep spatial reasoning capabilities; the structured Function-based Knowledge Graph (FKG) required to bridge SPLI data with LLMs is proposed but not yet developed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A functional prototype where an LLM accurately retrieves SPLI indicators to answer complex spatial planning queries without hallucination.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the static SPLI framework be extended to incorporate spatiotemporal data to enable dynamic, adaptive land-use adjustments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6.1 notes the limitation of static datasets in capturing dynamic urban evolution, and Section 6.2 calls for spatiotemporal forecasting techniques to enhance adaptability.
- Why unresolved: The current methodology relies on static snapshots (OSM, satellite imagery) and lacks the mechanisms to process temporal variations in activity or functional usage over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified framework utilizing spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GCNs) that can successfully model and predict temporal shifts in land-use intensity or functional diversity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does integrating SPLI with environmental-climatic and socio-economic datasets improve the accuracy of urban microclimate regulation and habitability assessments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6.4 outlines the future potential of fusing SPLI with these datasets to refine Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification and support policy-making.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses on morphological and functional spatial attributes but has not yet validated the correlation between these layout indicators and environmental or socio-economic outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative analysis showing strong correlations between specific SPLI layout patterns and measurable improvements in environmental metrics (e.g., heat island reduction) or social metrics.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability testing beyond Queenstown case study; performance on cities with different urban forms remains unknown.
- Static snapshot approach misses temporal dynamics of land use change and urban evolution.
- Five-dimensional indicator system may omit relevant factors (e.g., socio-economic indicators, environmental performance metrics).

## Confidence
- Multi-modal fusion improves accuracy: **Medium** - supported by methodology but lacks comparative ablation studies in the paper.
- RGCN effectively handles heterogeneous urban relationships: **Low** - mechanism is plausible but no direct comparative evidence against alternative models.
- Five-dimensional framework enables standardized cross-regional comparison: **High** - well-defined computational methods and orthogonal dimensions provide theoretical foundation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study removing individual data modalities to quantify each source's contribution to classification accuracy.
2. Apply SPLI framework to a different urban context (e.g., another Singapore subzone or international city) to test generalization limits.
3. Compare RGCN performance against standard GNN and non-graph baseline models to validate the advantage of relational modeling for urban classification.
