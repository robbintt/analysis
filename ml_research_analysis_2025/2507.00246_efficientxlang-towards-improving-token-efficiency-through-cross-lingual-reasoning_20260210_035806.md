core_contribution: This work investigates whether reasoning in languages other than
  English can improve token efficiency without sacrificing accuracy in large reasoning
  language models (RLMs). Experiments on three RLMs (DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5, and Qwen
  3) across seven typologically diverse languages and four math datasets show that
  multilingual reasoning consistently reduces token usage by 20-40% while maintaining
  comparable accuracy.

# EfficientXLang: Towards Improving Token Efficiency Through Cross-Lingual Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.00246
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00246
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Multilingual reasoning reduces token usage by 20-40% while maintaining accuracy

## Executive Summary
This work investigates whether reasoning in languages other than English can improve token efficiency without sacrificing accuracy in large reasoning language models (RLMs). Experiments on three RLMs (DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5, and Qwen 3) across seven typologically diverse languages and four math datasets show that multilingual reasoning consistently reduces token usage by 20-40% while maintaining comparable accuracy. This efficiency gain persists even after translating reasoning traces back to English, indicating genuine improvements in reasoning behavior rather than linguistic effects. The extent of improvement depends on the model's multilingual strength, with stronger multilingual models showing better performance and token efficiency in non-English languages.

## Method Summary
The study systematically evaluates multilingual reasoning efficiency by prompting three RLMs to solve math problems in seven typologically diverse languages. Researchers compare token usage and accuracy against English-only reasoning, then translate reasoning traces back to English to verify that efficiency gains reflect genuine reasoning improvements rather than language-specific effects. The evaluation spans four math datasets and includes models with varying multilingual capabilities to test the relationship between multilingual strength and reasoning efficiency.

## Key Results
- Multilingual reasoning reduces token usage by 20-40% across all tested models and languages
- Accuracy remains comparable to English-only reasoning despite significant token savings
- Efficiency gains persist when reasoning traces are translated back to English
- Stronger multilingual models show better performance and token efficiency in non-English languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The efficiency gains likely stem from language-specific cognitive pathways and expression patterns that enable more concise reasoning representations. Different languages may offer more direct ways to express certain mathematical concepts or logical relationships, reducing the need for verbose explanations. Additionally, the cognitive shift of working in a non-native language may promote more deliberate and focused reasoning processes, eliminating unnecessary elaboration common in English reasoning traces.

## Foundational Learning
- **Token efficiency:** Why needed - core metric for evaluating reasoning cost-effectiveness; Quick check - measure tokens per problem across languages
- **Multilingual reasoning:** Why needed - enables cross-linguistic efficiency comparisons; Quick check - verify model understands reasoning instructions in target language
- **Reasoning trace translation:** Why needed - validates that efficiency gains reflect actual reasoning improvements; Quick check - compare translated traces for semantic equivalence
- **Typological diversity:** Why needed - ensures findings generalize across language families; Quick check - include languages from different families (Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, etc.)

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Input problem -> Language routing -> Reasoning engine -> Token counter -> Accuracy evaluator -> Trace translator
**Critical path:** Problem input → Multilingual reasoning generation → Token counting → Accuracy assessment → English translation verification
**Design tradeoffs:** Language switching overhead vs. token savings, multilingual model capability requirements, translation accuracy impact on verification
**Failure signatures:** Increased token usage in non-English, accuracy drops in multilingual reasoning, translation artifacts obscuring efficiency gains
**3 first experiments:** 1) Baseline English reasoning efficiency measurement, 2) Single-language multilingual reasoning test, 3) Trace translation fidelity validation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings based on seven typologically diverse languages and four math-focused datasets
- Limited evaluation of reasoning quality beyond accuracy metrics
- Unclear scalability to non-mathematical reasoning tasks and broader domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** 20-40% token reduction with maintained accuracy is well-supported
- **Medium confidence:** Relationship between multilingual strength and efficiency gains needs more systematic validation
- **Low confidence:** Practical significance and real-world application scalability not thoroughly explored

## Next Checks
1. Test multilingual reasoning efficiency on non-mathematical reasoning tasks (code generation, logical reasoning, commonsense reasoning)
2. Conduct ablation studies varying reasoning trace translation timing to isolate language switching impact
3. Evaluate broader language families including low-resource languages and different script systems
