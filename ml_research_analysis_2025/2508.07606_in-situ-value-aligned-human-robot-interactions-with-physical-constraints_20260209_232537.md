# In-situ Value-aligned Human-Robot Interactions with Physical Constraints

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.07606
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07606
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ICLHF framework integrates human preferences with physical constraints via in-context learning, achieving 0.95 preference accuracy and 93.33% application accuracy in household task planning.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a framework for enabling robots to perform household tasks while respecting both human preferences and physical constraints. The core innovation is In-Context Learning from Human Feedback (ICLHF), which allows robots to learn personalized preferences through textual feedback without fine-tuning the underlying language model. The approach combines symbolic planning from a large language model with geometric instantiation from a pose synthesizer, creating a dual-loop system that iteratively refines plans based on both physical execution feedback and human preference adjustments.

## Method Summary
The ICLHF framework uses GPT-3.5 Turbo for symbolic task planning, outputting scene graphs that describe object relationships. A customized POG (Planning on Scene Graphs) algorithm then synthesizes geometric poses using stochastic optimization with custom loss functions for Manhattan distance, area, and orthogonality. The system operates through dual feedback loops: physical feedback from execution (collisions, stability) and human preference feedback (direct instructions or adjustments). When context limits are reached, the system performs "profiling" to summarize specific preferences into generalized rules, creating a hierarchical preference structure that enables better generalization across scenarios.

## Key Results
- ICLHF achieves 0.95 preference learning accuracy versus 0.47 without in-context learning
- Plan feasibility improves from 8.44 to 12.98 with ICLHF
- Preference application accuracy reaches 85.49% versus 66.67% without ICLHF
- POG pose synthesizer achieves 100% success rate versus 56.67% for LLM-GROP in geometric instantiation
- Framework successfully handles 5-10 objects in complex household scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: In-Context Preference Accumulation Without Fine-Tuning
ICLHF accumulates human preferences through prompt context updates rather than weight updates, allowing the LLM to retrieve relevant preference precedents during planning without task-specific training.

### Mechanism 2: Dual-Loop Feedback Integration
Separate but coordinated feedback loops optimize physical feasibility and preference alignment in parallel, reconciling constraints at the symbolic planning level before geometric instantiation.

### Mechanism 3: Hierarchical Preference Abstraction via Periodic Introspection
When context limits are reached, the LLM summarizes concrete feedback into generalized preference rules, creating a hierarchical structure where higher-level preferences are more generalizable across scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Scene Graphs for Task Planning**
  - Why needed: LLM outputs symbolic scene graphs (nodes=objects with attributes, edges=relationships) rather than direct coordinates
  - Quick check: Can you explain how a scene graph representing "mug on coaster on table" differs from direct pose coordinates for the mug?

- **Concept: In-Context Learning in LLMs**
  - Why needed: ICLHF's core innovation uses in-context learning rather than fine-tuning
  - Quick check: If an LLM has seen "put fragile items in soft containers" in its context, how does it apply this to a new object category not in training data?

- **Concept: Stochastic Optimization for Pose Synthesis**
  - Why needed: Pose synthesizer uses optimization (POG algorithm) with custom loss functions
  - Quick check: Given the L_manhattan loss function, what arrangement of three objects minimizes this cost?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** LLM Planner (GPT-3.5 Turbo) -> Pose Synthesizer (POG-based) -> Motion Planner -> Execution -> [Physical Feedback + Preference Feedback] -> Context Update -> Replan if needed

- **Critical path:** Task instruction + initial state → LLM classification → symbolic scene graph → pose optimization → motion planning → execution → [physical feedback + preference feedback] → context update → replan if needed

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LLM vs. POG for pose synthesis: POG achieves 100% success rate vs. LLM-GROP's 56.67% for 3-5 objects
  - Context retention vs. profiling: Longer context preserves detail but increases cost and may hit limits
  - Separate feedback loops vs. unified reward: Text-based feedback preserves preference diversity better than scalar rewards

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Hallucinated actions when object count increases without in-context learning
  - Stability failures from physically implausible relationships
  - Context overflow causing loss of earlier preference instances
  - Generalization failures with scenario-specific preferences

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline preference application: Run table tidying with 5-10 objects, compare ICLHF vs. no-ICL on preference learning score
  2. Physical feedback loop validation: Inject collision scenarios, measure whether feedback correctly modifies LLM plans
  3. Profiling trigger test: Force context to token limit with repetitive feedback, verify hierarchical summarization occurs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How can the framework be extended to incorporate continuous kinodynamic constraints in full motion planning?
2. To what extent does the "periodic introspection" mechanism retain low-level nuances when summarizing preferences?
3. How does the system disambiguate between genuine preference signals and unintentional or noisy human adjustments?

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on synthetic simulations rather than real human subjects
- Preference learning mechanism depends on a single LLM without ablation studies on different models
- Context management strategy for preference accumulation is underspecified
- Physical constraint validation uses simplified metrics that may not capture complex real-world dynamics

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Physical constraint integration with POG synthesizer (quantified success rates and collision statistics)
- **Medium Confidence**: Preference learning effectiveness in simulated environment (results show improvement but lack real human validation)
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization claims and hierarchical preference abstraction (based on limited scenario testing)

## Next Checks
1. **Real Human Validation**: Conduct user studies with actual human subjects providing preference feedback across multiple household tasks, measuring both objective success metrics and subjective satisfaction scores.

2. **Context Management Stress Test**: Systematically test the preference accumulation mechanism by generating tasks that approach context limits, verifying that profiling correctly summarizes preferences and maintains performance across extended interaction sequences.

3. **Cross-Scenario Transfer**: Design experiments that explicitly test whether preferences learned in one household context successfully transfer to semantically similar but physically distinct scenarios.
