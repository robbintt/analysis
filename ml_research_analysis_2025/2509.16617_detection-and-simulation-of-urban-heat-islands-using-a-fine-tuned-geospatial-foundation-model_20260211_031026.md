# Detection and Simulation of Urban Heat Islands Using a Fine-Tuned Geospatial Foundation Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.16617
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16617
- **Reference count:** 7
- **One-line primary result:** Fine-tuned geospatial foundation model achieves <1.74°C MAE for urban heat island prediction and simulation.

## Executive Summary
This study fine-tunes a geospatial foundation model to predict urban land surface temperatures and simulate urban heat island effects under future climate scenarios. The model, trained on Landsat 8 imagery and ERA5 temperature data, achieves pixel-wise downscaling errors below 1.74°C and demonstrates extrapolation capacity up to 3.62°C. Evaluated in Brașov, Romania, the model shows strong performance across different land cover types, with the lowest error (1.31°C) for flooded vegetation and robust results for built areas (1.98°C). The approach offers a promising alternative for urban climate modeling where traditional methods face data and generalization limitations.

## Method Summary
The study fine-tunes a pre-trained geospatial foundation model (IBM Granite Geospatial LST) using Landsat 8 spectral bands (1-6) and ERA5-Land 2-meter air temperature data for the city of Brașov, Romania (2013-2023). The model is trained with a high-heat scenario approach, using data below the 90th percentile temperature (≤ 23.29°C) and testing on the top 10% to evaluate extrapolation capability. Fine-tuning uses TerraTorch framework with AdamW optimizer (learning rate 6×10⁻⁵), batch size 16, and GeLU activation for up to 100 epochs. The model is then used to simulate land cover change effects through inpainting techniques, swapping urban pixels with forest pixels to assess cooling impacts.

## Key Results
- Achieved pixel-wise downscaling errors below 1.74°C on high-heat hold-out set
- Demonstrated extrapolation capacity up to 3.62°C beyond training temperature range
- Lowest prediction error (1.31°C) for flooded vegetation, robust performance for built areas (1.98°C)
- Forest pixel insertions reduced predicted LST while urban pixels increased it, validating spatial influence capture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The model generalizes to unseen urban environments by leveraging pre-trained spatial features rather than requiring city-specific training from scratch. A Geospatial Foundation Model (GFM) pre-trained on global unstructured data learns universal representations of surface structures (buildings, trees). During fine-tuning, these features are aligned with local temperature labels, allowing the model to infer LST patterns in new cities using minimal local data. This works because spectral and structural characteristics of target cities share sufficient similarity with the global pre-training distribution.

### Mechanism 2
The model simulates local cooling/heating effects by capturing the spatial influence of land cover changes on neighboring pixels. Using a Vision Transformer backbone, the model utilizes attention mechanisms to weigh relationships between target pixels and their context. When pixels are swapped via inpainting, attention recalculates thermal influence on surrounding areas, simulating microclimate effects. This captures physical diffusion of heat and correlation between land cover adjacency and temperature.

### Mechanism 3
The model predicts future extreme heat by extrapolating beyond training distribution up to a defined temperature limit. By holding out top 10% of temperature values during training, the model learns a continuous regression function mapping spectral inputs to temperature. It projects this learned trend into higher temperature ranges without having explicitly seen those specific LST values in the local training set, assuming the relationship between spectral bands and temperature remains consistent even at extremes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Masked Autoencoding (MAE)**
  - Why needed: The Prithvi GFM uses MAE (masking image patches and reconstructing them) to learn semantic representations. Key to debugging why the model might prioritize scene reconstruction over physical causality.
  - Quick check: Does the model's loss function penalize inability to reconstruct spectral indices (NDBI/NDWI), or only raw pixel values?

- **Land Surface Temperature (LST) vs. Air Temperature (T2M)**
  - Why needed: The paper adapts a model designed for T2M to predict LST. These are physically distinct; LST is highly sensitive to material composition, whereas T2M is influenced by air mixing.
  - Quick check: Are we evaluating against satellite-derived LST or weather station T2M, and does training data (ERA5) align with target variable type?

- **Inpainting & Spectral Indices**
  - Why needed: The simulation strategy relies on modifying spectral bands to represent land cover changes. Understanding how indices like NDVI and NDBI are calculated from Landsat bands is essential for designing valid simulation experiments.
  - Quick check: If we increase the Red band to simulate urbanization, are we inadvertently altering NDVI in a way that contradicts the physical reality we intend to model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Landsat 8 Bands 1-6 + ERA5 T2M -> Prithvi GFM (ViT/Swin) -> Unified regression head -> LST predictions
- **Critical path:** Data Alignment (pair Landsat with ERA5) -> Fine-Tuning (train regression head with TerraTorch) -> Simulation/Inference (modify inputs via inpainting and run forward pass)
- **Design tradeoffs:** Generalization vs. Physical Realism (generalizes well but lacks physical constraints), Zero-shot vs. Fine-tuning (zero-shot MAE ~1.95-2.81, fine-tuning reduces to ~1.74)
- **Failure signatures:** Spectral Blindness (fails to change LST appropriately when NDBI/NDWI modified), Extrapolation Ceiling (unreliable predictions if temperature inputs exceed training distribution by >3.62°C)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Run pre-trained GFM (V1 and V2) on Brașov without fine-tuning to establish zero-shot error baseline (MAE)
  2. High-Heat Extrapolation: Train on data <90th percentile temperature and test on top 10% to verify if model can predict temperatures 3.62°C beyond training range
  3. Physical Consistency Check (Inpainting): Swap "Urban" pixels with "Forest" pixels in bounded area and measure LST change inside vs. outside to verify spatial cooling effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can integrating physics-informed constraints or alternative architectures resolve the model's limited responsiveness to spectral indices like NDBI and NDWI? The authors note the model fails to capture physical relationships in spectral indices and suggest exploring "domain-specific constraints" and "physics-informed models."

- Can the fine-tuned GFM maintain low pixel-wise downscaling errors when transferred to cities with different hydroclimatic zones and urban structures without city-specific recalibration? The paper explicitly lists "transferability" as a limitation, noting the model was only fine-tuned on Brașov without evaluation in other regions.

- How can inpainting simulation methods be advanced to incorporate dynamic physical constraints to improve realism of land cover change scenarios? The Outlook suggests "more advanced inpainting methods" are needed to incorporate "typical urban growth patterns and physical constraints" ignored by current static assumptions.

## Limitations
- Limited responsiveness to spectral indices (NDBI/NDWI) suggests the model relies on raw bands rather than derived physical indices
- Extrapolation performance beyond 3.62°C remains untested and may degrade rapidly
- Only evaluated in a single city (Brașov), limiting generalizability claims

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Pixel-wise temperature prediction accuracy (MAE < 1.74°C) and baseline generalization to new urban environments
- **Medium Confidence:** Extrapolation capability to future heat scenarios (up to 3.62°C) based on limited hold-out testing
- **Low Confidence:** Physical consistency of land cover simulation results, particularly regarding spectral index modifications

## Next Checks
1. **Physical Index Responsiveness:** Systematically test model predictions against controlled modifications of NDVI, NDBI, and NDWI to quantify gap between spectral and physical representations
2. **Extreme Climate Extrapolation:** Extend testing to temperatures 4-6°C beyond training distribution to establish clear performance degradation boundaries
3. **Cross-City Generalization:** Validate model performance on a second, climatically distinct urban area (e.g., tropical vs. temperate) to test universality of pre-trained features
