# DAMAGE: Detecting Adversarially Modified AI Generated Text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.03437
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03437
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Robust AI detector achieves 98.26% TPR on humanized text with 3.40% FPR, outperforming baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of detecting AI-generated text that has been modified by humanizer tools designed to evade AI detection. The authors qualitatively analyze 19 humanizers and categorize them into three tiers based on quality. They find that many existing detectors fail to identify humanized text. To solve this, they develop a robust AI detector using a data-centric augmentation approach, treating humanization as a learned invariance rather than a separate domain. They demonstrate that their detector generalizes well, even when attacked by a detector-specific fine-tuned humanizer. Results show their model achieves high true positive rates (98.26% on humanized academic text) while maintaining a low false positive rate (3.40%), outperforming baselines like GPTZero and Binoculars. The study concludes that robust AI detection is possible by incorporating diverse humanizer data during training.

## Method Summary
The approach uses Mistral NeMo (~12B parameters) with a linear classification head on the final token hidden state, fine-tuned with LoRA adapters while keeping the base frozen. Training data includes both human and AI documents processed through high-quality (L1) humanizers, with humanized human documents labeled as "human" to teach invariance to the humanization process itself. The model uses weighted cross-entropy loss, AdamW optimizer, and early stopping. Humanizer data is heavily oversampled (18x) despite comprising only ~0.68% of the final dataset. The approach includes active learning with hard negative mining to reduce false positives.

## Key Results
- Achieves 98.26% TPR on humanized academic text at 5% FPR, outperforming GPTZero (28.23% TPR) and Binoculars (65.28% TPR)
- Maintains 3.40% FPR on human text, comparable to best existing detectors
- Shows 93.2% detection rate against a detector-specific adversarial humanizer fine-tuned to evade detection
- Ablation studies demonstrate that treating humanization as invariance (rather than separate domain) improves performance from 96.83% to 98.26% TPR

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Augmenting training data with high-quality (L1) humanizer outputs improves detection of humanized AI text while preserving low false positive rates.
- Mechanism: The model learns features invariant to paraphrasing transformations by seeing both human and AI documents processed through humanizers during training. Including only L1 humanizers (those that preserve fluency) prevents the model from learning spurious features like grammatical errors or nonsensical text.
- Core assumption: High-quality humanizers share transformation patterns with lower-quality ones, so learning invariance to L1 humanizers transfers to L2/L3.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "demonstrate a robust model that can detect humanized AI text while maintaining a low false positive rate using a data-centric augmentation approach"
  - [Section 5.4] "including only L1 humanizers (the high quality humanizers) allows us to maintain a low false positive rate"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—related work on adversarial text detection exists but limited corpus data on data-centric augmentation specifically for humanizer robustness.
- Break condition: If novel humanizers introduce fundamentally different transformation patterns not represented in L1 training data, generalization may degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Labeling humanized human documents as "human" (rather than AI) teaches the model to be invariant to humanization transformations regardless of source.
- Mechanism: By treating humanization as a data augmentation transform applied to both classes—rather than treating humanized text as its own domain—the model learns that humanization itself is not a discriminative signal for AI authorship.
- Core assumption: The key discriminative signal lies in properties of the original AI generation, not the humanization process itself.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 5.4] "we choose to label them as human...we treat the model's response to humanization as an invariance rather than only including the AI humanized documents as a separate domain"
  - [Table 8] Ablation shows "Unbalanced" condition (without human-humanized text) drops humanized AI TPR from 98.26% to 96.83%
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; this invariance training approach appears novel in this specific application.
- Break condition: If humanization removes or fundamentally alters the original AI signal, this approach cannot recover detection capability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-humanizer generalization emerges from learning robust features that persist across diverse paraphrasing methods, including adversarially optimized humanizers.
- Mechanism: Training on diverse L1 humanizers exposes the model to a wide range of paraphrasing strategies. When attacked with a detector-specific fine-tuned humanizer, the model still detects 93.2% of samples because the underlying LLM generating the paraphrase leaves detectable patterns that fine-tuning cannot fully erase.
- Core assumption: The language model underlying humanizers retains detectable signatures even after fine-tuning for evasion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 7.2] "the detector is still able to detect 93.2% of the humanized AI samples...the underlying language model of the humanizer still leaves behind detectable patterns"
  - [abstract] "show that our detector's cross-humanizer generalization is sufficient to remain robust to this attack"
  - [corpus] Related work (RADAR, DIPPER) demonstrates adversarial training between detectors and paraphrasers, supporting plausibility.
- Break condition: If humanizers use architectures or techniques fundamentally different from LLM-based paraphrasing, learned invariances may not transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Perplexity-based vs. deep learning detection
  - Why needed here: The paper positions its approach against both paradigms; perplexity methods (DetectGPT, Binoculars) fail dramatically on humanized text (28.23% TPR), while deep learning with augmentation succeeds.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why paraphrasing specifically disrupts perplexity-based detection more than deep learning approaches?

- Concept: Data augmentation as invariance learning
  - Why needed here: The core innovation is treating humanization as a transformation to become invariant to, not a separate classification domain.
  - Quick check question: If you augmented with humanized AI text but labeled it as a third class, what would the model learn instead?

- Concept: Adversarial robustness in classification
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly attacks its own detector to test robustness; understanding the adversarial threat model is critical for evaluating claims.
  - Quick check question: Why does training a humanizer against a fixed detector not guarantee evasion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Human-written corpus -> Synthetic AI mirrors -> L1 humanizer processing -> Chunking (~300 words) -> Binary classification (AI/human) -> Mistral NeMo + LoRA -> Linear classification head on final token hidden state

- Critical path:
  1. Collect human-written corpus (pre-2022 sources across domains)
  2. Generate synthetic AI mirrors using diverse LLMs with mirror prompts
  3. Pass both human and AI documents through L1 humanizers
  4. Chunk humanized documents to ~300 words
  5. Label humanized human as "human," humanized AI as "AI"
  6. Oversample humanizer data 18x (comprises ~0.68% of final dataset)
  7. Train with LoRA fine-tuning on frozen base
  8. Run hard negative mining (active learning) for false positive reduction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Including only L1 humanizers trades coverage of humanizer diversity for false positive rate stability
  - Small humanizer data volume (~0.68%) compensated by heavy oversampling (18x)
  - 512-token context window constrains to short-range features but improves inference efficiency
  - Labeling humanized human text as human prioritizes invariance over theoretical label accuracy

- Failure signatures:
  - High false positive rate on human text → likely included L2/L3 humanizers that introduce artifacts
  - Poor generalization to new humanizer → training L1 set may lack transformation diversity
  - Degraded performance on adversarial humanizer → may need retraining with adversarial samples

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the ablation: train with all humanizers (L1+L2+L3) vs. L1 only and measure FPR difference on human text
  2. Test cross-humanizer generalization: hold out one L1 humanizer from training, evaluate detection rate on its outputs
  3. Implement the adversarial attack: fine-tune GPT-4o on false negatives, measure detector degradation before and after

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the detector maintain robustness against a detector-specific adversarial humanizer that produces high-fluency (L1 quality) text rather than the lower-quality (L2) text generated in the authors' attack experiment?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] In Section 7.3, the authors note that their custom detector-specific attack resulted in text with a fluency win rate of only 14.13%, roughly equivalent to an average L2 (medium quality) humanizer.
- Why unresolved: The authors demonstrated robustness against a specific fine-tuned attack, but that attack produced text of notably lower quality than the best commercial tools (L1).
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from an adversarial optimization loop (like DPO or fine-tuning) that successfully constrains the attack model to maintain high fluency (similar to L1) while attempting to evade detection.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is it possible to train a model robust to all tiers of humanizers (L1, L2, and L3) without compromising the false positive rate (FPR) on human text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 5.4: "if we include all humanizers in the augmentation, our precision (i.e. false positive rate) is significantly compromised." Table 8 confirms that the "All-Humanizers" model has nearly double the FPR (6.00%) of the final L1-only model (3.47%).
- Why unresolved: The current solution relies on a data curation strategy (filtering for L1 only) to maintain precision, rather than a model architecture or training methodology that can inherently handle the noise of lower-quality humanizers without overfitting.
- What evidence would resolve it: A training run incorporating L2 and L3 data that achieves an FPR comparable to the current L1-only model (approx. 3.5%) while maintaining high recall.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the proposed data-centric augmentation approach generalize to non-academic domains, such as creative writing, code, or technical documentation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors focus on academic text because humanizers are "primarily marketed at students." The evaluation datasets (Table 6) consist almost exclusively of student essays (PERSUADE, ELLIPSE, etc.), and the training augmentation uses Fineweb-EDU as a proxy for student writing.
- Why unresolved: The model's performance is benchmarked solely on student-level academic prose. It is unclear if the "invariance" learned from educational text transfers to domains where the syntax, vocabulary, and structure differ significantly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark results on the RAID dataset's non-academic domains (e.g., creative writing, code, reviews) or specifically constructed out-of-domain datasets for humanized text.

## Limitations

- Limited humanizer diversity in training: Only L1 humanizers used for augmentation, potentially leaving model vulnerable to novel transformation strategies
- Small effective humanizer training volume: Humanizer-augmented data comprises only ~0.68% of final training corpus despite 18x oversampling
- Context window constraints: 512-token limit may miss long-range dependencies critical for distinguishing AI authorship
- Detector-specific adversarial attack limitations: Single humanizer attack may not represent full space of adversarial strategies

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Claims about effectiveness of invariance-based training approach (Mechanism 2) are well-supported by ablation studies showing degraded performance when humanized human text is excluded. False positive rate maintenance (3.40% FPR) is directly measured.

**Medium confidence**: Cross-humanizer generalization claim (Mechanism 3) is supported by results against one adversarial humanizer but lacks testing against broader range of transformation strategies. L1 training transfer to L2/L3 remains theoretical.

**Low confidence**: Claim that excluding L2/L3 humanizers preserves FPR stability (Mechanism 1) is based on observed correlation rather than controlled experiments testing whether novel L2/L3 humanizers can be detected by L1-only trained model.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-tier humanizer validation**: Hold out all L2 and L3 humanizers from training corpus, then evaluate detection rates specifically on their outputs to test whether L1-only training provides sufficient coverage of transformation patterns.

2. **Full-length document evaluation**: Test detector on complete academic essays (1500-2000 words) rather than truncated ~300-word chunks to establish whether 512-token context window imposes meaningful limitations on real-world applicability.

3. **Multi-adversary attack robustness**: Implement ensemble adversarial attack using 3-5 different humanizers fine-tuned against detector to assess whether 93.2% single-attack robustness holds under more sophisticated adversarial pressure.
