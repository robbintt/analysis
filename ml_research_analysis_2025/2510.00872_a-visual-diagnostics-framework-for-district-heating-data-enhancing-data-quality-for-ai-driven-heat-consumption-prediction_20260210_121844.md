# A Visual Diagnostics Framework for District Heating Data: Enhancing Data Quality for AI-Driven Heat Consumption Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.00872
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00872
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Primary result:** A visual dashboard framework using Python and Dash successfully identifies data quality issues in district heating meter data, supporting LSTM/GRU model training by enabling human analysts to detect anomalies, missing values, and temporal inconsistencies.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a visual diagnostics framework designed to assess data quality in district heating systems prior to AI model training. The framework employs an interactive web-based dashboard built with Python's Dash and Plotly libraries, enabling human experts to visually inspect sensor data for anomalies, missing values, and temporal inconsistencies. Applied to a real-world Danish dataset of over 6,900 meters spanning four years, the approach uncovered critical data quality issues such as seasonal dropout patterns, extreme outliers, and negative consumption values. The methodology emphasizes the importance of human-in-the-loop analytics for nuanced data interpretation and supports the reliability of LSTM and GRU models by improving data trustworthiness.

## Method Summary
The framework uses Python-based visualizations within a web dashboard to assess district heating metering data quality. Data is stored in DuckDB for efficient querying and processed using Pandas and NumPy. Key statistical metrics include the Modified Z-score (using MAD) for anomaly detection and Medcouple for robust skewness. The dashboard features interactive time-series plots, heatmaps, box plots, and gauge indicators to visualize data quality KPIs. The system is designed to flag issues for human review rather than automatically clean data, supporting the preparation of high-quality datasets for AI-driven heat consumption prediction models.

## Key Results
- Successfully identified seasonal dropout patterns, extreme outliers, and negative consumption values in a 4-year dataset from 6,923 meters.
- Modified Z-score and MAD effectively flagged anomalies in noisy sensor data.
- Heatmap visualizations revealed missing data patterns correlated with seasonal consumption trends.
- Framework supports human-in-the-loop data quality assessment, improving trustworthiness for LSTM/GRU model training.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages human-in-the-loop analytics to apply domain knowledge in detecting complex data issues that automated algorithms might miss. By using robust statistical measures like MAD and Modified Z-score, it provides reliable anomaly detection in noisy sensor data. The interactive visualizations allow analysts to spot temporal inconsistencies, outliers, and missing values that could otherwise degrade AI model performance. This approach bridges the gap between raw data inspection and automated cleaning, ensuring data quality improvements are contextually informed.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Human-in-the-Loop Analytics**
  - Why needed here: Central paradigm allowing human analysts to apply contextual domain knowledge to detect data issues algorithms might misclassify.
  - Quick check question: Can you give an example from the paper where visual inspection allows an analyst to distinguish between a sensor fault and an explainable variation?

- **Concept: LSTM & GRU Networks for Time Series**
  - Why needed here: These AI models are sensitive to noise, missing values, and outliers, motivating the entire data quality framework.
  - Quick check question: According to the paper, what are three ways dirty data can negatively impact the training of LSTM/GRU models?

- **Concept: Robust Statistics (MAD and Modified Z-Score)**
  - Why needed here: Framework uses MAD and modified z-score for anomaly detection, essential for interpreting the "Anomaly Count" KPI.
  - Quick check question: Why is the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) considered a more "robust" measure of spread than standard deviation for this type of data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw hourly data from 6,923 meters over 4 years (CSV) -> DuckDB (embedded SQL, columnar storage) -> Pandas/NumPy processing -> Parquet files (performance) -> Web dashboard (Dash, Plotly) -> Interactive visualizations (time series, heatmaps, box plots, gauges)

- **Critical path:** 1) Ingest hourly data into DuckDB 2) Query and process in Pandas, calculate KPIs 3) Dashboard loads KPIs and dataframes 4) User interacts (e.g., selects time period) 5) Callback updates plots (e.g., zooms time series, redraws heatmap)

- **Design tradeoffs:** Prioritizes human oversight for nuance over automated speed; uses CSV exports and local DuckDB for portability vs. live DB connection; Dash/Plotly for Python ecosystem integration vs. potential performance of compiled languages

- **Failure signatures:** Dashboard fails to load (DuckDB or memory issues); charts empty/unresponsive (broken Dash callback or failed processing); unrealistic KPIs (100% nulls indicates schema mismatch)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce KPI calculation: Manually calculate modified z-score and MAD for sample data, compare with dashboard's "Anomaly Count" gauge
  2. Test interactivity: Select meter ID and time range with known missing data, verify time series plot shows correct break/gap
  3. Correlate manual fix: Identify clear outlier in line plot, manually correct in source data, reload dashboard, confirm anomaly disappears from visualizations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** To what extent does applying the visual diagnostics framework empirically improve LSTM/GRU forecasting accuracy compared to uncleaned datasets?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Conclusion states future work should include empirical validation comparing metrics like RMSE and MAE
  - Why unresolved: Current study provides framework and case application but no comparative training experiments to quantify model performance improvements
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study presenting quantitative error metrics (RMSE, MAE) for models trained on raw vs. cleaned data

- **Question:** Which specific data treatment strategies are most effective for resolving anomalies identified by the visual dashboard?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 8 notes future work should formalize treatment strategies and assess their impact on AI model performance
  - Why unresolved: Framework details how to detect issues but doesn't prescribe or validate optimal resolution methods
  - What evidence would resolve it: Analysis comparing downstream model accuracy from different cleaning protocols applied to flagged data

- **Question:** Can the framework be effectively generalized to other utility domains like electricity or water networks?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 8 suggests extending dashboard architecture to other utility data will demonstrate generalizability
  - Why unresolved: Framework validated only on Danish district heating dataset; applicability to different periodicities or physical constraints unproven
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful deployment on electricity or water datasets demonstrating ability to detect analogous data quality issues

## Limitations
- Framework's effectiveness depends on availability of comprehensive labeled datasets for validation
- Visual inspection approach introduces subjectivity and may not scale efficiently for very large datasets or real-time applications
- DuckDB-based architecture may face performance bottlenecks with extremely large datasets or concurrent user interactions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core methodology of using visual analytics for data quality assessment in district heating is sound and well-supported by human-in-the-loop analytics literature
- **Medium Confidence:** Effectiveness of specific KPIs (Modified Z-score, Medcouple) and thresholds for anomaly detection is plausible but needs validation on diverse datasets
- **Low Confidence:** Long-term scalability and performance under concurrent user load with datasets larger than 6,923 meters remains unproven

## Next Checks
1. **Statistical Validation:** Manually calculate Modified Z-score and MAD for a small representative sample, compare with dashboard's "Anomaly Count" to verify statistical logic
2. **Interactivity Test:** Select specific meter ID and known time range with missing data, verify time series plot accurately reflects missing data as break/gap
3. **Dashboard Robustness:** Intentionally corrupt small portion of source data (e.g., introduce negative values or outliers), reload dashboard, confirm anomalies correctly identified in visualizations
