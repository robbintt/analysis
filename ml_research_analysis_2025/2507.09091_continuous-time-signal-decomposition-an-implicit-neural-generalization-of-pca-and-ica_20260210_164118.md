## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.09091
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09091
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Extends PCA and ICA to continuous-time signals using implicit neural networks, enabling decomposition of irregularly sampled data where traditional matrix methods fail

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a neural framework that extends PCA and ICA to continuous-time vector-valued signals, enabling decomposition of irregularly sampled data where traditional matrix-based methods fail. The approach models signals as stochastic processes over continuous time, learning implicit neural representations for basis functions and activation signals via gradient-based optimization. A reconstruction loss ensures fidelity while a contrast function enforces statistical properties—decorrelation for PCA and independence for ICA—directly on the continuous source processes. Experiments demonstrate the method on face images and audio spectrograms sampled at irregular points: for faces, learned bases visually resemble eigenfaces and yield ~79% variance explained; for audio, the method separates overlapping notes in an irregularly sampled constant-Q transform, identifying note spectra and temporal activations without the rigid matrix requirements of standard ICA. The framework thus provides a unified, flexible tool for low-rank decomposition in continuous domains, applicable to point clouds, sparse sampling, and other irregular data structures.

## Method Summary
The method generalizes PCA and ICA to continuous-time vector-valued signals by modeling them as stochastic processes and learning implicit neural representations for basis functions f_n(ξ) and activation signals H_n(t). The reconstruction X̂ = Σ_n H_n(t)f_n(ξ) is computed by neural networks that take continuous time t and spatial coordinates ξ as inputs. A reconstruction loss L_reconstr = E[||X - X̂||²_{L²}] ensures fidelity, while a contrast function φ enforces statistical properties: for PCA, decorrelation (||E[(S-μ)(S-μ)ᵀ] - I||); for ICA, non-linear decorrelation with tanh (||E[(tanh(S)-μ̃)(S-μ)ᵀ] - I||). The loss is estimated via Monte Carlo integration over observed irregular samples, enabling training without uniform grids. Networks use Fourier positional encodings to address spectral bias, and gradients are computed through the continuous-time operators.

## Key Results
- Face decomposition: Learned bases visually resemble eigenfaces, explaining ~79% variance (vs ~85% for traditional PCA)
- Audio separation: Successfully separates overlapping notes in irregularly sampled CQT spectrograms without rigid matrix requirements
- Irregular sampling: Framework handles arbitrary point clouds and sparse sampling, where discrete PCA/ICA cannot operate
- Continuous generalization: Provides first principled extension of PCA/ICA to continuous-time stochastic processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Implicit neural networks can represent continuous basis functions and activations that approximate solutions to continuous-time PCA/ICA problems. Feedforward networks with Fourier positional encodings map continuous time inputs t and spatial inputs ξ to scalar outputs, forming basis functions f_n(ξ) and activations H_n(t). The composition T(ξ)·S_t = Σ_n H_n(t)f_n(ξ) reconstructs observed signals at arbitrary (t, ξ) coordinates without requiring uniform grids. Core assumption: The underlying signal manifold is sufficiently smooth that continuous functions can approximate the decomposition; stationarity of source processes enables expectation estimation from a single sample path.

### Mechanism 2
A contrast function term in the loss enforces statistical properties (decorrelation for PCA, independence for ICA) directly on learned source processes. For PCA, the contrast ϕ_PCA(S) = ||E[(S-μ)(S-μ)ᵀ] - Λ|| penalizes off-diagonal covariance entries, driving components toward decorrelation. For ICA, ϕ_ICA uses a non-linear decorrelation criterion E[(φ(S)-μ̃)(S-μ)ᵀ] with φ(y)=tanh(y), approximating higher-order independence by exploiting that independent variables are uncorrelated after arbitrary non-linear transformations. Core assumption: The expectation can be reliably estimated from finite samples; for ICA, finite moments of all orders exist; the non-linear decorrelation heuristic suffices to approach independence without explicit mutual information minimization.

### Mechanism 3
Monte Carlo estimation of the L² reconstruction loss over irregularly sampled (t, ξ, x) tuples enables training without uniform discretization. The loss L_reconstr = E[||X - X̂||²_{L²}] is computed by evaluating networks at observed coordinates (t_i, ξ_i), comparing to x_i, and averaging. The expectation is estimated by averaging across randomly sampled time points, leveraging stationarity. This allows the optimizer to receive gradients from arbitrary point clouds rather than fixed matrices. Core assumption: The observed point samples provide sufficient coverage to estimate the continuous integral; the reconstruction target function lives in a low-rank subspace (rank-k approximation is meaningful).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework generalizes these classical decomposition methods; understanding their discrete matrix formulations (eigenvalue decomposition, whitening, contrast functions like kurtosis) is prerequisite to grasping what the continuous extension preserves and changes.
  - Quick check question: Given a data matrix X, can you explain why PCA finds orthogonal directions of maximum variance while ICA seeks statistically independent (not just uncorrelated) components?

- **Concept: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)**
  - Why needed here: The method represents continuous functions via neural networks that map coordinates to values, replacing explicit storage (grids, meshes) with learned function approximators; Fourier positional encodings address spectral bias.
  - Quick check question: How does a coordinate-based MLP differ from a standard convolutional network, and why might it struggle with high-frequency details without positional encoding?

- **Concept: Stochastic Processes and Stationarity**
  - Why needed here: The theoretical foundation models signals as sample paths of continuous-time stochastic processes; stationarity justifies estimating expectations from single sample paths across time.
  - Quick check question: If a source process S_t were non-stationary (e.g., variance changes over time), what would break in the proposed expectation estimation procedure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - Fourier encoding layer -> Basis networks (f̂_1...f̂_k) -> Basis outputs f_n(ξ)
  - Fourier encoding layer -> Activation networks (Ĥ_1...Ĥ_k) -> Activation outputs H_n(t)
  - Basis outputs + Activation outputs -> Element-wise multiplication -> Summation Σ_n H_n(t)·f̂_n(ξ) -> Reconstruction X̂
  - Reconstruction + Ground truth -> L² loss computation -> Monte Carlo estimation
  - Source vectors from activation networks + Contrast function φ -> Statistical constraint loss
  - Combined loss -> Gradient computation -> Parameter updates for all networks

- **Critical path**:
  1. Parse irregular dataset D = {(t_i, ξ_i, x_i)} into coordinate tensors
  2. Forward pass: encode coordinates → pass through basis and activation networks → aggregate reconstruction
  3. Compute L_reconstr via MSE between predicted and observed x_i
  4. Sample random time points, compute source vector Ŝ at those times, evaluate contrast function
  5. Backpropagate combined loss, update all network parameters jointly

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Network capacity vs. overfitting**: Three hidden layers with PReLU work for demos; higher-capacity networks may memorize noise in sparse regions
  - **β (contrast weight)**: Too low → components not decorrelated/independent; too high → reconstruction quality degrades as statistical constraint dominates
  - **Fourier encoding variance σ²**: Controls spectral bias; too low → smooth/blurry outputs; too high → instability in training
  - **Number of components k**: Under-specification misses structure; over-specification may learn redundant or noisy components

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **High reconstruction loss with low contrast loss**: Components learned are decorrelated/independent but fail to span the signal space (k too small, network capacity insufficient)
  - **Low reconstruction loss with high contrast loss**: Networks fit data but components remain correlated/dependent (β too low, or source assumptions violated)
  - **Non-diagonal covariance matrix after training (PCA mode)**: Contrast function not effectively enforced; check β value and expectation estimation batch size
  - **Basis functions appear noisy or high-frequency artifacts**: Fourier encoding variance too high; reduce σ²
  - **Training instability/NaN losses**: Learning rate too high relative to β; gradients from contrast term may explode with tanh saturation

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Synthetic validation on known decomposition**: Generate X_t = Σ_n H_n(t)·f_n(ξ) with known sinusoidal activations and polynomial bases; sample irregularly; verify recovered networks match ground truth within tolerance. Success criterion: >90% variance explained, visual match to true bases.
  2. **Ablation on contrast weight β**: Train on face dataset with β ∈ {0.0, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}; plot reconstruction loss vs. off-diagonal covariance magnitude. Identify β regime where both objectives are reasonably satisfied.
  3. **Comparison to interpolated baseline**: Take irregularly sampled data, interpolate to uniform grid, apply standard PCA/ICA; compare variance explained and component interpretability to implicit neural method. Quantify performance gap vs. sampling density.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the non-linear decorrelation contrast function ($\phi_{ICA}$) guarantee convergence to statistically independent components for general non-Gaussian continuous processes, or does it fail for specific source distributions? The authors state that minimizing $\phi_{ICA}$ "provides a heuristic" and note that measuring independence is "notoriously difficult" involving higher-order cumulants not fully captured by the proposed criterion. The paper relies on a standard ICA approximation but does not provide theoretical proof that this specific contrast function suffices for the continuous, infinite-dimensional operator setting defined in the problem formulation.

### Open Question 2
Can the implicit neural formulation achieve optimal variance retention comparable to discrete PCA, or is the observed performance gap (79% vs. 85%) inherent to the continuous approximation? The experimental results on face data show a notable gap: "The shown neural EigenFaces explain ≈ 79% of the variance in the dataset, compared to ≈ 85% with the traditional PCA." The paper demonstrates the feasibility of the approach but does not analyze the specific cause of the loss in variance explained—whether it stems from network capacity, optimization difficulties, or the mathematical limitations of the Monte Carlo integration used in the loss function.

### Open Question 3
How does the constraint of operating on a single observed sample path impact the consistency of the statistical estimators for non-stationary or complex stochastic processes? The authors explicitly list this as a trade-off: "this generalization comes with the trade-off of operating on a single observed sample path of the underlying process." While the stationarity assumption (Assumption 1) is used to justify computing expectations from a single path, the paper does not explore the estimation error or variance bounds when this assumption is violated or when the path is short.

## Limitations
- Monte Carlo expectation estimation from irregularly sampled data lacks convergence validation and sensitivity analysis to sampling density
- ICA contrast function provides only heuristic independence guarantees without formal proofs for the continuous setting
- Key experimental hyperparameters (network architecture, learning rates, β weighting, Fourier encoding variance) are underspecified, preventing exact reproduction

## Confidence

- **High**: The theoretical framework extending PCA/ICA to continuous time via implicit neural representations is mathematically sound and the reconstruction loss mechanism is straightforward.
- **Medium**: The contrast function approach for enforcing statistical properties is well-motivated but the ICA variant's effectiveness for true source separation remains partially demonstrated.
- **Low**: Specific experimental configurations and hyperparameter choices are underspecified, preventing exact replication of reported performance metrics.

## Next Checks

1. **Convergence Analysis**: Systematically vary the number of Monte Carlo samples used to estimate expectations in the loss; plot convergence of reconstruction loss and contrast function values against sample count.

2. **ICA Separation Quality**: For the audio separation experiment, quantitatively evaluate the separated note spectra using standard metrics (SDR, SIR, SAR from BSS Eval toolbox) rather than relying solely on visual spectrogram comparison.

3. **Sampling Density Sensitivity**: Generate synthetic data with known ground truth decomposition; train the model on subsampled versions with varying densities; measure how reconstruction fidelity and component recovery degrade as sampling becomes sparser.
