# Beyond Point Matching: Evaluating Multiscale Dubuc Distance for Time Series Similarity

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.21824
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21824
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** MDD outperforms DTW on 41% of datasets with equal significance when DTW wins

## Executive Summary
This study introduces Multiscale Dubuc Distance (MDD), a novel time series similarity measure that avoids point-to-point alignment by comparing time series at multiple temporal scales using envelope-based intersection ratios. Unlike Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which relies on elastic point matching, MDD captures both microscopic and macroscopic features without warping. The method was tested on 95 UCR time series classification datasets and a real-world solar flare prediction task (SW AN-SF). Results show MDD outperforms DTW in 41% of datasets, with equally significant gains when DTW wins. On SW AN-SF, MDD achieved an F1 score of 0.83 (±0.02) and TSS of 0.67 (±0.02), significantly surpassing DTW's F1 of 0.74 (±0.03) and TSS of 0.63 (±0.03). The findings demonstrate MDD's effectiveness in scenarios where point matching is suboptimal, offering a complementary tool to existing similarity measures.

## Method Summary
MDD computes similarity by comparing time series at multiple scales ε using envelope-based intersection ratios. For each scale ε, upper and lower bounds u_x,ε(t) and l_x,ε(t) are calculated using neighborhood supremum and infimum operations. The intersection ratio r(x,y,ε) measures overlap between envelopes of two time series. These ratios are aggregated across scales using a pseudo-area formula with uniform weight 1/|E|. The method was evaluated using 1-Nearest Neighbors classification on 95 UCR datasets (excluding unequal-length and >900 observation series) and on SW AN-SF solar flare prediction task using three features. Optimal scales were selected via grid search with constraint ε ≤ 0.3d where d is time series length. DTW was used as baseline with Sakoe-Chiba band and optimized window width.

## Key Results
- MDD outperformed DTW on 41% of UCR datasets with equal statistical significance when DTW won
- On SW AN-SF, MDD achieved F1 score of 0.83 (±0.02) versus DTW's 0.74 (±0.03)
- On SW AN-SF, MDD achieved TSS of 0.67 (±0.02) versus DTW's 0.63 (±0.03)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MDD captures similarity at multiple temporal scales without requiring point alignment. By using envelope-based intersection ratios, it measures how much two time series overlap across different levels of detail. The multiscale approach allows detection of both local patterns and global trends simultaneously. Unlike DTW, which stretches and compresses time to find best point matches, MDD compares overall shapes at different resolutions. This makes it particularly effective for time series where temporal misalignment is inherent or where global shape similarity matters more than precise point correspondence.

## Foundational Learning
- **Envelope calculation**: Upper and lower bounds using neighborhood supremum/infimum - needed to capture local maxima/minima at different scales
  - Quick check: Verify bounds correctly capture local extrema for synthetic time series
- **Intersection ratio**: Measure of overlap between two envelopes - needed to quantify similarity at each scale
  - Quick check: Test ratio calculation with known overlapping/non-overlapping envelopes
- **Multiscale aggregation**: Combining similarity measures across different scales - needed to capture both fine and coarse features
  - Quick check: Verify aggregation preserves properties of individual scale similarities
- **Climatology-preserving sampling**: Undersampling method maintaining temporal distribution - needed for imbalanced solar flare dataset
  - Quick check: Confirm undersampling maintains original class distribution patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
MDD Calculator -> Scale Optimizer -> 1NN Classifier -> Performance Evaluator

**Critical Path:**
Time series input → Envelope calculation (Eq. 1-2) → Intersection ratio computation (Eq. 3) → Multiscale aggregation (Eq. 4) → Distance matrix → 1NN classification → Accuracy/F1/TSS calculation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
MDD sacrifices point-level precision for scale-invariant similarity measurement. This makes it robust to temporal misalignments but potentially less sensitive to exact timing patterns. The envelope-based approach is computationally efficient compared to point-by-point DTW alignment, but requires careful scale selection to balance detail and generalization.

**Failure Signatures:**
Poor performance on datasets where precise temporal alignment is critical (e.g., gesture recognition with specific timing requirements). Underperformance when scale selection is too coarse to capture important features or too fine to generalize across series variations.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test MDD on synthetic time series with known scale differences to verify multiscale detection
2. Compare MDD sensitivity to temporal shifts versus DTW on misaligned but shape-similar series
3. Evaluate MDD performance on datasets with varying noise levels to assess robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exact implementation details of climatology-preserving sampling are unspecified
- Tie-breaking rules for selecting optimal scales when multiple configurations yield equal accuracy are unclear
- Results depend on specific undersampling ratios and random seeds not reported in SW AN-SF evaluation

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** MDD's mathematical formulation (Equations 1-4) is fully specified and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence:** UCR results are verifiable through standard 1NN evaluation, though optimal E selection criteria need clarification.

**Medium Confidence:** SW AN-SF results hinge on unreported sampling details, though core distance calculations are sound.

## Next Checks

1. Verify envelope calculation by testing on synthetic time series with known bounds at multiple scales
2. Implement climatology-preserving undersampling with multiple random seeds to assess variance in SW AN-SF results
3. Benchmark MDD against DTW on additional real-world datasets where point alignment is known to be suboptimal (e.g., ECG signals with varying heart rates)
