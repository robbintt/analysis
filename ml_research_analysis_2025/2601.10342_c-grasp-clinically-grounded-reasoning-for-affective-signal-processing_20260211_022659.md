# C-GRASP: Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.10342
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10342
- **Authors:** Cheng Lin Cheng; Ting Chuan Lin; Chai Kai Chang
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** C-GRASP achieved 37.3% 4-class emotion classification accuracy on DREAMER dataset using guardrailed RAG pipeline with individualized baselines.

## Executive Summary
C-GRASP addresses physiological hallucinations in LLM-based HRV interpretation by introducing a guardrailed RAG pipeline with eight traceable reasoning steps. The system prioritizes individualized baseline shifts through a Dual Z-score Priority Hierarchy and includes automated guardrails for RSA contamination and nonlinear metric reliability. Evaluated on 414 DREAMER trials, C-GRASP with MedGemma3-thinking achieved 37.3% 4-class emotion classification accuracy and 69.6% Clinical Reasoning Consistency. Ablation studies confirmed the individualized Delta Z-score module as critical for preventing population bias.

## Method Summary
C-GRASP is a guardrailed RAG-enhanced LLM pipeline for 4-class emotion classification from HRV data. The system computes traditional and Delta Z-scores, applies RSA-aware guardrails to prevent spectral hallucinations, and uses evidence-governed retrieval to filter clinically reliable literature. The 8-step reasoning chain processes preprocessed HRV features through MedGemma or Qwen models with specific temperature and repetition parameters. The pipeline prioritizes individualized physiological baselines over population norms and validates outputs through automated consistency checks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 37.3% 4-class emotion classification accuracy on DREAMER dataset
- Demonstrated 69.6% Clinical Reasoning Consistency through keyword-Z-score alignment
- Ablation studies showed individualized Delta Z-score module critical for preventing population bias
- RSA guardrails successfully prevented spectral hallucination failures in contaminated signals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Enforcing a Dual Z-score Priority Hierarchy mitigates population bias by prioritizing individualized physiological shifts over static norms. The system calculates traditional Z-score ($z_{trad}$) and Delta Z-score ($z_{\Delta}$) representing deviation from personal baseline. In Step 6, reasoning path treats $z_{\Delta}$ as primary evidence source, triggering formal conflict flag ($\vdash_{conflict}$) when $z_{trad}$ and $z_{\Delta}$ contradict.

### Mechanism 2
Quantitative RSA-aware gating prevents spectral hallucinations by dynamically disabling low-reliability frequency-domain metrics when respiration contaminates the signal. The system compares extracted respiratory frequency ($f_{resp}$) against HF peak ($f_{HF}$). If distance is $< 0.05$ Hz, "RSA Severe" guardrail triggers, automatically rewriting prompts to prohibit LF/HF interpretation.

### Mechanism 3
Evidence Governance via metric-specific reliability weighting reduces logical inconsistencies by penalizing retrieval of scientifically contested literature. RAG system applies composite weight ($w_{domain}$) that down-ranks passages based on metric reliability ($\beta_{metric}$). High-quality evidence (RCTs) and stable metrics (RMSSD) are prioritized over contested metrics like LF/HF ratio.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Artifact Sources**
  - Why needed: Understanding respiration leakage into heart rate signals (RSA) and short segment limitations is required to understand why guardrails exist.
  - Quick check: Why would high HF power not necessarily indicate high parasympathetic activity in subject with respiratory rate of 0.15 Hz?

- **Concept: Individualized vs. Population Normalization**
  - Why needed: Core innovation is Delta Z-score. Understanding difference between population comparison ($z_{trad}$) versus personal history ($z_{\Delta}$) is required to debug conflict detection.
  - Quick check: If patient has naturally high resting HRV, why would population-based Z-score falsely flag them as abnormal during baseline recording?

- **Concept: RAG Evidence Governance**
  - Why needed: This is not standard "retrieve-and-read" system. It actively filters retrieved chunks based on study design and metric reliability.
  - Quick check: In C-GRASP, does RAG retrieve most semantically similar passages or most methodologically reliable ones?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer -> Normalization Module -> Guardrail Engine -> RAG Module -> Stepwise Reasoning Core -> Integration Module
- **Critical path:** Delta Z-score ($z_{\Delta}$) computed in Module 2, compared against $z_{trad}$ in Module 5 (Step 6), acts as logical anchor in Module 6. Missing or miscalculated value causes population bias failure mode.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Retrospective Baselines: Uses all subject trials to simulate longitudinal baseline, introducing non-causal data leakage that potentially inflates performance metrics.
  - Guardrail Rigidity: Strict RSA guardrails (prohibiting LF/HF) improve safety but may discard valid spectral data in clean signals, reducing granularity in edge cases.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Label Repetition Collapse: Model ignores input variance and outputs same class for 90%+ of trials.
  - Statistical Hypersensitivity: Model over-interprets small Z-score deviations ($|z| < 0.5$) as significant clinical states.
  - Label Mapping Paradox: Free-text reasoning describes "High Arousal" state but structured JSON outputs "Low Arousal."
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run Ablation "w/o $\Delta$Z": Disable Delta Z-score input to verify reversion to population-norm bias.
  2. Inject Synthetic RSA: Modify features to set $|f_{resp} - f_{HF}| < 0.05$ Hz and verify Step 3 prompt prohibits LF/HF interpretation.
  3. Audit CRC Calculation: Manually check 5 random samples to ensure Clinical Reasoning Consistency correctly aligns extracted Z-score signs with text keywords.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does C-GRASP performance degrade when individualized baselines are constructed causally using only prior measurements rather than retrospective data? The current offline evaluation estimates subject-specific baselines using all available trials (non-causal), with authors stating future deployment should use chronological accumulation or leave-one-trial-out baselines.

### Open Question 2
Can a deterministic validator at Step 8 effectively eliminate the "Label Mapping Paradox" where free-text reasoning contradicts structured state outputs? The current system lacks automated mechanism to enforce consistency between generated narrative rationale and discrete psychophysiological state label.

### Open Question 3
Does integrating visual attention heatmaps from EEG classifiers with C-GRASP's numerical HRV baselines improve detection of "image-physiological inconsistencies"? The current framework focuses on HRV interpretation and has not been validated on multimodal data combining visual and numerical features.

## Limitations
- Exact prompt templates and MedGemma3-thinking model weights are not publicly available, preventing exact reproduction of stated performance metrics.
- Current implementation uses retrospective baseline calculation that introduces non-causal data leakage, potentially inflating performance metrics.
- Effectiveness of Evidence Governance mechanism depends entirely on quality and content of curated knowledge base, which is not publicly specified.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Dual Z-score Priority Hierarchy mechanism with explicit mathematical formulations (Eq. 3-4) and conflict detection logic.
- **Medium Confidence:** RSA contamination guardrails clearly defined with specific thresholds and prompt rewriting rules, though practical effectiveness depends on respiration signal quality.
- **Low Confidence:** Exact prompt templates for 8-step reasoning chain and specific content of RAG corpus are not provided, making complete system behavior verification impossible.

## Next Checks
1. Implement Conflict Detection: Run "w/o ΔZ" ablation to verify system reverts to population-norm bias when individualized baseline is removed.
2. Test RSA Guardrail Robustness: Create synthetic HRV signals with varying respiratory contamination levels and verify correct LF/HF interpretation disablement.
3. Audit CRC Calculation: Manually verify Clinical Reasoning Consistency calculation on 10 random samples to ensure extracted Z-score signs properly align with text keywords.
