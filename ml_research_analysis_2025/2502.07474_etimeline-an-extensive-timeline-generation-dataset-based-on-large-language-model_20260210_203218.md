# ETimeline: An Extensive Timeline Generation Dataset based on Large Language Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.07474
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07474
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Key outcome:** Introduces ETimeline, a large-scale timeline generation dataset with 600 bilingual timelines across 28 news domains, built using a 7B LLM pipeline with knowledge distillation from GPT-4.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ETimeline, a large-scale timeline generation dataset built using a 7B-parameter large language model (LLM) pipeline. The dataset includes over 13,000 news articles spanning 600 bilingual timelines across 28 news domains. The authors developed a novel LLM-based pipeline that automatically extracts topics from trending words, fills timeline nodes from a curated news pool, and performs deduplication and refinement. Knowledge distillation was applied to train the 7B model using GPT-4 annotations, improving performance. ETimeline is significantly larger and more diverse than existing timeline datasets and includes both timeline data and the underlying news pool for further research.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed ETimeline using a 7B LLM pipeline trained via knowledge distillation from GPT-4. The process involved four main tasks: Topic Generation (extracting topics from trending words), Topic Refining (updating topics based on incoming news), Topic Mounting (classifying news articles into appropriate topics), and Text Deduplication (removing redundant information). The dataset was built from a news pool of 127,170 articles from March 2020 to April 2024, with topics sourced from Google Trends and Baidu Hotsearch. The 7B models (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 for English, Baichuan2-7B-Chat for Chinese) were fine-tuned on 40,000 GPT-4 annotated examples. The pipeline uses Faiss for topic retrieval and BM25 for deduplication, processing news chronologically to build comprehensive timelines.

## Key Results
- Constructed 600 bilingual timelines spanning 28 news domains
- Built dataset from 127,170 news articles across March 2020-April 2024 period
- Implemented knowledge distillation from GPT-4 to improve 7B model performance
- Created the largest and most diverse timeline generation dataset to date

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging trending topics as seeds and using a knowledge-distilled 7B model to systematically process a large news corpus. The four-task pipeline (Generation, Refining, Mounting, Deduplication) allows for incremental timeline construction that adapts to evolving news streams. Knowledge distillation from GPT-4 provides high-quality annotations that transfer reasoning capabilities to the smaller 7B models, enabling them to perform complex topic classification and relationship understanding despite their smaller size.

## Foundational Learning
- **Topic Extraction from Trends:** Identifying relevant topics from trending words is crucial for establishing meaningful timeline seeds. Quick check: Verify trending word relevance by sampling and manual validation.
- **Knowledge Distillation:** Transferring reasoning capabilities from large models (GPT-4) to smaller models (7B) enables efficient deployment. Quick check: Compare model outputs before and after distillation on held-out examples.
- **Retrieval-based Classification:** Using vector similarity (Faiss) for topic mounting enables scalable processing of large news streams. Quick check: Measure retrieval accuracy at different similarity thresholds.
- **Deduplication via Semantic Similarity:** Identifying and removing redundant information maintains timeline clarity and prevents information overload. Quick check: Evaluate precision/recall of deduplication on synthetic duplicate pairs.
- **Incremental Timeline Construction:** Processing news chronologically allows timelines to evolve naturally as events unfold. Quick check: Verify timeline temporal coherence by checking chronological ordering of events.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Trending Words → Topic Generation → News Pool → Topic Mounting (Faiss) → LLM Classification → Text Deduplication (BM25) → LLM Verification → Timeline Assembly

**Critical Path:** The end-to-end pipeline processes news chronologically: Faiss retrieval for topic mounting → LLM inference for classification → BM25 retrieval for deduplication → LLM verification → Timeline update. This sequence ensures each news item is properly contextualized before being added to a timeline.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The use of 7B models instead of larger LLMs balances performance with computational efficiency, enabling scalable deployment. However, this requires knowledge distillation from GPT-4 to achieve adequate reasoning capabilities. The pipeline prioritizes automation over human curation, trading some quality control for scale and speed.

**Failure Signatures:** Topic fragmentation occurs when the model creates new topics instead of mounting to existing ones. Hallucination in topic refining happens when updated topics drift from core events. These failures typically manifest as timeline inconsistency or semantic drift.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. **Distillation Data Validation:** Generate 100 examples using the provided prompts and verify GPT-4 annotation quality and consistency.
2. **Retrieval Baseline Test:** Implement the Faiss and BM25 retrieval steps with sample news and topics to verify similarity thresholds produce reasonable matches.
3. **End-to-End Mini Pipeline:** Process 100 news articles through the full pipeline to identify bottlenecks and verify the integration of all components.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** How can event relationship modeling be advanced to distinguish complex causal links between timeline nodes beyond mere semantic similarity? The authors suggest integrating timeline data with robust NLP models to bolster efficacy, as current methods relying on semantic similarity are insufficient for determining connections requiring deep inferential capabilities.

**Open Question 2:** How can multi-level topic generation be effectively implemented to capture both broad narratives and specific sub-events? The paper acknowledges that topics may require division into sub-topics to aid comprehensive understanding, but current dataset construction focuses on distinct, generalized topics.

**Open Question 3:** To what extent does the "silver standard" nature of the LLM-generated timeline introduce noise or hallucinations compared to human-curated timelines? The authors rely on a distilled 7B model for construction, which may propagate errors or biases not caught by heuristic filters, though limited analysis is provided on error rates compared to human curation.

## Limitations
- Missing specific implementation details for Faiss embedding model and exact retrieval hyperparameters (k values for both Faiss and BM25)
- Lack of detailed SFT hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs, LoRA configuration) that could affect model performance
- Evaluation focuses primarily on dataset construction rather than end-to-end timeline quality metrics

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The dataset construction methodology, the use of knowledge distillation from GPT-4, and the overall pipeline architecture are clearly described and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence:** The training approach using SFT on GPT-4 annotated data is well-specified, but exact hyperparameters remain unclear.

**Low Confidence:** The impact of specific embedding models and retrieval parameters on final timeline quality cannot be assessed without experimental validation.

## Next Checks

1. Reconstruct the 40,000 distillation examples using the provided prompts and publicly available GPT-4 access, then verify the training data quality.
2. Implement the full pipeline with multiple Faiss embedding models (e.g., sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to determine optimal retrieval performance.
3. Evaluate the trained 7B models on a held-out test set of timeline generation tasks to measure practical performance gains from the distillation process.
