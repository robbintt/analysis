# TransLight: Image-Guided Customized Lighting Control with Generative Decoupling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.14814
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14814
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: First method to transfer complex light effects with Light FID of 6.02 vs IC-Light 10.05

## Executive Summary
TransLight introduces the first method to transfer complex light effects from reference images to target images with high fidelity and flexibility. The core challenge is decoupling light effects from image content without leakage. To solve this, the authors propose Generative Decoupling: two fine-tuned diffusion models that remove and extract light effects from images, generating over one million image-content-light triplets. These triplets train TransLight, which uses IC-Light as a base model with added ControlNet for light effect injection. The method supports position, direction, and intensity adjustments of transferred light effects, achieving Light FID of 6.02 and setting a new direction for illumination harmonization research.

## Method Summary
TransLight uses a two-stage training approach with generative decoupling. First, two IC-Light diffusion models are fine-tuned: one for light removal (1K iterations) and one for light extraction (26K iterations). These models separate content and light effects from images to create over one million training triplets. Second, TransLight is trained using a two-stage pipeline: LoRA fine-tuning (rank=128, 10K iterations) for content preservation, followed by ControlNet training (40K iterations) for light injection. The system supports position, direction, and intensity control of transferred light effects through ControlNet conditioning.

## Key Results
- Light FID of 6.02, outperforming IC-Light baseline (10.05)
- PSNR of 19.58 and SSIM of 0.7931 on transferred light effects
- 83.64% success rate for decoupling complex light effects with filtering
- First method to enable position, direction, and intensity control of transferred light

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Generative Decoupling via Dual Diffusion Models
Two separately fine-tuned diffusion models can decouple light effects from image content more effectively than single-model approaches. One model (light removal) is trained on natural images without light effects; another model (light extraction) is trained on pure light material images with black backgrounds. When applied to an image with light effects, they produce complementary outputs: content-only and light-only images. The synthesis formula $I_S = aI + bL$ approximates real-world light-content composition sufficiently for training.

### Mechanism 2: ControlNet-based Light Injection with LoRA Content Preservation
A two-stage training approach (LoRA then ControlNet) preserves content while enabling controllable light effect injection. Stage 1 fine-tunes LoRA (rank=128) on content+background-light composites to teach content preservation. Stage 2 freezes LoRA and trains ControlNet to inject foreground light effects. The ControlNet receives extracted light effects as additional conditioning.

### Mechanism 3: DINOv2-based Quality Filtering for Training Data
Cosine similarity filtering on DINOv2 features removes low-quality triplets and improves final model performance. After decoupling, the system reconstructs $I_S$ from extracted content $I$ and light $L$, then computes similarity metrics to filter samples where content similarity is low (good light removal) AND reconstruction similarity is high (good light extraction).

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion Model Fine-tuning with LoRA**: Understanding how low-rank adaptation modifies frozen diffusion weights without catastrophic forgetting of IC-Light's pre-trained illumination capabilities. Quick check: Can you explain why LoRA rank=128 was chosen over smaller values, given the million-sample training scale?

- **ControlNet Conditioning Architecture**: TransLight adds ControlNet to inject light effects as spatial conditioning; understanding how ControlNet integrates with the frozen U-Net is essential for debugging generation artifacts. Quick check: How does ControlNet differ from directly concatenating conditions in the latent space?

- **Feature Similarity Metrics (DINOv2, Cosine Similarity)**: The filtering pipeline relies on DINOv2 semantic features and cosine similarity to assess decoupling quality. Quick check: Why might pixel-level metrics like PSNR be insufficient for evaluating light extraction quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Reference Image → Light Extraction Model → Light Effect Image → ControlNet; Content Image → [VAE Encoder] → Latent + Noise → [Generator w/ LoRA] → Output; Background Light → Direct Addition

- **Critical path**: 1) Light extraction quality from reference; 2) ControlNet training convergence; 3) LoRA content preservation

- **Design tradeoffs**: Simple synthesis (aI + bL) vs. physically-based compositing; Two-stage training vs. joint training; Pure black backgrounds for light materials vs. natural backgrounds

- **Failure signatures**: Content leakage in extracted light; Dark/yellow color cast; Misaligned light position; Missing subtle light effects

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Validate decoupling quality on 100 images with prominent light effects; 2) Ablate filtering threshold with γ ∈ {0.95, 0.98, 0.99}; 3) Test position/direction control by applying translations and flips to extracted light images

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the generative decoupling framework be refined to successfully handle reference images containing subtle or indistinct light effects? The Discussion section identifies the dependence on the extraction model as the primary limitation, stating the method "may fail to produce satisfactory results" when the reference light effect is "subtle or indistinct."

### Open Question 2
Does the use of simple additive synthesis ($I_S = aI + bL$) for training data limit the model's ability to generalize to complex physical light interactions, such as caustics or inter-reflections? The Method section utilizes a basic linear interpolation of content and light images, assuming this suffices for real-world generalization despite the complexity of optical physics.

### Open Question 3
Can the framework be extended to automatically align the geometric properties of the transferred light with the 3D structure of the target image? The Inference section states the model supports "translation [and] flipping" of the light effect, implying that geometric alignment is a manual user operation rather than an automated feature.

## Limitations
- Linear composition assumption may not capture complex light interactions like inter-reflections
- Subtle light effects with low contrast may fail the filtering threshold
- Proprietary datasets (20M+ image database, InternVL2.5 prompts) limit reproducibility

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Dual-model decoupling architecture
- ControlNet-based light injection with LoRA content preservation
- DINOv2 filtering pipeline effectiveness

**Medium Confidence**:
- Generalization to all "complex light effects"
- Real-world applicability without proprietary datasets
- Lighting control precision across arbitrary scenes

**Low Confidence**:
- Physical accuracy of linear light synthesis formula
- Threshold robustness (γ=0.98) for diverse lighting conditions
- Temporal consistency for video applications

## Next Checks

1. **Ablate the filtering threshold**: Train three TransLight variants with γ ∈ {0.95, 0.98, 0.99} on identical datasets; compare Light FID and qualitative decoupling quality.

2. **Test on subtle light effects**: Apply TransLight to images with weak, diffuse lighting (e.g., overcast outdoor scenes) and evaluate whether content leakage or incomplete light extraction occurs.

3. **Validate synthetic light synthesis**: Compare the linear composition formula (aI + bL) against physically-based rendering for simple scenes (e.g., sphere on plane with single light). Measure color deviation and shadow artifacts to assess realism limits.
