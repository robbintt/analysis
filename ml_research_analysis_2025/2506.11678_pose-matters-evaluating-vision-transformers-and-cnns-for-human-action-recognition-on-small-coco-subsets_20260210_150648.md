# Pose Matters: Evaluating Vision Transformers and CNNs for Human Action Recognition on Small COCO Subsets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.11678
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11678
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Binary ViT achieved 90% accuracy on 285-image COCO subset, significantly outperforming CNNs (~35%) and CLIP models (~62-64%)

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates Vision Transformers against CNNs and CLIP models for human action recognition on a small, manually curated three-class COCO subset. A binary ViT configuration achieved 90% mean test accuracy, significantly outperforming simpler models. One-way ANOVA confirmed these differences were statistically significant (F=61.37, p<0.001). SHAP and LeGrad explainability revealed that the binary ViT localized pose-specific regions (e.g., lower limbs for walking/running), while simpler models often relied on background textures, leading to errors. The findings highlight the data efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability in diagnosing model failures.

## Method Summary
The study used a manually curated COCO subset of 285 images (98/95/92 per class) split 80/10/10 for training, validation, and testing. Seven model configurations were evaluated: FNN, CNN, CNN_gen (with regularization and augmentation), fine-tuned ViT (binary and multiclass), and CLIP-based models. All models were trained with 5 independent runs using seeds 42-46, Adam optimizer with weight decay, and early stopping. Performance was measured via test accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with statistical validation through one-way ANOVA. Explainability analyses used SHAP and LeGrad to visualize attention patterns.

## Key Results
- Binary ViT achieved 90% mean test accuracy, significantly outperforming CNNs (~35%), CLIP-based models (~62-64%), and multiclass ViT (~57%)
- One-way ANOVA confirmed significant differences between model performances (F=61.37, p<0.001)
- Explainability revealed binary ViT localized pose-specific regions (lower limbs for walking/running) while simpler models relied on background textures
- CNN overfitting occurred due to undersized dataset, with validation performance stagnating after few epochs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Self-Attention Enables Long-Range Pose Dependency Modeling
ViT's self-attention mechanism captures global spatial relationships between body parts that CNNs with local receptive fields miss. Images are partitioned into patches; attention layers compute pairwise relationships across all patches simultaneously, allowing the model to link distant body regions (e.g., correlating lower limb position with torso orientation for gait recognition).

### Mechanism 2: Pre-Training Creates Data-Efficient Representations
Large-scale pre-trained ViT representations transfer more effectively to small downstream tasks than CNNs trained from scratch. Pre-training on massive datasets (ImageNet) creates general visual features; fine-tuning adapts only the classification head and upper layers rather than learning spatial features from ~228 training images.

### Mechanism 3: Attention-Based Localization Reduces Background Texture Bias
ViT's learned attention patterns converge on semantically relevant pose regions rather than spurious background correlations. Gradient-based saliency (LeGrad) reveals which patches contribute to predictions; properly trained attention suppresses irrelevant context.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Vision Transformer Architecture (Patch Embedding + Positional Encoding + Self-Attention)
  - Why needed here: Understanding patch-to-token conversion enables debugging attention maps and interpreting LeGrad overlays
  - Quick check question: Given the 224×224 input resolution mentioned, what patch size would create a 14×14 grid of tokens?

- **Concept**: Transfer Learning vs. Training from Scratch
  - Why needed here: The 90% vs. ~35% performance gap hinges on whether models leverage pre-trained features or learn from 228 training samples
  - Quick check question: Which model components were frozen versus fine-tuned in the binary ViT, and how does this differ from the CNN training approach?

- **Concept**: Explainability Methods (SHAP, Gradient-Based Saliency)
  - Why needed here: The paper's mechanistic claims depend on LeGrad and SHAP analyses to distinguish genuine pose attention from background leakage
  - Quick check question: What does diffuse SHAP attribution across background pixels indicate about a classifier's learned features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Input pipeline: COCO images → 224×224 resize → 80/10/10 stratified split (228/29/28 images)
  ViT: Pre-trained HuggingFace backbone + fine-tuned classification head (binary: 2 classes; multiclass: 3 classes)
  CNN baseline: 3 conv blocks (32→64→128 filters, ReLU, 2×2 max-pool) + 256-unit dense + softmax
  CNN_gen: Same backbone + L2 regularization, batch norm, SpatialDropout2D(0.2), GlobalAveragePooling2D
  CLIP variants: Frozen CLIP encoder (512-dim embeddings) + 5-layer MLP head (with/without cosine similarity features)
  Explainability: LeGrad (ViT attention saliency), SHAP (pixel-level attribution for FNN/CNN)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Data curation: Manual audit to remove noise samples (e.g., toilet bowl mislabeled as "standing")
  2. Model selection: Binary ViT for maximal accuracy; multiclass ViT if 3-way classification required
  3. Training: Adam optimizer with weight decay, early stopping (patience=5), 5 independent runs with seeds 42-46
  4. Explainability: Generate LeGrad overlays for correctly classified and error samples to validate attention localization

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Binary vs. multiclass head: Binary achieves 90% accuracy with zero variance; multiclass drops to 57% because "standing shares visual features with both sitting and walking_running"
  - CLIP vs. fine-tuned ViT: CLIP requires less compute (frozen encoder) but shows higher variance (±8-9%); ViT binary is deterministic but requires full fine-tuning
  - CNN regularization: CNN_gen's augmentation reduced variance (±2.7%) but did not improve mean accuracy—regularization trades stability for peak performance

- **Failure signatures**:
  - CNN overfitting: "Stagnating validation performance after a few epochs" on undersized dataset (~35% accuracy)
  - Multiclass confusion: Standing class activates both sitting and walking_running attention patterns, causing 33% accuracy drop
  - Background leakage: FNN SHAP shows "roughly an order of magnitude smaller and noticeably more diffuse" attributions, indicating lack of spatial selectivity

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Binary classification ablation: Replicate sitting vs. walking_running binary task (target: 90% accuracy), then add standing class to confirm ~57% degradation—validates intermediate posture confusion claim
  2. Explainability consistency check: Generate LeGrad overlays for 10 correctly classified walking_running samples; verify attention concentrates on lower limbs (>70% of saliency mass in body regions) vs. misclassified samples with diffuse attention
  3. Data scaling threshold test: Train CNN_gen on 50%, 75%, 100% of training data with augmentation; identify sample size where CNN accuracy approaches ViT—bounds the "data efficiency" claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can semi-supervised augmentation techniques effectively bridge the performance gap between binary (90%) and multiclass (57%) Vision Transformer configurations on small datasets?
The multiclass ViT failed to separate "standing" from other classes, resulting in a 33% accuracy drop compared to the binary setting.

### Open Question 2
Does incorporating temporal context resolve the ambiguity between static "standing" poses and dynamic "walking" actions that appear similar in single frames?
The study was limited to static images, where shared visual features between "standing" and "walking_running" caused confused self-attention activations.

### Open Question 3
Do current explainability methods reveal performance disparities or spurious correlations related to demographic attributes?
Current explainability analysis (SHAP, LeGrad) focused solely on spatial localization (pose vs. background) rather than subject demographics.

## Limitations
- Data scale uncertainty: Core findings depend on 285-image dataset (228 training samples), with scalability to larger datasets unverified
- Architecture specification gaps: Critical hyperparameters (learning rates, batch sizes, max epochs) are omitted for most models except binary ViT
- Explainability validation: No quantitative metrics (e.g., IoU with ground truth pose annotations) to validate that attention regions correspond to actual human body parts

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Binary ViT achieving 90% accuracy on the three-class subset is well-supported by reported statistics (F=61.37, p<0.001) and mechanistic explanation
- **Medium confidence**: Superiority of ViT over CLIP-based models (≈62-64% accuracy) is statistically significant but depends on unspecified CLIP encoder configuration
- **Low confidence**: Assertion that CNNs "struggle with long-range dependencies" is primarily supported by corpus citations rather than direct ablation experiments in this paper

## Next Checks
1. Data scaling threshold: Train CNN_gen with heavy augmentation on 50%, 75%, and 100% of training data to identify minimum sample size where CNNs approach ViT performance
2. Architecture ablation: Replace CNN baseline with ConvNeXt or CNN with global attention modules to isolate whether accuracy gap stems from local receptive fields or lack of pre-training
3. Explainability quantification: Generate bounding boxes around SHAP/LeGrad salient regions for correctly classified samples and compute IoU with ground truth pose annotations (if available) to provide objective metrics for attention localization quality
