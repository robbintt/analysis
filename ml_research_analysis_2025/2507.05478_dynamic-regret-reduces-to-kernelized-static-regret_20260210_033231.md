core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of dynamic regret minimization

  relative to an arbitrary time-varying sequence of comparators. The key insight is

- Primary result: Reduction from dynamic to static regret minimization in RKHS enables optimal dynamic regret guarantees for online convex optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel reduction framework that transforms the problem of dynamic regret minimization in online convex optimization into a static regret minimization problem in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). The key insight is that competing with a time-varying sequence of comparators can be equivalently framed as competing with a fixed function in an appropriately designed RKHS. This reduction leads to horizon-independent and scale-free algorithms that recover optimal dynamic regret guarantees for linear losses, while also extending to exp-concave and improper linear regression settings.

## Method Summary
The core method involves designing an RKHS that embeds the comparator sequence while optimizing the inherent trade-offs of the function class. By carefully constructing the RKHS, the authors demonstrate that any algorithm achieving low static regret in this space automatically achieves low dynamic regret when evaluated against the original time-varying comparators. The approach leverages the reproducing property of RKHSs to maintain computational feasibility despite working in potentially infinite-dimensional spaces. The reduction framework is general and applies to any sequence of losses, not just convex ones.

## Key Results
- Achieves optimal $O(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$ dynamic regret guarantee for linear losses, up to poly-logarithmic terms
- Recovers $O(\|u\|^2_{\mathcal{H}}+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T)$ bounds in exp-concave and improper linear regression settings
- The reduction leads to practical algorithms computable in finite time due to RKHS reproducing properties
- Framework provides a unifying perspective connecting dynamic and static regret minimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The reduction works by embedding the time-varying comparator sequence into a fixed function in an RKHS, where the distance between consecutive comparators in the original space translates to the RKHS norm of the corresponding function difference. This transformation allows standard static regret minimization algorithms to automatically achieve dynamic regret guarantees when evaluated against the original comparators. The key mechanism is that the RKHS norm provides a natural way to measure the complexity of tracking time-varying comparators, while the static regret minimization ensures low cumulative loss relative to the embedded function.

## Foundational Learning
**Online Convex Optimization**: Framework for sequential decision making where decisions are made repeatedly and performance is measured by regret relative to a comparator sequence; needed to understand the problem setting and regret minimization objectives.

**Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**: Function spaces with special properties that allow kernel methods to be applied; needed because the reduction relies on embedding comparator sequences into a fixed function in such a space.

**Dynamic vs Static Regret**: Dynamic regret measures performance against time-varying comparators while static regret measures performance against a fixed comparator; needed to understand the distinction the paper addresses and why the reduction is non-trivial.

**Kernel Methods**: Techniques that use kernel functions to implicitly work in high-dimensional feature spaces; needed because the reduction constructs specific kernels to embed comparator sequences.

**Online Learning with Exp-Concave Losses**: Setting where losses are exp-concave, which provides stronger convergence guarantees; needed to extend the reduction beyond linear losses to more general settings.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Comparator sequence -> RKHS embedding function -> Static regret algorithm -> Dynamic regret guarantee

**Critical Path**: The reduction requires: (1) constructing the appropriate RKHS kernel from the comparator sequence, (2) applying a static regret minimization algorithm in this RKHS, (3) translating the resulting static regret bound into a dynamic regret guarantee through the reduction framework.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice of kernel determines the trade-off between the complexity measure (like $\|u\|^2_{\mathcal{H}}$) and the effective dimension ($d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$); simpler kernels may lead to higher complexity measures but lower effective dimensions, while more expressive kernels have the opposite effect.

**Failure Signatures**: The reduction may fail or provide suboptimal guarantees when: the comparator sequence has high variation that cannot be well-represented in the chosen RKHS, the losses are highly non-convex or non-smooth, or when the effective dimension grows too quickly with time.

**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Implement the reduction with Gaussian RBF kernel on synthetic data with known comparator sequences to verify theoretical guarantees. 2) Test on real-world time series data with gradual concept drift to evaluate practical performance. 3) Compare against state-of-the-art dynamic regret algorithms on standard online learning benchmarks to establish empirical advantage.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The reduction may not directly apply to non-convex or highly non-smooth loss functions
- Complexity measures like $d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ may be difficult to estimate or bound in practice
- Computational overhead of working in potentially infinite-dimensional RKHS spaces may be non-trivial for certain kernel choices or large-scale problems

## Confidence
- Theoretical reduction framework: High
- Dynamic regret bounds for linear losses: High
- Bounds for exp-concave and improper linear regression: Medium
- Practical computability claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Implement the reduction with common kernels (e.g., Gaussian RBF, polynomial) on standard online learning benchmarks to verify practical efficiency claims.
2. Test the algorithm on non-stationary data with varying degrees of temporal variation to empirically validate the $\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T}$ bound.
3. Conduct ablation studies to understand the impact of kernel choice and RKHS complexity on regret performance.
