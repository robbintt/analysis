# Mechanistic Independence: A Principle for Identifiable Disentangled Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.22196
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22196
- Authors: Stefan Matthes; Zhiwei Han; Hao Shen

- Key outcome: Introduces mechanistic independence as a new framework for disentangled representation learning that characterizes disentanglement through how latent factors act on observations via the generator, enabling identifiability under nonlinear, non-invertible mixing without distributional assumptions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces mechanistic independence as a novel framework for disentangled representation learning that shifts focus from statistical independence of latent factors to independence in how these factors act on observations through the generator. Unlike traditional approaches that require distributional assumptions, this framework enables identifiability of latent subspaces even under nonlinear, non-invertible mixing by characterizing independence through the generator's behavior. The authors propose several independence criteria—Type D (support-based), Type M (mutual non-inclusion), Type S (sparsity gap), and Type H (higher-order)—each with different identifiability guarantees, and establish a hierarchy among them. The framework unifies and generalizes recent identifiability results while clarifying when disentangled representations can be identified without distributional assumptions.

## Method Summary
The authors propose mechanistic independence as an alternative to statistical independence for characterizing disentangled representations. Instead of requiring latent factors to be statistically independent, they define independence through how these factors act on observations via the generator function. They introduce four types of mechanistic independence criteria: Type D (based on support separation), Type M (based on mutual non-inclusion of transformations), Type S (based on sparsity gaps in minimal representations), and Type H (based on higher-order independence). For each criterion, they prove identifiability results showing that independent factors correspond to connected components in graphs derived from mechanistic assumptions. The framework provides a general theory that can recover and extend existing identifiability results without requiring distributional assumptions on latent factors.

## Key Results
- Introduces four mechanistic independence criteria (Type D, M, S, H) with varying levels of identifiability guarantees
- Establishes a hierarchy showing that each stronger criterion implies weaker ones
- Proves identifiability results for each criterion, showing that independent factors correspond to connected components in mechanistic graphs
- Demonstrates that compositional contrast can serve as a surrogate loss for learning Type S independent representations, though effectiveness degrades with increasing overlap
- Generalizes and unifies recent identifiability results from the literature while remaining invariant to changes in latent density

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by shifting the focus from statistical properties of latent factors to their mechanistic behavior through the generator. Instead of requiring factors to be statistically independent, it examines how each factor independently transforms observations and whether these transformations can be distinguished based on their structural properties. This mechanistic perspective allows identifiability even when factors are statistically dependent but act differently on the observation space. The independence criteria capture different aspects of this mechanistic behavior—from basic support separation (Type D) to higher-order structural properties (Type H)—creating a spectrum of identifiability guarantees that can be matched to the characteristics of the data and generator.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mechanistic independence**: Independence defined through how latent factors act on observations rather than their statistical properties; needed because statistical independence alone is insufficient for identifiability under nonlinear mixing
- **Generator-based characterization**: Using the generator function to define independence criteria; needed because it allows analysis without distributional assumptions on latent factors
- **Connected components in mechanistic graphs**: Independent factors correspond to separate connected components; needed to provide a structural interpretation of identifiability
- **Hierarchy of independence criteria**: Type H implies Type S implies Type M implies Type D; needed to understand the trade-offs between different levels of identifiability guarantees
- **Surrogate loss functions**: Using compositional contrast as a proxy for intractable sparsity-based objectives; needed for practical implementation of Type S independence

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Latent factors -> Generator function -> Observations -> Mechanistic independence criteria -> Identifiability guarantees
Critical Path: Define generator -> Apply independence criterion -> Derive connected components -> Identify latent subspaces
Design Tradeoffs: Stronger independence criteria provide better identifiability but may be harder to verify/optimize; weaker criteria are more flexible but provide weaker guarantees
Failure Signatures: Overlapping supports of latent factor transformations, violations of sparsity gap conditions, cyclic dependencies in mechanistic graphs
First Experiments: 1) Verify Type D independence on synthetic data with known support separation, 2) Test compositional contrast loss on datasets with varying overlap ratios, 3) Compare identifiability performance across different independence criteria on the same dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a robust surrogate loss function be identified for learning Type S independent representations that remains effective even as the overlap between latent factor supports increases?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.3: "Identifying more robust surrogate losses remains an open problem, which we leave for future work."
- Why unresolved: The authors demonstrate that while compositional contrast ($C_{comp}$) serves as a surrogate for the intractable $\ell_0$ minimization required by Type S, its effectiveness degrades and it becomes prone to local minima as the overlap ratio grows (Figure 1)
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed loss function that empirically maintains high disentanglement accuracy (e.g., low unscaled mean correlation coefficient) on the high-overlap datasets where compositional contrast fails, or theoretical proof of equivalence between the new loss and the Type S sparsity gap

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can mechanistic independence principles be formally combined with stochastic (statistical) assumptions to derive stronger or more general identifiability results?
- Basis in paper: Conclusion: "...providing a theoretical foundation for future work that explores... combinations of mechanistic and stochastic assumptions."
- Why unresolved: The current framework deliberately avoids distributional assumptions to remain invariant to changes in latent density. It is theoretically unclear how to integrate these mechanistic constraints with stochastic independence (e.g., ICA, VAE priors) without losing the invariance properties or creating conflicting optimization landscapes
- What evidence would resolve it: A unified theorem showing identifiability under a hybrid model (e.g., Type H mechanisms with auxiliary variables) or an algorithm that successfully leverages both mechanistic sparsity and temporal statistics for representation learning

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is there a computationally tractable method to verify or enforce the "sparsity gap" condition ($\rho^+_B(s) < \rho^-_B(s)$) for Type S independence without relying on heuristic surrogates?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.3: "Equation [7] is intractable to optimize in practice." and the reliance on the heuristic compositional contrast
- Why unresolved: The definition of Type S independence relies on a strict inequality between minimal $\ell_0$ norms over different bases. Minimizing $\ell_0$ norm is NP-hard, and the paper relies on a heuristic (compositional contrast) which is not guaranteed to enforce the specific inequality required for identifiability
- What evidence would resolve it: A convex relaxation or alternative regularizer proven to monotonically imply the sparsity gap condition, or a polynomial-time algorithm that can verify the Type S condition for a given generator function

## Limitations
- Theoretical proofs for Type D and Type H independence are described as "sketches" rather than complete proofs, suggesting gaps in the theoretical foundation
- The framework's practical applicability across complex real-world datasets remains uncertain without extensive empirical validation
- Reliance on heuristic surrogate losses (like compositional contrast) for Type S independence may not guarantee the required mechanistic independence conditions

## Confidence
- High confidence: The framework's ability to unify and generalize existing identifiability results, the mathematical formulation of mechanistic independence criteria
- Medium confidence: The proposed independence criteria (Type M and Type S) and their hierarchy, the experimental validation with compositional contrast
- Low confidence: Practical applicability of the framework to complex real-world scenarios, the completeness of theoretical proofs for all independence types

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of the mechanistic independence assumptions on real-world datasets with known ground truth latent factors
2. Comprehensive benchmarking of the proposed independence criteria against existing disentanglement metrics and methods
3. Extension of theoretical proofs to rigorously establish identifiability guarantees for all proposed independence types, particularly Type D and Type H
