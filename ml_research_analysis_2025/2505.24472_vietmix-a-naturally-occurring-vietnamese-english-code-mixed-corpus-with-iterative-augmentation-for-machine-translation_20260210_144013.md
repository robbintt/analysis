# VietMix: A Naturally Occurring Vietnamese-English Code-Mixed Corpus with Iterative Augmentation for Machine Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.24472
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24472
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First expert-translated parallel corpus of naturally occurring Vietnamese-English code-mixed text, with quality-filtered synthetic augmentation boosting MT performance by up to +3.5 xCOMET over strong back-translation baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VIETMIX, the first expert-translated parallel corpus of naturally occurring Vietnamese-English code-mixed text, addressing the scarcity of high-quality resources for low-resource code-mixed translation. To establish its utility, the authors develop a quality-aware data augmentation pipeline combining iterative fine-tuning, heuristic and neural filtering, and synthetic data generation to produce large-scale, syntactically plausible code-mixed Vietnamese-English pairs. Experimental results show that models fine-tuned on the VIETMIX seed data significantly outperform zero-shot baselines, and further gains are achieved by augmenting with quality-filtered synthetic data—up to +3.5 xCOMET points over strong back-translation baselines and +11.9 points over zero-shot models. LLM-based pairwise assessments confirm that augmented models produce more faithful and natural translations, especially in capturing pragmatic intent and idiomatic expressions. The work delivers a foundational benchmark and a transferable methodology for code-mixed MT in low-resource settings.

## Method Summary
The authors curate VIETMIX by first applying a two-stage LID pipeline (lingua for high-recall, then ensemble LLM majority vote) and PII redaction to social media data (Threads.net, Bluesky, Reddit). A held-out expert-translated test set (1,002 pairs) is created using MQM-Core framework. The augmentation pipeline involves: (1) GPT-4o translates Vi seed → synthetic En; fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B as base En→Vi model; (2) iteratively translate En corpora → synthetic Vi, filter via heuristics (length ratio, Rlex, Rchar, En tokens) and XLM-R classifier, and retrain; (3) final filter with xCOMET threshold 0.9. All models are fine-tuned with LoRA (rank 256) under four conditions: instruction-tuned zero-shot, back-translation baseline, seed-only, and augmented. Evaluation uses xCOMET, COMETKiwi, and LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons.

## Key Results
- Models fine-tuned on VIETMIX seed data significantly outperform zero-shot multilingual baselines.
- Augmenting with quality-filtered synthetic data yields up to +3.5 xCOMET over strong back-translation baselines and +11.9 points over zero-shot models.
- LLM-based pairwise assessments (80.1-81.3% agreement with xCOMET) confirm augmented models produce more faithful and natural translations, especially in pragmatic intent and idiomatic expressions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: In-domain expert-translated seed data improves code-mixed MT more than zero-shot multilingual models.
- Mechanism: High-quality, naturally occurring code-mixed pairs provide supervision that aligns model representations with real-world switching patterns, idioms, and omitted diacritics—artifacts that large-scale monolingual or standard parallel corpora lack.
- Core assumption: Code-mixed patterns are not well-captured in the pretraining distribution of current multilingual LLMs; a small but representative in-domain signal can shift model behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Models fine-tuned on the VIETMIX seed data significantly outperform zero-shot baselines.
  - [Section 6.1] All models improve significantly when fine-tuned on the VIETMIX seed corpus compared to zero-shot.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific claim (the paper itself introduces the corpus).
- Break condition: If base models already perform near ceiling on code-mixed inputs, or if seed data is noisy/out-of-domain, gains diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Quality-filtered synthetic augmentation improves code-mixed translation over naive back-translation.
- Mechanism: Iterative forward-translation with heuristic and neural filtering removes pathological artifacts (repetition, hallucination, code-mixing collapse) and preserves syntactically plausible, pragmatically appropriate switching patterns, providing scalable supervision without inheriting back-translation’s distortion of code-mixing.
- Core assumption: Heuristic and classifier filters effectively eliminate low-quality synthetic pairs; remaining data is sufficiently natural and diverse to provide useful training signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Augmenting with quality-filtered synthetic data yields up to +3.5 xCOMET over strong back-translation baselines.
  - [Section 4] The pipeline uses heuristic constraints and a neural classifier; unfiltered synthetic data depressed performance below seed-only baseline.
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbors show synthetic data generation is a common strategy for low-resource MT, but no direct evidence of the specific filtering thresholds.
- Break condition: If filters are too aggressive, yield drops; if too permissive, noise overwhelms signal, degrading performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLM-based pairwise evaluation correlates well with COMET metrics for code-mixed translation.
- Mechanism: A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) judging semantic faithfulness against human references provides a reliable proxy for human preference, enabling calibration where traditional reference-free metrics inflate scores.
- Core assumption: LLM-as-a-judge can approximate human judgment reliably on this specific language pair and domain; prompt design ensures structured, consistent outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] LLM-based pairwise assessments confirm augmented models produce more faithful and natural translations.
  - [Section 6.2] Agreement rates of 80.1% (COMETKiwi) and 81.3% (xCOMET) with GPT-4.1 judgments.
  - [corpus] No external corpus evidence; this is an internal validation.
- Break condition: If LLM judge is miscalibrated or biased toward certain phrasing styles, agreement degrades and automatic metrics become unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Code-mixing vs. code-switching**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly distinguishes intra-sentential blending (code-mixing) from broader language alternation; understanding this is crucial for data curation and evaluation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why identifying true code-mixed text is non-trivial for Vietnamese-English due to orthographic ambiguity?

- Concept: **Reference-free vs. reference-based evaluation metrics**
  - Why needed here: The paper shows reference-free metrics like COMETKiwi can be inflated and misleading for code-mixed translation; knowing when to rely on each is essential for robust evaluation.
  - Quick check question: Why might a reference-free quality estimation metric give a high score to a semantically incorrect translation?

- Concept: **Iterative self-augmentation**
  - Why needed here: The core pipeline relies on progressive retraining with filtered synthetic data to improve translation quality.
  - Quick check question: What is the risk of repeatedly retraining a model on its own synthetic outputs without filtering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Data Sourcing & Filtering (Threads.net, Bluesky, Reddit).
  2. LID & PII Removal (lingua + ensemble LLMs).
  3. Expert Translation (MQM-Core framework).
  4. Synthetic Generation (Qwen2.5-7B En→Vi).
  5. Quality Filtering (heuristics + XLM-R classifier + xCOMET threshold).
  6. Model Training (LoRA fine-tuning on seed/augmented data).
  7. Evaluation (xCOMET, COMETKiwi, LLM-as-a-judge).

- Critical path:
  1. Obtain clean code-mixed source (LID + PII).
  2. Generate expert references for test set.
  3. Bootstrap En→Vi model with seed translations.
  4. Generate synthetic Vi from monolingual En.
  5. Filter synthetic pairs (heuristics → classifier → xCOMET).
  6. Fine-tune final MT models on combined data.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o) for initial translations: higher quality but limits reproducibility and introduces cost.
  - Forward-translation vs. back-translation: avoids code-mixing distortion but relies on En source quality.
  - Filtering thresholds (e.g., xCOMET > 0.9): aggressive filtering improves quality but reduces corpus size.

- Failure signatures:
  - LID errors (e.g., English named entities misclassified as code-mixed).
  - Synthetic data with collapsed code-mixing (all Vi or all En).
  - Repetition artifacts (lexical or sub-lexical).
  - Inflated reference-free metric scores.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the LID pipeline on a small held-out set and validate accuracy.
  2. Generate a small batch of synthetic Vi from En source and manually inspect for artifacts.
  3. Compare xCOMET scores with and without human references on a subset to verify metric calibration.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the VIETMIX methodology and augmentation pipeline transfer effectively to code-mixed translation for other low-resource language pairs, particularly those with similar orthographic overlap or tonal properties?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they "provide a validated, transferable framework for building and augmenting corpora in other low-resource settings" and that their work "establishes a framework for addressing code-mixed translation challenges across other low-resource pairs."
- Why unresolved: The methodology has only been validated on Vietnamese-English; transferability to languages with different linguistic properties (e.g., different script systems, different code-mixing patterns) remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the same pipeline to at least one other low-resource code-mixed pair (e.g., Thai-English, Indonesian-English) with comparable performance gains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can code-mixed translation systems be evaluated when generating code-mixed output from monolingual input (En→Vi direction), given that single monolingual sources have multiple valid code-mixed targets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify this as an open challenge: "The inverse task of generating natural code-mixed from a non-code-mixed source (En→Vi) is a fundamentally different challenge... this direction also presents immense evaluation challenges because a single non-code-mixed source can have an indefinite number of 'correct' code-mixed targets, and this renders reference-based metrics inadequate."
- Why unresolved: Current reference-based metrics assume a single correct target; code-mixed generation requires accepting multiple valid outputs with different mixing patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of evaluation protocols that account for multiple valid code-mixed outputs, potentially through human preference or acceptability judgments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of improved code-mixed translation quality on downstream applications such as content moderation, cross-lingual information retrieval, or chat-based systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "While we validated our metrics, we have not yet measured the impact of improved translation on more downstream, extrinsic tasks. This is an important next step for future work to assess the real-world utility of this methodology."
- Why unresolved: All evaluations in the paper are intrinsic (translation quality metrics); the practical utility of these improvements remains unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks measuring performance changes on downstream tasks when using VIETMIX-trained models versus baseline systems.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the capabilities demonstrated by proprietary-LLM-based augmentation be effectively distilled into smaller, open specialist models without significant performance degradation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Our data pipeline relies on proprietary LLMs. This introduces limitations in reproducibility, cost, and the possibility of inheriting opaque biases. Therefore, a key avenue for future research is to use VIETMIX to distill the capabilities of these large models to smaller and open specialist models."
- Why unresolved: The augmentation pipeline requires GPT-4o and other commercial models; accessibility and reproducibility remain barriers for the research community.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration that smaller open models trained on VIETMIX can generate augmentation data of comparable quality to the proprietary pipeline.

## Limitations
- Data Filtering Efficacy: Reliance on proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o) for LID and PII removal limits reproducibility and may leave residual noise in the seed corpus.
- Synthetic Data Quality: Heuristic filtering thresholds (e.g., xCOMET > 0.9) are not ablated; trade-off between data volume and quality is unquantified.
- Evaluation Reliability: LLM-as-a-judge agreement (80-81%) is internally validated but not externally verified; potential cultural or pragmatic nuance may be missed.

## Confidence
- **High**: Claims about seed-only fine-tuning outperforming zero-shot (supported by direct experimental results and ablation).
- **Medium**: Claims about synthetic augmentation gains (robust but dependent on filtering quality; no explicit ablation on filter thresholds).
- **Medium**: Claims about LLM evaluation reliability (internally validated but not externally verified; no discussion of cultural bias).

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the LID + PII Pipeline: Apply the two-stage LID pipeline to a small held-out set of Vietnamese-English posts and manually verify code-mixed detection accuracy and PII redaction completeness.
2. Inspect Synthetic Data Samples: Generate a small batch of synthetic Vi from En using the described Qwen2.5-7B model and inspect samples for code-mixing collapse, repetition artifacts, and naturalness.
3. Metric Calibration Check: On a subset of the test set, compare reference-free (COMETKiwi) and reference-based (xCOMET) scores for augmented vs. baseline models to confirm that reference-free scores are not inflated relative to human judgments.
