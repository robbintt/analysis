core_contribution: Privacy collapse occurs when benign fine-tuning degrades models'
  ability to reason about contextual privacy norms. Across six models and five datasets,
  fine-tuning for helpfulness, emotional engagement, or personalization caused severe
  privacy violations (up to 99% accuracy drop) while preserving standard safety and
  capability performance.

# Privacy Collapse: Benign Fine-Tuning Can Break Contextual Privacy in Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.15220
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15220
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** Fine-tuning degrades models' contextual privacy reasoning while preserving standard safety performance

## Executive Summary
Privacy collapse is a newly identified vulnerability where benign fine-tuning severely degrades language models' ability to reason about contextual privacy norms, despite maintaining standard safety and capability performance. The phenomenon occurs across multiple models and datasets, with privacy violations reaching up to 99% accuracy drop. This creates a silent failure mode where models appear safe under conventional evaluations but inappropriately share sensitive information across contexts. The vulnerability extends beyond proactive helpfulness to include exposure to personal data and debugging code that normalizes broad context access.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated privacy collapse across six language models fine-tuned on five different datasets targeting helpfulness, emotional engagement, and personalization objectives. Researchers employed probing techniques and layer-wise intervention analyses to examine how fine-tuning affects privacy representations in late model layers. The evaluation compared privacy performance against standard safety benchmarks to identify discrepancies between conventional safety assessments and actual privacy vulnerabilities. Synthetic and curated test sets were used to measure degradation in privacy reasoning capabilities.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning for helpfulness, emotional engagement, or personalization caused up to 99% accuracy drop in privacy reasoning
- Privacy representations are selectively fragile to fine-tuning while task-relevant features remain intact
- Models preserved standard safety benchmark performance while exhibiting severe privacy violations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Privacy collapse occurs because fine-tuning selectively degrades representations of contextual privacy norms encoded in late model layers while preserving task-relevant features. The mechanistic analysis reveals that privacy reasoning relies on specific neural representations that are more vulnerable to parameter updates during fine-tuning than general task capabilities. This differential fragility creates a situation where models maintain functional performance on standard safety evaluations but lose the nuanced understanding of when and how to protect sensitive information based on context. The phenomenon represents a fundamental tension between optimization for helpfulness and preservation of privacy reasoning capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contextual privacy norms:** Understanding that privacy requirements vary by situation (medical, legal, financial) - needed to recognize why one-size-fits-all safety measures fail; quick check: can models distinguish appropriate information sharing across different contexts?
- **Representation fragility:** Some neural features are more vulnerable to fine-tuning than others - needed to explain selective degradation; quick check: do probing interventions in late layers specifically disrupt privacy reasoning?
- **Silent failure modes:** Systems can pass standard evaluations while having critical vulnerabilities - needed to understand why conventional safety testing misses this issue; quick check: do models fail privacy tests while maintaining benchmark safety scores?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Input text -> Encoder layers -> Late-layer privacy representations -> Privacy reasoning output
- **Critical path:** Late model layers contain specialized privacy representations that are selectively degraded during fine-tuning
- **Design tradeoffs:** Optimizing for helpfulness/engagement directly conflicts with maintaining contextual privacy reasoning capabilities
- **Failure signatures:** High standard safety benchmark scores combined with severe privacy violation accuracy drops
- **First experiments to run:** 1) Test real-world conversational datasets for ecological validity, 2) Conduct ablation studies varying fine-tuning parameters, 3) Compare open-weight vs proprietary models for accessibility differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis focuses on specific privacy scenarios that may not capture the full spectrum of privacy contexts
- Evaluation methodology relies on synthetic or curated test sets rather than real-world conversational complexity
- Mechanistic analysis provides correlational rather than definitive causal evidence for selective degradation mechanisms

## Confidence
- Privacy collapse phenomenon (High): Consistent degradation across multiple models, datasets, and fine-tuning objectives provides robust evidence
- Selective fragility of privacy representations (Medium): Layer-wise analysis shows differential effects but exact mechanisms remain incompletely characterized
- Silent failure mode under standard evaluations (High): Preservation of safety benchmark performance while exhibiting privacy failures is clearly demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. Test the privacy collapse phenomenon with real-world conversational datasets and naturalistic privacy scenarios to assess ecological validity
2. Conduct ablation studies varying fine-tuning duration, learning rates, and architectural modifications to identify conditions that mitigate or prevent privacy representation degradation
3. Evaluate whether similar privacy collapse occurs in open-weight models where fine-tuning is more accessible, comparing with proprietary models studied here
