# Worst-case generation via minimax optimization in Wasserstein space

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.08176
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08176
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposed framework for worst-case generation in DRO using Wasserstein space with convergence guarantees and scalable sample generation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for worst-case sample generation in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) by formulating the problem as a min-max optimization over continuous probability distributions in Wasserstein space. The key innovation is using transport maps parameterized by neural networks, enabling scalable worst-case sample generation beyond discrete DRO. The approach bridges the gap between DRO theory and practical worst-case sample generation, offering a scalable solution for robustness evaluation in high-stakes applications.

## Method Summary
The method formulates worst-case generation as a min-max optimization problem over continuous probability distributions via transport maps in Wasserstein space. The framework consists of two stages: particle optimization using Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) to update the classifier and particle locations, and neural transport map training to generalize the transport map to unseen data. A neural network parameterizes the transport map and is trained simultaneously with the GDA iterations through an L2 matching loss. The approach enables generalization to unseen test samples and is validated on synthetic and image data (MNIST, CIFAR-10), demonstrating efficient convergence and the ability to generate meaningful worst-case distributions through semantic deformations.

## Key Results
- Develops a GDA-type algorithm with convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, even without convexity-concavity
- Demonstrates efficient convergence and ability to generate meaningful worst-case distributions through semantic deformations on MNIST and CIFAR-10
- Bridges the gap between DRO theory and practical worst-case sample generation, offering a scalable solution for robustness evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by reformulating DRO as a min-max problem over transport maps in Wasserstein space, where the inner maximization finds the worst-case perturbation of data samples subject to a transportation cost constraint. The transport map is parameterized by a neural network trained simultaneously with the GDA iterations through an L2 matching loss, allowing the method to generalize to unseen test samples. This formulation enables continuous worst-case sample generation beyond discrete DRO, addressing the computational challenge of evaluating robustness in high-stakes applications.

## Foundational Learning
- **Wasserstein DRO:** Distributionally robust optimization using Wasserstein distance as the ambiguity set, needed to model transportation cost constraints on perturbations.
  - *Quick check:* Verify the Wasserstein ball constraint is properly implemented as the transportation cost term.
- **Min-max optimization in Wasserstein space:** Optimization over continuous probability distributions using transport maps, needed to avoid discrete approximations.
  - *Quick check:* Confirm the transport map parameterization can represent meaningful perturbations.
- **GDA with momentum:** Gradient descent ascent algorithm with momentum, needed for convergence in nonconvex-nonconcave settings.
  - *Quick check:* Monitor gradient norms to ensure convergence behavior.
- **Neural transport map parameterization:** Using neural networks to parameterize transport maps, needed for scalability and generalization.
  - *Quick check:* Verify the transport map can generate semantically meaningful perturbations.
- **L2 matching loss:** Loss function for training the transport map to match particle locations, needed for generalization to unseen data.
  - *Quick check:* Ensure the L2 loss properly aligns transported samples with target particles.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Pre-trained VAE -> Latent Space -> Transport Map Network -> Worst-case Samples -> Classifier

**Critical Path:**
1. Pre-train VAE on training data
2. Initialize particles and transport map
3. Iterate GDA updates on particles and classifier
4. Train transport map to match particle locations
5. Generate worst-case samples for evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- **Wasserstein vs. other metrics:** Wasserstein distance provides transportation cost constraints but requires solving optimal transport problems.
- **Neural vs. parametric transport maps:** Neural networks offer flexibility and scalability but require careful training and may lack interpretability.
- **GDA with momentum vs. other optimizers:** Momentum helps convergence in nonconvex settings but may introduce oscillations if not tuned properly.

**Failure Signatures:**
- **Divergence:** Gradient norms oscillate or increase, indicating step sizes too large or regularization insufficient.
- **Semantically meaningless transport:** Generated images are artifacts or noise, suggesting VAE latent space is not smooth or transport map is not properly trained.
- **Poor generalization:** Transport map fails to generate meaningful perturbations on unseen data, indicating insufficient training or model capacity.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Verify VAE reconstruction quality on training data to ensure latent space smoothness.
2. Test GDA convergence on a simple 2D synthetic dataset with known optimal solution.
3. Evaluate transport map generalization by generating worst-case samples on held-out test data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical convergence guarantees rely on strong regularity assumptions that may not hold in high-dimensional latent spaces.
- The method's sensitivity to hyperparameters (step sizes, momentum, regularization) is not thoroughly explored, which is critical for practical deployment.
- The claim of "semantic deformations" is validated visually but lacks quantitative metrics for measuring semantic shift.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The min-max formulation and its connection to Wasserstein DRO are mathematically correct. The two-stage optimization procedure is clearly described and implementable.

**Medium Confidence:** The empirical convergence results and visual quality of generated worst-case samples are convincing but rely on a single VAE architecture and fixed hyperparameters.

**Low Confidence:** The theoretical convergence analysis for the full nonconvex-nonconcave case is incomplete, and the method's generalization to other latent space models or loss functions is untested.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on Regularization:** Systematically vary γ to quantify the trade-off between transport magnitude and worst-case loss improvement.
2. **Robustness to Hyperparameters:** Conduct a sensitivity analysis on step sizes (η, τ) and momentum (β) to identify stable operating regimes.
3. **Quantitative Semantic Evaluation:** Develop or apply a metric (e.g., CLIP-based similarity, human evaluation) to measure the semantic difference between original and worst-case samples.
