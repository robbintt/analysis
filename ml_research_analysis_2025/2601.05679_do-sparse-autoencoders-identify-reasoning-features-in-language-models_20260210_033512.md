# Do Sparse Autoencoders Identify Reasoning Features in Language Models?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.05679
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05679
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Across 22 configurations, 45%-90% of contrastively selected "reasoning" features activate when only a few associated tokens are injected into non-reasoning text

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can identify genuine reasoning features in large language models. Through theoretical analysis and empirical falsification experiments, the authors demonstrate that SAE sparsity bias systematically favors low-dimensional token-level patterns over high-dimensional reasoning processes. Their novel falsification framework, combining causal token injection with LLM-guided counterexample generation, reveals that most contrastively selected reasoning features track superficial linguistic correlates rather than semantic reasoning.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a falsification-based evaluation framework that first selects top reasoning features using contrastive metrics (Cohen's d, ROC-AUC) between reasoning and non-reasoning corpora, then applies token injection to test sensitivity to lexical cues, and finally uses LLM-guided adversarial counterexample generation to construct non-reasoning inputs that trigger the feature and meaning-preserving paraphrases that suppress it. They test across 22 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and datasets, using steering experiments as a final validation check on benchmark performance.

## Key Results
- 45%-90% of contrastively selected reasoning features activate when only 2-3 associated tokens are injected into non-reasoning text
- All 248 context-dependent features analyzed admitted systematic false positives and negatives through LLM-guided falsification
- Steering the highest-ranked features yields no improvements on benchmarks (AIME/GPQA)
- Feature overlap across datasets is minimal (Jaccard 0.06-0.19), suggesting dataset-specific cues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Sparsity-regularized decoding preferentially retains stable low-dimensional lexical cues while suppressing high-dimensional within-reasoning variation
- **Mechanism:** When reasoning traces co-occur with recurring tokens (e.g., "wait", "therefore"), the ℓ₁ penalty makes it "cheaper" for the SAE to represent the cue direction via a single coordinate than to distribute the semantic variation across many small coordinates. The theoretical analysis shows exponential suppression of recovered energy from the high-dimensional component as (k−1)λ² grows.
- **Core assumption:** Reasoning has a stable low-dimensional cue component that correlates with a high-dimensional semantic component distributed across many directions.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "sparsity-regularized decoding favors stable low-dimensional correlates over high-dimensional within-reasoning variation"; [Section 3, Theorem 3.1] Expected recovered energy from the (k−1)-dimensional component decays exponentially in (k−1)λ²
- **Break condition:** If reasoning has no stable lexical correlates, or if λ is small relative to the variance b²/(k−1), the asymmetry diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Most contrastively selected "reasoning" features are triggered by injecting just 2–3 associated tokens into non-reasoning text
- **Mechanism:** Features that separate reasoning/non-reasoning corpora via Cohen's d or ROC-AUC often encode token-level patterns (e.g., "First, I need to") that appear in CoT text. Causal injection tests reveal that lexical presence alone—without semantic reasoning—is sufficient to elicit strong activation.
- **Core assumption:** Genuine reasoning features should not activate strongly when surface cues are present in non-reasoning contexts.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "45%-90% of contrastively selected reasoning features activate when only a few associated tokens are injected into non-reasoning text"; [Section 5.3, Table 2] Across 22 configurations, 45–90% of features classified as token-driven or partially token-driven
- **Break condition:** If token injection fails to elicit activation, features may encode higher-level patterns—these become candidates for deeper falsification.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** LLM-guided adversarial counterexamples can falsify even "context-dependent" features by constructing non-reasoning text that instantiates the feature's pattern and paraphrases that preserve meaning but suppress activation
- **Mechanism:** The LLM hypothesizes what pattern the feature detects (e.g., "First, I need to" syntactic template), generates false positives (non-reasoning text with that pattern) and false negatives (meaning-preserving paraphrases without the pattern). If both succeed, the feature tracks surface form, not semantic reasoning.
- **Core assumption:** Meaning-preserving paraphrases should not substantially alter activation for features encoding semantic reasoning.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "LLM-guided falsification reliably constructs non-reasoning inputs that instantiate the feature's token-level cues and trigger activation, and meaning-preserving paraphrases of top-activating reasoning traces that suppress it"; [Section 5.4, Tables 3–4] Across 248 context-dependent features analyzed, zero classified as genuine reasoning; all admitted systematic FPs/FNs
- **Break condition:** If neither valid FPs nor FNs can be constructed, the feature may encode genuine reasoning—but none were found.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) basics**
  - Why needed here: The entire analysis hinges on understanding how SAEs decompose activations into sparse features and why sparsity induces representational biases.
  - Quick check question: Explain why an ℓ₁ penalty on latent activations favors solutions where few coordinates are nonzero.

- **Concept: Contrastive feature selection**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates features selected by Cohen's d or ROC-AUC between reasoning and non-reasoning corpora—understanding what these metrics measure is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: If a feature has Cohen's d = 1.5 on reasoning vs. non-reasoning text, what does that imply about its activation distributions?

- **Concept: Causal vs. correlational interpretability**
  - Why needed here: The core argument is that high activation correlation ≠ causal representation; the falsification framework tests whether activation is necessary/sufficient for reasoning behavior.
  - Quick check question: A feature activates on 95% of reasoning samples and 10% of non-reasoning samples. What additional test would determine if it encodes reasoning vs. a lexical correlate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Contrastive selector -> Token injector -> LLM falsifier -> Steering check

- **Critical path:**
  1. Sample reasoning corpus (s1K or General Inquiry CoT) and non-reasoning corpus (Pile uncopyrighted); chunk to 64 tokens
  2. Compute feature activations; rank by contrastive metric; select top 100
  3. For each feature: identify top tokens → inject into non-reasoning samples → classify token sensitivity
  4. For context-dependent features: run LLM-guided falsification (max 10 iterations, early stop at 3 valid FPs + 3 FNs)
  5. Optional: steer top features and evaluate on AIME/GPQA benchmarks

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Middle layers selected for lower token concentration / higher entropy (Figure 2); early layers too lexical, late layers output-focused
  - Maximum aggregation across tokens (vs. mean) reduces sensitivity to sequence length but may overemphasize single spikes
  - Falsification thresholds (τ=0.5×max reasoning activation for FPs, 0.1τ for FNs) balance sensitivity vs. noise

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Features with high token concentration (>0.5) almost always token-driven—skip detailed falsification
  - Low overlap between s1K and General Inquiry CoT feature sets (Jaccard 0.06–0.19) suggests dataset-specific cues
  - Steering yields minimal or degraded performance—behavioral change ≠ reasoning representation

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce token injection on a single model/layer/dataset; verify 45–90% token-driven classification holds
  2. Run LLM-guided falsification on 5–10 context-dependent features; check if valid FPs/FNs are constructed within 2–3 iterations (median observed: 2)
  3. Vary the sparsity parameter λ in the theoretical model (Eq. 2); confirm predicted suppression of high-dimensional residual as λ increases relative to b/√(k−1)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can alternative SAE training objectives or architectures be designed to explicitly preserve high-dimensional within-behavior variation rather than suppressing it?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The theoretical analysis (Section 3) demonstrates that ℓ1 and Top-K sparsity regularization systematically suppress high-dimensional isotropic components even under an ideal dictionary, while retaining low-dimensional correlates.
- Why unresolved: The paper characterizes a failure mode of current SAEs but does not propose or test modified objectives that might balance sparsity against preservation of distributed behavioral structure.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training SAEs with modified objectives (e.g., structured sparsity, group regularizers, or explicit variance preservation terms) and evaluating whether contrastively selected features become more robust to the falsification tests described.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do reasoning-relevant representations exist as distributed patterns across multiple SAE features, even when no single feature satisfies the criteria for genuine reasoning representation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section explicitly states the results "do not rule out... the possibility that reasoning-relevant information is distributed across many features or represented nonlinearly in ways that resist single-feature attribution."
- Why unresolved: The paper's falsification framework evaluates individual features in isolation; it does not test whether combinations of features might jointly track reasoning behavior.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying multivariate probing methods (e.g., linear probes on feature subsets, attention-head style superposition analysis) to test whether feature ensembles predict reasoning behavior when individual features fail falsification.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Would features selected using causal intervention criteria rather than correlational contrastive methods better identify genuine reasoning mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper develops falsification as a post-hoc validation step but does not explore whether alternative selection criteria—e.g., features whose activation causally affects reasoning task performance—might identify different feature sets that are more robust to falsification.
- Why unresolved: The contrastive selection methodology using Cohen's d, ROC-AUC, and frequency ratio all rely on correlational differences between corpora.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing features selected by causal criteria (e.g., gradient-based attribution, steering efficacy) against contrastively selected features using the falsification pipeline.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How generalizable are the findings across broader model families, scales, and training regimes—particularly models explicitly trained for reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section notes "Our conclusions are scoped to the contrastive candidate features and experimental settings we study." Only one explicitly reasoning-trained model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B) was tested, showing similar token-driven patterns.
- Why unresolved: It remains unclear whether models with different pretraining objectives or scales would exhibit different sparsity-driven biases in their SAE decompositions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the falsification framework to larger reasoning-specialized models (e.g., full DeepSeek-R1, o1-class models) and comparing the proportion of features that pass falsification tests.

## Limitations

- The core assumption that reasoning can be cleanly separated into stable lexical cues and high-dimensional semantic variation is not directly validated
- The LLM-guided falsification methodology introduces potential subjectivity through manual validation of false positives and negatives
- The framework only evaluates individual features in isolation, not whether distributed patterns across multiple features might encode reasoning

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The sparsity bias mechanism is mathematically sound and token injection results are reproducible
- Dataset-specific nature of contrastively selected features is well-established
- Steering experiments showing minimal performance are reliable

**Medium Confidence:**
- Interpretation that most SAE features track superficial linguistic patterns
- Generalizability of the falsification methodology to other SAE applications
- Claim that all context-dependent features can be systematically falsified

**Low Confidence:**
- Completeness of the falsification - whether genuine reasoning features might resist current methods
- Extent to which sparsity bias applies to all SAE applications vs. this specific context

## Next Checks

1. **Direct validation of the decomposition assumption:** Design experiments that explicitly test whether reasoning traces can be decomposed into stable lexical cues and high-dimensional semantic variation by ablating specific lexical patterns while preserving semantic content and measuring feature activation changes.

2. **Cross-dataset transfer test:** Take features identified as "genuine reasoning" candidates from one dataset and test their activation patterns on a held-out reasoning dataset. High activation on the new dataset would provide stronger evidence for genuine reasoning encoding rather than dataset-specific cues.

3. **Alternative sparsity regularization comparison:** Train SAEs with different sparsity regularization strengths (varying λ) and compare feature activation patterns and falsification success rates to test the predicted relationship between sparsity strength and the representation of low-dimensional vs. high-dimensional components.
