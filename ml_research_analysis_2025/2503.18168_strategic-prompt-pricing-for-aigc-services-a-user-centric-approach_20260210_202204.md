# Strategic Prompt Pricing for AIGC Services: A User-Centric Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.18168
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18168
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: Introduces Optimal Prompt Pricing (OPP) algorithm achieving up to 31.72% improvement in platform payoff by optimizing prompt pricing for heterogeneous user capabilities

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a theoretical framework for optimizing prompt pricing in AI-generated content (AIGC) services by modeling users as strategic agents with varying "prompt ambiguity" capabilities. The authors establish that users with intermediate prompt ambiguity exhibit non-monotonic prompt usage patterns, first increasing then decreasing prompt attempts as their capability improves. Based on this insight, they propose the Optimal Prompt Pricing (OPP) algorithm that maximizes platform revenue by strategically partitioning users and setting optimal prices for multiple model tiers. Experimental evaluation using a character-level GPT-like model demonstrates significant revenue improvements over existing pricing mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The framework models AIGC services as a Stackelberg game where the platform (leader) sets prompt prices and users (followers) strategically choose models and prompt counts to maximize their utility. The core innovation is quantifying "prompt ambiguity" as a user capability parameter that determines both optimal prompt usage (non-monotonically) and model selection. The OPP algorithm solves the resulting bi-level non-convex optimization by decomposing it into tractable sub-problems through strategic price partitioning based on user ambiguity distribution. The algorithm iteratively determines optimal prices for high-tier models given each possible low-tier price, using theoretical bounds to partition the user population.

## Key Results
- Users with higher prompt ambiguity exhibit non-monotonic prompt usage patterns, first increasing then decreasing prompt attempts as their capability improves
- OPP algorithm achieves up to 31.72% improvement in platform payoff compared to Modified Utility-Based and Modified Cost-Based Pricing mechanisms
- Platform payoff maximization requires strategic price partitioning based on user ambiguity distribution rather than uniform pricing across all users

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: User Strategy Optimization via Prompt Ambiguity Quantification
- Claim: A user's optimal number of prompts for a given AI model follows a non-monotonic (inverse U-shaped) pattern with respect to their "prompt ambiguity" when model prices are low.
- Mechanism: User payoff is modeled as expected utility (probability of success × model utility) minus cost (prompts × price). Success probability is defined as $1 - \epsilon^n$, where $\epsilon$ is prompt ambiguity (lower is better) and $n$ is the number of prompts. This creates a trade-off: more prompts increase success probability but also cost. The non-monotonicity arises because users with moderate capability ($\epsilon$) derive higher marginal utility from an additional prompt than those with very high or very low capability.
- Core assumption: A user's utility is solely determined by the probability of successfully conveying their intention and the model's intrinsic utility. This assumes a specific functional form for success probability ($1 - \epsilon^n$) based on independent prompts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...users with higher prompt ambiguity (i.e., lower capability) exhibit non-monotonic prompt usage patterns, first increasing then decreasing..."
  - [section] Proposition 1 formally details the relationship, showing that for a low price ($p_s \le U_s/4$), the optimal prompt number first increases and then decreases with ambiguity.
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak; it generally supports the importance of prompt engineering for service utility but does not validate the non-monotonic relationship.
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks if prompts are not independent (e.g., chain-of-thought), if the success probability function is incorrect, or if user utility cannot be captured by the expected value model.

### Mechanism 2: Platform Revenue Maximization via Strategic Price Partitioning
- Claim: A platform can maximize its payoff by using a specialized algorithm (OPP) that strategically partitions users based on their ambiguity to set optimal prices for multiple model tiers.
- Mechanism: The platform's problem is a bi-level non-convex optimization. The OPP algorithm decomposes this by iteratively solving for the optimal price of a high-tier model ($p_H$) for each possible price of a low-tier model ($p_L$). It uses a theoretical upper price bound (Eq. 12) to partition the user population into those who would choose the low-tier vs. the high-tier model, thereby converting the problem into tractable sub-problems.
- Core assumption: The distribution of user ambiguity across the population is known and stationary. Users are rational agents who always choose the model and prompt count that maximize their individual payoff.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experimental evaluation... demonstrates that our OPP algorithm achieves up to 31.72% improvement in platform payoff compared to existing pricing mechanisms."
  - [section] Algorithm 1 description outlines the iterative decomposition, and Problem 2 shows the reformulation for a single model.
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak; no papers were found that validate this specific algorithm or its reported payoff improvement.
- Break condition: The mechanism fails if the user ambiguity distribution is unknown or dynamic, if users behave irrationally, or if the presence of more than two model tiers invalidates the binary partitioning logic.

### Mechanism 3: Model Selection via Price-Utility Trade-off
- Claim: A user's choice between AI models is determined by a calculated trade-off between the model's utility, its price, and the user's own prompt ambiguity.
- Mechanism: A user computes their maximum expected payoff for each available model. The optimal selection is the model yielding the highest payoff. The paper derives a price upper bound for the low-tier model, above which a user with a given ambiguity level will switch to the high-tier model. This bound is a function of the utility difference between models and the prompt cost needed to compensate for it.
- Core assumption: Users have perfect information about each model's utility mapping ($U_m$) and make optimal selections based on this knowledge. Models are functionally substitutable for the same task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...current approaches overlook users' strategic two-step decision-making process in selecting and utilizing generative AI models."
  - [section] Equation (8) defines the optimal model selection, and Equation (12) provides the theoretical upper bound for model switching.
  - [corpus] Corpus mentions dynamic service provisioning but does not detail this specific selection mechanism.
- Break condition: The mechanism is invalid if models are not substitutable, if users lack information to judge utility, or if non-price factors (e.g., latency, brand) dominate the selection decision.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stackelberg Game (Leader-Follower Game)
  - Why needed here: The AIGC service process is explicitly framed as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Understanding this hierarchical structure is essential to grasp why the platform's optimization is "bi-level"—it must account for the subsequent, rational reaction of the users (followers) to its pricing decisions (leader's move).
  - Quick check question: In this model, who is the leader and who is the follower, and what action does each take?

- Concept: In-Context Learning (ICL)
  - Why needed here: The core concept of "prompt ambiguity" is inspired by ICL literature. Understanding that ICL involves a model learning from context (prompts) without weight updates provides the theoretical basis for modeling task success as a function of the number and quality of prompts.
  - Quick check question: How does the paper relate the number of prompts to the probability of a successful task outcome, and what concept from in-context learning does this draw upon?

- Concept: Bi-level and Non-Convex Optimization
  - Why needed here: The primary technical challenge is that the platform's payoff maximization is a bi-level, non-convex problem. This classification signals that standard optimization methods are insufficient, motivating the paper's contribution of a specialized decomposition algorithm (OPP).
  - Quick check question: Why is the platform's optimization problem described as "bi-level" and why does its non-convexity make it difficult to solve?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
    1.  **User Model**: Represents a heterogeneous user population defined by a distribution of prompt ambiguity $f(\epsilon)$. Each user computes a payoff to make a two-step decision: select a model ($s^*$) and determine the number of prompts ($n^*$).
    2.  **Platform Model**: The service provider managing a set of GAI models (e.g., $\{M_L, M_H\}$). Each model has a utility mapping ($U_m$) and operational cost ($C_m$). The platform's objective is to set prompt prices ($p$) to maximize aggregate payoff.
    3.  **Pricing Engine (OPP Algorithm)**: The decision-making component that ingests model specs and user distribution data. It executes the decomposition strategy (Alg. 1) to output the optimal price vector $p^*$.
    4.  **Simulation Environment**: A character-level GPT-like model used for experimental validation, simulating user intentions and AIGC responses to measure outcomes like KL divergence and payoff.

- Critical path: The system's validity hinges on the **User Model**. The accuracy of the "prompt ambiguity" framework in capturing real user behavior is the central linchpin. If this abstraction is flawed, the derived user strategies ($n^*, s^*$) will be incorrect, causing the **Pricing Engine** to optimize for a non-existent reality, leading to suboptimal or negative results in a live deployment.

- Design tradeoffs:
    - **Model Granularity vs. Computational Tractability**: The paper focuses on a binary model set ($M_L, M_H$) to make the analysis tractable. Extending the OPP algorithm to handle many distinct model tiers would significantly increase the complexity of the optimization.
    - **Theoretical Optimality vs. Practicality**: The OPP algorithm provides an optimal solution but relies on knowing the user ambiguity distribution $f(\epsilon)$. In practice, this distribution must be estimated, introducing potential error.
    - **Payoff vs. User Accessibility**: The platform's strategy is to maximize its own payoff. This can result in pricing structures that exclude users with high prompt ambiguity (low capability), a potential fairness issue not addressed in the optimization.

- Failure signatures:
    - **User Drop-off**: If the platform sets prices based on overestimated user utility, users will calculate a negative payoff and abandon the service ($n^* = 0$).
    - **Local Optima Trap**: If the non-convex payoff landscape is more complex than modeled, the algorithm could converge to a local maximum, yielding prices that are significantly suboptimal.
    - **Distribution Drift**: If the actual user ambiguity distribution shifts from the assumed $f(\epsilon)$, the pre-calculated optimal prices will become misaligned with the market, causing unpredictable revenue fluctuations.

- First 3 experiments:
    1.  **Validate User Behavior (Non-Monotonicity)**: Fix a low prompt price and vary user ambiguity $\epsilon$ in the simulation. Plot the resulting optimal prompt number $n^*$ against $\epsilon$. Confirm the predicted inverse U-shaped curve to validate the core user model.
    2.  **Benchmark Pricing Mechanisms**: Compare the proposed OPP algorithm against the two benchmarks: Modified Utility-Based Pricing and Modified Cost-Based Pricing. Run simulations across different user ambiguity distributions and measure total platform payoff to reproduce the reported ~31% improvement.
    3.  **Sensitivity to User Distribution**: Alter the parameters of the user ambiguity distribution $f(\epsilon)$ (e.g., shift the mean ambiguity higher). Re-run the OPP algorithm and analyze how the optimal prices and total payoff change. This tests the system's robustness to different market conditions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does temporal dependency between prompts (e.g., chain-of-thought reasoning) alter the optimal prompt usage strategy and platform pricing?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Footnote 1 (Page 3) states the analysis focuses on independent prompts, noting that dependent cases require analyzing "more complicated prompt correlations."
- **Why unresolved:** The current mathematical framework (Lemma 1) assumes prompts are independently generated, simplifying the probability of intention inference.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Extending the prompt ambiguity definition to conditional probabilities and analyzing the resulting payoff functions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can the Optimal Prompt Pricing (OPP) algorithm be adapted to optimize strategies for a continuous spectrum of GAI model performance tiers?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VI (Conclusion) explicitly lists supporting "GAI models with more granular performance tiers" as a goal for future refinement.
- **Why unresolved:** The current algorithm relies on a binary model set $\{M_L, M_H\}$ to decompose the bi-level optimization into tractable sub-problems.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A generalized version of Algorithm 1 that converges efficiently with $N>2$ models.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the counterintuitive, non-monotonic usage pattern persist when validating the framework against empirical user behaviors on production AIGC platforms?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section VI (Conclusion) notes the need to "enhance our experiments with practical data sets and model-based agents" rather than synthetic data.
- **Why unresolved:** Current validation relies on synthetic language data and a character-level GPT model, which may not fully capture human strategic decision-making.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Field data showing prompt usage frequencies across different price points and user ambiguity levels in a live deployment.

## Limitations

- The framework assumes users have perfect information about model utilities and behave as rational agents, which may not reflect real-world user behavior
- The non-monotonic relationship between prompt ambiguity and usage depends heavily on the specific success probability function ($1 - \epsilon^n$), lacking empirical validation
- Current experimental validation uses a character-level GPT-like model rather than real-world AIGC systems, limiting generalizability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mathematical formulation of the Stackelberg game structure and the OPP algorithm's decomposition approach are well-defined and internally consistent
- **Medium Confidence**: The relationship between prompt ambiguity and user strategy (non-monotonicity) is theoretically sound but requires empirical validation beyond the current simulation framework
- **Low Confidence**: The claimed 31.72% improvement over existing mechanisms needs validation with more diverse AIGC models and real user data, as current evidence comes from a single-character-level model simulation

## Next Checks

1. **Validate Non-Monotonic Behavior**: Conduct human user studies across different capability levels, fixing prompt prices at low values, and measure actual prompt usage patterns to confirm the predicted inverse U-shaped relationship with ambiguity.

2. **Benchmark Against Real-World Mechanisms**: Implement the OPP algorithm alongside Modified Utility-Based and Modified Cost-Based Pricing in a live AIGC platform with multiple model tiers, measuring actual revenue impact across diverse user populations.

3. **Stress Test Distribution Assumptions**: Systematically vary the assumed user ambiguity distribution parameters in simulation, then re-optimize prices and measure payoff changes to quantify sensitivity to distribution estimation errors.
