# Eco-Friendly AI: Unleashing Data Power for Green Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.17241
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17241
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Data-centric FL achieves 56% carbon emission reduction while improving accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a data-centric approach to reduce the environmental impact of Federated Learning (FL) by analyzing dataset characteristics and selecting optimal data subsets based on quality metrics and node carbon emissions. The method combines horizontal and vertical data reduction strategies, with vertical reduction (selecting fewer, higher-quality nodes) showing superior performance. Experiments on time series classification tasks demonstrate significant reductions in carbon emissions while maintaining or improving model accuracy. The proposed FL Configuration Selection System provides actionable recommendations for researchers to optimize FL training for both performance and sustainability.

## Method Summary
The approach involves analyzing dataset characteristics, selecting optimal data subsets based on quality metrics, and choosing federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. The method uses a combination of horizontal and vertical data reduction strategies, with vertical reduction showing better performance. A node scoring function combines normalized carbon intensity with weighted data quality dimensions (consistency, completeness). Experiments were conducted using the Flower framework with ResNet models on time series datasets from the UCR/UEA archive, comparing Node Selection, Minimal Smart Reduction, and Smart Reduction methods against a baseline.

## Key Results
- Node Selection method achieved an average 56% reduction in carbon emissions
- Vertical data reduction consistently achieved higher or equal accuracy compared to horizontal reduction
- The data-volume-to-accuracy relationship can be modeled predictively using Gradient Boosting regressors
- Training on clean data can delay early stopping, potentially increasing energy consumption despite using less data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Vertical data reduction achieves greater carbon savings than horizontal reduction while maintaining accuracy.
- Mechanism: Selecting fewer, higher-quality nodes reduces total compute cycles and communication overhead. The node scoring function combines normalized carbon intensity with weighted data quality dimensions, ranking nodes and selecting the top N̂ nodes to meet target data volume percentage V.
- Core assumption: Data quality and node-level carbon intensity are stable and measurable before training begins.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The Node Selection method achieved an average 56% reduction in carbon emissions, while still improving accuracy over baseline methods." [section 5.2] "Results show that the vertical approach consistently achieves higher or equal accuracy compared to the horizontal approach."
- Break condition: May fail if data quality metrics are incorrectly specified, node carbon intensity fluctuates unpredictably, or the target accuracy is unachievable with available high-quality nodes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Predictive modeling of the data-volume-to-accuracy relationship enables pre-training recommendations for optimal dataset reduction.
- Mechanism: A Gradient Boosting regressor takes dataset features (type, number of training samples, sequence length, number of classes) and desired accuracy threshold as input, outputting required data volume expressed as number of nodes N̂ under vertical reduction.
- Core assumption: The regressor generalizes to unseen datasets.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The proposed FL Configuration Selection System provides actionable recommendations for researchers to optimize FL training for both performance and sustainability." [section 5.2] "The model with the lowest test error, Gradient Boosting, was ultimately selected."
- Break condition: May underperform if new dataset lies outside training distribution, accuracy-volume relationship differs fundamentally, or FL training dynamics deviate significantly.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Filtering low-quality data from selected nodes can improve accuracy but may increase carbon emissions if early stopping is prevented.
- Mechanism: Minimal Smart Reduction and Smart Reduction methods remove "dirty" data (mislabels, inconsistencies, missing values) before training. Cleaner data can lead to more stable loss curves, delaying early stopping and extending training duration.
- Core assumption: Removing low-quality data improves signal-to-noise ratio sufficiently to maintain or improve accuracy.
- Evidence anchors: [section 6.1] "Training on clean data results in a consistent reduction of evaluation loss after each round, preventing premature termination of the training process." [section 6.4] "MSR, which selects the same nodes as NS but uses clean data, results in longer FL training due to an increased number of epochs and extended duration."
- Break condition: May not hold if data cleaning process is computationally expensive, quality filtering removes too much data, or early stopping criterion is not primary driver of training duration.

## Foundational Learning

- **Federated Learning (FL) Basics**: The entire methodology operates within an FL setting where data is distributed across nodes and models are aggregated centrally. Understanding local training, parameter aggregation, and communication rounds is essential to interpret energy and accuracy trade-offs.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why FL introduces system and statistical heterogeneity as challenges for energy efficiency?

- **Data Quality Dimensions (Accuracy, Consistency, Completeness)**: The node scoring and data reduction strategies explicitly rely on quantified data quality metrics. Understanding how these are defined and injected as degradations is critical for reproducing experiments.
  - Quick check question: How would you measure "consistency" in a federated dataset where labels for duplicate samples may conflict across nodes?

- **Carbon Intensity and Energy Measurement for ML**: The paper quantifies environmental impact in kg CO2e, derived from energy consumption (kWh) and regional carbon intensity. Understanding these units and data sources is necessary for realistic deployment.
  - Quick check question: If a node in a region with low carbon intensity but high power consumption is compared to a node with high carbon intensity but low power, which would the scoring function prefer, assuming equal data quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: FL Simulator (Flower framework) -> Curves Extractor -> Data Analyzer -> Training Component -> FL Reduction System -> FL Configuration Recommender

- **Critical path**:
  1. Run FL Simulator on representative datasets with controlled degradations (horizontal and vertical)
  2. Extract and store accuracy-energy curves
  3. Train the Gradient Boosting regressor
  4. For a new FL task, gather node metadata and data quality metrics
  5. Call FL Reduction System to predict N̂
  6. FL Configuration Recommender ranks nodes and outputs selected subset

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - NS vs. MSR vs. SR: NS prioritizes energy efficiency; MSR adds quality filtering but may increase emissions; SR targets accuracy but can negate emission savings
  - Exploration cost: The Data-Centric FL Exploration phase generates upfront carbon emissions but is intended as one-time investment for reusable recommendations
  - Static vs. dynamic weights: Current implementation uses fixed weights for energy and quality in node scoring; dynamic adjustment noted as future work

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Accuracy threshold not met: Investigate whether predicted N̂ is too low or data quality is insufficient
  - Emissions higher than baseline for SR/MSR: Check if early stopping is being delayed due to cleaner data
  - Regressor returns implausible N̂: Verify input features are within training distribution; consider retraining with more diverse datasets

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline Reproduction: Implement FL Simulator with Flower on small time-series dataset, run horizontal and vertical reduction experiments, verify accuracy-volume curves match reported pattern
  2. Node Selection Ablation: Compare NS, MSR, and SR methods on Configuration 1; measure carbon emissions and accuracy; confirm NS achieves highest emission reduction
  3. Regressor Generalization Test: Train Gradient Boosting model on 4 of 5 UCR datasets, test prediction of N̂ on held-out dataset; report prediction error and discuss failure cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the node scoring weights (WE, Wi) be optimized through dynamic adjustment rather than fixed values to better balance real-time energy efficiency and data quality?
- To what extent do FL hyperparameters (e.g., aggregation techniques, batch size, number of epochs) influence the energy efficiency gains achieved through data-centric reduction?
- How does the data reduction methodology perform on non-time-series tasks, such as computer vision or natural language processing?
- How does energy consumption vary when analyzing data distribution effects (Non-IID data) within individual nodes rather than just system-wide?

## Limitations

- Core findings depend heavily on simulated FL environments with controlled data quality degradations
- Real-world FL deployments exhibit more complex system and statistical heterogeneity that may invalidate scoring function stability
- The paper's use of fixed logarithmic model for accuracy-volume relationships may not capture non-monotonic or dataset-specific patterns
- Upfront carbon cost of exploration phase is acknowledged but not deeply analyzed for amortized benefit

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Experimental results within controlled simulation environment are internally consistent with clear improvements in carbon efficiency for NS method (56% reduction)
- **Medium Confidence**: Predictive power of Gradient Boosting regressor is inferred from training on small set of UCR datasets without thorough out-of-distribution validation
- **Low Confidence**: Node scoring function not validated against real-world carbon intensity fluctuations; assumption that data quality metrics are stable and representative not rigorously tested

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Stress Test**: Train Gradient Boosting regressor on 4 UCR datasets and test accuracy-volume predictions on held-out dataset; quantify prediction error and analyze failure modes for datasets with different characteristics

2. **Dynamic Carbon Intensity Simulation**: Modify simulator to introduce time-varying carbon intensity for nodes; re-run NS method and assess if static scoring function remains effective or if dynamic re-weighting is necessary

3. **Real-Data Quality Correlation**: Using public federated dataset with ground-truth labels, implement data cleaning pipeline and measure actual impact of removing low-quality data on both accuracy and training duration; compare to simulated results to validate MSR mechanism
