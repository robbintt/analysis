# Enhancing Visual Representation with Textual Semantics: Textual Semantics-Powered Prototypes for Heterogeneous Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.13543
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13543
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FedTSP outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods by up to 3.26% in accuracy across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet under various non-IID scenarios.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of data heterogeneity in federated learning by introducing FedTSP, a novel approach that leverages textual semantics to construct semantically enriched prototypes. The method uses a large language model (LLM) to generate fine-grained textual descriptions for each class, which are processed by a pretrained language model (PLM) on the server to form textual prototypes. To bridge the modality gap between client image models and PLM prototypes, trainable prompts are introduced. The approach demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving up to 3.26% higher accuracy across multiple image classification benchmarks under non-IID data distributions.

## Method Summary
FedTSP operates in a federated learning framework where the server generates semantic prototypes using textual descriptions from an LLM, which are then processed by a PLM. The server shares these prototypes with clients, who use them to update their local models. To address the modality gap between visual and textual representations, trainable prompts are introduced that allow prototypes to better adapt to client-specific tasks. The method is evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet under various non-IID scenarios, demonstrating improved accuracy and faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

## Key Results
- FedTSP achieves up to 3.26% higher accuracy than existing federated learning methods across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets
- The method demonstrates superior robustness to data heterogeneity, maintaining performance across various non-IID scenarios
- FedTSP shows faster convergence compared to baseline approaches, reducing the number of communication rounds needed to reach optimal accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by enriching visual prototypes with semantic information from textual descriptions, creating a more informative representation that helps bridge the gap between heterogeneous client data distributions. The LLM generates detailed textual descriptions for each class, capturing semantic nuances that may be missing from visual data alone. The PLM processes these descriptions into fixed-dimensional prototypes that can be shared across the federated network. Trainable prompts allow these textual prototypes to be adapted to the specific visual representations learned by client models, effectively translating between modalities and enabling more effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous clients.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Federated Learning Fundamentals**: Understanding how distributed training works across heterogeneous clients with non-IID data
   - Why needed: The entire method operates within a federated learning framework and builds upon its challenges
   - Quick check: Can explain the difference between centralized and federated learning approaches

2. **Prototype-based Classification**: Knowledge of how class prototypes are used in metric learning and few-shot learning
   - Why needed: FedTSP relies on prototype-based classification as its core mechanism
   - Quick check: Can describe how prototypes represent class distributions in embedding space

3. **Multimodal Representation Learning**: Understanding how to bridge representations from different modalities (text and images)
   - Why needed: The method connects textual and visual representations through trainable prompts
   - Quick check: Can explain modality gap and methods for cross-modal alignment

4. **Large Language Models and Pretrained Language Models**: Familiarity with LLM capabilities and PLM architectures
   - Why needed: LLMs generate textual descriptions while PLMs process them into prototypes
   - Quick check: Can describe how LLMs differ from PLMs in their typical applications

5. **Non-IID Data Distributions**: Understanding the challenges posed by heterogeneous data across clients
   - Why needed: FedTSP specifically targets performance degradation caused by non-IID data
   - Quick check: Can explain why standard federated learning struggles with non-IID data

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Client models -> Trainable prompts -> Textual prototypes (server) -> LLM (server) -> PLM (server)

**Critical Path**: Client local training → Prototype update → Prompt optimization → Prototype generation → Prototype distribution

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses external LLM and PLM services for semantic enrichment vs. computational overhead and dependency on external models; introduces trainable prompts to bridge modality gap vs. increased model complexity

**Failure Signatures**: Poor textual description quality from LLM leads to ineffective prototypes; inadequate prompt training causes persistent modality gap; server-side PLM processing becomes bottleneck in large-scale deployments

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison of FedTSP vs. FedAvg on CIFAR-10 under moderate non-IID data split
2. Ablation study isolating the contribution of trainable prompts by comparing with fixed prompts
3. Sensitivity analysis of LLM description quality by varying description granularity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit questions include: How does FedTSP scale to larger datasets and more complex vision tasks? What is the impact of different LLM and PLM choices on final performance? How can the computational overhead of processing textual prototypes be minimized in resource-constrained environments?

## Limitations

- Relies on external LLM and PLM models whose performance and accessibility may vary across different deployment scenarios
- Effectiveness is contingent on the quality of textual descriptions generated by the LLM, which could introduce variability in prototype quality
- Computational overhead introduced by processing textual prototypes and training prompts may limit scalability to larger models or datasets

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core methodology of using textual semantics to create enriched prototypes is well-defined and the reported accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods are substantial and consistent across multiple datasets and non-IID scenarios.

**Medium confidence**: The claims about faster convergence and superior robustness to data heterogeneity are supported by the experiments but would benefit from additional ablation studies isolating the contribution of each component (LLM descriptions, PLM processing, trainable prompts).

**Medium confidence**: The scalability and practical deployment considerations are discussed but not thoroughly evaluated, particularly regarding computational costs and latency in real-world federated learning environments.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of LLM-generated descriptions, PLM-based prototype formation, and trainable prompts to overall performance improvements.

2. Evaluate the method on more complex vision tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection or semantic segmentation, to assess generalizability.

3. Perform a detailed computational analysis comparing the overhead of FedTSP against baseline methods, including server-side processing time and communication costs in federated settings.
