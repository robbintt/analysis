# Contextual ASR Error Handling with LLMs Augmentation for Goal-Oriented Conversational AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.06129
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06129
- Reference count: 11
- Improved recall and F1 by 34% and 16% respectively while maintaining precision

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a context augmentation method for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in goal-oriented conversational AI systems. The approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate task variations and dialogue states, which are then used to rank n-best ASR hypotheses through lexical, semantic, and phonetic similarity measures. Evaluated in cooking and home improvement domains, the method demonstrates significant improvements in recall and F1 metrics while maintaining precision and false positive rates.

## Method Summary
The proposed method generates LLM-created task variations and dialogue states to augment ASR hypotheses, then ranks these hypotheses using a combination of lexical, semantic, and phonetic similarity measures. The system evaluates n-best hypotheses against both task variations and dialogue states to identify the most contextually appropriate interpretation. The method was evaluated across cooking and home improvement domains, demonstrating improved ASR error handling while maintaining precision and avoiding false positive impacts on user experience.

## Key Results
- Recall improved by 34% and F1 by 16% compared to baseline
- Maintained precision and false positive rate (FPR)
- User ratings improved by 0.8-1 point when corrections worked properly
- No decrease in user experience due to false positives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages LLMs to generate diverse task variations and dialogue states that capture the contextual intent of user utterances. By ranking n-best ASR hypotheses against these generated contexts using multiple similarity measures (lexical, semantic, and phonetic), the system can identify the most appropriate interpretation even when the original ASR output contains errors. This multi-faceted approach compensates for different types of ASR errors by considering various aspects of similarity.

## Foundational Learning
**Task variations generation**: Creating diverse representations of intended tasks from dialogue context
- Why needed: ASR errors often stem from homonyms or similar-sounding words that have different task implications
- Quick check: Verify generated variations cover semantic space of intended task

**Dialogue state tracking**: Maintaining and extracting structured representations of conversation progress
- Why needed: Context provides crucial information for disambiguating ASR errors
- Quick check: Ensure dialogue states capture relevant entities and constraints

**Multi-similarity ranking**: Combining lexical, semantic, and phonetic similarity measures
- Why needed: Different error types require different similarity approaches for effective correction
- Quick check: Validate each similarity measure contributes positively to ranking accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: ASR output -> LLM task variation generation -> Dialogue state extraction -> Similarity calculation -> Hypothesis ranking -> Final selection

**Critical path**: LLM inference for task variations and dialogue states represents the primary bottleneck, followed by similarity calculations across multiple hypotheses and contexts

**Design tradeoffs**: Balances accuracy improvements against computational cost of LLM inference and multiple similarity calculations; trades real-time latency for higher ASR accuracy

**Failure signatures**: Performance degrades when task variations miss the semantic space of the intended utterance or when dialogue states fail to capture relevant context; also sensitive to LLM hallucination

**3 first experiments**: 1) Measure individual contribution of each similarity type through ablation studies, 2) Test LLM prompt engineering variations for task generation quality, 3) Evaluate latency impact of the complete pipeline on real-time responsiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Human evaluation study had only 11 participants, limiting statistical power
- No baseline comparisons with other ASR error correction methods
- Method relies on availability of dialogue states and task variations, limiting domain portability

## Confidence
- LLM augmentation improves ASR error correction: High confidence
- Context ranking using lexical, semantic, and phonetic similarities is effective: Medium confidence
- No false positive impact on user experience: Medium confidence
- Domain portability to cooking and home improvement: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale human evaluation (minimum 30-50 participants) with randomized control conditions comparing the proposed method against standard n-best re-ranking and other ASR error correction baselines to establish statistical significance of the reported improvements.

2. Implement latency and computational cost measurements for the complete pipeline, including LLM inference time for generating task variations and dialogue states, to assess real-time feasibility in production conversational AI systems.

3. Perform ablation studies systematically disabling each similarity component (lexical, semantic, phonetic) and each context type (task variations, dialogue states) to quantify their individual contributions and identify the most critical elements for performance gains.
