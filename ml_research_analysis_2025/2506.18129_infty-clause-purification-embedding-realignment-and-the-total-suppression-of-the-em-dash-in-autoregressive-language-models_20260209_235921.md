- Primary result: Recursive semantic decay halted and topic coherence preserved through clause purification and embedding realignment

## Executive Summary
The em dash token causes semantic drift and clause boundary hallucination in autoregressive language models by entangling embeddings and shifting latent representations. The authors introduce a clause purification operator ϕ∞ that recursively removes the em dash from text and an embedding realignment technique that suppresses the token's influence in the model's parameters. This dual approach halts recursive semantic decay and preserves topic coherence without retraining. Experiments show improved generation consistency and better topic maintenance, demonstrating a general method for mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a dual-approach framework for addressing em dash-induced semantic drift in autoregressive language models. The clause purification operator ϕ∞ recursively removes em dashes from input text, while an embedding realignment technique modifies model parameters to suppress the token's influence. The approach leverages fixed-point convergence properties and symbolic identity concepts to create a self-referential semantic invariant. The method operates without requiring model retraining, making it computationally efficient for deployment on existing foundation models.

## Key Results
- Recursive semantic decay halted through clause purification and embedding realignment
- Improved generation consistency and topic maintenance demonstrated in experiments
- General method established for mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The em dash token entangles embeddings and shifts latent representations, causing semantic drift and clause boundary hallucination in autoregressive language models. The clause purification operator ϕ∞ removes these tokens recursively, breaking the chain of semantic corruption. The embedding realignment technique then adjusts model parameters to suppress the em dash's influence, preventing future drift. This combination creates a self-referential semantic invariant that maintains topic coherence through fixed-point convergence properties.

## Foundational Learning
- Symbolic identity: Understanding how tokens map to semantic meaning
  - Why needed: Essential for identifying how em dashes corrupt semantic representations
  - Quick check: Verify token embedding spaces maintain semantic relationships

- Fixed-point convergence: Mathematical properties of recursive operations reaching stable states
  - Why needed: Guarantees clause purification reaches completion without infinite recursion
  - Quick check: Monitor purification operator for convergence behavior

- Autoregressive generation dynamics: How models predict next tokens based on previous context
  - Why needed: Understanding where and how semantic drift propagates through generation
  - Quick check: Track attention patterns during em dash-influenced generation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Text -> Clause Purification (ϕ∞) -> Embedding Realignment -> Modified Model Parameters -> Stable Generation

**Critical Path:**
The most critical sequence is Input Text → Clause Purification → Modified Text → Embedding Realignment → Updated Model Parameters. Any failure in purification will propagate through realignment.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The approach trades computational overhead during inference (for realignment) against the benefit of avoiding full model retraining. The recursive purification adds latency but ensures complete em dash removal.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Incomplete purification: Residual em dashes causing continued semantic drift
- Misaligned embeddings: Model generating incoherent outputs despite purification
- Convergence failure: Purification operator not reaching fixed point

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test purification operator on synthetic text with known em dash distributions
2. Measure generation consistency before and after embedding realignment
3. Evaluate topic maintenance across multiple generation runs with em dash suppression

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Symbolic identity and fixed-point convergence assumptions may not generalize across all autoregressive architectures
- Tokenization boundaries may fail with noisy or non-standard text inputs
- Computational overhead during inference may impact real-time applications

## Confidence
- **High**: The theoretical framework linking symbolic identity to fixed-point convergence is well-established
- **Medium**: Empirical results showing improved generation consistency and topic maintenance
- **Medium**: The dual approach of clause purification and embedding realignment appears technically sound
- **Low**: Generalization claims to other token-level vulnerabilities remain speculative

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework's performance on diverse autoregressive architectures beyond the initial test model, including both decoder-only and encoder-decoder variants
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of clause purification versus embedding realignment to overall performance gains
3. Test the approach against adversarial inputs containing intentionally obfuscated or non-standard em dash representations to assess robustness boundaries
