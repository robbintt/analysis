# Neural network initialization with nonlinear characteristics and information on spectral bias

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.02244
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02244
- Reference count: 0
- This paper proposes a neural network initialization method that leverages spectral bias information to improve training performance without backpropagation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel neural network initialization method that incorporates spectral bias information to enhance training performance. The approach modifies the SWIM algorithm by introducing layer-dependent hyperparameters that control activation function nonlinearity. Specifically, it allocates low-frequency components to early hidden layers and high-frequency components to later layers, following the natural spectral bias of neural networks. The method demonstrates improved performance on both regression and classification tasks compared to standard initialization approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed method modifies the SWIM (Sampling Where It Matters) algorithm by introducing layer-dependent scale factors that control the nonlinearity of activation functions. These scale factors are designed to capture low-frequency components in early hidden layers and high-frequency components in later layers, reflecting the natural spectral bias of neural networks. The initialization process involves adjusting these scale factors based on the layer's position in the network, with earlier layers receiving lower frequency components and later layers receiving higher frequency components. This ordered initialization approach aims to provide a more favorable starting point for training by aligning with the network's inherent spectral properties.

## Key Results
- The ordered initialization method outperforms both the original SWIM algorithm and a reversed-order variant on regression and classification tasks
- Performance improvements are particularly pronounced when using a large number of nodes in hidden layers
- The approach achieves lower root mean square error in regression tasks and reduced error rates in classification
- The results highlight the importance of incorporating spectral properties into parameter initialization strategies for enhanced neural network training efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging spectral bias, which is the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency functions first before gradually capturing high-frequency details. By initializing early layers with low-frequency components and later layers with high-frequency components, the network starts closer to a favorable solution space. This initialization strategy reduces the need for extensive training to discover these spectral patterns, as the network begins with parameters already aligned with its natural learning progression. The layer-dependent scale factors act as a guide, directing each layer to focus on the frequency range it's best suited to capture based on its position in the network hierarchy.

## Foundational Learning
**Spectral bias** - The tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency functions before high-frequency ones. Why needed: Understanding this property is crucial for designing initialization schemes that align with natural learning progression. Quick check: Verify that neural networks indeed learn smooth, low-frequency functions first by observing training dynamics.

**Frequency decomposition in neural networks** - The concept that different layers in a network can capture different frequency components of the input function. Why needed: This principle underlies the layer-dependent initialization strategy. Quick check: Analyze the learned weights to confirm that earlier layers capture lower frequencies than later layers.

**Activation function nonlinearity** - The degree to which activation functions introduce nonlinear transformations. Why needed: Controlling nonlinearity through scale factors is central to the proposed initialization method. Quick check: Experiment with different activation functions to observe how scale factors affect their effective nonlinearity.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Input -> Layer-wise scale factors -> Activation functions -> Output
**Critical path**: The initialization process must correctly assign scale factors to each layer based on its position, then apply these factors to control activation function nonlinearity before training begins.
**Design tradeoffs**: 
1. Frequency allocation vs. network depth: Deeper networks may require more nuanced frequency distribution
2. Scale factor magnitude vs. training stability: Larger scale factors may provide better initialization but risk instability
3. Computational overhead vs. performance gain: The additional hyperparameter tuning introduces overhead that must be justified by performance improvements
**Failure signatures**: 
1. Reversed order initialization performs worse, indicating importance of correct frequency allocation
2. Poor performance with small hidden layers suggests method works best with sufficient capacity
3. Absence of improvement over standard methods would indicate spectral bias information is not being effectively utilized
**First experiments**:
1. Test on one-dimensional regression with varying numbers of hidden nodes to verify performance scaling
2. Apply to MNIST classification to confirm generalization to image data
3. Compare against reversed-order initialization to validate importance of correct frequency allocation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation is limited to one-dimensional regression and MNIST classification tasks, leaving unclear how the approach generalizes to higher-dimensional problems
- The study does not compare against standard initialization schemes like He or Glorot initialization, making it difficult to assess practical significance
- The paper lacks theoretical analysis connecting the scale factors to spectral properties, relying primarily on empirical observations

## Confidence
High: Performance improvements on controlled experiments
Medium: Generalization to different architectures and tasks
Low: Theoretical foundation and comparison to standard methods

## Next Checks
1. Test the initialization method on image classification tasks beyond MNIST (e.g., CIFAR-10/100) to assess generalization to higher-dimensional data
2. Compare performance against standard initialization schemes (He, Glorot) across different activation functions and network depths
3. Analyze the computational overhead and training speed impact of the proposed initialization method relative to standard approaches
