- Models incorporating intra-event role interactions improve EAE performance by 3.4% F1 on the RAMS dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper explores prompt-based approaches for event argument extraction (EAE), proposing three model variants with increasing levels of prompt information: single-role, multiple-roles, and multiple-events. The study systematically investigates how different types of information in prompts affect EAE performance. Experiments on the RAMS dataset with BERT, BART, and Roberta models demonstrate that considering intra-event role interactions significantly improves performance (3.4% F1), while inter-event information provides smaller benefits. The authors also find that current models cannot fully utilize enriched prompts, showing a 6.0% F1 gap compared to gold-augmented prompts, and demonstrate that Dice loss regularization further improves all prompt-based EAE models.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes three prompt-based EAE models with varying information density. The single-role prompt (R-Prompt) uses a template like "Q(r) [SEP] D" to extract one role at a time. The multiple-roles prompt (mRole-Prompt) incorporates known arguments of other roles within the same event as contextual clues, using a template like "T(r1, r2...) [SEP] D". The multiple-events prompt (mEvent-Prompt) further includes information from other events. All models use a pre-trained language model (BERT, BART, or RoBERTa) to encode the prompt-document pair and predict argument spans. A Dice loss regularization term is introduced to optimize for region overlap between predicted and gold spans, improving model robustness.

## Key Results
- Considering intra-event role interactions (mRole-Prompt) improves performance by 3.4% F1 over single-role prompts
- Inter-event information provides smaller benefits, with mEvent-Prompt slightly underperforming mRole-Prompt (-0.4% F1)
- Current models cannot fully utilize enriched prompts, showing a 6.0% F1 gap compared to gold-augmented prompts
- Dice loss regularization improves all prompt-based EAE models
- RoBERTa-large achieves the best performance among tested models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Incorporating intra-event role interactions into the prompt improves EAE performance by providing contextual clues.
- Mechanism: A template-based prompt structure (e.g., `T(r1, r2...)`) explicitly provides known arguments of other roles within the same event. This conditions the model to use these "clues" to better locate the target role argument, exploiting the semantic interdependence of roles (e.g., a "passenger" role informs the "transporter" role).
- Core assumption: Roles within a single event are semantically related, and the model's attention mechanism can successfully prioritize and integrate this side information to constrain the prediction space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...considering intra-event role interactions improves performance by 3.4% F1..."
  - [section] "Considering that roles within the same event are interrelated... we can leverage related roles of the target as clues..." (Section 3.2).
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence for this specific mechanism in provided neighbors. REGen (2502.16838) focuses on evaluation, not this architectural mechanism.
- Break condition: Performance gains will diminish or reverse if the provided "clue" arguments are noisy, incorrect, or if the event schema has roles that are largely independent.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A Dice loss regularization term improves model robustness by optimizing for region overlap rather than token-level accuracy.
- Mechanism: Standard cross-entropy loss treats each token independently, which can be problematic with sparse argument spans. Dice loss (Eq. 4) directly optimizes the F1-like overlap between the predicted span and the gold span, making the model less sensitive to class imbalance and minor boundary errors.
- Core assumption: The standard token-level loss function is sub-optimal for the span extraction task due to the dominance of non-argument tokens.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using dice loss regularization further improves all prompt-based EAE models."
  - [section] "...all prompt-based EAE models can benefit from this loss..." (Section 5, analysis of Table 1).
  - [corpus] No specific corpus evidence on Dice loss for EAE; this is a novel contribution of the paper.
- Break condition: This mechanism requires gradient-based training. It is inapplicable to frozen LLMs or in-context learning setups where model weights are not updated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Current prompt-based EAE models operate below their theoretical ceiling because they cannot fully comprehend enriched prompt information.
- Mechanism: The paper defines a "ceiling" by injecting gold arguments into the prompt. The persistent 6.0% F1 gap between this oracle (mR-Prompt ceiling) and the standard model indicates the model fails to effectively extract and integrate the additional signals provided in the prompt text.
- Core assumption: The model's limiting factor is not the information availability but its reasoning capacity or training objective's ability to utilize the provided context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...current models cannot fully utilize additional prompt information, with a ceiling performance gap of 6.0% F1..."
  - [section] "...the current model cannot fully comprehend the additional information in the prompt." (Section 5, discussing 'Prompt testing').
  - [corpus] 2504.07357 supports the difficulty LLMs face in reasoning without optimized prompts.
- Break condition: The "ceiling" concept breaks if the gold-augmented prompt evaluation setup is found to be leaky or unrepresentative of real-world inference constraints.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Event Argument Extraction (EAE)**
  - Why needed here: This is the core task. Unlike NER, EAE requires identifying an entity's *role* relative to a specific *event trigger*, making context and trigger information critical.
  - Quick check question: In the sentence "John was fired", is "John" a victim or an agent? (Answer: Depends on the event schema, but typically the "target/employee" relative to the "termination" event triggered by "fired").

- Concept: **Prompt-based Extraction**
  - Why needed here: The paper's method relies on formulating extraction as a question-answering task. Understanding how to construct effective templates (e.g., `Q(r)`) is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does a single-role prompt differ from a multiple-role prompt? (Answer: Single-role asks about one role at a time, while multiple-role includes information about other roles in the same template).

- Concept: **Ceiling Analysis**
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces a methodology to diagnose model limitations by establishing an upper bound. Understanding this helps interpret the "6.0% F1 gap" not as a metric, but as a diagnostic tool.
  - Quick check question: Why is comparing a model to its own "ceiling" (gold-augmented) performance more informative than comparing to a baseline? (Answer: It isolates the model's reasoning failure from its information retrieval failure).

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Document + Event Schema -> Prompt Constructor -> Encoder -> Span Predictor -> Predicted Argument
- Critical path: `Document + Event Schema` -> `Prompt Constructor` -> `Encoder` -> `Span Predictor` -> `Predicted Argument`. The Dice Loss influences the Encoder's weights during training.
- Design tradeoffs:
  1. **Prompt Density vs. Model Capacity**: Adding more information (clues for other roles) helps (mRole-Prompt > R-Prompt), but can overwhelm the model if not designed well (mEvent-Prompt < mRole-Prompt).
  2. **Loss Function**: Standard loss is simpler but less robust to imbalance. Dice loss improves performance but adds complexity.
  3. **Encoder Choice**: RoBERTa-large performs best among tested PLMs, but is heavier than BERT-base.
- Failure signatures:
  1. **Information Overload**: The mEvent-Prompt model's performance drops (-0.4% F1) compared to mRole-Prompt, indicating the model cannot handle excessive inter-event information.
  2. **Hallucination**: Noted in LLM experiments, where models generate plausible but incorrect arguments not found in the text.
  3. **High Ceiling Gap**: A large gap between standard and gold-augmented performance indicates the model is not using the provided clues.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce R-Prompt Baseline**: Implement the single-role prompt model on the RAMS dataset with BERT-base to verify the baseline performance (~42.5% F1).
  2. **Validate Intra-Event Clue Benefit**: Add known arguments of other roles to the prompt (mRole-Prompt) and measure the F1 improvement to confirm the +3.4% gain.
  3. **Test Loss Regularization**: Train the best-performing prompt model with and without Dice loss to quantify the improvement and verify the robustness claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can prompt designs be optimized to effectively exploit inter-event dependencies for event argument extraction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors observe that while the theoretical ceiling for multiple-events prompts is higher, the actual multiple-events prompt model performs worse than the multiple-roles model, indicating current prompts fail to utilize cross-event information.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that simply adding inter-event information degrades performance, suggesting the specific mechanism for integrating this data remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: A prompt architecture that leverages inter-event information to statistically outperform the multiple-roles baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can models be improved to better comprehend and utilize role arguments provided as clues in the prompt?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude that "the current model cannot fully comprehend the additional information in the prompt" based on the performance gap between standard models and the "Prompt testing" gold-augmented ceiling.
- Why unresolved: There is a persistent performance gap (approx. 6.0% F1) indicating models fail to fully leverage the enriched context provided to them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Architectural changes or training objectives that significantly narrow the performance gap between standard and gold-augmented prompt models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why do large language models (LLMs) like Llama-3 and GPT-4 fail to consistently benefit from gold-enriched prompts in this task?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors report that LLM performance "significantly diverges from what we predicted," noting that even the "ceiling" prompt performed worse than the standard multi-role prompt for Llama-3.
- Why unresolved: The interaction between LLM reasoning, hallucination issues, and enriched prompts in EAE is not yet understood.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of LLM error types or attention patterns explaining why additional gold context leads to performance degradation.

## Limitations

- Template format ambiguity: The paper does not specify exact natural language templates for T(·) and Tm(·), which are critical for reproducing the prompt construction.
- Loss function specification: Dice loss integration details are missing, making exact replication of the training procedure challenging.
- LLM experiment protocol: Preliminary LLM experiments used only 50 samples with insufficient detail on prompting strategy.
- Ceiling analysis assumptions: The "ceiling" performance assumes models can utilize gold-augmented prompts, which may not represent true upper bounds.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- The core finding that intra-event role interactions (mRole-Prompt) improve performance over single-role prompts (+3.4% F1) is well-supported by experimental data.
- The observation that current models have a significant performance gap (6.0% F1) compared to gold-augmented prompts indicates room for improvement.

**Medium Confidence**:
- The benefit of Dice loss regularization is supported by results, but exact integration details are unspecified.
- The negative impact of inter-event information is observed, but LLM sample size is small.

**Low Confidence**:
- Preliminary LLM results (Llama-3, GPT-4) are not robust due to limited sample size and lack of prompting detail.
- Claims about reasoning versus information retrieval failures are inferred from ceiling analysis assumptions.

## Next Checks

1. **Template Format Validation**: Implement and test multiple template formats for the multiple-roles prompt (e.g., different delimiters, question structures) to determine optimal design and confirm the reported +3.4% F1 gain is not format-dependent.

2. **Dice Loss Ablation Study**: Conduct controlled experiment training single-role prompt model with and without Dice loss, systematically varying loss weight (λ) to find optimal configuration and isolate regularization's contribution.

3. **Ceiling Analysis Stress Test**: Modify ceiling experiment by adding varying levels of noise to gold arguments (e.g., random spans, incorrect role assignments) and measure performance impact to determine if the 6.0% F1 gap reflects reasoning limitations or evaluation sensitivity.
