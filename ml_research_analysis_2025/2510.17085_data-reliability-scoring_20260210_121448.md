# Data Reliability Scoring

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.17085
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17085
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces Gram determinant score as a novel reliability measure that preserves ground-truth-based orderings without access to true labels

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of assessing data reliability without ground truth by leveraging auxiliary observations from unknown statistical experiments. The authors propose the Gram determinant score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical distribution of reported data and experiment outcomes. The score uniquely preserves reliability orderings across all linearly independent experiments and decreases monotonically as data deviates from truth. Experiments on synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data demonstrate the score's effectiveness in capturing data quality across diverse observation processes.

## Method Summary
The Gram determinant score computes det((PQ)⊺(PQ)) where P represents the unknown experiment and Q represents the misreport matrix. The method involves building an empirical Gram matrix from co-occurrence statistics of reported labels and observations, then computing its determinant. Two variants exist: plug-in (for categorical observations) and stratified-matching (for finite-sample guarantees). The score admits a geometric interpretation as measuring the volume of a parallelepiped spanned by observation distributions conditional on reported labels, with volume contracting under misreporting.

## Key Results
- The Gram determinant score preserves exact-match, Blackwell-dominant, and approximate Hamming orderings under specific conditions
- Score is uniquely experiment-agnostic, yielding the same dataset ranking regardless of the experiment used
- Decreases monotonically as reported data deviates from true data, verified on synthetic corruption models
- Shows reasonable correlation with known errors in real employment data experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Geometric Volume as Reliability Proxy
The Gram determinant score decreases as reported data deviates further from true data. The score computes det((PQ)⊺(PQ)), which equals the squared volume of a parallelepiped spanned by column vectors in PQ. When misreport matrix Q mixes true labels (column-stochastic transformation), it contracts this volume because each column becomes a convex combination of original columns. Maximum volume occurs when Q is identity (perfect reporting); volume shrinks toward zero as reports become uninformative mixtures. Core assumption: experiment P must have linearly independent columns (P ∈ P_indep) so det(P⊺P) > 0.

### Mechanism 2: Order Preservation Through Multiplicative Decomposition
The Gram determinant score preserves exact-match, Blackwell-dominant, and approximate Hamming orderings under specific conditions. The determinant factorizes: Γ(PQ) = det(Q⊺) det(P⊺P) det(Q) = det(P⊺P) det(Q)². This decouples experiment quality (det(P⊺P), fixed for a given P) from misreport quality (det(Q)²). Since det is sub-multiplicative under column-stochastic transformations, |det(T)| < 1 when T ≠ I is column-stochastic, ensuring that post-processing via Q′ = QT⊺ yields Γ(Q) > Γ(Q′). Core assumption: misreport matrices must be invertible and diagonally maximal (Q ∈ Q_reg) for Blackwell ordering.

### Mechanism 3: Experiment Agnosticism via Ranking Invariance
The Gram determinant score uniquely (up to scaling) yields the same reliability ranking across all linearly independent experiments. Because Γ(PQ) = det(P⊺P) · Γ(Q), and det(P⊺P) > 0 is fixed for any P ∈ P_indep, the ordering Γ(Q) ≥ Γ(Q′) is equivalent to Γ(PQ) ≥ Γ(PQ′) for all such P. The uniqueness proof shows any continuous experiment-agnostic score satisfying S(tQ) = c(t)S(Q) must be α det(Q⊺Q)^β. Core assumption: score must be continuous on invertible matrices and scale homogeneously.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Gram Matrix and Determinant**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire scoring mechanism rests on computing det(Ĝ) where Ĝ = (PQ)⊺(PQ). Understanding that Gram determinants measure the volume of a parallelepiped is essential for the geometric intuition.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a 2×2 matrix A with columns [1,0]⊺ and [0.5, 0.866]⊺, compute det(A⊺A). What does this represent geometrically?

- **Concept: Column-Stochastic Matrices and Convex Combinations**
  - **Why needed here:** The misreport matrix Q ̂_{x|x} is column-stochastic, meaning each column is a probability distribution. This ensures that corrupting reports (mixing labels) contracts volume, making the score decrease.
  - **Quick check question:** If T is a 2×2 column-stochastic matrix with T(1,1) = 0.7, T(2,1) = 0.3, T(1,2) = 0.4, T(2,2) = 0.6, verify |det(T)| < 1. Why does this guarantee score decrease?

- **Concept: Partial Orderings and Their Refinement**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper defines three orderings (exact match, Blackwell dominant, Hamming/dist) with refinement relationships. Understanding these is critical for interpreting which reliability guarantees apply under which conditions.
  - **Quick check question:** If dataset ˆx Blackwell-dominates ˆx′, does it necessarily have lower Hamming distance to truth? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Reported labels → Gram matrix estimator → Determinant computation → Reliability score
- **Critical path:** 1) Verify minimum occurrence (≥2 per label), 2) Build empirical Gram matrix from observation co-occurrence statistics, 3) Compute determinant (use log-det for numerical stability), 4) Compare scores across datasets
- **Design tradeoffs:** Plug-in vs. stratified-matching (simpler vs. finite-sample guarantees), kernel choice (delta for discrete vs. Gaussian RBF for continuous), discretization vs. kernelization for quasi-continuous observations
- **Failure signatures:** Near-zero determinant suggests rank-deficient experiment or uninformative reports; score increases with obvious corruption may indicate label imbalance or dependent experiment columns; stratified-matching returns 0 indicates insufficient sample size or class imbalance
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Synthetic data sanity check with truthful vs. corrupted reports, 2) CIFAR-10 embedding kernel bandwidth sensitivity analysis, 3) Validate impossibility condition by constructing P with linearly dependent columns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How can scalable estimators for the Gram determinant score be developed for high-dimensional or continuous label domains using dimensionality-reduction techniques or learned encoders?
- **Question:** Can formal reliability ordering guarantees be established for other singular-value-based criteria, such as the Top-k volume or maximal correlation?
- **Question:** Does the property of "experiment agnosticism" provide a measurable advantage for the Gram determinant score over alternative scores (like Φ-mutual information) in finite-sample regimes?

## Limitations
- Score cannot distinguish between truthful data and permuted labels (theoretical impossibility)
- Requires experiment matrix P to have linearly independent columns for meaningful discrimination
- Practical performance on real-world data limited by synthetic corruption assumptions and heuristic quantization of continuous variables

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Geometric mechanism (volume contraction under column-stochastic transformations) and uniqueness proof for experiment-agnostic scores
- **Medium Confidence:** Preservation of Blackwell and Hamming orderings (conditional on specific matrix properties)
- **Low Confidence:** Practical performance on real-world data (synthetic corruption and heuristic discretization limit generalizability)

## Next Checks

1. **Rank Deficiency Stress Test:** Systematically construct experiments P with varying degrees of linear dependence (controlled by correlation parameter ρ between columns). Measure how quickly score discrimination degrades as ρ increases from 0 to 1.

2. **Permutation Robustness Check:** On CIFAR-10, generate multiple datasets with different label permutations (Q = random permutation matrix). Verify that all permutations receive identical scores as predicted by Proposition 3.1, and test whether combining with auxiliary metadata could break this symmetry.

3. **Continuous Observation Sensitivity:** For the CIFAR-10 embedding experiment, vary the Gaussian kernel bandwidth σ across orders of magnitude. Quantify how ranking stability changes and identify the threshold where the score becomes dominated by noise rather than meaningful distributional differences.
