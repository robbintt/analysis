# RULERS: Locked Rubrics and Evidence-Anchored Scoring for Robust LLM Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08654
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08654
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: RULERS achieves significantly higher human agreement (e.g., QWK scores up to 0.73 on ASAP 2.0) compared to baselines while maintaining stability under adversarial rubric perturbations

## Executive Summary
RULERS is a framework designed to address three critical failure modes in LLM-based scoring: rubric instability, unverifiable reasoning, and scale misalignment. By compiling natural language rubrics into locked, versioned specifications, enforcing evidence-anchored inference, and applying Wasserstein-based post-hoc calibration, RULERS produces more consistent, auditable, and calibrated evaluations without model fine-tuning. The framework demonstrates substantial improvements in human agreement metrics across essay and summarization tasks while maintaining stability under rubric perturbations.

## Method Summary
RULERS operates through a three-phase frozen-model pipeline: (1) compilation converts rubrics into locked JSON bundles with taxonomies, checklists, and evidence rules; (2) structured decoding with evidence anchoring extracts verbatim quotes and mechanically caps scores when insufficient evidence exists; (3) Wasserstein-based quantile matching calibrates model outputs to human score distributions. The framework is evaluated on three benchmarks (ASAP 2.0, SummHF, DREsS) using Quadratic Weighted Kappa as the primary metric, with experiments comparing against baselines like DHS, MTS, and AutoScore.

## Key Results
- Achieves QWK scores up to 0.73 on ASAP 2.0, significantly exceeding baseline performances
- Maintains stability under adversarial rubric perturbations (reversed/paraphrased variants) with minimal performance variance
- Enables smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to match or exceed larger models when using RULERS framework
- Post-hoc calibration proves critical, with QWK drops of up to 0.46 when removed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Rubric Compilation into Immutable Specifications
Converting natural language rubrics into versioned, hashed JSON bundles eliminates stochastic interpretation drift across inference runs. The compilation function transforms raw rubric R into a locked bundle B with fixed components: taxonomy T with K distinct dimensions, operational checklist C with granular binary/ternary decision items, and deterministic evidence rules. This ensures evaluation criteria remain static and agnostic to the model's internal state.

### Mechanism 2: Evidence-Anchored Extraction with Score Capping
Forcing models to extract verbatim quotes and mechanically capping scores when evidence is insufficient prevents hallucinated justifications. Schema-constrained decoding requires structured outputs with checklist decisions, extractive quotes anchored to sentence IDs, and boundary justifications. An evidence gate enforces that if valid evidence count is less than m, the score is mechanically capped, making high scores mathematically impossible without verified grounding.

### Mechanism 3: Wasserstein-Based Distribution Calibration
Post-hoc quantile matching aligns frozen model outputs to human score distributions without parameter updates. Extract feature vector with trait scores and uncertainty metrics, then learn non-parametric optimal transport map g(z) = F⁻¹_human(F_model(z)), minimizing Wasserstein distance between distributions. This corrects systematic biases while preserving ranking order.

## Foundational Learning

- **LLM-as-a-Judge Failure Modes**
  - Why needed here: RULERS explicitly targets three recurrent failures (instability, unverifiable reasoning, scale misalignment); understanding these is prerequisite to grasping why each phase exists.
  - Quick check question: Can you name two specific causes of rubric instability mentioned in the paper?

- **Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)**
  - Why needed here: QWK is the primary evaluation metric throughout; it measures inter-rater agreement on ordinal scales while correcting for chance.
  - Quick check question: Why is QWK preferred over simple accuracy for essay scoring tasks?

- **Optimal Transport / Wasserstein Distance**
  - Why needed here: Phase III uses quantile matching via cumulative distribution functions to transport model scores to human distributions.
  - Quick check question: What does F⁻¹_human(F_model(z)) compute in the calibration formula?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Phase I (Compiler): Raw rubric R -> compilation function π -> locked bundle B (JSON with taxonomy, checklist, evidence rules) -> hash h(B)
  Phase II (Executor): Input x + locked bundle B -> constrained decoding Ω -> structured object o (decisions, quotes, justifications) -> verification V(q,u) -> evidence gate -> raw scores s
  Phase III (Calibrator): Raw scores s + uncertainty -> ridge regression features -> WGR layer g(·) -> final calibrated scores

- Critical path: Phase I compilation is one-time per rubric; Phase II runs per evaluation instance; Phase III requires 200+ labeled samples for calibration fitting before deployment.

- Design tradeoffs:
  Extractive evidence improves auditability but may miss holistic quality aspects; deterministic string verification prevents hallucinations but is brittle to minor formatting variations; post-hoc calibration requires labeled data but preserves frozen model parameters.

- Failure signatures:
  Low evidence count triggering caps: Model outputs valid reasoning but quotes fail string match -> scores artificially depressed; Distribution collapse after calibration: If calibration data is non-representative, quantile mapping produces distorted final scores; Checklist mismatch: If locked taxonomy doesn't align with actual human scoring practice, high stability won't translate to high agreement.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. End-to-end validation: Run RULERS on ASAP 2.0 test split with GPT-4o-mini; compare QWK against Table 3 baseline (target: ~0.73)
  2. Ablation by phase: Disable WGR calibration and verify QWK drop matches Table 4 (~0.26 on ASAP 2.0)
  3. Rubric perturbation stress test: Apply reversed/paraphrased rubric variants and confirm performance variance is minimal compared to baselines (Figure 3 pattern)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evidence verification via strict string matching is brittle to formatting differences and tokenization artifacts
- Calibration requires labeled development data and may not transfer across substantially different rubrics or scales
- If the original rubric is underspecified or internally inconsistent, locking preserves those flaws rather than correcting them

## Confidence

- **High**: Phase II evidence-anchored inference with checklist-based scoring and deterministic gates produces consistent outputs across rubric perturbations
- **Medium**: End-to-end QWK gains over baselines are substantial and statistically stable
- **Low**: Claims of rubric-agnostic generalization and resilience to rubric underspecification are asserted but not empirically tested

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization stress test**: Apply RULERS to a rubric with free-form holistic criteria (e.g., narrative creativity) and measure QWK drop vs. checklist-heavy domains

2. **Calibration sensitivity**: Retrain WGR with varying calibration set sizes (e.g., 50, 100, 150 samples) and quantify QWK variance on a held-out test set

3. **Evidence matching robustness**: Introduce controlled formatting noise (e.g., tokenization artifacts, punctuation variations) in input texts and track the degradation in evidence verification pass rate
