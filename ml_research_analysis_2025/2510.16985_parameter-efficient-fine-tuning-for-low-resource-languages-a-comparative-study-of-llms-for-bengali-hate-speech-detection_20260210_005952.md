# Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Low-Resource Languages: A Comparative Study of LLMs for Bengali Hate Speech Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16985
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16985
- Reference count: 38
- Llama-3.2-3B achieved 92.23% F1-score on Bengali hate speech detection using <1% trainable parameters

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the growing problem of hate speech on Bengali social media platforms, which disproportionately affects women and adolescents, by introducing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as a resource-effective solution for low-resource languages. The authors apply LoRA and QLoRA adapters to fine-tune three open-source instruction-tuned LLMs—Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B—on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated Bengali comments, training fewer than 1% of parameters on a single consumer-grade GPU. Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at 88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%, demonstrating that PEFT enables strong performance with minimal computational overhead and offers a scalable, replicable approach for Bengali and similar low-resource languages.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tuned three open-source LLMs using LoRA and QLoRA on the BD-SHS dataset containing 50,281 Bengali social media comments. All models were trained with 4-bit quantization and LoRA adapters (rank=16, alpha=16) on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, with less than 1% of parameters being trainable. The models were evaluated on a held-out test set using weighted F1-score as the primary metric, with batch sizes adjusted per model size (Gemma-3-4B: 32, Llama-3.2-3B: 8, Mistral-7B: 4).

## Key Results
- Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23% with 12.8GB GPU memory usage
- Mistral-7B achieved 88.94% F1 with 14.2GB memory usage
- Gemma-3-4B achieved 80.25% F1 with 12.5GB memory usage
- All models used fewer than 1% trainable parameters with 4-bit quantization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Low-Rank Adaptation Concentrates Task-Specific Learning
- Claim: LoRA achieves competitive performance by learning low-rank delta matrices that modify frozen pretrained weights, enabling task adaptation with <1% trainable parameters.
- Mechanism: LoRA injects trainable low-rank decomposition matrices (rank=16, α=16 in this study) into transformer layers. Only these adapter matrices are updated during backpropagation while base weights remain frozen.
- Core assumption: Task-specific knowledge for Bengali hate speech detection can be compressed into low-rank matrices; pretrained multilingual representations contain sufficient linguistic foundations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters"; [section III-B]: "LoRA freezes the pretrained model weights and injects low-rank adapter matrices into each transformer layer where only these adapters are trained"; [corpus]: Sidibomma et al. (2025) applied LoRA to Hindi/Nepali hate speech with similar efficiency gains.

### Mechanism 2: Architecture-Tokenizer Alignment Affects Cross-Lingual Transfer
- Claim: Performance differences between models appear influenced by the interaction between tokenizer design, architectural features, and target language characteristics.
- Mechanism: Llama-3.2-3B's multilingual subword tokenizer, combined with RoPE positional embeddings and SwiGLU activations, may better handle Bengali's complex morphology and code-mixing patterns.
- Core assumption: Tokenizer vocabulary coverage and architectural inductive biases significantly impact PEFT effectiveness on low-resource languages.
- Evidence anchors: [section IV-B]: "What matters more is how well the model's architecture, tokenizer, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning work together"; [section IV-B]: Llama's performance "may partly reflect architectural features such as RoPE positional embeddings, SwiGLU activations, RMSNorm normalization, and a multilingual subword tokenizer".

### Mechanism 3: 4-bit Quantization with Gradient Backpropagation Preserves Adaptation Capacity
- Claim: QLoRA enables large model fine-tuning on consumer hardware by quantizing base weights to 4-bit precision while maintaining gradient flow through to LoRA adapters.
- Mechanism: Base model weights are quantized to 4-bit (reducing memory by ~65-75%), but gradients backpropagate through the quantized model into trainable LoRA adapters.
- Core assumption: Quantization-induced precision loss is tolerable for adapter learning; critical task knowledge can be captured in full-precision adapters.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU"; [section III-B-2]: "QLoRA further quantizes the base model to 4-bit precision and backpropagates through it into the frozen model into LoRA adapters"; [table VII]: Memory reduction of 65-75% across models with trainable fractions of 0.58-0.75%.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - Why needed here: Core technique enabling <1% parameter training. Understanding rank/α hyperparameters is essential for reproduction and tuning.
  - Quick check question: If you increase LoRA rank from 16 to 64, what happens to trainable parameter count and potential overfitting risk on a 50K sample dataset?

- Concept: **Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning (QLoRA)**
  - Why needed here: Enables 7B parameter models on 24GB GPUs. Understanding 4-bit quantization tradeoffs is critical for deployment decisions.
  - Quick check question: Why does QLoRA backpropagate gradients through quantized weights into adapters rather than fine-tuning the quantized weights directly?

- Concept: **Cross-Lingual Transfer in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: Explains why models without explicit Bengali pretraining can achieve 92% F1. Critical for selecting base models for other low-resource languages.
  - Quick check question: What features should you investigate in a base model's tokenizer and training corpus before assuming it will transfer to a new low-resource language?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BD-SHS Dataset (50,281 samples) -> Unsloth Framework -> Base Models: Gemma-3-4B | Llama-3.2-3B | Mistral-7B -> Trained Adapter Weights (<1% params) -> Binary Classification Output

- Critical path:
  1. Dataset preparation: Verify BD-SHS loading, confirm 80/10/10 splits, validate prompt template formatting
  2. Model initialization: Load in 4-bit quantization, inject LoRA adapters, confirm trainable parameter count (<1%)
  3. Training: Monitor training/validation loss curves for convergence without overfitting (paper: train loss 0.145, val loss 0.162)
  4. Evaluation: Compute weighted F1-score on test split, generate confusion matrices for error analysis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Model size vs. memory**: Mistral-7B (88.94% F1, 14.2GB) vs. Llama-3.2-3B (92.23% F1, 12.8GB) — smaller model achieved better performance
  - **Batch size vs. gradient accumulation**: Larger models required smaller batches (Mistral: 4, Llama: 8) with gradient accumulation to maintain effective batch size
  - **LoRA rank vs. capacity**: Rank=16 selected; lower ranks may underfit complex Bengali morphology, higher ranks increase overfitting risk

- Failure signatures:
  - **Overfitting**: Large divergence between training and validation loss curves (paper shows stable convergence: 0.145 vs. 0.162)
  - **Tokenizer mismatch**: High UNK token rates or excessive subword fragmentation in Bengali text
  - **Memory overflow**: OOM errors when batch size exceeds VRAM; mitigate with gradient accumulation
  - **Poor generalization**: High test error on code-mixed (Banglish) samples not well-represented in training

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline reproduction**: Fine-tune Llama-3.2-3B with exact hyperparameters (rank=16, α=16, lr=2e-4, 3 epochs) on BD-SHS to verify reported 92.23% F1.
  2. **LoRA rank ablation**: Compare rank ∈ {8, 16, 32, 64} to identify capacity requirements for Bengali hate speech; expect diminishing returns beyond optimal rank.
  3. **Cross-domain validation**: Evaluate best model on held-out domains (e.g., political vs. sports comments) or external Bengali hate speech datasets to assess generalization beyond BD-SHS distribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does PEFT-based Bengali hate speech detection perform across dialectal variations such as Chittagonian, Sylheti, or Noakhali Bengali?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "Future research should address more nuanced challenges such as dialectal variation... to better reflect real-world moderation scenarios."
- Why unresolved: The BD-SHS dataset does not stratify by dialect, and all experiments assumed standard Bengali without dialect-specific evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of PEFT-adapted models on dialect-stratified test sets with comparative F1-scores across Bengali dialects.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the demonstrated PEFT approach generalize to non-social media domains such as news comment sections, online forums, or private messaging platforms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly identifies "non-social media domains" as a direction for future research.
- Why unresolved: BD-SHS exclusively contains data from Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok; no cross-domain validation was performed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-domain experiments showing PEFT model performance on hate speech detection in news websites, discussion forums, or messaging application data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust are PEFT-adapted models when confronted with explicit code-mixing between Bengali and English (Banglish) or Romanized Bengali text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion calls for investigating "robustness under explicit code-mixing conditions"; the introduction also identifies code-mixing as a key challenge.
- Why unresolved: While BD-SHS may contain some code-mixed samples, no controlled evaluation isolating code-mixing effects was conducted.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments with code-mixing intensity as an independent variable, reporting F1-score degradation patterns.

## Limitations
- The study's performance metrics are confined to a single dataset (BD-SHS) without cross-validation on alternative Bengali hate speech datasets or different domains.
- The paper does not report performance on out-of-domain samples or alternative Bengali hate speech datasets for cross-validation.
- The study employs fixed LoRA configurations (rank=16, α=16, learning rate=2×10⁻⁴) without systematic ablation studies or exploration of optimal hyperparameter settings.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- PEFT enables training on consumer GPUs with <1% trainable parameters (directly verifiable from memory usage tables and parameter counts)
- Llama-3.2-3B achieved 92.23% F1 on BD-SHS test set (reported metric with clear experimental procedure)
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning is feasible for low-resource languages (demonstrated across three different models)

**Medium Confidence**:
- LoRA's low-rank adaptation concentrates task-specific learning effectively for Bengali hate speech (supported by performance but lacks rank ablation evidence)
- Architecture-Tokenizer alignment affects cross-lingual transfer performance (plausible mechanism but limited empirical validation)
- 4-bit quantization with gradient backpropagation preserves adaptation capacity (reported memory savings but no precision-quality tradeoff analysis)

**Low Confidence**:
- The specific LoRA hyperparameters (rank=16, α=16) are optimal for Bengali hate speech detection (no hyperparameter search reported)
- Llama-3.2-3B's architectural features (RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm) specifically benefit Bengali processing (correlation without causal evidence)
- QLoRA is the first application to Bengali language processing (corpus search shows no prior applications but cannot definitively confirm absence)

## Next Checks

1. **Tokenizer Diagnostic Analysis**: Measure UNK token rates, average subword fragmentation, and out-of-vocabulary statistics for each base model's tokenizer on the BD-SHS validation set. Compare these metrics against F1-score performance to quantify the relationship between tokenizer-Bengali alignment and model effectiveness.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Evaluate the best-performing model (Llama-3.2-3B) on at least two additional Bengali hate speech datasets from different domains (e.g., news comments, forum discussions, regional dialects) to assess whether the 92.23% F1 score generalizes beyond the BD-SHS distribution.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Study**: Conduct a systematic ablation of LoRA rank values (r ∈ {4, 8, 16, 32, 64}) while keeping other parameters constant, measuring F1-score, training convergence speed, and overfitting indicators (train-val loss gap) to identify the optimal capacity-accuracy tradeoff for Bengali hate speech detection.
