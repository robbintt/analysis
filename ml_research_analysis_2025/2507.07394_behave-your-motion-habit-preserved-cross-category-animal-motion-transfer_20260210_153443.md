# Behave Your Motion: Habit-preserved Cross-category Animal Motion Transfer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07394
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07394
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed framework achieves FID of 0.0070 and MPJPE of 0.3758 on DeformingThings4D-skl, significantly outperforming direct transfer and style-based methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenging problem of cross-category animal motion transfer, where the goal is to transfer motion from one animal species to another while preserving species-specific behavioral habits. Unlike previous approaches that focus primarily on skeletal alignment or style transfer, this work introduces a habit-preserved motion transfer framework that captures and maintains the characteristic behaviors unique to each animal category. The method leverages a VQ-VAE architecture enhanced with category-specific habit encoders and an LLM-based text encoder for generalization to unseen species. A new synthetic dataset, DeformingThings4D-skl, is introduced for evaluation purposes. The approach demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods, particularly in preserving the characteristic movements and behaviors that define different animal species.

## Method Summary
The proposed habit-preserved motion transfer framework is built on a VQ-VAE architecture that encodes motion into discrete latent codes while preserving behavioral characteristics. The key innovation lies in integrating category-specific habit encoders that capture species-specific motion patterns, combined with an LLM-based text encoder for handling unseen animal categories. The framework processes skeletal motion data through a series of encoders that extract both generic motion features and category-specific habits, which are then decoded to generate target animal motions that maintain the source's behavioral characteristics. The DeformingThings4D-skl dataset provides a comprehensive evaluation platform with diverse animal motions and skeletal structures, enabling quantitative assessment of cross-category transfer quality through metrics like FID and MPJPE.

## Key Results
- Achieves FID score improvement from 0.2400 to 0.0070 on DeformingThings4D-skl dataset
- Reduces MPJPE from 6.0139 to 0.3758, indicating more accurate motion transfer
- Outperforms both direct transfer methods and style-based approaches in preserving species-specific behaviors
- Ablation study confirms effectiveness of combining category-specific encoders with LLM text encoders

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from its ability to disentangle general motion patterns from species-specific habits. By using category-specific habit encoders, the model can capture the unique behavioral signatures of different animals while maintaining the ability to transfer motion patterns through the shared VQ-VAE backbone. The LLM text encoder provides semantic understanding of animal categories, enabling generalization to unseen species by leveraging textual descriptions of behavioral characteristics. This multi-modal approach ensures that transferred motions not only align anatomically but also maintain the characteristic movements and behaviors that define each species, addressing the fundamental limitation of previous methods that treat motion transfer as purely geometric alignment.

## Foundational Learning

**VQ-VAE (Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder)**: Why needed - Enables discrete representation of continuous motion data for better control and stability. Quick check - Verify that latent codes capture both spatial and temporal motion characteristics.

**Category-specific habit encoding**: Why needed - Preserves species-specific behavioral patterns that distinguish one animal from another. Quick check - Ensure habit encoders can generalize across different motion speeds and styles within the same category.

**LLM-based text encoding**: Why needed - Provides semantic understanding for generalizing to unseen animal categories. Quick check - Validate that textual descriptions correlate with actual motion characteristics.

**Skeletal alignment**: Why needed - Maintains anatomical correctness during cross-category transfer. Quick check - Confirm that transferred skeletons preserve joint relationships and movement ranges.

**Motion fidelity metrics (FID, MPJPE)**: Why needed - Quantifies quality of motion transfer in terms of both style and accuracy. Quick check - Ensure metrics capture both local motion details and global behavioral patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw motion data -> Category-specific habit encoders -> VQ-VAE backbone -> LLM text encoder -> Motion decoder -> Generated motion

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are the category-specific habit encoders and the VQ-VAE backbone. The habit encoders must effectively capture species-specific behaviors, while the VQ-VAE ensures stable latent representation. The LLM text encoder serves as a bridge for unseen categories but is secondary to the core habit encoding.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for accuracy by using multiple specialized encoders. While this increases model size and training requirements, it enables more precise preservation of behavioral characteristics compared to single-encoder approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include loss of species-specific habits when transferring to anatomically very different animals, and degradation in quality when handling highly dynamic or complex motion sequences that exceed the model's learned patterns.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Transfer motion from a dog to a cat to verify preservation of quadrupedal movement patterns
2. Transfer human motion to a horse to test cross-category generalization
3. Transfer bird flight motion to a bat to evaluate handling of similar but distinct skeletal structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the limitations section implies several areas for future research, including scalability to more diverse real-world animal behaviors and improved handling of animals with significantly different skeletal structures.

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic data (DeformingThings4D-skl) limits real-world applicability
- Extensive training data requirements per species may not be feasible for rare animals
- LLM text encoder may struggle with fine-grained behavioral nuances not well-represented in text
- Performance on animals with significant skeletal differences remains untested

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Core VQ-VAE architecture with category-specific encoders is well-documented and reproducible
- Medium Confidence: Generalizability claims are supported by synthetic benchmarks but unverified on real-world data
- Low Confidence: LLM text encoder's effectiveness for capturing subtle motion patterns is not thoroughly validated

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on real-world motion capture data from multiple species to validate synthetic benchmark performance
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating LLM text encoder contribution versus category-specific encoders
3. Evaluate method's ability to transfer motion between animals with vastly different skeletal structures (e.g., insects to mammals)
