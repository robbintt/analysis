# Solving the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem via Learning-Based Path Generation and Optimal Splitting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.17087
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17087
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GaS framework outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based methods on m³-TSP with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) and superior out-of-distribution generalization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the min-max multiple traveling salesmen problem (m³-TSP), where the goal is to minimize the longest tour among m salesmen visiting n cities. The authors propose the Generate-and-Split (GaS) framework, which integrates reinforcement learning with an optimal splitting algorithm. GaS first generates a path visiting all cities using an LSTM-enhanced RL path generator, then applies a deterministic algorithm to partition this path into tours for each salesman. Extensive experiments show GaS significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches on both solution quality and transferability, achieving better results in 90.7% of out-of-distribution test cases.

## Method Summary
The GaS framework combines a reinforcement learning path generator with an optimal deterministic splitting algorithm. The path generator uses a graph attention network (GAT) encoder and an LSTM-enhanced decoder to produce a TSP path visiting all nodes. The decoder employs partial observability, tracking visited cities through its hidden state. After path generation, a binary search-based algorithm optimally splits the path into m tours to minimize the maximum tour length. The method is trained using REINFORCE with a baseline computed from 16 augmented samples. The framework achieves superior performance by leveraging the computational efficiency of the deterministic splitter while maintaining the flexibility of learned path generation.

## Key Results
- GaS achieves statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) over state-of-the-art methods like Eqt and Dpn on standard benchmarks
- On out-of-distribution data, GaS performs better in 90.7% of test cases, demonstrating superior generalization
- The framework shows strong transferability across different city distributions and problem scales (n ∈ [50,100], m ∈ [2,10])

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from its hybrid approach that combines the strengths of algorithmic design with end-to-end learning. By using a deterministic optimal splitting algorithm, GaS guarantees the best possible partition of any generated path, which provides a strong learning signal for the RL agent. The LSTM-enhanced decoder handles the partial observability inherent in the TSP path generation task by maintaining a history of visited cities in its hidden state. This allows the model to make context-aware decisions despite not having full visibility of the entire solution space at each step.

## Foundational Learning
- **Min-Max mTSP:** Optimization problem minimizing the longest tour among multiple salesmen - needed for defining the objective function that the framework optimizes
- **REINFORCE algorithm:** Policy gradient method for training the RL agent - needed to learn the path generation policy without requiring full supervision
- **Graph Attention Networks:** Neural architecture for processing graph-structured data - needed to encode the spatial relationships between cities
- **Partial Observability:** The agent only sees visited cities, not the full solution - needed to model the sequential decision-making process where history matters
- **Binary Search for Optimization:** Algorithm to find optimal split points - needed to efficiently solve the splitting subproblem with guaranteed optimality
- **Augmentation for Baseline:** Using multiple transformations to compute stable reward baselines - needed to reduce variance in the REINFORCE updates

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Input graph → GAT Encoder → Decoder Context → LSTM → Attention → Action Distribution → Path Generation → Optimal Splitter → Cost

**Critical Path:** The RL training loop (path generation → cost computation via splitter → REINFORCE update) is the core computational bottleneck, requiring multiple forward passes per batch.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The deterministic splitter guarantees optimal partitioning but constrains the problem structure. The LSTM decoder handles partial observability at the cost of increased model complexity and training time compared to fully observable approaches.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Training instability manifests as oscillating rewards or failure to converge
- Suboptimal splits produce degenerate tours (empty or very short tours)
- Poor generalization shows up as degraded performance on out-of-distribution data

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement and test the greedy check algorithm on small instances (n=10, m=2-3) to verify correct tour partitioning
2. Verify the binary search implementation finds optimal split points by comparing against brute-force solutions on tiny problems
3. Train a minimal version (n=20, m=2) to confirm the RL pipeline converges and produces valid paths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1:** Can the Generate-and-Split (GaS) framework be effectively adapted to solve other combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)? The authors plan to apply it to other CO problems in future work, but adapting it to problems with additional constraints like capacity would require significant modifications to the path generation or splitting phases.

**Open Question 2:** Does the optimality guarantee of the splitting algorithm hold for non-Euclidean distance metrics or graphs that violate the triangle inequality? The greedy check relies explicitly on the triangle inequality, suggesting it may fail on asymmetric or non-Euclidean graphs, potentially degrading the RL reward signal.

**Open Question 3:** To what extent does the reliance on a deterministic algorithmic component restrict the "immediate generality" of the framework compared to purely end-to-end learning methods? While the hybrid approach improves performance, hard-coding the splitting logic might make the model less robust to problem variations like time windows where a neural network could learn adaptive heuristics.

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on a deterministic algorithmic component may limit its immediate generality compared to fully learning-based methods
- The optimality guarantee of the splitting algorithm depends on Euclidean distance metrics and may not extend to non-Euclidean spaces
- Key implementation details remain unspecified, including exact augmentation transformations and sampling width parameters

## Confidence
- **Implementation feasibility:** Medium - core algorithms are specified but key parameters are missing
- **Reproducibility:** Medium - the framework is clearly described but exact training dynamics are uncertain
- **Result verification:** Medium - performance improvements are significant but exact replication depends on unspecified hyperparameters

## Next Checks
1. Implement the greedy check algorithm and verify it produces exactly m tours (or fewer) with consistent total path length when tested on known examples
2. Compare the learned path generation against TSP2Real results - while the m³-TSP objective differs, similar path patterns should emerge
3. Test the binary search splitting algorithm on small instances (n=10, m=2-3) where optimal solutions can be verified by exhaustive search
