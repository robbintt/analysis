# ARLED: Leveraging LED-based ARMAN Model for Abstractive Summarization of Persian Long Documents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.10233
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10233
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: ARLED achieves F1=0.734 on Persian long-document summarization, outperforming ARMAN baseline and matching ChatGPT performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ARLED, a novel abstractive summarization model for Persian long documents that combines the ARMAN and LED architectures. The model addresses the challenge of processing documents exceeding 512 tokens by leveraging LED's sparse attention mechanism and ARMAN's semantic sentence selection capabilities. The authors constructed a new dataset of 300,000 Persian research papers and fine-tuned their model using it. Experimental results show that ARLED outperforms the original ARMAN model with precision of 0.752, recall of 0.716, and F1 score of 0.734, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating informative, concise summaries for Persian long texts.

## Method Summary
The ARLED model integrates ARMAN's semantic sentence selection and reordering with LED's Longformer encoder-decoder architecture to handle Persian documents up to 8192 tokens. The approach uses pre-trained weights from both ARMAN and LED, fine-tuned on a custom dataset of 300,000 Persian research papers from Ensani.ir. The model employs sparse attention patterns (local sliding-window plus global attention) to efficiently process long sequences while maintaining cross-document context. Training uses Adafactor optimizer with gradient checkpointing, processing inputs at 8192 tokens and generating summaries up to 512 tokens.

## Key Results
- ARLED achieves F1 score of 0.734, outperforming ARMAN baseline (F1=0.722)
- Precision of 0.752 and recall of 0.716 demonstrate strong performance
- Results show competitive performance with ChatGPT on BERTScore metrics
- Model successfully handles documents exceeding standard transformer length limits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sparse Attention Enables Long-Document Processing
- Claim: LED processes documents up to 8192 tokens using linear-scaling sparse attention
- Core assumption: Important semantic relationships can be captured through local context windows supplemented by strategic global attention
- Evidence anchors: Longformer literature and neighbor papers on long-document summarization
- Break condition: If documents require dense token-to-token dependencies across distant sections

### Mechanism 2: Semantic Sentence Selection and Reordering
- Claim: ARMAN's pre-training teaches the model to identify summary-worthy content
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity to document core topics correlates with summary importance
- Evidence anchors: ARMAN literature on semantic selection, though no direct Persian validation
- Break condition: If domain-specific importance doesn't align with semantic similarity

### Mechanism 3: Transfer Learning via Pre-trained Weight Initialization
- Claim: Initializing with pre-trained ARMAN and LED weights improves performance
- Core assumption: Pre-training objectives transfer effectively to Persian academic summarization
- Evidence anchors: Performance improvement over ARMAN baseline, supported by neighbor papers
- Break condition: If fine-tuning data distribution diverges significantly from pre-training corpus

## Foundational Learning

- **Transformer Self-Attention and Length Constraints**
  - Why needed here: Explains why standard transformers fail beyond 512-1024 tokens
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why standard self-attention has O(n²) complexity?

- **Encoder-Decoder Seq2Seq Architecture**
  - Why needed here: LED is an encoder-decoder model; understanding the architecture is essential
  - Quick check question: How does an encoder-decoder model differ from encoder-only or decoder-only architectures?

- **Tokenization, Padding, and Truncation**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses 8192-token inputs and 512-token outputs
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between padding and truncation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Persian text → AutoTokenizer → Token IDs (max 8192) → LED encoder (sparse attention) → ARMAN semantic selection → Decoder → Autoregressive generation (max 512 tokens)

- **Critical path:** Preprocess raw Persian text → Tokenize with AutoTokenizer → Forward pass through LED encoder + decoder → Compute cross-entropy loss → Backpropagate with gradient checkpointing → Update via Adafactor

- **Design tradeoffs:** Batch size = 1 (trades throughput for memory), gradient checkpointing (reduces memory at 20-30% slower training), beam size = 2 (conservative for speed)

- **Failure signatures:** CUDA OOM errors with long sequences, degraded summaries from truncation, training divergence without gradient checkpointing

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline ARMAN-only model reproduction, 2) LED-only ablation study, 3) Length-stratified evaluation by token length bins

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How do human subjects rate the readability and utility of the generated summaries compared to automated BERTScore metrics?
  - Basis: Paper explicitly states human evaluations can assess readability and usefulness
  - Resolution: User study with human annotators rating fluency and relevance

- **Open Question 2:** Can the model be effectively adapted to summarize long documents in other domains or non-English languages?
  - Basis: Conclusion outlines future work on other domains and languages
  - Resolution: Performance metrics on datasets from different domains or languages

- **Open Question 3:** How does ARLED compare to other sparse attention architectures like BigBird or ETC on the Persian dataset?
  - Basis: Authors note further analysis with other models can provide deeper insights
  - Resolution: Comparative study evaluating BigBird or ETC against ARLED

## Limitations

- Data provenance uncertainty with conflicting dataset sizes (300,000 vs 49,457 articles)
- Integration mechanism between ARMAN and LED remains underspecified
- Benchmark validity concerns due to reliance on BERTScore rather than human evaluation
- Limited prior work cited and absence of comprehensive comparisons with other Persian models

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** LED's sparse attention capability for long sequences is well-established; reported improvements over ARMAN baseline are statistically meaningful
- **Medium confidence:** Claims of competitiveness with ChatGPT are supported by BERTScore but lack direct comparative analysis
- **Low confidence:** Assertion of addressing a "gap in Persian abstractive summarization" is difficult to verify given limited prior work citations

## Next Checks

1. **Length-stratified performance validation:** Divide test set into three length bins and measure F1 scores per bin to confirm ARLED's advantages for longer documents

2. **Ablation study of ARMAN integration:** Fine-tune LED-only model with identical hyperparameters to isolate ARMAN's contribution

3. **Direct human evaluation comparison:** Conduct small-scale human evaluation comparing ARLED, ARMAN, and ChatGPT summaries on 50 Persian research paper abstracts
