# Causal Distillation: Transferring Structured Explanations from Large to Compact Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.19511
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19511
- Authors: Aggrey Muhebwa; Khalid K. Osman
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Compact models (1-3B parameters) achieve up to 0.910 CEC score on climate causal explanations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for distilling causal reasoning abilities from large proprietary language models to smaller open-source models through structured explanation transfer. The method uses GPT-4 as a teacher to generate evidence-based causal explanations for claim-evidence pairs, which are then used to fine-tune compact student models via supervised fine-tuning with divergence-based objectives. To evaluate explanation quality, the authors propose a new metric called Causal Explanation Coherence (CEC) that measures semantic alignment of causal relationships between generated and reference explanations using sentence-level bidirectional matching. Experimental results on the Climate-FEVER dataset show that student models achieve high CEC scores (up to 0.910 for Phi-2) after fine-tuning, demonstrating effective transfer of causal reasoning.

## Method Summary
The framework uses GPT-4 to generate structured causal explanations for claim-evidence pairs from the Climate-FEVER dataset. These explanations are then used to fine-tune compact student models (TinyLlama, Phi-2, and Gemma-2B) via supervised fine-tuning with divergence-based objectives. The training minimizes divergence between student-generated and teacher-generated explanations across the training distribution. A new evaluation metric, Causal Explanation Coherence (CEC), is introduced to measure semantic alignment of causal relationships between generated and reference explanations using bidirectional sentence-level matching. Student models are fine-tuned using 4-bit quantization and LoRA adaptation, with training configured for 10 epochs at a learning rate of 2e-5 and batch size of 8.

## Key Results
- Phi-2 achieved the highest CEC score of 0.910, followed by Gemma-2B at 0.886 and TinyLlama at 0.838
- CEC metric correlates more consistently with explanation quality than traditional metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore
- Student models tend to simplify fine-grained causal distinctions, merging region-specific or temporally localized insights into broader narratives
- Student models struggle with out-of-distribution examples requiring novel causal chains or multi-hop reasoning steps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Supervised fine-tuning on teacher-generated causal explanations transfers reasoning structure to student models
- Mechanism: Student model M_student(X; θ) trained to minimize divergence D(·, ·) between its generated explanations and GPT-4's reference explanations across training distribution per Equation 1: θ* = argmin_θ E_X~p(X)[D(M_teacher(X), M_student(X, θ))]
- Core assumption: Teacher explanations encode genuine causal structure rather than superficial patterns, and student models can internalize this structure via next-token prediction
- Evidence anchors: Abstract confirms teacher-generated explanations provide consistent causal rationales; related work on reasoning distillation supports symbolic reasoning supervision improving compact model performance
- Break condition: If teacher explanations contain systematic biases or spurious correlations, students will inherit these flaws

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bidirectional sentence-level semantic alignment captures causal fidelity better than surface-level metrics
- Mechanism: CEC computes forward coverage (each generated sentence's max similarity to reference) and backward faithfulness (each reference sentence's max similarity to generated), averaging both per Equation 2
- Core assumption: Causal structure is preserved at sentence level and can be captured via embedding similarity, independent of word order or phrasing
- Evidence anchors: Abstract shows CEC correlates more consistently with explanation quality than traditional metrics; symmetric design captures both types of misalignment
- Break condition: CEC does not verify factual correctness—a "causally coherent yet factually incorrect explanation" can achieve high CEC

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Compact models (1-3B parameters) can approximate teacher causal reasoning with sufficient fine-tuning data
- Mechanism: Student models initialized from pre-trained weights are fine-tuned on claim-evidence-explanation triplets using LoRA adaptation (4-bit quantization), learning to generate structured explanations while retaining base language capabilities
- Core assumption: Pre-trained representations in compact models contain sufficient inductive biases to learn causal structure when provided with explicit supervision
- Evidence anchors: Experimental results show Phi-2 achieving 0.910 CEC; student models simplify fine-grained distinctions; converging evidence from related work on reasoning distillation
- Break condition: Student models "often struggle with out-of-distribution examples that require novel causal chains or multi-hop reasoning steps"

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Distillation Fundamentals**: Understanding how divergence-based objectives (KL, cross-entropy) transfer behavior from teacher to student is essential for grasping the core method
  - Quick check: Can you explain why minimizing KL divergence between output distributions differs from directly copying token sequences?

- **Causal Reasoning vs. Correlation**: The paper's core premise is that LLMs default to associative prediction; understanding why causal structure requires explicit modeling is essential
  - Quick check: Given the polar bear example, what intermediate causal variable connects "rising temperatures" to "population decline"?

- **Sentence Embeddings and Semantic Similarity**: CEC relies on cosine similarity between sentence embeddings; understanding embedding space geometry is prerequisite
  - Quick check: Why might two sentences with high cosine similarity still differ in causal directionality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: GPT-4 + Climate-FEVER claims → structured explanations (offline generation) → student training [Claim; Evidence; Label] → explanation generation (LoRA fine-tuning, 4-bit quantization) → CEC evaluation (sentence embedding model + bidirectional max-similarity computation)

- **Critical path**: 1) Generate teacher explanations for all claim-evidence pairs (one-time cost), 2) Fine-tune student models (10 epochs, lr=2e-5, batch=8), 3) Evaluate with CEC against GPT-4 reference explanations

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using GPT-4 explanations as ground truth enables scaling but introduces teacher dependency and potential bias inheritance; CEC's sentence-level granularity captures causal structure but lacks factuality verification; LoRA reduces memory overhead but may limit full reasoning capacity transfer

- **Failure signatures**: High BLEU/ROUGE but low CEC indicates surface mimicry without causal structure; high CEC but factual errors shows coherent but incorrect reasoning chains; simplified explanations indicate student merges fine-grained distinctions

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate baseline: Fine-tune TinyLlama on Climate-FEVER subset with GPT-4 explanations; measure CEC vs. BERTScore gap, 2) Ablate bidirectionality: Compare symmetric CEC against forward-only variant to quantify faithfulness penalty, 3) Out-of-distribution test: Evaluate fine-tuned models on claims outside climate domain to assess generalization limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can CEC be augmented with factuality verification to prevent high coherence scores for causally coherent but factually incorrect explanations?**: The authors state that "CEC does not verify factual correctness. As a result, a model may generate a causally coherent yet factually incorrect explanation and still receive a high CEC score, potentially obscuring critical errors."

- **How effectively do distilled student models generalize to out-of-distribution examples requiring novel causal chains or multi-hop reasoning beyond the training distribution?**: The paper explicitly notes that "while the student models generalize well within the data distribution observed during training, they often struggle with out-of-distribution examples that require novel causal chains or multi-hop reasoning steps beyond what the distillation process exposed them to."

- **Does the causal distillation framework transfer effectively to high-stakes domains such as medical diagnostics or legal justification where structured causal reasoning is critical?**: The authors propose that "the framework can generalize naturally to other tasks such as legal justification, scientific question answering, and clinical decision support, all which require structured explanatory behavior."

- **How can CEC be extended to provide interpretable, component-level diagnostics rather than a single aggregate score?**: The paper acknowledges that "CEC has interpretability limitations: it reduces explanation quality to a single scalar value without identifying which causal components influenced high or low scores."

## Limitations
- Dependence on GPT-4 as sole teacher model creates circular dependency where evaluation compares student explanations only against GPT-4 outputs
- Lack of factuality verification means explanations can be "causally coherent yet factually incorrect" while still achieving high CEC scores
- Sentence-level granularity may miss multi-sentence causal relationships that span across sentence boundaries

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the distillation mechanism (Mechanism 1): Supervised fine-tuning with divergence-based objectives is well-established and experimental results provide strong empirical support
- **Medium confidence** in CEC metric effectiveness (Mechanism 2): Limited external validation of CEC's sensitivity to causal fidelity and lack of factuality verification represent significant limitations
- **Medium confidence** in compact model capabilities (Mechanism 3): Results support the claim that compact models can learn causal reasoning, but observed failure modes indicate fundamental limitations in transferred reasoning capacity

## Next Checks
1. **Factuality-Aware Evaluation**: Implement a factuality check by cross-referencing generated explanations against evidence sentences using semantic similarity or entailment models to address CEC's blind spot regarding factual correctness

2. **Multi-Teacher Distillation**: Train student models using explanations from multiple teacher models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama-2-70B) to assess robustness against individual teacher biases and determine whether diverse causal perspectives improve student performance and generalization

3. **Human Evaluation Study**: Conduct a controlled human evaluation where annotators rate explanation quality on causal correctness, completeness, and faithfulness to evidence, comparing human judgments against CEC scores to validate whether the metric captures human notions of good causal explanations
