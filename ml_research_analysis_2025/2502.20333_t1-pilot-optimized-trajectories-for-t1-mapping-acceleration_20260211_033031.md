## Executive Summary
This work introduces T1-PILOT, a method for accelerated cardiac T1 mapping that jointly optimizes k-space sampling trajectories and image reconstruction within a physics-informed framework. Unlike previous approaches that rely on fixed or single-frame undersampling masks, T1-PILOT learns non-Cartesian, per-frame trajectories while explicitly incorporating the T1 signal relaxation model into the optimization objective. The method follows a three-stage training process: pre-training for reconstruction, joint optimization of decay and acquisition, and optional per-sample refinement. Extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset demonstrate that T1-PILOT significantly outperforms baseline methods including fixed radial and golden-angle sampling, as well as learned single-mask approaches. The method achieves consistent gains in PSNR and VIF, with improvements of approximately 2.5 dB in PSNR when finetuning is applied, and shows better preservation of fine myocardial structures. These results highlight that integrating the physical T1 relaxation model into trajectory learning leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and greater acceleration compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
T1-PILOT jointly optimizes non-Cartesian per-frame k-space trajectories and image reconstruction for accelerated cardiac T1 mapping. The method incorporates the T1 exponential decay model (A - B·exp(-t/T₁)) into the optimization objective, learning trajectories that maximize information for decay parameter estimation. The three-stage training process includes reconstruction pre-training using TEAM-PILOT backbone, joint optimization of decay and acquisition, and optional per-sample refinement. Trajectories are parameterized as 2D control points with SPLINE interpolation and kinematic constraints. The reconstruction network uses 3D convolution and windowed multi-head self-attention blocks, while the decay estimation network processes reconstructed frames with temporal embeddings of inversion times to predict T1 parameters.

## Key Results
- T1-PILOT achieves approximately 2.5 dB PSNR improvement over baseline methods when per-sample finetuning is applied
- The method consistently outperforms fixed radial and golden-angle sampling schemes across different acceleration factors (16, 32, 64 shots)
- T1-PILOT shows better preservation of fine myocardial structures compared to baseline approaches
- Per-frame trajectories demonstrate superior performance compared to single-mask learned sampling strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating the T1 signal relaxation model into trajectory optimization improves sampling efficiency for downstream T1 map estimation.
- Mechanism: The optimization objective backpropagates error from decay-model fitting through both reconstruction and sampling parameters, forcing trajectories to acquire k-space points most informative for exponential curve fitting rather than generic reconstruction quality.
- Core assumption: K-space locations that minimize reconstruction error overlap significantly with those that minimize T1 decay parameter error; this may not hold if decay-critical frequencies are spatially dispersed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling–reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories..."
  - [Section 2.1] Eq. 3 shows the joint objective argmin_{θ,ψ} Σ ||x_{ti} - (A_{θ,ψ} - B_{θ,ψ}·exp(-t_i/T*_{1,θ,ψ}))||²
  - [corpus] q3-MuPa (arXiv:2512.23726) similarly uses physics-informed diffusion for multi-parametric mapping, suggesting physics constraints as an emerging pattern—but corpus evidence is limited and this is not directly comparable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A three-stage optimization schedule prevents noisy decay-objective gradients from destabilizing trajectory learning.
- Mechanism: Stage 1 pre-trains trajectories with a stable reconstruction objective; Stage 2 fine-tunes with the decay objective; Stage 3 optionally adapts model weights per-sample. This curriculum isolates high-variance decay gradients to later stages when trajectories are already reasonable.
- Core assumption: Reconstruction pre-training converges to a basin from which decay-guided refinement can escape local minima without catastrophic forgetting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method follows a three-stage training process: pre-training for reconstruction, joint optimization of decay and acquisition, and optional per-sample refinement."
  - [Section 2.2] "...gradients backpropagated from [the decay objective] supply overly noisy feedback to the sampling parameters ψ."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Non-Cartesian per-frame trajectories outperform single-mask or fixed radial schemes by adapting to inversion-time-specific signal content.
- Mechanism: Each frame has different T1-weighted contrast due to varying inversion times t_i; per-frame trajectories can prioritize different k-space regions (e.g., higher frequencies for later frames with stronger tissue contrast).
- Core assumption: The signal content difference across inversion times is large enough to justify different sampling patterns; with small T1 differences, per-frame gains diminish.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...learns non-Cartesian, per-frame trajectories while explicitly incorporating the T1 signal relaxation model..."
  - [Table 1] Single-mask baseline underperforms T1-PILOT by ~2dB PSNR on T1-Map metric.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **T1 Relaxation Physics & MOLLI Sequencing**
  - Why needed here: The decay model (Eq. 1) is the core constraint; understanding why A, B, T*₁ parameterize recovery enables debugging of decay-estimation failures.
  - Quick check question: Given inversion times [100ms, 400ms, 900ms], sketch expected signal intensities for two tissues with T1=400ms vs T1=800ms.

- Concept: **Non-Cartesian K-Space Sampling & NUFFT**
  - Why needed here: T1-PILOT uses radial-like trajectories with SPLINE interpolation; implementing F_{Kψ} requires non-uniform FFT operations.
  - Quick check question: Why does radial sampling spread aliasing artifacts compared to Cartesian undersampling?

- Concept: **Compressed Sensing & Reconstruction Networks**
  - Why needed here: Stage 1 uses TEAM-PILOT for reconstruction pre-training; understanding unrolled networks and data consistency layers is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the data-consistency layer in an unrolled reconstruction network?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input sequence X -> F_{Kψ} (undersample) -> R_ζ (reconstruct) -> D_ξ (predict decay params) -> Eq. 1 forward model -> L2 loss vs X
- Critical path: Input sequence X → F_{Kψ} (undersample) → R_ζ (reconstruct) → D_ξ (predict decay params) → Eq. 1 forward model → L2 loss vs X
- Design tradeoffs:
  - More shots → lower acceleration but higher PSNR (Table 1: 16→64 shots yields ~5dB gain)
  - Per-sample finetuning → +2.5dB PSNR but adds inference-time optimization (3000 iterations)
  - Trajectory flexibility vs hardware constraints: SPLINE parametrization enforces smoothness but limits high-frequency trajectory changes
- Failure signatures:
  - Decay loss stagnates while reconstruction improves → decay model capacity insufficient, increase D_ξ depth
  - T1-Map PSNR much lower than Decay PSNR → decay-fitting error not translating to parameter accuracy; check inversion time embedding conditioning
  - Trajectory gradients explode → add gradient clipping or reduce SPLINE control point density
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation: Decay objective timing**: Run Stage 1 → Stage 2 vs. joint optimization from scratch. Expect joint to be unstable; this validates curriculum necessity.
  2. **Trajectory visualization**: Plot learned trajectories for early vs. late inversion-time frames. Expect systematic differences in radial density or angular distribution.
  3. **Finetuning sensitivity**: Test per-sample finetuning with 500, 1000, 3000 iterations. Plot PSNR vs. iterations to identify saturation point.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the T1-PILOT framework be successfully extended to other quantitative MRI modalities (e.g., T2 or T2* mapping) and cross-modality acceleration scenarios?
- What is the clinical impact of T1-PILOT's improved PSNR and VIF metrics on diagnostic accuracy for detecting myocardial pathologies?
- How well does T1-PILOT generalize across different MRI scanner manufacturers, field strengths, and acquisition protocols?
- Can the three-stage optimization pipeline be simplified or accelerated while maintaining reconstruction and decay estimation quality?

## Limitations
- Trajectory optimization hyperparameters and SPLINE parametrization details are underspecified, requiring implementation assumptions that may affect performance
- The per-sample finetuning stage (3000 iterations) represents significant computational overhead at inference time
- Evaluation relies on pseudo-ground-truth T1 maps generated by a model trained on fully-sampled data, introducing potential bias
- The method's performance on pathology-specific cases (ischemia, fibrosis) remains unexplored despite claims of clinical relevance

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Claims about superior PSNR/VIF metrics compared to fixed sampling schemes (directly supported by Table 1 results)
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about trajectory adaptation to inversion-time-specific content (inferred from architecture but not directly visualized in results)
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about clinical applicability and diagnostic utility (supported by qualitative examples but lacking formal reader study)

## Next Checks
1. **Trajectory Visualization Analysis**: Generate and compare learned trajectories across different inversion-time frames to verify systematic adaptation patterns and rule out trivial solutions
2. **Diagnostic Accuracy Validation**: Conduct a formal reader study comparing T1 map quality between T1-PILOT and conventional methods on pathology cases (ischemia, fibrosis)
3. **Computational Efficiency Assessment**: Measure wall-clock time for per-sample finetuning stage across different hardware configurations to quantify practical deployment costs
