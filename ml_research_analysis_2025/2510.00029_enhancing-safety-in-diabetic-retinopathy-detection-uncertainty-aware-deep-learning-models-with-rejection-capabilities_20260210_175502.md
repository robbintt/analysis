# Enhancing Safety in Diabetic Retinopathy Detection: Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning Models with Rejection Capabilities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00029
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00029
- Reference count: 20
- Model achieves 89.93% accuracy on accepted predictions while rejecting 25.50% of uncertain cases to improve safety

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a Variational Bayesian Linear Layer (VBLL) integrated into a diabetic retinopathy detection model, enabling principled uncertainty quantification and selective rejection of low-confidence predictions. The approach achieves 89.93% accuracy on accepted predictions while maintaining 74.50% coverage, rejecting 25.50% of uncertain cases to enhance clinical safety. With an Expected Calibration Error of 0.0217, the model demonstrates reliable confidence estimates that align with actual performance, providing a safer diagnostic support tool that defers uncertain cases to human experts.

## Method Summary
The method replaces the final classification layer of DenseNet201 with a Variational Bayesian Linear Layer (VBLL) that models uncertainty in weights using variational inference. Training employs an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) loss combining negative log-likelihood and KL divergence. At inference, Monte Carlo sampling (10-30 passes) generates predictive distributions, with maximum softmax probability serving as confidence metric. Predictions below threshold (0.7) are rejected and deferred to human experts, trading coverage for reliability. The approach uses progressive layer-wise unfreezing, CLAHE preprocessing, SMOTE oversampling for class balance, and stratified 70/15/15 data splitting.

## Key Results
- Model achieves 89.93% accuracy on accepted predictions with 74.50% coverage
- Rejects 25.50% of uncertain cases to improve safety in clinical deployment
- Expected Calibration Error of 0.0217 confirms predicted confidence aligns with actual performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VBLL enables principled uncertainty estimation without architectural complexity
- Mechanism: VBLL learns distributions over weights via variational inference; Monte Carlo sampling produces predictive posterior variance quantifying epistemic uncertainty
- Core assumption: Mean-field variational approximation sufficiently captures posterior complexity
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states VBLL "enhances prediction reliability through uncertainty quantification"; section III.B describes VBLL as learning weight distributions via variational inference

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Confidence-based rejection improves safety by deferring uncertain predictions
- Mechanism: Max softmax probability threshold (0.7) gates output vs. deferral, trading coverage for reliability
- Core assumption: Rejected cases can be reviewed by human experts in deployment
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "rejecting 25.50% of uncertain cases to improve safety"; section III.C describes confidence threshold simulation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ELBO loss enables tractable training while regularizing uncertainty estimates
- Mechanism: ELBO = NLL + KL divergence; NLL drives accuracy, KL prevents overconfident posteriors on limited data
- Core assumption: Prior distribution choice is reasonable; KL weight appropriately balances accuracy and uncertainty
- Evidence anchors: Section III.B describes ELBO comprising negative log-likelihood and KL divergence; ECE of 0.0217 indicates good calibration

## Foundational Learning

- **Variational Inference & ELBO**: VBLL relies on variational approximation to intractable posteriors; understanding ELBO components (NLL + KL) is essential for debugging training and interpreting uncertainty. Quick check: If your model is underconfident (ECE high), which ELBO component would you adjust and how?

- **Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty**: VBLL primarily captures epistemic uncertainty (model parameter uncertainty); distinguishing this from aleatoric (data noise) informs whether rejection indicates fixable model ignorance vs. inherent ambiguity. Quick check: A prediction has high entropy but low epistemic uncertainty—what does this imply about the input image quality?

- **Calibration (ECE)**: Low ECE (0.0217) justifies using confidence as a proxy for correctness; without calibration, rejection thresholds are arbitrary. Quick check: If ECE doubles after domain shift, can you still trust the 0.7 rejection threshold?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: DenseNet201 backbone -> Pooled convolutional features -> VBLL head -> Monte Carlo sampling (10-30 passes) -> Predictive mean + variance -> Max-softmax threshold (0.7) -> Output vs. rejection

- **Critical path**: 1) Train backbone frozen, then unfreeze progressively; 2) Replace final layer with VBLL, train with ELBO loss; 3) Tune rejection threshold on validation for target coverage-accuracy trade-off; 4) Evaluate ECE to verify calibration before deployment

- **Design tradeoffs**: More MC samples → better uncertainty estimates, slower inference; higher rejection threshold → higher accuracy on accepted, lower coverage; VBLL vs. MC Dropout: VBLL is architecturally cleaner but less battle-tested

- **Failure signatures**: Overconfident on OOD (low uncertainty on blurry images) → check calibration on augmented validation; excessive rejection (>40%) → threshold too high or model undertrained; ECE spike after deployment → distribution shift → recalibrate

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Threshold sweep: vary rejection threshold (0.5-0.9), plot accuracy vs. coverage curve; 2) Uncertainty vs. image quality: inject noise/blur, verify rejected cases correlate with degraded inputs; 3) Comparison baseline: implement MC Dropout variant alongside VBLL to compare ECE and rejection behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can VBLL framework maintain performance on other medical imaging domains?** The paper suggests future work on applying methodology to other medical imaging use cases. This remains unresolved as current validation is exclusively on retinal fundus images. Evidence would require successful replication on distinct datasets like chest X-rays or dermatology images.

- **Do dynamic, instance-dependent rejection thresholds improve coverage-safety trade-off?** Authors propose that dynamic thresholds may further improve clinical application. The current static threshold (0.7) may be suboptimal across diverse clinical cases. Evidence would show adaptive thresholds yield higher coverage without sacrificing 89.93% accuracy standard.

- **Does expert feedback in rejection loop improve clinical utility?** The paper suggests engaging domain experts' input into rejection processes. Current mechanism is fully automated; expert oversight interaction has not been tested in real-world workflow. Evidence would require human-in-the-loop study showing expert review reduces final diagnostic error rate more effectively than automated rejection alone.

## Limitations
- Results derived from single unspecified public dataset; performance may not generalize across different imaging equipment or populations
- 0.7 confidence threshold selected based on validation but lacks clinical validation for real-world deployment
- Monte Carlo sampling increases inference time by 10-30×, potentially limiting real-time clinical applications

## Confidence
- High Confidence: ELBO loss formulation and variational inference principles are well-established; ECE calculation methodology is standard
- Medium Confidence: VBLL implementation details and specific performance metrics lack sufficient methodological transparency for independent verification
- Medium Confidence: Rejection mechanism's clinical safety claims are supported by performance metrics but lack validation in actual clinical settings

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Dataset Validation: Evaluate VBLL model on at least two additional DR datasets (APTOS, DDR) to assess generalization beyond original training data
2. Clinical Workflow Integration: Test rejection mechanism in simulated clinical setting where human experts review rejected cases to measure workflow impact and safety benefits
3. Comparative Analysis: Implement MC Dropout baseline with identical backbone and compare calibration, uncertainty quality, and computational efficiency against VBLL approach
