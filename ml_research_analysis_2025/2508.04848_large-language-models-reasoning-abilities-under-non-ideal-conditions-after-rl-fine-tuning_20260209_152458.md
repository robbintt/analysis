# Large Language Models Reasoning Abilities Under Non-Ideal Conditions After RL-Fine-Tuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.04848
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04848
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: RL-fine-tuned LLMs show significant reasoning performance degradation in noisy, multi-option, and irrelevant-context scenarios despite strong ideal-condition performance

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how RL-fine-tuned large language models perform under non-ideal conditions that better reflect real-world reasoning challenges. While RL fine-tuning improves reasoning in idealized settings, performance significantly degrades when faced with noisy inputs, summary inference tasks, and contextual filtering requirements. The study evaluates three LLMs and a vision-language model across eight datasets, revealing critical limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Though scenario-specific remediation strategies (format rewards, guided examples) partially address these deficits, they don't fully resolve the underlying issues. The authors publicly release novel evaluation datasets to support future research in this area.

## Method Summary
The study fine-tunes four models (Llama3.1-8B, Qwen3-14B, Mistral-24B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B) using GRPO on multiple datasets, creating stage variants (A/C/E/G) with different training focuses. Evaluation occurs on clean test sets (Stages AB/CD) and constructed non-ideal scenarios: FineTest (noise injection with distractors) and FilterTest (irrelevant context prepending). Remediation strategies include format rewards for structured analysis and guided examples for noise identification. Training uses 4× A100 80GB GPUs with DeepSpeed 0.17.0, TRL 0.18.2, and Transformers 4.52.4, with validation every 30 steps and early stopping after 4 evaluations without improvement.

## Key Results
- RL-fine-tuned models show >5% accuracy drop from ideal (StageAB) to non-ideal (StageAD) conditions across all evaluated scenarios
- Performance degradation is most severe for smaller models (Llama3.1-8B) and varies by task type
- Remediation strategies partially recover performance but show inconsistent transferability across model architectures
- Qwen3-14B benefits from evaluation-time guidance (StageEH), while Qwen2.5-VL-7B requires training-time updates (StageGH) for noise suppression

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: GRPO Policy Optimization for Reasoning Enhancement
Policy gradient optimization with group-relative advantage estimation improves LLM reasoning in ideal settings by reinforcing successful reasoning trajectories. GRPO samples multiple outputs per question, computes advantages via group-normalized rewards (correctness + format), then updates policy via clipped surrogate objective with KL regularization. This amplifies high-reward reasoning paths while maintaining proximity to reference policy. The reward signal (correctness + format) is assumed to correlate with genuine reasoning quality rather than surface pattern matching. Break condition: If rewards become sparse (advantage approaches zero), KL term dominates and policy degrades, as observed in Llama3.1 where "advantage term Ai approaches zero, causing the KL divergence to update the policy in unhelpful directions."

### Mechanism 2: Non-Ideal Scenario Performance Degradation
RL-fine-tuned models exhibit systematic reasoning deficits when inputs contain noise, require multi-hypothesis integration, or demand contextual filtering—tasks humans handle robustly. RL optimization under ideal conditions overfits to clean, single-path reasoning. When presented with multiple possibilities requiring summary, fine-grained distractors, or irrelevant context, the reinforced policy lacks exploratory capacity and gets confused by additional information rather than leveraging it. Current RL training lacks explicit mechanisms for noise robustness and hypothesis aggregation. Break condition: Model size mediates degradation—larger models (Mistral 24B, Qwen3 14B) maintain better performance than smaller ones (Llama3.1 8B), suggesting parameter capacity partially compensates.

### Mechanism 3: Remediation via Format Rewards and Guided Examples
Explicit training for summary inference (Stage C/D) and providing guided examples (Stage G/H) partially recovers non-ideal performance by activating latent reasoning capabilities. Format rewards enforce structured analysis of all options before concluding, preventing premature commitment. Guided examples demonstrate noise identification and contextual filtering, priming the model to apply similar patterns. Both mechanisms leverage pre-existing knowledge rather than fundamentally altering the policy. The assumption is that models possess latent advanced reasoning capabilities from pre-training that can be activated but not reliably acquired through current RL approaches. Break condition: Remediation effectiveness varies by model architecture and scenario. Qwen2.5-VL requires training-stage examples (StageGH) for noise suppression since "recognizing fine-grained noise requires image-text comparison that cannot be effectively trained during evaluation alone."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Policy Gradient with Advantage Estimation**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how GRPO computes advantages (group-relative normalization) explains why sparse rewards cause Llama3.1's policy collapse.
  - Quick check question: Given rewards [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] for 5 samples, what happens to the advantage term and subsequent policy update?

- Concept: **KL Divergence Regularization**
  - Why needed here: The DKL term in GRPO prevents excessive policy deviation but becomes counterproductive when advantage signals are weak.
  - Quick check question: If all rewards in a group are identical, which term dominates the GRPO loss, and what behavior results?

- Concept: **Cognitive Robustness from Neuroscience**
  - Why needed here: Paper grounds non-ideal scenarios in brain science findings about human reasoning under imperfect inputs (Nature/Science citations).
  - Quick check question: Why might human "phase-amplitude coupling of hippocampal neurons" (Daume et al. 2024) suggest different evaluation metrics for LLM reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  ```
  Training Pipeline: Base LLM → GRPO fine-tuning → Stage A/E model → Additional training → Stage C/G model
                     ↓
              Reward computation: R_format + R_correctness
  Evaluation Pipeline: Test Question → Optional noise injection → Model variant → Structured output parsing → Accuracy
                           ↓
              FineTest (distractors) or FilterTest (irrelevant context)
  ```

- Critical path: Base model → GRPO Stage A training → Stage AB evaluation (ideal) vs Stage AD evaluation (non-ideal). Performance gap reveals reasoning deficits.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Stage EH (evaluation-time guidance) vs Stage GH (training+evaluation guidance): EH preserves original parameters; GH updates them but risks overwriting latent capabilities
  - Format reward enforcement: Improves structure but may constrain reasoning flexibility
  - Noisy dataset construction: Synthetic noise enables controlled evaluation but may not reflect real-world noise distributions

- Failure signatures:
  - Sparse reward collapse: Llama3.1 shows accuracy drop even in ideal conditions after RL fine-tuning
  - Non-ideal degradation: >5% accuracy drop from StageAB to StageAD indicates insufficient summary inference capability
  - Cross-modal failure: Qwen2.5-VL requires training-stage examples (StageGH) for noise suppression since recognizing fine-grained noise requires image-text comparison that cannot be effectively trained during evaluation alone

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce ideal vs non-ideal gap**: Fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL on MathVision with GRPO Stage A, evaluate on TestA vs FineTest. Expect ~15-20% degradation on noisy set.
  2. **Test remediation transfer**: Train Stage C variant on CommonsenseQA, evaluate zero-shot on Ceval-exam with Stage D instructions. Does summary inference training generalize across domains?
  3. **Ablate guidance timing**: Compare Stage EH vs Stage GH on FilterTest for Llama3.1. Hypothesis: Llama3.1 requires GH (training updates) due to weaker base capabilities; Qwen3 should prefer EH (activation-only).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can a unified training framework be developed to address summary inference, noise suppression, and contextual filtering simultaneously, rather than relying on the isolated, scenario-specific remediation strategies identified in this work? The authors state that while they "propose a scenario-specific remediation method... current methods leave these reasoning deficits largely unresolved," and they release datasets to support future research. A single RL-fine-tuned model that maintains statistically equivalent performance across ideal settings and all three defined non-ideal scenarios without requiring scenario-specific prompts would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Do the reasoning deficits observed in policy-gradient methods (specifically GRPO) persist when fine-tuning large language models using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based RL algorithms? The paper evaluates GRPO exclusively; it is unclear if the inability to suppress noise or summarize possibilities is an artifact of policy gradient optimization or a fundamental limitation of current RL paradigms. A comparative study showing the performance of MCTS-DPO or similar methods on the newly released FineTest and FilterTest datasets would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How does the performance of RL-fine-tuned models on synthetic noise (distractors/irrelevant context) correlate with their robustness against naturally occurring, organic noise found in real-world user interactions? The authors construct noisy evaluation sets via crowdsourcing and "synthetic distractors," explicitly noting the need for strict quality control to preserve meaning, which differs from the messy, unpredictable nature of real-world input. Evaluation of the fine-tuned models on domain-specific datasets containing organic transcription errors, colloquialisms, or uncurated context would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Synthetic non-ideal scenarios may not fully capture real-world noise complexity and diversity
- Remediation strategy effectiveness shows inconsistent transferability across model architectures
- Study does not investigate the impact of varying noise intensity or explore computational efficiency trade-offs

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The fundamental observation that RL-fine-tuned models show performance degradation in non-ideal scenarios (summary inference, noise suppression, contextual filtering). Consistently demonstrated across eight datasets and three model types.
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism explaining why RL optimization under ideal conditions leads to overfitting and insufficient exploration capabilities. Theoretical framework is sound but requires more empirical validation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of remediation strategies (format rewards and guided examples) in partially recovering performance. Results show improvement but vary significantly by model and scenario.

## Next Checks

1. **Noise Distribution Generalization**: Evaluate the same model variants on real-world noisy datasets (e.g., crowdsourced data with natural errors) to assess whether synthetic noise injection adequately represents practical conditions.

2. **Cross-Architecture Remediation Analysis**: Systematically compare remediation effectiveness across the full model spectrum (8B to 24B parameters) to determine whether model size alone explains the variation in StageEH vs StageGH performance.

3. **Advantage Dynamics Monitoring**: Implement detailed tracking of advantage distributions, KL divergence evolution, and policy entropy during GRPO training to empirically validate the claimed relationship between sparse rewards and policy collapse in smaller models.
