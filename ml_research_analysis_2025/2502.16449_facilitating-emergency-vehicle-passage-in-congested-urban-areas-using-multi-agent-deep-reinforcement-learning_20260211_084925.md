## Executive Summary
This dissertation advances emergency vehicle passage in congested urban areas through three key contributions. First, EMVLight, a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, integrates EMV routing with traffic signal pre-emption, achieving 42.6% faster EMV travel times and 23.5% improvement for other vehicles. Second, the Dynamic Queue-Jump Lane system uses Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization for coordinated lane-clearing in mixed autonomous and human-driven traffic, reducing EMV travel times by 40%. Third, an equity study of NYC Emergency Medical Services revealed disparities across boroughs: Staten Island faces delays due to sparse signalized intersections, while Manhattan struggles with congestion. Solutions include optimized EMS stations and improved intersection designs. These contributions enhance EMV mobility and emergency service equity, offering insights for policymakers and urban planners to develop safer, more efficient transportation systems.

## Method Summary
The dissertation employs Multi-Agent Advantage Actor-Critic (MA2C) with Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) for EMVLight, using three types of intersection agents (Normal, Primary Pre-emption, Secondary Pre-emption) with LSTM-based policy and value networks. Traffic flow is modeled using the Sublane Model in SUMO with a Blue Light Device for emergency lane formation. The reward function uses a modified "Pressure" metric based on lane density differences plus pre-emption penalties. For MAPPO-DQJL, the method uses transformer-based policy/value networks with GAE advantage estimation to coordinate CAVs for dynamic queue-jump lane formation in mixed traffic. The accessibility analysis uses an intersection-aware model that adjusts travel time by intersection density delays and maps population to network nodes via Voronoi polygons to identify vulnerable EMS regions.

## Key Results
- EMVLight achieves 42.6% faster EMV travel times and 23.5% improvement for other vehicles in simulation
- Dynamic Queue-Jump Lane system reduces EMV travel times by 40% in mixed autonomous and human-driven traffic
- NYC accessibility study reveals Staten Island delays due to sparse signalized intersections while Manhattan struggles with congestion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: EMVLight — Decentralized Joint Routing and Signal Pre-emption
EMVLight reduces travel time through coordinated, real-time routing and signal pre-emption where intersection agents learn local traffic control while sharing observations and policy fingerprints to stabilize training. The decentralized routing heuristic incrementally updates EMV routes using neighbor ETAs without full recomputation.

### Mechanism 2: MAPPO-DQJL — Coordinated Lane Clearing in Mixed Traffic
Dynamic Queue-Jump Lanes reduce EMV passage time by coordinating CAVs through shared policy training with centralized critic and decentralized execution. A transformer-based policy network processes local observations including neighboring vehicle states, balancing global EMV passage time with local efficiency.

### Mechanism 3: Intersection-Aware Accessibility — Quantifying Vulnerable Regions
The accessibility model reveals EMS disparities by adjusting travel time with intersection density delays (α·I(v)) and mapping population to network nodes via Voronoi polygons. EMVLight's potential impact is estimated by reducing α based on simulated intersection delay reductions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with CTDE:** Needed to enable multiple agents to learn coordinated policies with global information during training but local execution. Quick check: Can you explain why a centralized critic with decentralized actors helps stability in non-stationary multi-agent environments?

- **Traffic Signal Control and Pressure-Based Rewards:** Required to understand EMVLight's reward design using intersection "pressure" (vehicle density imbalance) to encourage efficient flow. Quick check: How does minimizing pressure differ from minimizing queue length in traffic signal control?

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Transformer Policy Networks:** Essential for MAPPO-DQJL's stable policy updates and processing variable-length, partially observed traffic states. Quick check: Why is PPO's clipped objective beneficial for avoiding large policy updates in a safety-critical domain like EMV passage?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** SUMO simulation backend with Sublane Model and Blue Light Device -> MA2C or MAPPO RL framework with policy/value networks -> Decentralized routing module (Algorithm 1) -> Evaluation pipeline with SUMO-RL interface

- **Critical path:** 1) Define network and traffic flows 2) Configure agent types 3) Train via centralized simulation rollouts 4) Evaluate on held-out scenarios

- **Design tradeoffs:** Centralized vs. decentralized execution balances coordination during training with scalable deployment; pressure vs. queue-based rewards affects flow smoothness; parameter sharing among CAVs accelerates learning but may reduce specialization; emergency capacity modeling enables emergency lanes but assumes driver compliance

- **Failure signatures:** Unstable training indicates insufficient fingerprinting or inadequate neighbor observation; EMV route oscillation suggests aggressive ETA updates or non-converged agents; high non-EMV lane changes with EMV improvement indicates imbalanced reward (α too high); accessibility model false positives/negatives suggest mis-calibrated α or poor intersection-delay correlation

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Ablate agent types by removing secondary pre-emption agents and compare TEMV/Tavg to full EMVLight on Hangzhou4×4 2) Vary CAV penetration at 25%, 50%, 75% on 3-lane road with 15 veh/lane/min 3) Calibrate intersection delay factor α by comparing simulated travel times to 911 End-to-End data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can reward functions be designed to navigate multiple emergency vehicles simultaneously within the same traffic network without causing conflicts? The current framework focuses on single EMV, and multiple priority vehicles create conflicting optimization goals and ethical dilemmas regarding right-of-way.

- **Open Question 2:** How can network-level signal control (EMVLight) and intra-link lane clearing (MAPPO-DQJL) be integrated into a unified system? The two frameworks currently operate independently at different granularities, and aligning global network efficiency with local lane-level optimization remains unexplored.

- **Open Question 3:** How can safe reinforcement learning frameworks be developed to minimize negative impacts during the training phase in real-world traffic? The dissertation relies on simulations, and transferring policies to reality requires mitigating risks inherent in trial-and-error iterations.

## Limitations

- Performance in highly dynamic, unpredictable urban environments with varying driver behaviors and infrastructure constraints is unknown
- Assumption that CAVs can reliably coordinate via V2X communication may not hold with communication delays or failures
- Intersection-aware accessibility model's reliance on static demographic and infrastructure data may not capture temporal variations

## Confidence

- EMVLight travel time improvements (42.6%): **High** - well-supported by multiple simulation scenarios and benchmarks
- MAPPO-DQJL lane-clearing effectiveness (40% reduction): **Medium** - strong simulation results but limited validation of mixed traffic behavior models
- NYC accessibility disparities findings: **Medium** - comprehensive data analysis but model assumptions about intersection delays may not fully reflect reality

## Next Checks

1. Test EMVLight's coordination stability under communication delays and packet loss in simulation to assess robustness to real-world V2I/V2V constraints
2. Validate the HDV behavior model in MAPPO-DQJL against empirical traffic camera data of actual EMV passage events in mixed traffic
3. Compare the accessibility model's intersection delay factor (α) calibration against high-resolution traffic signal timing data from NYC DOT to improve vulnerability prediction accuracy
