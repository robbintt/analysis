# GraphProp: Training the Graph Foundation Models using Graph Properties

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.04594
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04594
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: GraphProp achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization for graph-level tasks, especially on graphs without node attributes

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes GraphProp, a two-phase training method for graph foundation models (GFMs) that achieves strong generalization across domains for graph-level tasks. The approach first trains a structural GFM by predicting graph invariants (properties dependent only on abstract graph structure like Fiedler value and Lovász number) to capture cross-domain consistent information. Then, it uses these structural representations as positional encodings to train a comprehensive GFM with in-context learning using domain-specific node features and labels. GraphProp significantly outperforms competitors in supervised and few-shot learning scenarios, particularly on graphs without node attributes, making it the first GFM to achieve both structural and node feature generalization across domains.

## Method Summary
GraphProp employs a two-phase training strategy for graph foundation models. First, it trains a structural GFM to predict K graph invariant properties from a positional encoding B = UΛ^(1/2) derived from Laplacian eigendecomposition. This captures domain-invariant structural information. Second, it trains a comprehensive GFM using in-context learning, where node features are augmented with the structural representations from phase one and unified using a large language model. The method uses 10-fold cross-validation with 80/10/10 splits and evaluates on both graphs with and without node features across multiple domains.

## Key Results
- GraphProp significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain graph classification tasks
- Achieves superior performance on graphs without node attributes by leveraging structural information
- Demonstrates strong generalization across diverse graph domains (biological, social, molecular)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GraphProp works by first extracting domain-invariant structural information through graph invariants, which are properties dependent only on abstract graph structure rather than domain-specific features. This structural representation captures fundamental graph characteristics that are consistent across domains. The two-phase training approach ensures the model learns both structural patterns and domain-specific knowledge, with in-context learning allowing adaptation to new domains without extensive retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- Laplacian eigendecomposition: Needed to create reversible positional encodings that capture graph structure; quick check: verify A can be reconstructed from B
- Graph invariants: Needed as domain-agnostic training targets; quick check: ensure properties are normalized to zero mean and unit variance
- In-context learning: Needed for domain adaptation without retraining; quick check: verify context window construction preserves relevant information

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Graph -> Laplacian -> Positional Encoding B -> Structural GFM -> Graph Properties -> Structural Representations Z -> LLM Unified Features -> Comprehensive GFM -> Classification

**Critical Path:** B = UΛ^(1/2) → Structural GFM training → Z extraction → LLM feature unification → Comprehensive GFM training → Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Structural vs. node feature focus; computational cost of property computation vs. generalization benefits; choice of graph invariants vs. learnable positional encodings

**Failure Signatures:** Non-reversible positional encoding preventing property prediction; scale mismatch in graph properties causing training instability; poor cross-domain performance indicating inadequate structural representation

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate positional encoding reversibility by reconstructing adjacency matrix from B
2. Train structural GFM on single domain and test property prediction accuracy
3. Compare comprehensive GFM performance with and without structural representations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for large node-level tasks and massive graph datasets
- Dependency on specific graph properties that may not capture all relevant structural information
- Computational overhead of computing multiple graph invariants during training

## Confidence
High confidence in core methodology and experimental results demonstrating cross-domain generalization. Medium confidence in theoretical analysis of graph discrimination capability. Low confidence in reproducibility due to missing architectural and hyperparameter details.

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the positional encoding B = UΛ^(1/2) by verifying that the original adjacency matrix A can be accurately reconstructed from B
2. Conduct ablation studies on the comprehensive GFM phase by training with and without the structural representations
3. Test scalability by evaluating GraphProp on larger graph datasets and node-level tasks to identify practical limits
