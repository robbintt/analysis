# ALERT Open Dataset and Input-Size-Agnostic Vision Transformer for Driver Activity Recognition using IR-UWB

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.12206
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12206
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 22.68% accuracy improvement over existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based driver activity recognition

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses distracted driving detection using IR-UWB radar by tackling two key challenges: the absence of large-scale real-world UWB datasets and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers to non-standard UWB data dimensions. The authors present the ALERT dataset containing 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions, and propose ISA-ViT, an input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer framework. By preserving pre-trained positional embeddings and implementing a domain fusion strategy combining range- and frequency-domain features, the method achieves 76.28% classification accuracy, representing a 22.68% improvement over existing approaches.

## Method Summary
The method involves preprocessing UWB radar data by extending the shorter dimension to match the longer one, then dividing into 14×14 patches to preserve pre-trained ViT positional embeddings. A domain fusion strategy combines range-time and frequency-time features using a learnable balancing factor β. The model is trained on the ALERT dataset using leave-one-out cross-validation across unseen drivers, with 30 epochs, Adam optimizer, and learning rates between 0.00001-0.0001.

## Key Results
- ISA-ViT achieves 76.28% classification accuracy on ALERT dataset
- Distracted driving detection accuracy reaches 97.35%
- 22.68% accuracy improvement over existing ViT-based UWB approaches
- Domain fusion with learned β improves F1 scores across all activities, with largest gains on Panel (+13.69), Drink (+10.50), and Relax (+9.82)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Preserving the pre-trained 14×14 positional embedding sequence yields better UWB classification than interpolating or truncating PEVs. ISA-ViT resizes UWB data by extending the shorter dimension to match the longer one (lossless), then calculates patch size k = ceil(longer_side/14) to produce exactly 14×14 patches. This preserves the original spatial relationships encoded in ImageNet-pretrained PEVs without degradation. Core assumption: The spatial structure learned by ViT on natural images transfers meaningfully to radar spectrograms when patch topology is preserved. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors, ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches." [Section V-A, Table V] Shows adjusting patch shape (43.55%/53.92%) and manipulating PEVs (36.74%/49.25%) significantly underperform vs. ISA-ViT's approach (66.29%/65.39%) on ALERT/RaDA datasets.

### Mechanism 2
Fusing range-time and frequency-time domains with a learnable balancing factor improves DAR accuracy over single-domain approaches. Range data captures spatial position/movement magnitude; frequency data (via FFT) captures velocity/Doppler shift patterns. An adjusting factor β weights frequency features before concatenation, preventing one domain from dominating. The paper reports 66.29% (range-only), 65.45% (frequency-only), 74.02% (equal-weight fusion) → 76.28% (learned β fusion). Core assumption: Range and frequency domains provide complementary, non-redundant discriminative information for driver activities. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance" [Section VI-E-3, Fig. 16, Table VIII] Shows F1 score improvements across all 7 activities after domain fusion.

### Mechanism 3
Real-driving data collection exposes model to environmental factors (vibration, multipath, interference) that simulation cannot replicate, improving generalization. ALERT dataset captures 10,220 samples across urban (12km) and campus (6km) routes with varied road surfaces (asphalt, cobblestone, dirt, speed bumps) and vehicle conditions (stop-and-go, slopes). This forces models to learn robust features invariant to confounding motion signatures. Core assumption: Models trained on simulated data fail to generalize because simulation omits critical real-world noise sources. Evidence anchors: [Section I, Related Works] Cites Morales-Alvarez et al.: accuracy dropped from 85.7% → 46.6% when transferring from simulation to real-world. [Section III-E, Table IV] Compares ALERT (real driving, lenient restrictions, 5s windows) vs. RaDA (simulated, moderate restrictions, 1s windows).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Vision Transformer Patch Embeddings**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how ViT converts 2D inputs to token sequences is prerequisite to grasping why input-size mismatch breaks pretrained PEV alignment.
  - Quick check question: Given a 224×224 image divided into 16×16 patches, how many tokens does ViT produce, and what spatial information does each PEV encode?

- **Concept: IR-UWB Radar Signal Structure (Range-Time vs. Frequency-Time)**
  - Why needed here: The paper manipulates UWB data into two representations; understanding what each domain captures is essential for interpreting domain fusion benefits.
  - Quick check question: If a driver raises their hand, which domain (range-time or frequency-time) would show the primary signature, and what would distinguish this from a head nod?

- **Concept: Transfer Learning with Pretrained Positional Embeddings**
  - Why needed here: ISA-ViT's core contribution is adapting pretrained weights to non-standard input sizes; understanding PEV role clarifies why naive resizing fails.
  - Quick check question: Why does interpolating a 14×14 PEV grid to match a 20×20 patch sequence potentially corrupt spatial relationships?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw UWB Signal → [FFT Branch + Range Branch] → ISA-ViT (range) + Lightweight Feature Extractor (freq) → Feature Concatenation with β-weighting → Classifier (3 FC layers)

- **Critical path:** The patch-size calculation (Algorithm 1, lines 2-3) determines k and `side_extended`. Error here cascades to patch embedding dimension mismatch with pretrained weights.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Early fusion (2-channel input to single ViT) vs. Late fusion (dual ViTs): Paper chose early fusion for 2× compute reduction, accepting ~3% accuracy drop.
  - Observation window: 5s recommended; 1-2s insufficient for activity discrimination, 10s increases latency.
  - Cropping range bins: Removing >2.7m multipath improved most algorithms except ResNet.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy ~36-52%: Likely using manipulated PEVs (interpolation/truncation) instead of preserved 14×14 sequence.
  - Large precision/recall variance across activities: May indicate insufficient domain fusion or β not trained.
  - Training loss diverges: Check kernel weight resizing (line 4 of Algorithm 1) - averaging RGB channels then interpolating/pooling to k×k.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline sanity check:** Run standard ViT with simple resize (up/down-sample to 224×224) on ALERT. Expect ~52% per Table V. Confirm data pipeline works before implementing ISA-ViT.
  2. **ISA-ViT component validation:** Ablate domain fusion by training range-only ISA-ViT. Should achieve ~66%. Then add frequency with β=1.0 (equal weight) → ~74%. Finally train β → ~76%.
  3. **Cross-dataset transfer:** Train ISA-ViT on ALERT, evaluate on RaDA (and vice versa) to assess whether real-driving training transfers to simulated environments. Paper implies unidirectional transfer (real→sim) should work better than sim→real.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The lightweight feature extractor architecture for frequency-domain processing is not specified, creating ambiguity in the domain fusion implementation
- Initial value and optimization strategy for the adjusting factor β remain undefined
- No validation of ISA-ViT's generalization to radar modalities beyond IR-UWB (e.g., FMCW, mmWave)

## Confidence

- **High**: Real-world data collection benefits (supported by cross-dataset performance drops in prior work)
- **Medium**: Domain fusion mechanism (empirical improvements shown but theoretical justification limited)
- **Low**: PEV preservation mechanism (no ablation on radar-specific PEV structure, relies on ImageNet transfer assumptions)

## Next Checks

1. Implement frequency-domain feature extractor with multiple architectures (CNN, transformer) to quantify sensitivity
2. Conduct ablation study comparing PEV preservation vs. interpolation under varying aspect ratios
3. Test ISA-ViT on a second UWB dataset (if available) or simulated data with known ground truth to validate radar-specific adaptations
