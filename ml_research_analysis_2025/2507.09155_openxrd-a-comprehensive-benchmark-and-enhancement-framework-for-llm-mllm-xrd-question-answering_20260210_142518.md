# OPENXRD: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Enhancement Framework for LLM/MLLM XRD Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.09155
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09155
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Expert-reviewed supporting materials improve mid-capacity models' XRD QA accuracy by up to 11.5 percentage points

## Executive Summary
OPENXRD presents an open-book question-answering framework for crystallography that leverages GPT-4.5-generated supporting materials to enhance the performance of smaller models on XRD questions. The framework evaluates 14 vision-language models on a dataset of 217 expert-level XRD questions in both closed-book and open-book settings. The key finding demonstrates that mid-capacity models (7B-34B parameters) show the largest improvement from external knowledge, gaining up to 11.5 percentage points with expert-reviewed materials compared to 6% with AI-generated content alone. This approach suggests cost-effective deployment strategies for domain-specific applications by using larger models to generate knowledge scaffolding that smaller models can leverage.

## Method Summary
The framework evaluates vision-language models on XRD question answering using a retrieve-then-read prompting architecture. The 217-question benchmark contains expert-curated multiple-choice questions with options, correct answers, explanations, and subtask labels. For open-book evaluation, supporting materials are generated by GPT-4.5 (0.5-1 page per question) and optionally reviewed by crystallography PhD experts. The fusion module FORMAT(x_s, x_q, x_o) concatenates supporting material, question, and options with delimiters. Zero-shot inference is performed on target models, and accuracy is computed with subtask-level breakdown. The framework compares AI-generated versus expert-reviewed materials and examines model capacity effects on knowledge utilization.

## Key Results
- Mid-capacity models (7B-34B parameters) gain the most from external knowledge, with LLaVA-v1.6-mistral-7B improving by 5.35% and LLaVA-v1.6-34B by 6.89%
- Expert-reviewed supporting materials provide 6-8 percentage points more improvement than AI-generated materials across 13/14 models tested
- Larger models (GPT-4.5, O3-mini) show minimal or negative gains from open-book materials, suggesting internal knowledge redundancy or context sensitivity
- Mathematical reasoning subtasks (Bragg's Law, structure factor calculations) remain at 0% accuracy even with expert-reviewed materials

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Model Knowledge Distillation via Textual Context
Large models generate domain-specific supporting materials that fill pretraining gaps in smaller models. This works when the knowledge gap is retrieval-based rather than reasoning-capacity-based. The mechanism breaks when tasks require multi-step mathematical derivation that textual context cannot scaffold.

### Mechanism 2: Capacity-Dependent Context Utilization (Inverted-U Pattern)
Mid-capacity models have sufficient parametric capacity to integrate new context while lacking sufficient pretraining coverage in crystallography. Both smaller and larger models benefit less - smaller models lack reasoning bandwidth, larger models are near ceiling performance and may be confused by redundant context.

### Mechanism 3: Expert Refinement of AI-Generated Explanations
Human experts correct terminology errors, add missing contextual details, remove tangential information, and emphasize practical implications in AI-generated materials. This transforms generic explanations into pedagogically coherent guidance that systematically improves model performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Open-book vs. closed-book evaluation paradigm**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework depends on comparing model performance with and without external context
  - Quick check question: If a model achieves 70% closed-book and 85% open-book accuracy, what does the 15-point gap represent?

- **Concept: Retrieve-then-read prompting architecture**
  - Why needed here: OPENXRD uses a specific fusion module where supporting material precedes the question in the prompt
  - Quick check question: In the FORMAT(x_s, x_q, x_o) function, what happens to x_s in closed-book mode?

- **Concept: Bragg's Law and X-ray diffraction fundamentals**
  - Why needed here: The benchmark questions assume familiarity with crystallography concepts
  - Quick check question: Why would a path difference of nλ between scattered rays lead to constructive interference rather than cancellation?

## Architecture Onboarding
