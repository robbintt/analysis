# Enhancing Multimodal Protein Function Prediction Through Dual-Branch Dynamic Selection with Reconstructive Pre-Training

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.04040
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04040
- **Reference count**: 15
- **Primary result**: DSRPGO outperforms SOTA unimodal and multimodal baselines, improving Fmax by 1.9–8.6% across GO categories

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses protein function prediction by integrating multimodal protein features (sequences, structures, interactions, attributes) which are complex and interconnected. To tackle this, the authors propose DSRPGO, a method using reconstructive pre-training and dynamic selection. Reconstructive pre-training learns fine-grained features from each modality (spatial structures via BiMamba and sequences via ProtT5-based transformers), capturing low-level semantic details. Bidirectional Interaction Modules (BInM) enable cross-modal fusion, and a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) adaptively chooses optimal features for each protein function prediction task. Experiments on human datasets show DSRPGO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines, improving Fmax by 1.9–8.6% across biological process, molecular function, and cellular component categories. This demonstrates the value of multimodal integration and dynamic feature selection for accurate protein function prediction.

## Method Summary
DSRPGO integrates multimodal protein features through a two-stage approach: reconstructive pre-training followed by fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, PSSI (BiMamba encoder-decoder for spatial data) and PSeI (Transformer encoder-decoder for sequences) are trained to reconstruct inputs using BCE loss, learning fine-grained features from each modality. In the fine-tuning stage, DSRPGO uses frozen ProtT5 and pre-trained encoders. Features pass through Multimodal Shared Learning (MSL) and Interactive (MIL, using BInM cross-attention) branches. A Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) routes features via Mixture-of-Experts using asymmetric loss. The model is trained separately for three GO categories (BPO, MFO, CCO) with specific dataset splits.

## Key Results
- DSRPGO improves Fmax by 1.9–8.6% compared to SOTA unimodal and multimodal baselines
- Achieves superior performance across all three GO categories: Biological Process (BPO), Molecular Function (MFO), and Cellular Component (CCO)
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal integration and dynamic feature selection for protein function prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by learning comprehensive representations from multiple protein data modalities simultaneously. Reconstructive pre-training captures fine-grained semantic details from each modality before task-specific fine-tuning. The dual-branch architecture with bidirectional interaction modules enables effective cross-modal fusion, while the dynamic selection module adaptively routes the most relevant features for each prediction task, preventing feature redundancy and enhancing prediction accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **BiMamba for spatial data**: Bidirectional selective scan mechanism needed for efficient processing of sparse PPI adjacency matrices; quick check: verify bidirectional scan correctly handles matrix sparsity
- **ProtT5 sequence embeddings**: Pre-trained transformer model provides rich sequence representations; quick check: confirm ProtT5 embeddings capture known functional motifs
- **BInM cross-attention**: Bidirectional interaction module enables mutual information exchange between modalities; quick check: validate attention weights show meaningful modality interactions
- **Dynamic Selection Module**: Mixture-of-Experts routing prevents feature redundancy; quick check: monitor expert selection distribution for diversity
- **Asymmetric loss**: Handles class imbalance in protein function prediction; quick check: verify loss weights correctly emphasize rare functional terms
- **Reconstruction pre-training**: Enables learning of modality-specific features before task adaptation; quick check: confirm reconstruction loss decreases during pre-training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: ProtT5 -> MSL Branch, PSeI -> MIL Branch; PSSI -> MIL Branch; BInM Cross-Attention -> DSM -> Output

**Critical Path**: Input modalities → Pre-trained encoders → Dual branches (MSL + MIL) → Dynamic Selection → Prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**: The dual-branch structure separates shared and interactive feature learning, but increases model complexity. BiMamba offers efficient spatial processing compared to GNNs but requires careful parameter initialization. The DSM provides adaptive feature selection but risks expert collapse without proper regularization.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- MoE collapse: DSM routes all inputs to single expert
- Pre-training instability: BiMamba fails to converge on sparse inputs
- Cross-modal interference: BInM modules produce noisy interactions
- Class imbalance: Asymmetric loss fails to properly weight rare functions

**First Experiments**:
1. Test BiMamba reconstruction on synthetic sparse adjacency matrices
2. Validate DSM routing with synthetic expert outputs
3. Verify asymmetric loss implementation on small protein subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does DSRPGO generalize to non-human organisms with distinct PPI network topologies or sparser functional annotations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.1 (Experimental Setup) explicitly states that the fine-tuning and pre-training datasets are constructed solely from human proteins (UniProt and STRING databases), with no validation on other species.
- Why unresolved: The model's efficacy is established only for human biology; it is unknown if the reconstructive pre-training and dynamic selection mechanisms transfer to organisms with different genomic complexities or less available interaction data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking results on standard non-human datasets (e.g., Yeast or Mouse) showing comparable Fmax and AUPR scores against species-specific baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust is the Dual-Branch architecture when specific modalities, such as subcellular location or PPI connections, are missing for a target protein?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The methodology (Section 2.1) assumes the simultaneous availability of sequences, PPI networks, subcellular locations, and domains, but real-world application often involves incomplete records.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include ablation studies or simulations where entire modalities are dropped for specific inference samples to test the model's fault tolerance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics (Fmax) from experiments where specific input channels (e.g., PPI adjacency matrices) are randomly masked or zeroed out during testing.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the BiMamba-based spatial feature extraction provide superior robustness against false-positive interactions in PPI networks compared to the GNN baselines criticized in the introduction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The introduction explicitly states that noise in PPI networks generated by high-throughput techniques poses risks and that GNNs may amplify noise. The paper introduces BiMamba as an alternative but does not quantify its noise resilience.
- Why unresolved: While BiMamba avoids message passing, it still processes the adjacency matrix; the model's sensitivity to spurious edges compared to Graph Neural Networks remains unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis where varying levels of synthetic noise (random edges) are injected into the PPI network to observe the degradation rate of DSRPGO versus GNN-based baselines.

## Limitations
- Unspecified implementation details including exact model hyperparameters (hidden dimension $D$, number of cross-attention heads, number of DSM experts)
- Specific data splits and protein IDs for pre-training and fine-tuning sets not provided
- Performance claims rely on proprietary pretrained models (ProtT5) and external databases (STRING, UniProt) that may evolve

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core architectural innovations (BiMamba for spatial data, dual-branch structure with BInM modules, DSM routing mechanism) are clearly described and theoretically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Overall approach and reported performance improvements (1.9-8.6% Fmax gains) are plausible given the architectural advantages described
- **Low Confidence**: Specific performance comparisons to baselines cannot be independently verified without access to exact same data splits, pretrained model checkpoints, and implementation details of competing methods

## Next Checks
1. Verify the BiMamba implementation by testing reconstruction accuracy on synthetic sparse adjacency matrices before integrating into full pipeline
2. Test the DSM routing mechanism with synthetic expert outputs to confirm it learns diverse, task-appropriate feature selection rather than collapsing to single expert
3. Validate the asymmetric loss implementation on a small protein subset to ensure proper handling of class imbalance before full-scale training
