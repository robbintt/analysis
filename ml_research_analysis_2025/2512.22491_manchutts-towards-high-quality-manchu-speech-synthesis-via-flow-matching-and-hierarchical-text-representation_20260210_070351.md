# ManchuTTS: Towards High-Quality Manchu Speech Synthesis via Flow Matching and Hierarchical Text Representation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.22491
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22491
- **Reference count:** 13
- **Primary result:** Achieves MOS 4.52 with 5.2h training data on endangered Manchu language

## Executive Summary
ManchuTTS addresses the challenge of high-quality speech synthesis for endangered Manchu language, which suffers from severe data scarcity and complex agglutinative morphology. The system introduces a three-tier hierarchical text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) combined with cross-modal attention for multi-granular alignment, integrated into a conditional flow matching framework. The method also employs a hierarchical contrastive alignment loss to improve acoustic-linguistic consistency. Experiments on a newly constructed 6.24-hour Manchu dataset show ManchuTTS significantly outperforms baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal training data.

## Method Summary
ManchuTTS processes Manchu text through a three-tier hierarchical encoder that decomposes linguistic features into phoneme, syllable, and prosodic levels. The phoneme level captures vowel harmony and coarticulation, the syllable level decomposes complex affixes into root+suffix structures, and the prosodic level encodes sentence-level intonation. These features are processed through an 8-layer Diffusion Transformer with a three-stage cross-modal attention mechanism (Self → Cross → Self) for implicit alignment. The model uses conditional flow matching with a hierarchical contrastive alignment loss to ensure acoustic-linguistic correspondence across all three levels. Training employs AdamW optimizer with cosine learning rate decay over 300K steps on 8× RTX 4090 GPUs.

## Key Results
- Achieves MOS 4.52±0.11 on Manchu test set with only 5.2 hours of training data
- Outperforms all baseline systems by large margins across multiple metrics
- Ablation studies show 31% improvement in agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy and 27% improvement in prosodic naturalness
- Demonstrates computational efficiency enabling real-time synthesis on edge devices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Linguistic Conditioning for Agglutinative Phonology
The three-tier decomposition specifically addresses segment distortion and alignment errors in agglutinative languages by providing explicit structural guidance. By conditioning on root+suffix boundaries at the syllable level, the model reduces the learning burden of inferring morphological boundaries from scarce audio data alone. This prevents phoneme "smearing" between word stems and suffixes that occurs with flat text encoders.

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Modal Hierarchical Attention (Implicit Alignment)
Replacing explicit duration predictors with a three-stage attention mechanism (Self → Cross → Self) improves robustness in low-resource settings. This allows the model to find multi-granular alignment implicitly without relying on external aligners that have 25-35% error rates in low-resource Manchu. The cross-attention forces text features to query acoustic features, establishing bidirectional information exchange.

### Mechanism 3: Hierarchical Contrastive Alignment Loss
Enforcing consistency between audio and text at all three hierarchy levels via contrastive loss prevents fluent but hallucinated speech. By maximizing mutual information between positive pairs and pushing apart negatives at phoneme, syllable, and prosodic levels, the model ensures generated audio matches specific linguistic tiers. This addresses the insufficiency of standard reconstruction losses for fine-grained linguistic adherence in low-data regimes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Flow Matching (Conditional ODEs)**
  - Why needed: Required to understand the "efficient, non-autoregressive generation" claims and the linear path formulation xt = (1−t)x0 + tx1
  - Quick check: How does the vector field ut(xt|x1) = x1 - x0 differ from the score-based denoising objective in standard Diffusion models?

- **Concept: Agglutinative Morphology**
  - Why needed: The entire architectural premise rests on Manchu being agglutinative; without this understanding, the three-tier hierarchy seems arbitrary
  - Quick check: Why would a standard character-level encoder struggle with a long Manchu word like "šunggi-ra" compared to a hierarchical [root+suffix] representation?

- **Concept: Self-Attention vs. Cross-Attention**
  - Why needed: The paper proposes a specific "Self → Cross → Self" block; understanding how Cross-Attention uses a different modality as context is vital for implementing the alignment mechanism
  - Quick check: In Layer 2 of the proposed attention mechanism, which modality provides the Query and which provides the Key/Value for the text feature update?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Text → IPA Phonemes → Hierarchical Encoder (cphon, csyll, cpros) → 8-layer DiT Backbone with 3-layer Cross-Modal Attention → Conditional Flow Matching → Mel-Spectrogram → Vocoder → Audio
- **Critical path:** The Hierarchical Text Encoder and Cross-Modal Attention. If the text encoder fails to segment root from suffix, the conditioning c is corrupted and the contrastive loss penalizes incorrectly.
- **Design tradeoffs:** 
  - Implicit vs. Explicit Alignment: Abandoned external aligners to avoid high error rates, trading deterministic duration control for learned flexibility (risks "stress drift")
  - Complexity vs. Data: Hierarchical structure adds parameters to low-resource task, mitigated by inductive bias but requiring careful regularization (dropout 0.1-0.15)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Segment Distortion: Incorrect phoneme transitions, specifically "smearing" of sounds between word stems and suffixes (indicates csyll failure)
  - Rigid Rhythm / Stress Drift: Flat intonation or misplaced emphasis in long sentences (indicates cpros insufficient or prosodic contrastive loss too weak)
  - Hallucination: Fluent speech that doesn't match text (indicates LHCA is not sufficiently weighting negative samples)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation of Hierarchy: Train with only phoneme features (Config A). Verify if AWPA drops to ~70% to confirm syllable layer is primary driver of intelligibility.
  2. Data Scaling: Train on subsets (1h, 2h, 5.2h). Determine minimum data threshold where Cross-Modal Attention stops converging (detect "rigid rhythm" or alignment collapse).
  3. Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual: Test trained Manchu model on related language (Ewenki) without retraining. Check if hierarchical structure generalizes or creates Manchu-specific bias.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can ManchuTTS be adapted to maintain high synthesis quality when processing diverse Manchu dialects or non-studio (noisy) recording environments?
- **Basis:** The Conclusion states the model is "still limited to studio recorded speech and its accuracy decreases in dialect variations," explicitly listing expanding data coverage to dialects and improving robustness via "noise perception training" as future work.
- **Why unresolved:** Current study relies on high-quality audio with strict SNR filtering (≥25 dB) and doesn't test performance on dialectal variances or real-world acoustic conditions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation results (MOS, WER) from models trained or tested on multi-dialect corpora and "wild" audio samples with background noise.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What specific mechanisms are required to eliminate the "occasional stress drift" and limited emotional expression observed in long-form synthesized sentences?
- **Basis:** Subjective Listening Tests section notes qualitative feedback regarding "limited emotional expression in long sentences and occasional stress drift," identifying these as key areas for future improvement.
- **Why unresolved:** While three-tier hierarchy improves general prosodic naturalness, inference mechanism struggles to maintain consistent suprasegmental control over longer time horizons.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies testing modified attention windows or explicit emotion/stress tokens in hierarchical representation, resulting in statistically significant improvements.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the hierarchical cross-modal attention mechanism be effectively scaled to extremely low-resource scenarios (<1 hour) where the current 5.2-hour requirement is unavailable?
- **Basis:** Authors note previous low-resource methods "assume a minimum data threshold unavailable for truly endangered languages," yet their solution required 5.2 hours to reach saturation, leaving sub-1-hour performance gap unexplored.
- **Why unresolved:** Data scale sensitivity analysis only descends to 1 hour (MOS drops to 3.22), leaving efficacy of hierarchical guidance in "extreme" low-resource regimes (minutes of data) unverified.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments utilizing few-shot adaptation techniques (<10 minutes of target data) on ManchuTTS framework to determine if hierarchical priors compensate for data sparsity below 1-hour threshold.

## Limitations
- Dataset availability: Paper claims newly constructed 6.24-hour Manchu dataset will be made available but provides no URL or repository information, blocking faithful reproduction
- Implementation details missing: Exact syllable/prosodic feature extraction pipeline, negative sampling strategy for hierarchical contrastive loss, and vocoder choice for mel-to-audio conversion not specified
- Computational efficiency claims lack empirical validation: Real-time synthesis on edge devices claimed but no latency measurements or model size metrics provided

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core architectural components (hierarchical text representation, conditional flow matching, cross-modal attention) are technically sound and well-grounded in literature
- **Medium Confidence:** Quantitative results (MOS 4.52, AWPA improvements) are likely valid given ablation study design, but reproducibility is limited by missing dataset and implementation details
- **Low Confidence:** Computational efficiency claims (edge device performance) and generalization to related languages lack supporting data; hierarchical contrastive loss effectiveness asserted but not thoroughly analyzed

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Accessibility Verification:** Attempt to locate or reconstruct the claimed 6.24-hour Manchu dataset. If unavailable, create synthetic Manchu-like agglutinative language corpus with IPA annotations and test whether hierarchical architecture provides claimed AWPA improvements over flat encoders.

2. **Ablation Study Replication:** Implement three configurations (phoneme-only, syllable-level, full hierarchical) and measure not just AWPA but also training stability metrics (gradient norms, attention entropy) to determine if hierarchical model genuinely learns better alignments or simply memorizes with more parameters.

3. **Cross-Lingual Generalization Test:** Train model on small corpus (1-2 hours) of related agglutinative language (e.g., Turkish or Finnish) and evaluate whether hierarchical structure transfers without catastrophic forgetting, or if it encodes Manchu-specific phonological rules that harm generalization.
