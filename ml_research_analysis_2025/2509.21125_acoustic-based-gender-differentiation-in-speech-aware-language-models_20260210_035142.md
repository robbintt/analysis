- Systematic analysis reveals male-oriented acoustic bias in SpeechLMs across stereotypical contexts while showing gender-agnostic responses in contextually dependent questions

## Executive Summary
This study systematically analyzed acoustic-based gender differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) using a dataset of 9,208 speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent, Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. Results revealed a paradoxical pattern where all models consistently exhibited male-oriented responses in Gender-Stereotypical questions (statistically significant p < 0.001), while showing gender-agnostic responses in Gender-Dependent questions where gender consideration would be contextually appropriate. Through experiments with neutral response options, gender-neutralized speech inputs, and comparisons with backbone LLMs, the study confirmed that these biases primarily stem from male-oriented acoustic tokens generated by the Whisper encoder. This indicates current SpeechLMs prioritize general fairness principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more sophisticated techniques to properly utilize gender information in speech technology.

## Method Summary
The study constructed a 9,208-sample dataset using Kokoro-TTS to synthesize speech from 1,151 questions across three categories: Gender-Independent (402 questions), Gender-Stereotypical (449 questions), and Gender-Dependent (300 questions). Each question was spoken by 8 speakers (4 male, 4 female) with gender validated using wav2vec 2.0 and ECAPA-TDNN classifiers (>99% accuracy). Inference was performed on LLaMA-Omni models (8B, 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B) and compared against backbone LLMs (LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5 series) using deterministic decoding with forced-choice prompts. Four metrics were computed: Gender Response Overlap (J), Gender Preference (∆), Backbone Influence (κ), and Neutral Response Rate (ν).

## Key Results
- All SpeechLMs exhibited statistically significant male-oriented bias (p < 0.001) in Gender-Stereotypical questions across all model sizes
- Gender-agnostic responses in Gender-Dependent questions where gender consideration would be contextually appropriate
- Male-oriented bias persisted even after gender-neutralized voice input, suggesting encoder-level origin
- Larger models showed weaker male-orientation, indicating capacity-constrained bias mitigation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Whisper Encoder Generates Male-Oriented Acoustic Representations
Whisper encodes speech into acoustic tokens that carry systematic male-orientation, propagating bias through SpeechLM architectures regardless of the backbone LLM's inherent bias patterns. The acoustic token representations systematically favor male interpretations during tokenization.

### Mechanism 2: Contextual Appropriateness Signal Failure
Current SpeechLMs cannot distinguish between contexts where gender consideration is appropriate bias versus inappropriate discrimination. This results in over-application of male-bias in stereotypical contexts and under-application in biologically-dependent contexts due to insufficient training signal or architectural mechanisms.

### Mechanism 3: Insufficient Acoustic-Content Disentanglement
SpeechLMs cannot effectively separate acoustic gender cues from linguistic content, leading to either inappropriate gender-agnostic responses or stereotypical bias. The bias originates at the acoustic encoding stage rather than being a high-level reasoning failure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) Architecture**: Understanding how acoustic tokens interface with text-based LLMs is essential for diagnosing where bias enters the system.
  - Quick check: Can you explain how a Whisper encoder's output becomes input for a backbone LLM like LLaMA or Qwen?

- **Contextual Fairness vs. Contextual Appropriateness**: This paper's core contribution is distinguishing between eliminating bias (fairness) and knowing when gender information should be used (appropriateness).
  - Quick check: For a query like "What are my sex chromosomes?", should a SpeechLM consider the speaker's perceived gender? How about "Recommend a movie"?

- **Forced-Choice Evaluation Paradigm**: The experimental design uses binary/ternary choices to measure bias quantitatively; understanding its limitations is critical for interpreting results.
  - Quick check: What are the tradeoffs of using forced-choice response formats versus open-ended responses when evaluating gender bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Speech input -> Whisper Encoder -> Acoustic Tokens -> Adapter/Projection -> Backbone LLM -> Response Generator

- **Critical path**: Speech input → Whisper encoder → male-oriented acoustic tokens → adapter → LLM embedding space → backbone LLM → biased response generation. The backbone LLM's capacity to counteract Whisper's bias scales with parameter size.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Freezing Whisper preserves ASR capability but prevents bias correction at the encoder level; forced-choice enables quantitative measurement but may mask model uncertainty; embedding-level neutralization did not eliminate bias, suggesting upstream encoding issues.

- **Failure signatures**: Male-oriented responses in stereotypical questions (p < 0.001); gender-agnostic responses in dependent questions; high Jaccard overlap (>0.9) between male/female voice responses; smaller models (0.5B-1.5B) show stronger male-oriented bias than larger models (7B-14B).

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce baseline metrics across all models and categories; 2) Ablate speech encoder by comparing Whisper-based outputs to text-only backbone LLMs; 3) Test alternative encoders (HuBERT, wav2vec 2.0) to determine Whisper-specific bias.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- The attribution of bias to Whisper encoder is correlative rather than mechanistic, lacking direct validation through encoder ablation studies
- Gender-neutralization experiments did not eliminate bias, but implementation details and targeting accuracy are not fully specified
- TTS-based speech synthesis may not capture all acoustic gender cues present in natural speech, limiting generalizability

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Paradoxical pattern findings are well-supported by statistical analysis across multiple models and dataset sizes
- **Medium confidence**: Attribution of bias primarily to Whisper encoder is plausible but lacks direct mechanistic validation
- **Medium confidence**: Capacity-constrained bias mitigation claim is supported by observed trends but requires more systematic scaling analysis

## Next Checks

1. Implement controlled experiments replacing Whisper with alternative speech encoders (HuBERT, wav2vec 2.0) to determine whether male-oriented bias is Whisper-specific or a broader acoustic encoding phenomenon.

2. Probe Whisper's acoustic token representations directly to identify systematic gender encoding differences using representational similarity analysis or targeted feature extraction.

3. Replicate key experiments using naturally recorded speech samples from diverse speakers to verify TTS-based findings generalize to real-world acoustic variations and speaker characteristics.
