# Learning What Matters: Causal Time Series Modeling for Arctic Sea Ice Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.09128
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09128
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Causality-guided deep learning improves Arctic Sea Ice Extent forecasting accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a causality-guided deep learning framework for Arctic Sea Ice Extent (SIE) forecasting that integrates Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ algorithms to identify key ocean-atmospheric drivers. The method uses these causally identified features as inputs to a hybrid GRU-LSTM neural network, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy compared to correlation-based models across 1–6 month lead times. The framework shows higher R² scores and lower RMSE and MAE values while enhancing model interpretability and robustness through focus on direct causal drivers.

## Method Summary
The framework combines causal discovery with deep learning for Arctic Sea Ice Extent forecasting. MVGC and PCMCI+ algorithms identify causally influential predictors from 10 ocean-atmospheric variables, which are then used as inputs to a hybrid GRU-LSTM neural network. The model is trained on 43 years of daily and monthly Arctic climate data, using a 21-timestep look-back window. Four model variants are evaluated: DL_vanilla (all variables), DL_GC (MVGC-selected), DL_PCMCI+ (PCMCI+-selected), and DL_DPCMCI+ (daily PCMCI+ features on monthly data). Training uses Adam optimizer, MSE loss, and early stopping on validation data.

## Key Results
- Causality-guided models achieve higher R² scores and lower RMSE/MAE than correlation-based models across 1–6 month lead times
- DL_PCMCI+ and DL_DPCMCI+ variants outperform vanilla deep learning approaches
- Daily-to-monthly feature transfer (DL_DPCMCI+) preserves high-resolution causal signals and improves performance at longer lead times

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Filtering inputs via causal discovery reduces noise from spurious correlations common in high-dimensional climate data
- Mechanism: MVGC and PCMCI+ identify conditional independence, pruning variables that correlate with SIE but don't causally drive it
- Core assumption: Causal structures identified on 1979–2021 data remain valid during forecast period
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "identifies causally influential predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary features"; MVGC revealed all variables except SST exert significant causal influence
- Break condition: Regime shifts where non-causal variables become primary drivers

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hybrid GRU-LSTM architecture captures multi-scale temporal dependencies more effectively than homogeneous architectures
- Mechanism: GRU layers handle short-range dynamics efficiently while LSTM layers retain information over extended time intervals for seasonal ice trends
- Core assumption: Hybrid complexity is necessary; simpler architectures might suffice with optimized look-back windows
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.2 states "hybrid GRU-LSTM models leverage speed and efficiency of GRUs with memory retention capabilities of LSTMs"; architecture specified as GRU followed by LSTM
- Break condition: Insufficient look-back window (21 timesteps) causing LSTM to suffer from vanishing gradients

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Causal features identified at high temporal resolution improve generalization for lower resolution long-range forecasting
- Mechanism: Fine-grained daily data reveals specific causal links that persist when aggregated to monthly scales
- Core assumption: Causal strength identified in daily fluctuations scales linearly when temporally aggregated
- Evidence anchors: Section 5 states DL_DPCMCI+ "utilized PCMCI+ features discovered from daily data but repurposed for monthly forecasting... effectively preserving high-resolution causal signals"; Table 4 shows DL_DPCMCI+ outperforming DL_PCMCI+ at 2, 5, and 6 month lead times
- Break condition: High computational cost of running PCMCI+ on daily data becomes prohibitive

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Granger Causality vs. Correlation**
  - Why needed here: Core premise is that correlation fails to distinguish drivers from confounders
  - Quick check question: If variable A and B are both caused by hidden variable C, would a correlation test catch this vs. a Granger test?

- Concept: **PCMCI+ (PC algorithm with MCI tests)**
  - Why needed here: Standard Granger causality struggles with autocorrelation common in climate data
  - Quick check question: Why is handling autocorrelation critical when analyzing daily ice extent data?

- Concept: **RNN Architectures (GRU vs LSTM)**
  - Why needed here: Model relies on specific sequence (GRU -> LSTM)
  - Quick check question: In proposed hybrid stack, which layer handles "long-term trends" vs "short-range dynamics"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (10 vars) -> Causal Filter (MVGC/PCMCI+) -> Encoder (21-timestep lookback) -> GRU (64 units) -> LSTM (128 units) -> Dense (64) -> Output (1)

- Critical path: Causal Feature Identification is the differentiator; passing all 10 variables to "Causal DL" model breaks experimental design

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Selectivity: MVGC keeps more features (robust but noisier) vs. PCMCI+ (fewer features, cleaner but risks missing weak drivers)
  - Resolution: Daily data captures transient causal links but is computationally heavy; monthly is faster but may miss dynamics

- Failure signatures:
  - Vanilla DL Overfitting: High performance at 1-month lead time, rapid degradation at 5-6 months
  - PCMCI+ Underfitting: Too sparse causal graph lacks sufficient context for complex interactions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline Reconstruction: Train DL_vanilla (all 10 vars) vs. DL_PCMCI+ (3 vars: Longwave radiation, SST, SIE) on monthly data
  2. Lag Sensitivity Analysis: Vary tau (max lag) in PCMCI+ to see if identified causal drivers change
  3. Ablation Study: Test DL_PCMCI+ performance using only direct causal parents vs. including parents-of-parents

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can the framework be extended to account for spatial heterogeneity and multi-scale interactions in the Arctic climate system?
- Can algorithmic enhancements reduce the computational overhead of PCMCI+ and MVGC for operational forecasting?
- Do adaptive strategies for lag selection improve robustness of causal discovery compared to fixed maximum lags?

## Limitations

- Causal discovery assumes stationary relationships over 43-year period, which may not hold during climate regime shifts
- High computational cost of PCMCI+ on daily data limits practical scalability
- Resolution transfer mechanism lacks explicit corpus validation

## Confidence

- Prediction accuracy improvements: High confidence (systematic comparison across four model variants and multiple lead times)
- Architectural effectiveness: Medium confidence (no alternative architectures benchmarked)
- Interpretability benefits: Medium confidence (primarily qualitative, pending systematic ablation studies)
- Daily-to-monthly resolution transfer: Low confidence (lacks explicit corpus validation)

## Next Checks

1. Test causal feature stability across sliding time windows to assess stationarity assumptions
2. Implement cross-validation with climate regime-based splits to evaluate robustness
3. Compare causal feature sets against domain expert-identified physical drivers of SIE dynamics
