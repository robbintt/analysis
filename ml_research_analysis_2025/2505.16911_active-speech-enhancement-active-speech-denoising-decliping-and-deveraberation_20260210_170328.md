# Active Speech Enhancement: Active Speech Denoising Decliping and Deveraberation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.16911
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16911
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ASE-TM achieves PESQ 2.98 on VoiceBank-DEMAND, outperforming traditional ANC approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Active Speech Enhancement (ASE), a paradigm that extends beyond traditional active noise cancellation by actively shaping speech signals through constructive interference. The proposed ASE-TM architecture combines Transformer and Mamba layers for efficient long-range modeling of speech enhancement tasks including denoising, dereverberation, and declipping. A specialized hybrid loss function balances noise suppression with speech enrichment. Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline methods, with ASE-TM achieving state-of-the-art results on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset while maintaining low latency suitable for real-time applications.

## Method Summary
The ASE-TM architecture processes audio through STFT-based complex spectrogram input, encoding into a dense representation before passing through 8 TFMamba blocks (4 before and 4 after a central Attention layer). The model generates an anti-signal that, when propagated through a simulated secondary acoustic path and added to the disturbed signal, produces enhanced speech. Training uses a hybrid loss combining L1/L2 time-domain and magnitude losses with phase-specific and metric-adversarial components. The model is trained separately for denoising, dereverberation, and declipping tasks using simulated Room Impulse Responses for acoustic path modeling.

## Key Results
- ASE-TM achieves PESQ 2.98 on VoiceBank-DEMAND test set, significantly outperforming traditional ANC approaches
- The model demonstrates strong performance under varying acoustic conditions including different reverberation times and loudspeaker nonlinearities
- ASE-TM maintains low latency (500 future frames prediction) while achieving high enhancement quality
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the TFMamba-Attention hybrid architecture and modified hybrid loss function

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Constructive Interference Paradigm
The active addition paradigm enables signal enrichment beyond pure suppression. Unlike ANC's objective to minimize error, ASE constructs an enhanced signal by adding a learned anti-signal to the disturbed input, allowing frequency-specific amplification of speech components. The secondary path and loudspeaker nonlinearity are modeled during training to enable accurate anti-signal synthesis at inference.

### Mechanism 2: Efficient Long-Range Modeling
The interleaved TFMamba-Attention-TFMamba architecture captures both local spectral structure and long-range temporal dependencies efficiently. Mamba2 blocks process time and frequency dimensions separately with linear complexity, while a central Multi-Head Attention layer provides global context after dimensionality reduction. This hybrid approach achieves faster convergence than pure Mamba or attention architectures.

### Mechanism 3: Robust Hybrid Loss Function
The combination of L1 and L2 losses in both time and magnitude domains improves robustness to outliers while maintaining spectral fidelity. This hybrid approach balances fine detail preservation with global coherence, augmented by phase-specific and metric-adversarial losses. The weighting hyperparameters generalize across different enhancement tasks without requiring task-specific retuning.

## Foundational Learning

- **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Complex Spectrogram Processing:** Essential for understanding input dimensions and latency constraints. *Quick check:* With 16 kHz audio and hop length 100 samples, frame rate is 160 Hz with minimum algorithmic latency of 2.5 ms.

- **State Space Models (Mamba/Mamba2) vs. Self-Attention:** Critical for understanding the computational tradeoffs that justify the hybrid architecture. *Quick check:* Mamba2 is preferred for 2-second audio segments at 100 frames/second because it offers linear complexity versus quadratic for self-attention.

- **Acoustic Transfer Functions (Primary/Secondary Path):** Fundamental for understanding how the anti-signal propagates and interferes with the disturbed signal. *Quick check:* With Tp − Ts ≈ 4.3 ms, the model must predict 500 future frames (31.25 ms) to maintain causality.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw waveform → STFT → [magnitude, phase] → Dense Encoder → 4 TFMamba blocks → Attention (with reduction/expansion) → 4 TFMamba blocks → Magnitude/Phase Decoders → Anti-signal synthesis → Secondary path convolution → Final summation

- **Critical path:** STFT input → Dense Encoder → TFMamba blocks → Attention (with reduction/expansion) → TFMamba blocks → Dual decoders → Anti-signal synthesis → Secondary path convolution → Final summation. The attention block's dimensionality reduction/expansion is the narrowest point.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Mamba2 vs. Mamba1 shows Mamba2 + modified loss yields largest gain. Attention placement in center with 4 TFMamba blocks before/after was chosen based on faster convergence. Future-frame prediction of 500 frames (31.25 ms) maintains causality with minimal PESQ degradation.

- **Failure signatures:** Low PESQ but high STOI indicates phase reconstruction failure. Good denoising but poor dereverberation suggests overfitting to noise profiles. Performance collapse under strong nonlinearity shows PESQ drops from 2.98 to 2.74.

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline reproduction on VoiceBank-DEMAND targeting PESQ ≥ 2.90. 2) Ablation of loss components by removing L1 to verify slower convergence. 3) Causality stress test by reducing future-frame prediction from 500 to 250 frames.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1: Unified Multi-Task Model
Can a single ASE-TM model effectively handle denoising, dereverberation, and declipping simultaneously without separate training instances? The current approach requires training distinct models for each task, limiting deployment efficiency. Evidence would be a multi-task trained model achieving comparable metrics to specialized models.

### Open Question 2: Real-World Hardware Deployment
How does ASE-TM perform on physical hardware with real acoustic transfer functions versus simulated RIRs? The paper relies entirely on simulations, but real deployment introduces complex non-linearities and time-varying path characteristics. Evidence would be hardware-in-the-loop evaluation with measured primary and secondary paths.

### Open Question 3: Secondary Path Robustness
Is the method robust to significant estimation errors or fluctuations in the secondary path S(z) during operation? While robustness to T60 and nonlinearity is tested, the paper assumes fixed, known linear impulse response. Evidence would be ablation studies showing performance degradation under perturbed S(z) conditions.

## Limitations

- The specific weighting hyperparameters (γ1–γ6) for the hybrid loss function are not reported, making direct replication challenging
- The model requires separate training instances for each enhancement task (denoising, dereverberation, declipping), limiting deployment versatility
- Performance relies on simulated acoustic paths rather than real-world measurements, raising questions about hardware deployment robustness

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The constructive interference paradigm and mathematical formulation are well-defined and fundamentally different from ANC
- **Medium Confidence:** The TFMamba-Attention hybrid architecture's effectiveness is supported by ablation studies, though component contributions are not fully isolated
- **Medium Confidence:** Performance claims are reported with proper methodology, but the impact of loss hyperparameter choices remains uncertain

## Next Checks

1. **Loss Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary γ1–γ6 weights and measure PESQ/STOI impact to identify critical components and optimal balance

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization:** Evaluate ASE-TM on unseen datasets (DNS Challenge, REVERB) to test robustness beyond VoiceBank-DEMAND conditions

3. **Real-Time Hardware Validation:** Implement ASE-TM on embedded DSP hardware to measure actual latency and CPU usage under causal constraints (500-frame look-ahead)
