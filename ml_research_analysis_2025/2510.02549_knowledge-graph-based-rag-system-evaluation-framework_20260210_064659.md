# Knowledge-Graph Based RAG System Evaluation Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02549
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02549
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Introduces KG-based metrics for RAG evaluation that improve sensitivity to semantic alignment

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a knowledge graph (KG)-based evaluation framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Building on RAGAS, it introduces graph algorithms for multi-hop reasoning and community clustering to enhance evaluation granularity. The framework constructs a unified KG from input and context, enabling semantic traversal and community detection to assess factual alignment. Experiments demonstrate moderate-to-high correlation with existing metrics and human annotations, with improved discriminative power for entity-level relevance tasks.

## Method Summary
The framework extracts subject-relation-object triplets from both input (question/answer) and context using an LLM. These triplets form nodes in a unified graph, with edges added between semantically similar entities (cosine similarity > 0.7) using an embedding model. Two evaluation metrics are implemented: Multi-Hop Semantic Matching uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find low-cost paths from input to context entities, while Community-Based Semantic Overlap applies Louvain community detection to measure overlap between input and context clusters. The system correlates these scores with RAGAS and human annotations.

## Key Results
- KG-based metrics show moderate-to-high correlation with RAGAS and human annotations
- Multi-Hop Semantic Matching excels at entity-level relevance detection
- Community-Based Semantic Overlap better captures complex relationships
- Framework demonstrates improved discriminative power for factual alignment
- Computational costs create scalability challenges for real-world deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Structuring text into a unified Knowledge Graph with cross-modal semantic edges enables detection of factual alignment missed by atomic overlap methods. The LLM extracts entity-relation triplets from input and context, then links nodes via "SIMILAR" edges when embedding cosine similarity exceeds a threshold (τ), creating traversable semantic bridges between query and knowledge spaces. This assumes high semantic similarity between entity labels implies valid relationships for factual verification.

### Mechanism 2
Factual consistency is measured by the cost of traversing from input entities to context entities using Multi-Hop Semantic Matching. A weighted Dijkstra's algorithm checks if input nodes can reach context nodes with path cost below threshold (δ), with scores based on the proportion of successful traversals. This treats factual verification as a connectivity problem where valid chains exist when semantic distance is low.

### Mechanism 3
Global semantic coherence is better evaluated by community structure overlap than individual entity matches. The Community-Based Semantic Overlap method partitions the unified graph using Louvain algorithm and scores based on percentage of communities containing nodes from both input and context subgraphs. This assumes semantically related input and context will cluster into the same modularity classes regardless of direct edge connectivity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Atomic Fact Decomposition**: Breaking text into atomic triplets (subject, relation, object) is essential for KG construction. Without this decomposition, the evaluation graph cannot be built.
  - Quick check: Can you identify the atomic triplets in "The cat sat on the mat because it was tired"?

- **Modularity and Community Detection (Louvain)**: Understanding how the algorithm groups nodes based on edge density is crucial for Mechanism 3, where communities represent clusters of tightly coupled concepts.
  - Quick check: If a graph has two disconnected clusters of nodes, how many communities would a modularity-based algorithm ideally detect?

- **Weighted Graph Traversal (Dijkstra)**: Mechanism 2 requires understanding that edge weights represent semantic distance (cost), not just presence of a path. The algorithm seeks low-cost paths, not any path.
  - Quick check: In this system, does a high similarity score result in a high edge weight or a high edge cost?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** LLM Evaluator -> Embedder -> Graph Engine -> Scorer
- **Critical path:** The Triplet Extraction phase. If the LLM fails to extract high-quality relations, subsequent graph algorithms operate on noisy or empty structures, rendering Dijkstra/Louvain analysis meaningless.
- **Design tradeoffs:** 
  - Granularity vs. Scalability: High computational costs in graph construction hinder efficiency and scaling to real-world settings
  - Specificity vs. Robustness: Hyperparameters like similarity threshold (τ=0.7) and path cost (δ=0.5) require tuning—strict thresholds increase precision but may miss paraphrased facts
- **Failure signatures:** 
  - Low Context Relevancy Correlation: Retrieved context often contains broader entities than specific queries, dispersing community structure
  - Scalability Wall: Performance degrades with long contexts due to quadratic pairwise similarity checks and graph construction overhead
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sensitivity Validation: Run evaluation on ground-truth vs. deliberately incorrect answers to verify Multi-Hop scores drop close to 0 for wrong answers
  2. Correlation Benchmark: Calculate Spearman/Pearson correlation between KG-based scores and RAGAS on 10% domain data to validate "moderate to high" correlation
  3. Threshold Tuning: Vary similarity threshold τ to observe impact on edge density and score distribution, calibrating semantic bridge strictness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can computational cost of graph construction be reduced to enable efficient scaling to large real-world contexts?
- Does extending semantic similarity scoring from individual entity level to triplet level improve evaluation granularity?
- Can the framework be effectively adapted to evaluate negative rejection capabilities and long-context accuracy?

## Limitations
- High computational costs of graph construction create scalability challenges for real-world deployment
- Threshold-based edge creation introduces brittleness—system may miss valid semantic connections with different terminology
- Correlation with human annotations shows variability across different RAG tasks, suggesting sensitivity depends on context structure and entity density

## Confidence
- Multi-Hop Semantic Matching effectiveness: **High** (validated through sensitivity analysis and correlation with RAGAS)
- Community-Based Semantic Overlap utility: **Medium** (shows promise but weaker correlation in certain tasks)
- Scalability for production use: **Low** (explicitly acknowledged computational burden)

## Next Checks
1. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary similarity threshold τ and path cost δ across multiple datasets to identify optimal operating points and failure modes
2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test:** Evaluate framework on non-English text and specialized domains (medical, legal) to assess embedding model limitations and triplet extraction quality
3. **Human Annotation Validation:** Replicate human evaluation correlation study on independently annotated dataset to verify claimed 0.7+ Spearman correlation under different annotator pools
