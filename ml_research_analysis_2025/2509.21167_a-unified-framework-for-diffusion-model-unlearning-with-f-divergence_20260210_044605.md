# A Unified Framework for Diffusion Model Unlearning with f-Divergence

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.21167
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21167
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: f-divergence minimization framework unifies diffusion model unlearning, outperforming MSE in concept removal while preserving image quality

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a unified framework for unlearning specific concepts from text-to-image diffusion models using f-divergence minimization. The authors demonstrate that mean squared error (MSE), the standard approach for diffusion model unlearning, is a special case of f-divergence. By leveraging various f-divergences (KL, Hellinger, χ²), the framework provides a principled approach to shifting model outputs from target concepts to anchor concepts while maintaining output quality for non-erased concepts. The method is evaluated on Stable Diffusion, showing superior performance compared to standard MSE in both concept removal effectiveness and quality preservation.

## Method Summary
The framework unifies diffusion model unlearning through f-divergence minimization, extending beyond the traditional MSE approach. It formulates unlearning as minimizing the f-divergence between the original model's output distribution and a modified distribution that shifts from the target concept to an anchor concept. The method supports both closed-form expressions for certain f-divergences (KL, Hellinger) and variational formulations for more general cases. During fine-tuning, the model learns to generate images that minimize the f-divergence with respect to the anchor concept while maintaining fidelity to the prompt. The framework naturally scales to multi-concept erasure and provides flexibility in choosing the optimal divergence for specific unlearning scenarios.

## Key Results
- Hellinger divergence achieves the best balance between effective concept removal and output quality preservation compared to other f-divergences
- The proposed f-divergence-based approach outperforms standard MSE in both concept erasure effectiveness and quality preservation for non-erased concepts
- Variational formulations show higher removal effectiveness but produce less realistic outputs compared to closed-form solutions
- The framework successfully scales to multi-concept erasure scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating unlearning as a distribution alignment problem rather than a simple regression task. By minimizing f-divergence between the original and target distributions, the model learns to suppress the target concept while preserving the overall generation quality. Different f-divergences have distinct gradient behaviors that affect convergence and stability. The closed-form expressions provide stable gradients for certain divergences, while variational formulations offer more aggressive optimization at the cost of output realism. The anchor concept approach ensures that the model maintains meaningful generation capabilities while removing unwanted concepts.

## Foundational Learning
- **f-divergence theory**: Mathematical framework for measuring distribution differences; needed to unify various divergence measures under a single optimization objective; quick check: verify KL, Hellinger, and χ² divergences satisfy f-divergence properties
- **Diffusion model reverse process**: Understanding how diffusion models generate images through iterative denoising; needed to properly formulate the unlearning objective in the latent space; quick check: confirm the variance schedule and noise schedule are properly incorporated
- **Variational inference**: Technique for approximating intractable distributions; needed for f-divergences without closed-form expressions; quick check: validate the ELBO formulation matches the theoretical bounds
- **Distribution alignment**: Concept of shifting probability distributions; needed to understand how concepts are removed by shifting from target to anchor concepts; quick check: visualize the distribution shift in latent space
- **Conditional generation**: How diffusion models condition on text prompts; needed to ensure unlearning preserves prompt fidelity; quick check: test prompt preservation across different concept removal scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text Prompt → Conditioned Diffusion Model → Latent Space → f-Divergence Loss → Parameter Updates → Output Image

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves computing the f-divergence between the original and target distributions in latent space, backpropagating through the diffusion model, and updating parameters to minimize the divergence while maintaining prompt fidelity.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Closed-form expressions offer stable gradients and better output quality but are limited to specific f-divergences. Variational formulations provide flexibility for any f-divergence but may produce less realistic outputs and require careful hyperparameter tuning. The choice of anchor concept affects both removal effectiveness and output quality.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor concept removal with excessive quality loss suggests the divergence is too aggressive. Ineffective removal with minimal quality impact indicates the divergence is too conservative. Mode collapse or unrealistic outputs suggest the variational formulation parameters need adjustment.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test KL divergence unlearning on a single concept (e.g., removing "soldiers" from military scenes)
2. Compare Hellinger vs MSE unlearning on the same concept to validate performance improvements
3. Evaluate multi-concept erasure by removing both "soldiers" and "weapons" simultaneously

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions for future research.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation is limited to Stable Diffusion, requiring testing on other diffusion architectures for generalizability
- The trade-off between concept removal and quality preservation needs more extensive ablation studies across different concept types
- Variational formulations, while more effective at removal, produce less realistic outputs limiting practical deployment
- Closed-form expressions are limited to specific f-divergences, constraining framework flexibility

## Confidence

**High**: Theoretical unification of MSE and f-divergence in diffusion unlearning; mathematical analysis of gradient behaviors and convergence properties

**Medium**: Experimental results showing Hellinger divergence's superior performance; claims about multi-concept erasure scalability

**Low**: Generalization to other diffusion models beyond Stable Diffusion; long-term stability of unlearned concepts

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional diffusion models (e.g., DALL-E, Imagen) to assess cross-model generalization
2. Conduct longitudinal studies to evaluate the persistence of unlearned concepts over extended training periods
3. Perform user studies to quantify the perceptual quality trade-offs between different f-divergences in practical applications
