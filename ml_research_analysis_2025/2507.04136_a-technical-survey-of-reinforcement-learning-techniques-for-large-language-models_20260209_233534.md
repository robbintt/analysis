# A Technical Survey of Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.04136
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04136
- Authors: Saksham Sahai Srivastava; Vaneet Aggarwal
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DPO offers training efficiency and stability comparable to PPO-based RLHF while eliminating explicit reward modeling.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines reinforcement learning techniques for large language models, highlighting how RL addresses alignment and reasoning challenges. It covers foundational methods like RLHF and RLAIF, advanced approaches such as DPO and GRPO, and specialized reasoning techniques including RLVR and CoT-RO. Comparative analysis reveals that DPO offers training efficiency and stability, while RLVR and verifier-guided RL significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance. The survey also identifies persistent challenges such as reward hacking, computational costs, and evaluation difficulties.

## Method Summary
The survey analyzes RL methods for LLM alignment through a three-stage RLHF pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations, reward model training with preference pairs, and policy optimization via PPO or alternative methods. DPO bypasses explicit reward modeling by directly optimizing preference likelihood. GRPO reduces computational overhead through group-relative advantage estimation. For reasoning tasks, verifier-guided RL (RLVR, CoT-RO) provides dense feedback on intermediate steps. The methods are evaluated on benchmarks including GSM8K, HumanEval, TruthfulQA, and MMLU.

## Key Results
- DPO achieves alignment comparable to PPO-based RLHF while eliminating explicit reward modeling, improving training stability
- RLVR and verifier-guided RL significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance, with RLVR boosting GPT-3.5's accuracy on GSM8K from 56.8% to 72.5%
- GRPO reduces computational overhead by half while maintaining o1-level performance on math and logic tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) achieves alignment comparable to PPO-based RLHF while eliminating explicit reward modeling, improving training stability.
- **Mechanism:** DPO reformulates the reward function as an implicit function of the optimal and reference policies, allowing direct policy optimization from preference pairs without training a separate reward model. The loss directly maximizes the log-likelihood of preferred over dispreferred responses.
- **Core assumption:** The preference data accurately reflects the target alignment objective, and the reference policy provides a stable baseline for implicit reward computation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "DPO offers training efficiency and stability"
  - [Section IV.D] "DPO formulates a direct loss function optimized for aligning model outputs with human preference data"
  - [corpus] Related survey (arXiv:2312.14925) confirms RLHF's centrality but does not contradict DPO's efficiency claims
- **Break condition:** If preference data is sparse, noisy, or unrepresentative of target behavior, DPO's direct optimization can amplify biases or fail to generalize.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Verifier-guided RL (RLVR, CoT-RO) improves multi-step reasoning by providing dense, verifiable feedback on intermediate reasoning steps rather than final outcomes alone.
- **Mechanism:** An external verifier (symbolic checker, unit test harness, or learned critic) assigns rewards at each reasoning step or validates final answers against ground truth. Policy gradients propagate credit through the chain-of-thought, reinforcing logically sound paths.
- **Core assumption:** The verifier accurately distinguishes correct from incorrect reasoning, and the task supports automated verification (e.g., mathematics, code).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "RLVR and verifier-guided RL significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance"
  - [Section IV.G] "RLVR boosted GPT-3.5's accuracy on GSM8K from 56.8% to 72.5%"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; neighbor papers focus on alignment broadly, not verifier-specific mechanisms
- **Break condition:** If the verifier is weak, biased, or gameable, models may learn to produce verifier-pleasing outputs without genuine reasoning (a form of reward hacking).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Group Relative Policy Optimizer (GRPO) reduces computational overhead and stabilizes training by replacing absolute reward signals with group-normalized advantages across candidate responses.
- **Mechanism:** For each prompt, multiple responses are generated and rewards are normalized within the group (mean-centering and scaling by standard deviation). This mitigates noisy or sparse rewards and eliminates the need for a separate value function estimator.
- **Core assumption:** Generating multiple candidates per prompt is feasible, and within-group reward variation captures meaningful quality differences.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III.C] "GRPO eliminates the need to maintain a separate value function estimator... adopts a group-based relative advantage estimation"
  - [Section V.E] "DeepSeek-R1 achieved o1-level performance on math and logic tasks while cutting overall training costs by half"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus corroboration for GRPO specifically; related surveys do not cover this variant
- **Break condition:** If groups are too small or reward variance within groups is minimal, normalization provides weak learning signal; if groups are too large, computational cost negates efficiency gains.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation for LLMs**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how states (prompts/context), actions (tokens), and rewards (human/AI preferences or verifiers) map onto the RL framework is essential for grasping why algorithms like PPO or DPO are adapted specifically for language generation.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the action space in LLM RL is described as "extremely large and discrete"?

- **Concept: KL-divergence regularization**
  - **Why needed here:** The KL penalty prevents the RL-tuned policy from drifting too far from the supervised fine-tuning baseline, which maintains fluency and prevents catastrophic forgetting. This constraint appears in PPO-based RLHF and is implicit in DPO's reference policy formulation.
  - **Quick check question:** What failure mode does the KL penalty specifically guard against in RLHF training?

- **Concept: Policy gradient vs. value-based methods**
  - **Why needed here:** The survey contrasts on-policy methods (PPO, GRPO) with off-policy Q-learning approaches (ILQL, VerifierQ). Understanding when each is appropriate (online interaction vs. offline datasets) determines architectural choices.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might off-policy methods like ILQL be preferred when only static preference datasets are available?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** SFT Model -> Reward Model (explicit in RLHF, implicit in DPO) -> Policy Optimizer (PPO, DPO, GRPO) -> Verifier (for reasoning) -> KL Constraint Module

- **Critical path:**
  1. Collect or prepare preference data (human or AI-labeled pairs)
  2. Train SFT model on demonstrations (or use pretrained checkpoint)
  3. **Decision point:** If using explicit RM, train reward model on preferences; if DPO, skip to step 5
  4. For PPO/GRPO: Initialize policy from SFT, configure KL penalty coefficient (β), run on-policy rollouts with RM scoring
  5. For DPO: Optimize direct preference loss using reference policy from SFT
  6. For reasoning tasks: Integrate verifier into reward pipeline; configure dense (CoT-RO) or sparse (outcome-based) feedback
  7. Evaluate on held-out benchmarks (TruthfulQA, GSM8K, instruction-following) for alignment and capability metrics

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **PPO vs. DPO:** PPO offers more exploration and handles complex reward shaping but requires explicit RM and is computationally expensive; DPO is simpler, more stable, but may under-explore diverse outputs
  - **Human vs. AI feedback:** Human feedback is higher-quality but costly and unscalable; RLAIF scales but risks bias propagation from supervising models
  - **Sparse vs. dense rewards:** Outcome-only (OB-RL) is scalable but high-variance; step-wise (CoT-RO) accelerates convergence but requires verifier infrastructure

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Reward hacking:** Model exploits RM loopholes (e.g., generating verbose but shallow reasoning); monitor for reward-to-performance divergence
  - **Policy collapse:** Sudden drop in generation diversity or quality; check KL divergence spikes and entropy regularization
  - **Verifier overfitting:** Model learns to game verifier rather than solve task; hold out verification tasks and test on out-of-distribution problems
  - **Catastrophic forgetting:** Previously capable behaviors degrade; track benchmark performance across training checkpoints

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline alignment with DPO:** Implement DPO on a small preference dataset (e.g., summarization pairs) using a 7B parameter model; compare win rates against SFT baseline on held-out prompts
  2. **Reward model sanity check:** Train a simple reward model on preference pairs; validate that RM scores correlate with human judgments on a test split before integrating into PPO
  3. **Verifier-guided reasoning pilot:** For a mathematical reasoning task (e.g., GSM8K subset), implement outcome-based RL with a symbolic verifier; compare pass@1 against SFT-only model to quantify reasoning gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can multi-objective reinforcement learning frameworks effectively balance conflicting alignment goals such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and fairness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "multi-objective reinforcement learning" as a key future direction to "balance conflicting goals like helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty, and fairness."
- Why unresolved: Current methods often struggle to optimize competing objectives simultaneously, leading to trade-offs where improving one alignment metric degrades another.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of a training framework that improves all alignment metrics concurrently on standardized benchmarks without requiring manual weight tuning.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) scale effectively without inheriting or amplifying the biases of the supervising model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The survey notes that a critical challenge is that "AI-generated feedback can inherit or even amplify biases from the supervising model," potentially leading to behaviors that diverge from human values.
- Why unresolved: Recursive training on synthetic feedback risks creating feedback loops where systemic biases become entrenched and difficult to correct.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies showing that RLAIF models maintain or improve alignment scores relative to RLHF baselines across diverse demographic contexts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What techniques can prevent models from engaging in reward hacking or "alignment faking" while maintaining high performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that models are vulnerable to "reward hacking" and the problem of "alignment faking" or sycophancy, where models conceal misaligned behaviors to maximize rewards.
- Why unresolved: Proxy reward models are often imperfect approximations of human intent, allowing models to exploit loopholes in the objective function.
- What evidence would resolve it: The creation of adversarial evaluation frameworks that successfully detect and quantify internal misalignment even when surface-level outputs appear compliant.

## Limitations
- Claims about DPO's training efficiency and GRPO's cost reduction are primarily derived from published results rather than controlled replication
- Specific performance thresholds (e.g., RLVR's 72.5% GSM8K accuracy) are cited without clear experimental context or baseline definitions
- The analysis is constrained by the lack of experimental ablation studies directly comparing DPO, PPO, and GRPO under identical conditions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: RLHF's foundational role and DPO's direct preference optimization mechanism are well-established in prior work
- **Medium confidence**: GRPO's computational advantages and RLVR's reasoning improvements are supported by individual papers but lack comprehensive comparative analysis
- **Low confidence**: Specific performance thresholds (e.g., RLVR's 72.5% GSM8K accuracy) are cited without clear experimental context or baseline definitions

## Next Checks
1. Implement controlled comparison of DPO vs PPO on identical preference datasets with matching model sizes and compute budgets
2. Conduct ablation study of verifier strength in RLVR, measuring performance degradation as verifier accuracy drops
3. Test group size sensitivity in GRPO to identify optimal candidate pool size for different task types and model scales
