- Primary result: A living manifesto promoting ethical AI practices, equitable access, and interdisciplinary collaboration at the intersection of AI and the Arts.

## Executive Summary
The XAIxArts Manifesto addresses the challenge of making AI models understandable beyond technocentric explanations by integrating artistic practices and perspectives into explainable AI (XAI). Through a collaborative co-creation process involving workshops, discussions, and public feedback, the manifesto emphasizes themes such as empowerment, inclusion, fairness, artistic practice, hacking, glitches, and openness. The resulting living document promotes ethical AI practices, equitable access, and interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering innovation and understanding at the intersection of AI and the Arts. The manifesto invites ongoing community engagement to refine and expand its vision.

## Method Summary
The core method involves co-creating a manifesto through collaborative workshops and discussions. The process began with a World Café style workshop where 39 participants (researchers and creative practitioners) rotated through four tables, each addressing one of the four core manifesto themes. Outputs were captured in a structured visual mind map using Excalidraw. Authors then synthesized this visual data into a text document over two days, followed by a public poster session for annotations and online collaborative editing (Miro) to refine the manifesto. The final product is a living document that continues to evolve through community engagement.

## Key Results
- A living manifesto structured around four core themes: Empowerment, Inclusion, and Fairness; Valuing Artistic Practice; Hacking and Glitches; and Openness.
- The manifesto promotes ethical AI practices, equitable access, and interdisciplinary collaboration at the intersection of AI and the Arts.
- The document invites ongoing community engagement to refine and expand its vision, fostering innovation and understanding.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by shifting the focus of XAI from technical metrics to human-centered, artistic perspectives. By involving diverse stakeholders (artists, researchers, practitioners) in a collaborative co-creation process, the manifesto captures insights that technocentric approaches might overlook. The World Café format encourages cross-pollination of ideas across disciplines, while the "living" aspect ensures continuous evolution and relevance. This mechanism leverages the unique ability of artistic practices to reveal AI's inner workings through alternative lenses such as glitches, play, and aesthetic exploration.

## Foundational Learning
- **World Café facilitation:** Structured group discussion format that encourages diverse perspectives and cross-pollination of ideas. Why needed: To gather interdisciplinary insights that technocentric approaches might miss. Quick check: Ensure each table has clear prompts and diverse participants.
- **Mind mapping for synthesis:** Visual organization of unstructured discussion outputs into coherent themes. Why needed: To make sense of qualitative data from workshops. Quick check: Validate that the mind map accurately represents participant contributions.
- **Living document principles:** Ongoing community engagement and iterative refinement. Why needed: To ensure the manifesto remains relevant and evolves with the field. Quick check: Monitor engagement metrics and update frequency.
- **Artistic critique of technology:** Using artistic practices to reveal technological limitations and possibilities. Why needed: To move beyond technical explanations toward more accessible and meaningful understanding. Quick check: Assess whether artistic explanations improve comprehension for non-technical audiences.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Workshop participants -> World Café discussions -> Mind map capture -> Text synthesis -> Public annotation -> Living document

### Critical Path
The critical path is the synthesis phase where unstructured mind map data is converted into the finalized manifesto text. This requires careful interpretation of the visual data and collaborative editing to ensure the manifesto accurately reflects the workshop outcomes.

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Structured vs. open-ended discussions:** Structured prompts ensure focus on non-technocentric themes but may limit unexpected insights. Open-ended discussions encourage creativity but risk drifting toward technical optimization.
- **Expert vs. diverse participation:** Experts ensure technical accuracy but may perpetuate technocentric thinking. Diverse participants bring fresh perspectives but may lack technical depth.
- **Living vs. static document:** Living documents evolve with the field but require sustained community engagement. Static documents are easier to maintain but may become outdated.

### Failure Signatures
- **Technocentric drift:** The synthesized text focuses on efficiency/optimization rather than expression/inclusion.
- **Community disengagement:** The "living" aspect fails to attract ongoing contributions and updates.
- **Theme dilution:** The four core themes become blurred or lose their distinct focus during synthesis.

### First Experiments
1. Replicate the World Café workshop with a new cohort using non-technocentric prompts to test theme emergence.
2. Implement a public, collaborative version of the manifesto and monitor engagement metrics over three months.
3. Conduct follow-up interviews with original participants to validate manifesto accuracy and impact.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can artistic practices provide alternative, non-technocentric forms of explanation for AI systems that are effective for diverse audiences? The manifesto proposes this direction but lacks empirical evidence comparing artistically-grounded explanations to technocentric ones in terms of user comprehension, trust, or engagement.

### Open Question 2
How can glitches and AI errors be systematically repurposed as explainable artistic elements that reveal inner workings of AI systems? While the manifesto calls for embracing glitches, it provides no framework for mapping specific glitch types to explanatory power or measuring their effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
What mechanisms can effectively reduce barriers to equitable access to XAI tools for artists from diverse backgrounds and with diverse abilities? The manifesto advocates for inclusive design but does not identify specific barriers or empirically validated interventions for different marginalized groups.

### Open Question 4
How do sustained, longitudinal artistic engagements with AI models generate unique forms of explainability that differ from one-time interactions? The manifesto references longitudinal engagement as valuable but does not compare it to brief interactions or identify which aspects of explainability specifically benefit from extended practice.

## Limitations
- The specific facilitation prompts used at each World Café table to guide non-technocentric discussions are not specified, which may impact reproducibility.
- The process for condensing unstructured mind map and post-it notes into finalized manifesto text is unclear, leaving room for interpretation in the synthesis phase.
- The long-term viability and community engagement of the "living manifesto" are uncertain, as there is no evidence of sustained updates beyond the initial event.

## Confidence

### Confidence Labels
- **High confidence:** The general structure and workflow of the co-creation process (World Café workshop, mind map synthesis, public annotation) are well described and actionable.
- **Medium confidence:** The four core themes are clearly defined, but the exact framing and interpretation of each theme during workshops is not detailed.
- **Low confidence:** The long-term viability and community engagement of the "living manifesto" are uncertain, as there is no evidence of sustained updates or interaction beyond the initial event.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the World Café workshop with a new cohort, explicitly using non-technocentric prompts to test whether the same themes emerge.
2. Implement a public, collaborative version of the manifesto (e.g., Miro board) and monitor engagement metrics over at least three months to assess the "living" aspect.
3. Conduct a follow-up survey with original participants to validate whether the final manifesto accurately reflects their contributions and intentions.
