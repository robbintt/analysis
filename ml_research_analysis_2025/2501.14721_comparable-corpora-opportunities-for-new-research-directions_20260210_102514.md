# Comparable Corpora: Opportunities for New Research Directions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.14721
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14721
- **Reference count**: 11
- **Primary result**: Challenges NLP community to explore richer applications of comparable corpora beyond bilingual lexicon induction, including lexical semantics, transfer learning, bursting filter bubbles, and multimodal data connections.

## Executive Summary
This paper surveys the state of comparable corpora research and proposes new research directions that move beyond traditional bilingual lexicon induction. While comparable corpora have been used to induce bilingual lexicons by exploiting distributional similarity across monolingual corpora, the paper argues this represents only a narrow slice of potential applications. The author identifies opportunities in lexical semantics, transfer learning for growth languages, bursting filter bubbles, and connections to academic search and multimodal data. A central theme is avoiding over-reliance on English pivoting and instead developing methods that preserve cultural diversity and reduce bias in multilingual NLP systems.

## Method Summary
The paper reviews existing methods for bilingual lexicon induction using comparable corpora, primarily the Procrustes alignment approach. This method aligns embedding spaces from two monolingual corpora by learning a rotation matrix that minimizes the distance between seed dictionary pairs. The paper also discusses methods for finding comparable documents across languages, including translation, BERT-based similarity (Specter vectors), and citation graph random walks. While the paper presents these as established methods, it primarily proposes future research directions rather than conducting new experiments.

## Key Results
- Highlights the need to expand beyond bilingual lexicon induction to applications in lexical semantics, transfer learning, and cross-cultural understanding
- Identifies limitations of current benchmarks like MUSE that fail to capture word sense disambiguation
- Proposes using translation into English (rather than from English) to reduce Western bias in transfer learning
- Suggests cross-modal prompts (images) as language-neutral annotation sources to capture cultural diversity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Comparable corpora can substitute for parallel corpora when inducing bilingual lexicons by exploiting distributional similarity across separately-collected monolingual corpora on similar topics.
- Mechanism: Two monolingual corpora covering comparable domains produce similar co-occurrence statistics. By aligning embedding spaces via rotation matrices learned from seed dictionaries, nearest-neighbor search maps words across languages without requiring direct translation pairs.
- Core assumption: Distributional hypothesis holds cross-lingually—words with similar meanings in different languages appear in similar contexts within their respective corpora.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CC were originally introduced to address limitations of parallel corpora by using two monolingual corpora on similar topics instead of requiring translation"
  - [section 2.2] "CC replace a single parallel corpus with two monolingual corpora, ideally on similar (comparable) topics"
  - [section 2.6] Describes Procrustes alignment: "R = argmin_R ||RX_li − X_lj||²_F" with ANN for inference
- Break condition: Corpora differ substantially in domain, time period, or genre; vocabulary coverage is asymmetric; seed dictionary quality is poor.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Translating from growth languages into English (rather than from English outward) reduces imposition of Western biases in transfer learning pipelines.
- Mechanism: Source documents originate in the growth language (e.g., Hausa Wikipedia, Semantic Scholar papers). Comparable English documents are found via: (1) translation into English, (2) BERT-based Specter vector similarity, or (3) citation-graph random walks. The target English system processes already-grounded content rather than projecting English assumptions forward.
- Core assumption: Professional translators (and MT systems) produce more faithful output when translating into their stronger language; cultural concepts in source languages survive better when not filtered through English-first framing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "We suggest using translation in the reverse direction... It is better for systems that are stronger in English to translate into English than vice versa"
  - [section 3.2] Lists three methods: translation, Specter vectors, citation walks
  - [section 2.5.3] Documents translation artifacts in WordNet/VAD pivoting—e.g., Hausa words that "are not (much of) 'a thing'"
- Break condition: Source-language documents are low-quality or sparse; translation quality into English is poor; vector similarity fails to retrieve semantically comparable English documents.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-modal prompts (e.g., images) enable culturally diverse annotations that avoid English-text bias in multilingual datasets.
- Mechanism: Images serve as language-neutral prompts. Annotators from different linguistic/cultural backgrounds label the same image with emotion tags and captions in their native language. Because the prompt is non-linguistic, annotations reflect local interpretations rather than translations of English presuppositions.
- Core assumption: Visual stimuli carry fewer culture-bound presuppositions than English text prompts; annotation diversity reflects genuine cultural variation rather than translation artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4] "Mohamed et al. (2022, 2024) starts with pictures from WikiArt as prompts. Annotators are asked to add emotion labels and captions in 28 languages"
  - [section 3.4, Figure 1] Shows same tree labeled "sad" in English/Chinese but more positive in Arabic; dress captions show cultural objections absent in English
  - [section 3.4] "It should be possible to beat a baseline system that translates the captions from English to growth languages"
- Break condition: Images themselves carry cultural bias (Western art traditions); annotation interfaces impose English categories; annotator pools are not culturally diverse.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Parallel vs. Comparable Corpora**
  - Why needed here: The entire paper argues for expanding beyond parallel corpora (translated sentence pairs) to comparable corpora (separate monolingual collections on similar topics). Understanding this distinction is prerequisite to all mechanisms.
  - Quick check question: Given a Chinese news article about the 2024 Olympics and an English Wikipedia page about the same event with no translation relationship—is this parallel or comparable?

- Concept: **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) via Translation**
  - Why needed here: The paper critiques MUSE benchmark for failing to capture sense distinctions (bank→banque vs. banc) that older parallel-corpus methods handled. Understanding why bilingual senses ≠ monolingual senses is critical for designing better BLI systems.
  - Quick check question: If "interest" has the same ambiguity in English and French, why is parallel-corpus WSD less effective for it than for "bank"?

- Concept: **Orthogonal Procrustes Alignment**
  - Why needed here: The standard BLI pipeline uses Procrustes to align embedding spaces. Without this, you cannot implement or debug comparable-corpus lexicon induction.
  - Quick check question: Why must the rotation matrix R be orthogonal rather than an arbitrary linear transform?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Corpus collectors: Monolingual scrapers for growth-language sources (Wikipedia, S2, local news)
  2. Comparable document matcher: Specter encoder + ANN index, or citation-graph walker
  3. Embedding trainers: fastText/word2vec per language, or multilingual encoder
  4. Alignment module: Procrustes solver using seed dictionary
  5. Lexicon extractor: Cross-lingual nearest-neighbor search with CSLS/directionally constraint
  6. Evaluation harness: BLI metrics + WSD-aware tests (unlike MUSE)

- Critical path: (1) Identify growth-language corpus → (2) Train/obtain embeddings → (3) Build seed dictionary (even small) → (4) Align spaces → (5) Extract lexicon → (6) Validate on sense-disambiguated test pairs

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Translation direction: Into English = better quality, but loses source-culture framing; From English = simpler, but imposes bias
  - Prompt modality: Images avoid language bias but limit domain coverage; text prompts are flexible but Anglocentric
  - Seed dictionary size: Larger = better alignment but more English projection; smaller = noisier but less bias
  - Corpus comparability: Tight domain match = better BLI but less coverage; loose match = more coverage but noisier signals

- Failure signatures:
  - High BLI accuracy but all predictions are cognates/loanwords (overfitting to form similarity)
  - Sense distinctions collapse (bank always maps to banque, never banc)
  - Growth-language concepts have no English nearest neighbors (embedding-space gaps)
  - Annotations cluster by annotation language rather than image content (prompt leakage)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline replication: Train fastText on English and a growth language (e.g., Hausa), align with MUSE seed dictionary, evaluate on standard BLI test. Then manually inspect failure cases for sense collapse.
  2. Reverse-direction transfer: Build a small comparable corpus by translating Hausa Wikipedia articles into English (rather than vice versa). Compare BLI quality to forward-direction baseline.
  3. Cross-modal probe: Use ArtELingo-28 benchmark; train image-to-caption model using only non-English captions, then evaluate whether it captures culturally specific objections (e.g., dress modesty) that English-trained models miss.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can a formal theory based on linear algebra and graph theory explain why random walks on translation dictionaries distinguish synonyms from antonyms better than PMI?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.1.3 observes that while PMI scores are large for both synonyms and antonyms (due to collocation), back translations (random walks) link synonyms but rarely link antonyms.
- Why unresolved: Current distributional methods conflate contrast and similarity because words appearing together often have high PMI regardless of semantic relationship.
- What evidence would resolve it: A computational model that successfully uses graph-based random walks to separate synonym pairs from antonym pairs with higher accuracy than PMI-based methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can transfer learning for growth languages be improved by constructing comparable corpora using source texts in the growth language and finding similar English documents, rather than pivoting via English?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.2 suggests using translation into English or similarity measures (like Specter vectors) from growth language sources to avoid imposing American values and filter bubbles.
- Why unresolved: Standard practice currently pivots from English, which limits the learned concepts to those present in the high-resource culture.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing that models trained on growth-to-English comparable corpora capture cultural nuances omitted by English-to-growth translation methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we design a bilingual lexicon induction benchmark that effectively tests Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 2.6 notes that the MUSE benchmark fails to capture classic ambiguities (e.g., bank mapping to banc), suggesting there is "room to introduce a new benchmark."
- Why unresolved: Existing benchmarks often assume a one-to-one mapping or use identical loanwords, failing to test a system's ability to handle polysemy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new dataset containing complex 1-to-many translation pairs where systems are evaluated on their ability to retrieve all valid senses rather than just the most frequent translation.

## Limitations
- The paper is primarily conceptual, proposing future research directions rather than presenting new empirical results
- Assumes access to professional translators and culturally diverse annotators without addressing practical constraints
- No quantitative evaluation is provided for the suggested applications beyond existing BLI benchmarks

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core mechanism of comparable corpora for BLI via Procrustes alignment (established method with published code)
- **Medium confidence**: Reverse-direction transfer reduces bias (theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation)
- **Medium confidence**: Cross-modal prompts avoid language bias (supported by Mohamed et al. results but not tested within this paper)

## Next Checks
1. **Sense-aware BLI validation**: Implement the Procrustes alignment pipeline and specifically test on ambiguous word pairs (bank→banc vs. banque) to verify the claimed failure mode
2. **Transfer direction ablation**: Build comparable corpora using both translation directions (growth→English vs. English→growth) and measure downstream task performance differences
3. **Cross-modal annotation quality**: Use ArtELingo-28 benchmark to compare models trained on image-based vs. text-based prompts for capturing culturally-specific interpretations
