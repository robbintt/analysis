# AI-MASLD Metabolic Dysfunction and Information Steatosis of Large Language Models in Unstructured Clinical Narratives

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11544
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Current LLMs exhibit functional decline ("AI-MASLD") when processing noisy unstructured clinical narratives

## Executive Summary
This study introduces the concept of "AI-MASLD" to describe the functional decline of Large Language Models when processing unstructured clinical narratives. Using a cross-sectional analysis with twenty standardized medical probes, the research evaluated four LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max) across five clinical capability dimensions. All models exhibited functional defects, with Qwen3-Max performing best (16/80) and Gemini 2.5 worst (32/80). GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in DVT/PE risk assessment. The results show that current LLMs cannot reliably extract core medical information from noisy, real-world patient narratives and must be used as auxiliary tools under human supervision.

## Method Summary
The study employed a cross-sectional analysis using twenty standardized "Medical Probes" - unstructured text prompts simulating patient complaints with noise, contradictions, and emotional content. Four LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, Qwen3-Max) were accessed via API using unified text prompts. Two independent attending physicians with >10 years experience scored model outputs against gold-standard answers using a 4-point inverse rating scale (0=Perfect, 4=Invalid). Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was used for inter-rater reliability. The probes tested five dimensions: Noise Sensitivity, Priority Triage, Dynamic Reasoning, Fact-Emotion Separation, and Timeline Sorting.

## Key Results
- All four LLMs exhibited functional defects, failing to reliably extract core medical information from noisy clinical narratives
- Qwen3-Max performed best (16/80) while Gemini 2.5 performed worst (32/80) on the 80-point scale
- GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in DVT/PE risk assessment, prioritizing chronic chest pain over acute thrombosis risk
- The study identified three failure modes: Information Steatosis (buried correct information), Algorithmic Fibrosis (failed dynamic reasoning), and Toxic Accumulation (emotional contamination)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information Steatosis
High-noise clinical narratives trigger a "functional collapse" in LLMs, analogous to organ failure under metabolic stress. When the ratio of irrelevant data to relevant medical signals crosses a threshold, attention mechanisms fail to suppress distractors, incorporating noise or hallucinating new symptoms.

### Mechanism 2: Algorithmic Fibrosis
LLMs exhibit "Algorithmic Fibrosis," failing to dynamically re-weight risks when distractors are present. The model processes symptoms in isolation or is attracted to conspicuous chronic symptoms while missing lethal but subtle chains (e.g., leg swelling + shortness of breath = Pulmonary Embolism).

### Mechanism 3: Toxic Accumulation
Emotional and redundant language causes "toxic accumulation," degrading the purity of medical summaries. The model treats subjective emotional expressions as valid clinical data points, mixing "toxic" emotional data with objective facts and lowering the signal-to-noise ratio of the output.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Inverse Rating Scale (0-4)
  - **Why needed here:** To quantify the severity of "AI-MASLD." You must understand that a lower score is better (0 = perfect extraction) and higher scores indicate dangerous deviations like hallucination (4) or excessive verbosity (3).
  - **Quick check question:** If a model includes a symptom not mentioned by the patient (e.g., "hypersomnia"), what score does it receive?

- **Concept:** "Medical Probe" Dimensions
  - **Why needed here:** To diagnose *where* the model fails. A model might excel at Timeline Sorting (Dimension 5) but fail at Priority Triage (Dimension 2).
  - **Quick check question:** Which dimension tested the model's ability to ignore "red herring" symptoms like a toothache in favor of palpitations?

- **Concept:** The "Metabolic Load" Metaphor
  - **Why needed here:** This frames the problem not as a lack of knowledge, but as a processing capacity issue. High noise = high load = functional failure.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the paper suggest models fail because they don't know medical facts, or because they cannot process the "metabolic load" of unstructured noise?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** 20 Standardized Medical Probes -> 4 LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, Qwen3-Max) via API -> Two Double-blinded Clinicians -> 4-point Inverse Scoring against Gold Standards -> Failure Mode Diagnosis

- **Critical path:** Designing the Probes -> Generating Model Responses -> Inverse Scoring against Gold Standards -> Diagnosing Failure Modes (Steatosis, Fibrosis, Hallucination)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - *Scope vs. Depth:* The study uses only 20 probes for 4 models. This allows deep qualitative analysis (failure modes) but limits statistical generalizability.
  - *Simulated vs. Real:* Probes simulate real patients (ecological validity) but lack the messiness of actual EHR data or voice transcripts.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Information Steatosis:** Score 2-3. Output is correct but buried in "fat" (redundancy/irrelevant details).
  - **Catastrophic Failure:** Score 4. "Performance Cliff" under extreme noise; output is invalid or hallucinated.
  - **Algorithmic Fibrosis:** Correctly identifying individual symptoms but failing to connect the risk chain (e.g., DVT -> PE).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Probe 1.1 Stress Test:** Run the "terrible week" probe (car accident, snoring, leg cramps) to see if the model hallucinates "hypersomnia" or misses the "abnormal liver function" signal.
  2. **Priority Triage Test (Probe 2.2):** Input the "chest tightness vs. leg swelling" prompt. Verify if the model prioritizes the chronic chest issue (fail) or the acute DVT/PE risk (pass).
  3. **Fact-Emotion Separation (Probe 4.4):** Use the "anxious mother/child furnace" prompt. Check if the output is a clean medical list (pass) or includes the mother's anxiety (fail).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can a standardized "AI Clinical Capability Stress Test Benchmark" (analogous to FibroScan) be established to quantitatively measure information filtering efficiency and noise rejection capability across different LLM architectures? The authors state there is an "urgent need to establish a unified and widely accepted diagnostic framework" including quantitative indicators to screen a model's "liver function" before deployment.

### Open Question 2
Do "Data Diet Control" (pre-training on authentic unstructured clinical dialogue) and "Algorithmic Anti-fibrosis Treatment" (RLHF for warning symptoms) effectively reverse the functional defects of AI-MASLD? The paper proposes these as specific "treatment" strategies, asking future research to focus on implementing "systematic 'anti-inflammatory and metabolic' interventions" to mitigate the syndrome.

### Open Question 3
Can a Mixture of Experts (MoE) system, utilizing models proficient in extraction as frontend filters and others in reasoning as backend analyzers, effectively compensate for the metabolic defects observed in single models? The paper suggests exploring "multi-model collaboration mechanisms" specifically to compensate for individual metabolic defects.

### Open Question 4
Does the inclusion of multimodal data (medical imaging and audio speech tone) exacerbate or mitigate the "metabolic load" and functional decline (AI-MASLD) in Large Language Models? The authors note the study was limited to text probes, excluding medical imaging or speech tone, which may underestimate the potential or risks of multimodal models in real clinical settings.

## Limitations

- The study's simulated probe approach may not fully capture the complexity and variability of real-world clinical narratives
- Scoring relies on subjective clinician judgment even with guidelines, and the absence of detailed generation parameters introduces potential reproducibility concerns
- The small sample of 20 probes limits statistical power for broader generalization

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core finding that current LLMs struggle with noisy clinical narratives is well-supported by the systematic scoring across multiple models and probes.
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific failure mode diagnoses (Information Steatosis, Algorithmic Fibrosis, Toxic Accumulation) are plausible based on observed outputs but rely on qualitative interpretation of scoring patterns.
- **Low Confidence:** The "AI-MASLD" metaphor, while evocative, extends beyond the empirical evidence to suggest a specific pathophysiological mechanism without direct validation of attention mechanism behavior or information processing capacity.

## Next Checks

1. **Real-World Echo:** Test the same 20 probes against actual patient narratives from EHR systems to validate if the simulated failure modes persist under authentic clinical noise.

2. **Parametric Sweep:** Systematically vary LLM generation parameters (temperature 0.0-1.0, max_tokens) to determine if hallucination and verbosity failures can be mitigated through configuration rather than fundamental model limitations.

3. **Attention Attribution:** Apply attention visualization techniques to verify whether observed "Information Steatosis" failures correspond to attention mechanisms failing to suppress irrelevant tokens as hypothesized.
