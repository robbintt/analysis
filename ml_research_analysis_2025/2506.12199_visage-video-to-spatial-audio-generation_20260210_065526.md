# ViSAGe: Video-to-Spatial Audio Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12199
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12199
- Reference count: 34
- This paper introduces ViSAGe, a framework for generating first-order ambisonics (FOA) directly from silent videos, outperforming two-stage baselines on semantic and spatial metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents ViSAGe, a framework for generating first-order ambisonics (FOA) directly from silent videos. The authors propose YT-Ambigen, a dataset of 102K video-FOA pairs, and new spatial evaluation metrics using audio energy maps and saliency. ViSAGe uses CLIP visual features, patchwise energy maps, and directional embeddings within a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Ambisonics generation leverages a neural audio codec with a novel code generation pattern to model both residual and spatial dependencies efficiently. Experimental results show ViSAGe outperforms two-stage baselines on semantic (FAD, KLD) and spatial (CC, AUC) metrics. Qualitative results demonstrate coherent and temporally aligned spatial audio, with improvements from directional and visual guidance. ViSAGe sets a new state of the art for video-to-spatial audio generation.

## Method Summary
ViSAGe generates first-order ambisonics (FOA) from silent videos using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. The model takes CLIP visual features (4 FPS), patchwise energy maps (spatial/temporal saliency), and direction embeddings (unit vector MLP) as input. The audio representation uses Descript Audio Codec (DAC) with 44.1kHz, 9 codebooks/channel. The model employs an interleaved code generation pattern to handle residual and spatial dependencies efficiently. Training involves pretraining on VGGSound and finetuning on YT-Ambigen with rotation augmentation and dual classifier-free guidance.

## Key Results
- ViSAGe outperforms two-stage baselines on semantic (FAD, KLD) and spatial (CC, AUC) metrics.
- Directional embedding and patchwise energy maps improve spatial coherence (CC, AUC).
- The interleaved code generation pattern effectively models residual and spatial dependencies.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ViSAGe's architecture effectively combines visual features, spatial saliency, and directional information to generate coherent spatial audio. The interleaved code generation pattern efficiently models residual and spatial dependencies, while the neural audio codec representation enables high-quality audio synthesis.

## Foundational Learning
- **First-Order Ambisonics (FOA)**: A 4-channel audio format (W, X, Y, Z) that represents 3D sound fields. *Why needed*: Provides a compact representation for spatial audio generation. *Quick check*: Verify that the model output has 4 channels and can be decoded to binaural audio.
- **CLIP Visual Features**: Pre-trained visual embeddings that capture semantic information. *Why needed*: Provides a rich representation of visual content for audio generation. *Quick check*: Ensure CLIP features are extracted at 4 FPS and have the correct dimensionality.
- **Patchwise Energy Maps**: Spatial and temporal saliency maps that highlight important regions in the video. *Why needed*: Guides the model to focus on relevant audio sources. *Quick check*: Visualize energy maps to ensure they align with salient video regions.
- **Neural Audio Codec (DAC)**: A codec that represents audio as discrete codes from multiple codebooks. *Why needed*: Enables efficient and high-quality audio synthesis. *Quick check*: Verify that the codec can decode the generated codes to audible audio.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: CLIP Features -> Patchwise Energy Maps -> Direction Embedding -> Transformer Encoder -> Transformer Decoder -> Neural Audio Codec
**Critical Path**: CLIP features, energy maps, and direction embedding are processed by the transformer encoder-decoder to generate audio codes, which are then decoded to FOA audio.
**Design Tradeoffs**: The model trades off between semantic quality (FAD, KLD) and spatial accuracy (CC, AUC) when applying classifier-free guidance. The interleaved code generation pattern balances computational efficiency with modeling capacity.
**Failure Signatures**: 
- Noise-like output: Check data pipeline or pretraining weights if FAD is high.
- Spatial incoherence: Verify the interleaved dependency pattern is implemented correctly.
- Mode collapse: Check codebook usage across all 9 layers.
**3 First Experiments**:
1. Generate FOA audio from a test video and verify it has 4 channels.
2. Visualize audio energy maps to ensure spatial coherence.
3. Apply classifier-free guidance and measure the trade-off between semantic and spatial metrics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can the ViSAGe architecture be effectively adapted to generate Higher-Order Ambisonics (HOA) to increase spatial precision?
- **Basis in paper**: The conclusion states: "Future work will explore... extend the framework's applicability to other forms like higher-order ambisonics."
- **Why unresolved**: The current architecture is optimized for First-Order Ambisonics (4 channels). Increasing the channel count for HOA would significantly increase the sequence length and complexity of the residual vector quantization dependencies.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Successful training and evaluation of a modified ViSAGe model on an HOA dataset, demonstrating improved localization accuracy over FOA without unsustainable computational costs.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can the trade-off between semantic audio quality and spatial accuracy be resolved when applying classifier-free guidance?
- **Basis in paper**: Table 4 and Appendix B show that while "Directional & Visual" guidance optimizes semantic metrics (FAD), "Directional only" guidance yields significantly higher spatial metrics (CC, AUC).
- **Why unresolved**: The paper demonstrates that joint guidance improves overall performance but acknowledges that maximizing spatial fidelity seems to require different conditioning strengths or strategies than maximizing semantic fidelity.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A novel guidance strategy or loss function that achieves state-of-the-art results in both spatial (CC/AUC) and semantic (FAD) metrics simultaneously, rather than requiring a preference for one over the other.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Is it possible to infer the camera direction directly from visual features rather than requiring it as an explicit input?
- **Basis in paper**: Section 3.2 notes that FoV lacks 3D context, so "we include the camera direction as input... allowing the model to create an accurate sound field."
- **Why unresolved**: The current framework relies on explicit metadata (φ, θ). Real-world applications often lack this precise orientation data for standard videos, limiting the model's applicability to videos without corresponding camera logs.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A variation of ViSAGe that achieves comparable spatial metrics (CC, AUC) on the YT-Ambigen test set using only video frames, effectively learning to estimate the viewing angle implicitly.

## Limitations
- **Dataset Dependency**: The core contribution hinges on the YT-Ambigen dataset. Without verified access to this specific 102K-clip collection, exact reproduction is blocked.
- **Spatial Metric Ambiguity**: The spatial metrics (CC, AUC) apply a sin θ correction to address sampling bias. The implementation details for this correction are described conceptually but lack pseudocode or exact mathematical formulation.
- **Codec Dependency**: The Descript Audio Codec (DAC) is central to the representation. While DAC weights may be public, integration details and codebook dimension handling are not fully specified.

## Confidence
- **High**: ViSAGe improves semantic metrics (FAD, KLD) over two-stage baselines on VGGSound/YT-Ambigen.
- **High**: Directional embedding and patchwise energy maps improve spatial coherence (CC, AUC).
- **Medium**: The interleaved code generation pattern effectively models residual and spatial dependencies; verification depends on dataset access.
- **Low**: Qualitative claims (coherent, temporally aligned spatial audio) lack ablation or perceptual study to rule out alternative explanations.

## Next Checks
1. Verify YT-Ambigen Access and Curation: Confirm the dataset's public release or curate it using the provided YouTube ID strategy. Compare clip counts, duration distributions, and class balance to the reported 102K clips.
2. Implement and Validate Spatial Metrics: Code the CC and AUC metrics with the sin θ oversampling correction. Validate against known synthetic examples (e.g., uniform source on horizontal plane vs. overhead).
3. Ablation on Code Generation Pattern: Implement both the proposed interleaved pattern and a naive sequential delay baseline. Measure impact on spatial metrics and codebook usage to confirm the design's effectiveness.
