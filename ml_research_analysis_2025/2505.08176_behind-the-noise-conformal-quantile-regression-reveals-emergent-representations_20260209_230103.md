# Behind the Noise: Conformal Quantile Regression Reveals Emergent Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.08176
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08176
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Denoising scientific imaging data with calibrated uncertainty bounds while revealing emergent latent representations

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of denoising scientific imaging data under severe time constraints, where rapid acquisition introduces high noise levels. The authors propose an ensemble of lightweight, randomly structured neural networks trained via conformal quantile regression to denoise data while providing calibrated uncertainty bounds. Beyond denoising, they observe that the learned latent representations self-organize into meaningful morphological and chemical features without supervision. Applied to SEM-EDX and XCT data, their method achieves denoising with ensemble correlation coefficients around 83% (SEM-EDX) and 94% (XCT), while reducing uncertainty intervals by up to a factor of two. The emergent latent structure enables interpretable segmentation-like analysis, demonstrating dual benefits of signal recovery and unsupervised representation learning.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a denoising framework using ensembles of randomly structured convolutional neural networks (SMSNet) trained via conformal quantile regression. The networks are generated as random Single-Source Single-Sink Directed Acyclic Graphs (SS-DAGs) with power-law degree distributions and exponential skip-connection biases. Each network outputs a latent representation that is projected to three quantiles (lower, median, upper) using independent MLP heads. The ensemble approach, combined with conformal calibration, provides both denoising performance and calibrated uncertainty bounds. The method is validated on synthetic data and real scientific imaging datasets (SEM-EDX and XCT), demonstrating improved signal recovery and revealing unsupervised latent structure.

## Key Results
- Denoising performance: Correlation coefficients of ~83% for SEM-EDX and ~94% for XCT data
- Uncertainty reduction: Quantile width reduced by up to 2x compared to baselines
- Coverage validity: Maintained ~90% coverage through conformal prediction
- Emergent representations: Latent features self-organize into meaningful morphological and chemical patterns without supervision

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the diversity of randomly structured networks in an ensemble to capture different aspects of the noise distribution, while conformal quantile regression ensures calibrated uncertainty bounds. The random SMSNet architecture creates a diverse hypothesis space that can represent complex noise patterns. The quantile regression framework directly models the conditional distribution of clean signals given noisy observations, rather than just point estimates. The emergent latent representations arise from the shared backbone architecture, which forces networks to compress information into a common latent space, revealing underlying structure in the data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal Prediction**: Distribution-free uncertainty quantification that provides valid coverage guarantees regardless of the underlying data distribution. Needed to ensure the uncertainty bounds are statistically valid and not overconfident.
- **Quantile Regression**: Learning conditional quantiles of a target variable rather than just the mean. Quick check: Verify predicted quantiles match empirical quantiles in calibration data.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to improve robustness and reduce variance. Quick check: Compare ensemble performance against individual network performance.
- **Sparse Graph Neural Networks**: Randomly structured DAGs that create diverse feature extraction pathways. Quick check: Verify graph connectivity and receptive field sizes match design specifications.
- **Heteroskedastic Noise Modeling**: Accounting for noise variance that varies with signal intensity. Quick check: Plot noise standard deviation against signal intensity to verify heteroskedasticity.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Input -> SMSNet Backbone (SS-DAG) -> Latent Vector -> Three Quantile Heads -> Output (Lower, Median, Upper)
- **Critical Path**: Random graph generation -> Backbone feature extraction -> Quantile projection -> Conformal calibration
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Random SMSNet provides diversity but lacks inductive bias; quantile regression is more robust to outliers but harder to train than mean regression; conformal calibration adds computational overhead but ensures valid uncertainty.
- **Failure Signatures**: Underfitting indicated by CC stagnating near 0; quantile crossing indicated by lower bounds exceeding upper bounds; poor calibration indicated by coverage deviating from nominal levels.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Implement SMSNet generator with specified power-law degree distribution and skip-connection bias
  2. Train on synthetic 2D data with known ground truth to verify denoising capability
  3. Apply conformal calibration and verify 90% coverage on held-out calibration set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method relies on a "critical threshold" for network complexity without providing quantitative guidance for identifying this phase transition, risking systematic underfitting
- The emergent representation analysis lacks rigorous quantitative metrics, making objective assessment difficult
- Critical architectural details (activation functions, exact MLP head dimensions) are underspecified, requiring assumptions for reproduction

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Denoising performance metrics and uncertainty calibration are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Training procedure is clear but critical dependence on network complexity threshold introduces risks
- **Low Confidence**: Emergent representation analysis lacks quantitative validation metrics

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary network depth and node degree to empirically identify the critical threshold for successful denoising
2. Rigorously validate the 90% coverage guarantee by ensuring strict exchangeability of the calibration set
3. Develop and apply quantitative metrics to objectively assess the organization of emergent latent representations
