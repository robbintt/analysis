# Operator Models for Continuous-Time Offline Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.10383
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10383
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** First end-to-end learning theory for continuous-time offline RL with global convergence guarantees and competitive pendulum benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces O-CTRL, a continuous-time offline reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes from historical data. By representing the world model in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and leveraging operator theory, the method constructs a modular dynamics model that decouples learning from policy optimization. The approach combines statistical learning methods with dynamic programming recursion to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, establishing global convergence with finite-sample guarantees tied to system properties like smoothness and stability.

## Method Summary
O-CTRL learns the infinitesimal generator G of controlled diffusion processes using Kernel Ridge Regression in an RKHS, creating a reward-free world model. The algorithm first computes state derivatives from trajectory data, then estimates the generator operators A and B that map states and actions to dynamics. With a separable reward structure (state reward plus quadratic action penalty), the optimal value function is computed via an Implicit-Explicit time-stepping scheme on the HJB equation. The method exploits Fenchel duality to analytically solve the max-operator, yielding a simple dynamic programming recursion without solving Q-function optimization at each step.

## Key Results
- Global convergence of value function with error bounded by operator learning error and system stability
- Finite-sample guarantees with bounds tied to smoothness and spectral gap properties
- Competitive performance on Pendulum-v1 benchmark: -141.71±84.23 (Random dataset) and -104.36±83.00 (Replay dataset)
- First end-to-end learning theory for continuous-time offline reinforcement learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Learning the infinitesimal generator allows for a modular, reward-free world model that decouples dynamics learning from policy optimization. The algorithm uses Kernel Ridge Regression to learn the operator G mapping state observables to their time derivatives in an RKHS, enabling the value function to be computed via the resolvent for any reward function defined later. Core assumptions include smooth dynamics (C^1) and a C^0-universal RKHS with bounded embedding operators. Break condition: insufficient offline data coverage of state-action space invalidates global convergence guarantees.

### Mechanism 2
The optimal policy is obtained via a single-loop dynamic programming recursion without solving Q-function optimization at every step. By imposing a separable reward structure with strongly convex action penalty, the paper exploits the Fenchel conjugate to analytically solve the max-operator in the HJB equation, transforming it into a tractable IMEX time-stepping scheme. Core assumption: reward separability with strongly convex action penalty. Break condition: non-separable or non-convex action penalties destabilize the recursion.

### Mechanism 3
Value function approximation errors are bounded linearly by operator learning error and inversely by system stability (spectral gap). The paper propagates generator learning error through the HJB PDE, where exponential stability controlled by discount ρ and spectral gap λ_gap ensures bounded perturbations in the value function. Core assumption: stability condition ρ + λ_gap > 0 sufficiently large. Break condition: small discount or unstable learned dynamics cause error divergence.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Infinitesimal Generator**
  - Why needed: Defines continuous-time dynamics by describing the rate of change of observables, replacing discrete transition matrices
  - Quick check: Can you write down the generator Gφ for a simple linear SDE dS = -S dt + dW?

- **Concept: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)**
  - Why needed: Allows "kernelizing" operator regression, learning infinite-dimensional operators using finite matrix operations
  - Quick check: If you have a kernel k(x,y), how do you compute the kernel derivative ∇_x k(x,y) required for generator embedding?

- **Concept: Fenchel Conjugate**
  - Why needed: Converts the "max" operation over actions in HJB into a differentiable soft-max-like term for efficient updates
  - Quick check: For cost c(a) = a^2, what is the Fenchel conjugate D_a(λ) = max_a { ⟨a, λ⟩ - a^2 }?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Layer -> Representation Layer -> World Model -> Solver -> Inference
- **Critical path:** Construction of Gram matrix K_γ and inversion to get A (World Model phase)
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Kernel Bandwidth: Large oversmooths dynamics (high bias); small fits noise (high variance)
  - Regularization γ: High stabilizes matrices but blurs dynamics; low risks overfitting
  - Discretization ∆t: Large speeds recursion but introduces discretization error O((∆t)^p)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Divergent Value Function: Check if ρ too small or data coverage insufficient
  - Stiff Dynamics: IMEX scheme may require very small ∆t for stability
  - Numerical Instability: Increase γ if K_γ is ill-conditioned
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Linear Sanity Check: Run on Linear SDE with known LQR solution; verify V matches s^⊤Ps
  2. Ablation on ρ: Test Pendulum with varying discount factors to verify ρ^{-1} sensitivity
  3. Distribution Shift Test: Train on "Random" dataset, test on narrow expert trajectories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can finite-sample guarantees and convergence analysis extend to dependent (trajectory) data instead of independent samples? The current proofs rely on i.i.d. sampling assumptions that don't hold for time-series data. Resolution would require extending Theorem 1 and Corollary 2 to mixing conditions or spectral decay rates.

- **Open Question 2:** Do operator model guarantees hold for partially observed systems where state measurements are unavailable? Current method uses direct state measurements and doesn't account for latent state estimation errors. Resolution would require deriving learning rates for generator estimation in partially observed settings.

- **Open Question 3:** How can the required stability condition (ρ + λ_gap > L_D E(Ĝ)) be enforced algorithmically without prior knowledge of the spectral gap? The convergence depends on sufficient spectral gap, but this is a system property not known beforehand. Resolution would require an adaptive regularization scheme or verification step within O-CTRL.

## Limitations

- Global convergence guarantees critically depend on spectral gap condition, which may not hold for poorly conditioned or unstable systems
- Method assumes smooth dynamics and quadratic action costs, limiting applicability to complex reward structures
- RKHS-based approach requires careful kernel tuning, and operator learning error can propagate significantly when spectral gap is small

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Theoretical framework connecting infinitesimal generators to value function learning is mathematically sound; kernel regression formulation is well-established
- **Medium Confidence:** IMEX dynamic programming scheme for solving HJB equation is valid, though numerical stability depends on discretization parameters
- **Low Confidence:** Experimental results show high variance (±84.23 reward), suggesting sensitivity to hyperparameters and data quality

## Next Checks

1. **Linear System Benchmark:** Test on linear-quadratic regulator with known solution to verify theoretical error bounds and identify implementation issues
2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Systematically vary ρ, γ, and kernel bandwidth σ to quantify impact on final performance and verify claimed stability conditions
3. **Sample Complexity Study:** Measure how error in learned value function scales with dataset size N to validate finite-sample guarantees
