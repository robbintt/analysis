# Cognitive-Level Adaptive Generation via Capability-Aware Retrieval and Style Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.19336
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19336
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** CLAF achieves up to 89.31% cognitive alignment and enhanced readability across three complexity levels.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses cognitive misalignment in large language model generation, where content complexity or presentation style fails to match users' cognitive capacities. To solve this, the authors propose the Cognitive-Level Alignment Framework (CLAF), which integrates capability-aware retrieval based on a hierarchical knowledge graph, adaptive language style optimization guided by Bloom's taxonomy, and knowledge-controllable generation. They construct Scale, a cognitively annotated dataset with responses at basic, intermediate, and advanced levels for each query. CLAF achieves significant improvements in cognitive alignment, with up to 89.31% average matching rate and enhanced readability across levels. The framework generalizes well to new domains and languages, such as Chinese classical poetry. Human evaluations confirm superior fluency and pedagogical effectiveness. CLAF enables scalable, efficient, and cognitively adaptive text generation for diverse educational and professional applications.

## Method Summary
CLAF operates through three core modules: Capability-Aware Retrieval (CAR) constrains content selection using a hierarchical knowledge graph tagged with cognitive levels; Adaptive Language Style Optimization (ALSO) employs Direct Preference Optimization to fine-tune generation style according to Bloom's taxonomy; and Knowledge Controllable Generation (KCG) dynamically adjusts feed-forward network weights to ensure retrieved knowledge appears in outputs. The system is trained on the Scale dataset, containing 18K queries with cognitively annotated responses across three complexity levels. This architecture enables generation that matches both the knowledge prerequisites and stylistic presentation appropriate to a user's cognitive level.

## Key Results
- CLAF achieves up to 89.31% average matching rate in cognitive alignment across complexity levels
- The framework significantly improves readability scores for basic and intermediate levels while maintaining advanced-level depth
- Human evaluations confirm superior fluency and pedagogical effectiveness compared to baseline approaches
- CLAF generalizes successfully to new domains and languages, including Chinese classical poetry generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Knowledge Constraining
- **Claim:** Retrieving content from a structure that mimics human learning prerequisites may reduce knowledge-level misalignment.
- **Mechanism:** The CAR module constructs a hierarchical knowledge graph where nodes are tagged with cognitive tiers ($l \in \{0,1,2\}$). By constraining retrieval to subgraphs where $l \le c$ (user level), the system filters out concepts requiring cognitive leaps the user has not yet made.
- **Core assumption:** Knowledge can be decomposed into discrete nodes with strict prerequisite relationships that align with the user's cognitive stage.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] Mentions "capability-aware retrieval based on a hierarchical knowledge graph."
  - [section] Section 4.1 details the retrieval of subgraph $K_c^{(k)}$ constrained by node level $l \le c$ and depth $d$.
  - [corpus] "DioR" (neighbor) discusses adaptive cognitive detection, supporting the viability of dynamic retrieval strategies, though CLAF relies on static graph topology.
- **Break condition:** If the knowledge graph contains incorrect prerequisite edges or noisy level annotations, users will receive either redundant or overwhelming content.

### Mechanism 2: Style-Specific Preference Optimization
- **Claim:** Decoupling linguistic style from content via reinforcement learning aligns presentation with cognitive capacity.
- **Mechanism:** The ALSO module uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). It optimizes a policy $\pi_\theta$ to maximize a reward for style matching (e.g., "basic" uses simple analogies) while minimizing divergence from a reference model.
- **Core assumption:** Style attributes (tone, syntax complexity) can be captured by a reward model $r(x, y)$ without degrading factual accuracy.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] Cites "style optimization module guided by Bloom's taxonomy and preference learning."
  - [section] Section 4.2 defines the DPO objective (Eq. 1) and the preference probability (Eq. 2).
  - [corpus] Weak corpus signal; "Personalized Text Generation" discusses style but uses contrastive steering rather than DPO.
- **Break condition:** If the reward model correlates style with specific (but unintended) content patterns, the model may hallucinate or simplify facts to match the "simple" style.

### Mechanism 3: Dynamic FFN Weight Manipulation
- **Claim:** Modifying specific feed-forward network (FFN) weights during generation ensures the output adheres to retrieved knowledge.
- **Mechanism:** The KCG module identifies "control centers" (specific FFN vectors) associated with keywords from the retrieval step. It dynamically scales these weights to boost the probability of relevant terms during decoding.
- **Core assumption:** Semantic concepts are localized in specific dimensions of the FFN's intermediate layer and can be isolated and amplified.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] References "knowledge-controllable generation component."
  - [section] Section 4.3 and Eq. 3 describe the weight update rule $\omega_{ai}^{t+1}$ based on cumulative alignment.
  - [corpus] "MIND" discusses capability-aware distillation, suggesting capability alignment is a trend, but lacks specific FFN manipulation evidence.
- **Break condition:** If keywords are polysemous, amplifying their weights might introduce bias or irrelevant context; excessive weight scaling may degrade fluency.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bloom's Taxonomy**
  - **Why needed here:** This framework defines the three output levels (Basic/Remember, Intermediate/Apply, Advanced/Create) used to annotate the dataset and train the reward model.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between a learning objective focused on "Remembering" versus "Analyzing"?

- **Concept: Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**
  - **Why needed here:** The retrieval module uses ZPD to define the boundary of "optimally challenging" content—difficult enough to learn, but not so difficult it causes misalignment.
  - **Quick check question:** How would you define the upper bound of a user's "Zone of Proximal Development" in terms of graph traversal depth?

- **Concept: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how the model learns "style" is critical. Unlike standard RLHF, DPO optimizes the policy directly against preference pairs without training a separate value function.
  - **Quick check question:** In DPO, what does the $\beta$ parameter control regarding the trade-off between the reward and the Kullback-Leibler divergence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User Query + Cognitive Level $c$ -> CAR (Hierarchical Graph -> Retrieved Knowledge Subgraph $K_c^{(k)}$) -> ALSO (LLM Backbone -> Stylized Generation Probability) -> KCG (FFN Weight Controller -> Final Constrained Output)

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Graph Construction:** Building the hierarchical knowledge graph with accurate level annotations is the primary dependency. If this fails, CAR retrieves misaligned context.
  2. **SCALE Dataset:** Required to train the DPO model in ALSO.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Static vs. Dynamic Graphs:** The paper uses a pre-constructed graph for efficiency (retrieval $\approx$ 2 seconds), but this may fail to adapt to novel user queries not in the corpus.
  - **Control vs. Fluency:** KCG explicitly modifies weights (interventionist), which carries a higher risk of "ungrammatical" outputs compared to prompt-based soft controls.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"Intermediate Bias":** Ablation studies show models default to intermediate complexity when ALSO is removed; watch for non-distinct outputs across levels.
  - **Catastrophic Forgetting:** If DPO over-tunes for "Basic" style, the model may lose the capacity for "Advanced" technical reasoning.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate CAR:** Run retrieval for "Advanced" queries and verify that "Basic" prerequisite nodes are excluded from the context window.
  2. **Ablate KCG:** Generate responses with KCG disabled vs. enabled and measure the drop in specific keyword recall (exact match of retrieved terms).
  3. **Stress Test ALSO:** Input "Advanced" queries but specify "Basic" level; check if the model oversimplifies facts (semantic loss) vs. just syntax (intended behavior).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The hierarchical knowledge graph construction relies heavily on accurate prerequisite relationships and cognitive level annotations, yet the paper provides limited detail on the annotation methodology and inter-rater reliability.
- The KCG module's approach of manipulating FFN weights during generation lacks theoretical grounding in how semantic concepts map to specific weight dimensions.
- The SCALE dataset, while comprehensive at 18K annotated samples, may not fully capture the diversity of real-world queries across different domains and languages.

## Confidence
- **CAR effectiveness:** High confidence (well-supported by quantitative results showing improved retrieval accuracy)
- **ALSO contribution:** Medium confidence (supported by ablation study showing intermediate bias when removed)
- **KCG component:** Low confidence (weight manipulation approach could introduce artifacts or fluency issues)

## Next Checks
1. **Graph Annotation Validation:** Conduct an inter-rater reliability study on the hierarchical knowledge graph construction process, measuring Cohen's kappa for cognitive level assignments across multiple annotators.
2. **KCG Stability Testing:** Generate 1,000 samples across all cognitive levels with KCG both enabled and disabled, then conduct automated fluency analysis using established metrics.
3. **Cross-Domain Generalization:** Apply CLAF to a new domain (e.g., medical education) with domain experts evaluating cognitive alignment, testing whether improvements transfer beyond original construction domains.
