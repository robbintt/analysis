# Preference Models assume Proportional Hazards of Utilities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.13189
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13189
- Reference count: 3
- Key outcome: This paper establishes a formal connection between the Plackett-Luce model for preference learning and the Cox Proportional Hazards model from survival analysis.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a formal connection between the Plackett-Luce model for preference learning and the Cox Proportional Hazards model from survival analysis. The key insight is that when preference rankings are associated with observed scalar utilities, the Plackett-Luce model assumptions recover exactly the same statistical framework as the Cox Proportional Hazards model. This connection reveals that preference models based on Plackett-Luce (such as Direct Preference Optimization and Bradley-Terry models) are inherently restricted to scenarios where underlying utility functions satisfy the proportional hazards assumption - specifically, when utility distributions are stochastically dominated.

## Method Summary
The paper demonstrates the mathematical equivalence between Plackett-Luce preference models and Cox Proportional Hazards models by showing that both use the same partial likelihood formulation when rankings derive from scalar utilities. The method involves fitting a score function f(x) via maximum partial likelihood estimation, with the option to estimate the baseline hazard non-parametrically using the Breslow estimator when absolute utility data is available. The key contribution is showing that standard preference models implicitly assume proportional hazards of underlying utilities.

## Key Results
- Plackett-Luce models are mathematically equivalent to Cox Proportional Hazards models when rankings derive from scalar utilities
- Preference models based on Plackett-Luce are restricted to scenarios where utility distributions are stochastically dominated
- When absolute utility data is available, baseline hazard can be estimated non-parametrically to recover true utility distribution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The Plackett-Luce model for preference rankings is mathematically equivalent to the partial likelihood in the Cox Proportional Hazards model when rankings derive from scalar utilities. Both models factor the probability of an ordering into a product of softmax-like terms over remaining items. In Cox PH, the partial likelihood conditions on items with utility ≥ current threshold. In Plackett-Luce, the probability of ranking σ is ∏ᵢ exp(f(x_σ(i))) / Σⱼ₌ᵢⁿ exp(f(x_σ(j))). When utility u determines ranking order, the risk set {j : u_j ≥ u_i} equals the set of remaining unranked items.

### Mechanism 2
Plackett-Luce and its derivatives (Bradley-Terry, DPO) can only correctly recover preferences when underlying utility distributions satisfy the proportional hazards assumption—specifically, when one distribution stochastically dominates another. The PH assumption requires hazard ratios that are invariant to the utility threshold. This holds when cumulative distribution functions do not cross. When CDFs cross—e.g., polarizing items where some annotators strongly prefer i and others strongly prefer k—the model cannot represent the true preference structure.

### Mechanism 3
When absolute utility data (e.g., Likert ratings, execution times) is available alongside rankings, the baseline hazard λ₀(u) can be estimated non-parametrically, enabling recovery of the true utility distribution. In Cox PH, λ₀(·) is typically a nuisance parameter. However, with pointwise utility observations, the Breslow estimator provides a non-parametric estimate of the survival function Ŝ₀(u). Combined with the estimated f(·), this yields P(U < u | X = x, f̂), recovering the full conditional utility distribution rather than just relative rankings.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Proportional Hazards Assumption**
  - Why needed here: The central claim is that PL-based preference models implicitly assume PH. Understanding that PH requires constant hazard ratios across utility levels is essential to diagnose when the model will fail.
  - Quick check question: If two items have utility CDFs that cross (item A is preferred at low utility thresholds, item B at high), does the PH assumption hold?

- **Concept: Stochastic Dominance**
  - Why needed here: PH violation often manifests as non-stochastically-dominated utility distributions. Recognizing when F₁(u) ≤ F₂(u) ∀u (first-order dominance) vs. when CDFs cross is key to anticipating model failure modes.
  - Quick check question: Given two utility distributions with crossing CDFs, can a scalar score f(x) correctly rank them under Plackett-Luce?

- **Concept: Partial Likelihood Estimation**
  - Why needed here: The Cox model estimates f(·) via partial likelihood, which conditions on risk sets rather than specifying λ₀. This parallels how PL/DPO learn from relative comparisons without modeling absolute utility scale.
  - Quick check question: Why does the partial likelihood in Equation 4 not require estimating λ₀(u)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Preference data pipeline -> Score function f(x) -> Loss function -> Baseline hazard estimator (optional) -> Downstream use
  - Component map: Preference data pipeline -> Score function f(x) -> Loss function -> Baseline hazard estimator (optional) -> Downstream use

- **Critical path:**
  1. Verify whether preference data has accompanying scalar utilities (ratings, scores)
  2. If rankings only → standard PL/DPO training; acknowledge PH assumption
  3. If ratings available → estimate f(·) and λ₀(u) jointly; use Equation 5 for utility distribution recovery
  4. Validate PH assumption: check for crossing CDFs in held-out utility data

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Ranking-only vs. ranking + ratings: Rankings alone are easier to collect but force reliance on PH assumption; ratings enable baseline estimation but require calibration across annotators
  - Parametric vs. non-parametric baseline: Parametric λ₀(u) is more sample-efficient if correctly specified; Breslow estimator is robust but slower to converge
  - Single-population vs. mixture models: If population heterogeneity is expected, mixture-of-Cox or stratified PH may be needed

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Polarizing items with high variance in annotator preferences → PL may assign near-equal scores despite strong but opposing subpopulation preferences
  - Crossing utility CDFs in validation data → PH assumption violated; consider alternative preference models or mixture approaches
  - Inconsistent reward rankings across different test distributions → May indicate latent heterogeneity not captured by scalar f(x)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. PH assumption diagnostic: On a dataset with Likert ratings, plot empirical CDFs of utilities for item pairs; identify crossing patterns and correlate with PL ranking errors
  2. Baseline hazard ablation: Train reward models with (a) ranking-only PL loss, (b) ranking + Breslow baseline; compare calibration of predicted vs. empirical utility distributions
  3. Heterogeneity stress test: Synthesize preference data from a mixture of two annotator types with opposing utilities; measure degradation of PL recovery vs. oracle mixture model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the non-parametric estimation of baseline hazards from absolute utility data (e.g., pointwise feedback) be effectively integrated into preference modeling to improve accuracy? While the statistical mechanism (Breslow estimator) exists, the paper proposes this integration as a theoretical improvement for AI alignment without providing empirical validation or a specific algorithmic implementation for modern models like DPO.

### Open Question 2
How can AI alignment methods be modified to correctly handle polarizing concepts that violate the proportional hazards assumption? The paper identifies the failure mode (violation of PH assumption) but does not propose a specific solution for ranking-only data where absolute utilities are unavailable to estimate the hazard.

### Open Question 3
What specific semi-parametric statistical methods can be adapted to build better models of human preference beyond the limitations of the Plackett-Luce framework? The author expresses hope that "explicitly stating this connection will help the AI research community build on existing research in semi-parametric statistics to build better models of human preference."

## Limitations
- The equivalence between PL and Cox PH relies on the strong assumption that rankings are generated from scalar utilities via stochastic dominance
- While the Breslow estimator is theoretically valid, its performance in high-dimensional or sparse preference settings remains unclear
- The paper focuses on single-population preference models, but real-world preference data often exhibits heterogeneity

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The mathematical equivalence between Plackett-Luce partial likelihood and Cox Proportional Hazards partial likelihood is well-established in the statistical literature and correctly applied here.

**Medium confidence:** The claim that PL models fail when utility distributions cross is theoretically sound, but empirical validation in real-world preference datasets would strengthen this claim.

**Medium confidence:** The ability to recover true utility distributions using non-parametric baseline estimation is theoretically valid, but practical challenges around sample efficiency, scale calibration, and censoring are not addressed.

## Next Checks

1. **PH assumption diagnostic:** Using a real-world preference dataset with Likert ratings (e.g., movie ratings, product reviews), plot empirical CDFs of utilities for item pairs and systematically identify crossing patterns. Measure the correlation between PH violations and ranking errors in PL-trained reward models.

2. **Baseline hazard ablation study:** Train reward models on preference data with and without accompanying ratings. For the ratings-available case, implement Breslow estimator to recover utility distributions. Compare calibration metrics (e.g., reliability diagrams) between models that only learn relative preferences versus those that recover absolute utility scales.

3. **Heterogeneity stress test:** Generate synthetic preference data from a mixture of two annotator types with opposing utilities (e.g., mixture weights 0.5/0.5, utilities drawn from N(μ₁,σ²) and N(μ₂,σ²) with μ₁ > μ₂). Compare PL recovery performance against a mixture-of-Cox baseline, measuring preference ranking accuracy and utility distribution recovery error.
