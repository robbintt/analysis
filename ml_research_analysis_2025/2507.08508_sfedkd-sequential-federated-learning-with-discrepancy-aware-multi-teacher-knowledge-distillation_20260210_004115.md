# SFedKD: Sequential Federated Learning with DiscrepancyAware MultiTeacher Knowledge Distillation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.08508
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08508
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Sequential federated learning framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation achieving 1.81-6.40% accuracy improvements over sequential methods and 17.53-29.08% over parallel methods

## Executive Summary
SFedKD addresses catastrophic forgetting in sequential federated learning by extending single-teacher decoupled knowledge distillation to a multi-teacher setting. The framework introduces a novel discrepancy-aware weighting mechanism that assigns different importance to target-class and non-target-class knowledge based on class distributional differences between teacher and student data. A complementary-based teacher selection mechanism prevents knowledge dilution by solving a maximum coverage problem through a greedy strategy. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to both sequential and parallel federated learning methods, with better model consistency and faster convergence in heterogeneous environments.

## Method Summary
The SFedKD framework operates through a sequential federated learning paradigm where each client learns from multiple teachers rather than a single source. The core innovation lies in the discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, which assigns distinct weights to teachers' knowledge based on the distributional differences between teacher and student data. The framework implements a complementary-based teacher selection mechanism to prevent knowledge dilution, formulated as a maximum coverage problem and solved using a greedy strategy. This approach effectively balances learning new knowledge while preserving previously acquired information, addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem common in sequential learning scenarios.

## Key Results
- Accuracy improvements of 1.81% to 6.40% over existing sequential federated learning methods
- Performance gains of 17.53% to 29.08% over parallel federated learning methods
- Superior model consistency and faster convergence demonstrated across five datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CINIC-10, CIFAR-100, HAM10000)
- Effective balance between learning new knowledge and preserving previously acquired information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to dynamically weight teacher knowledge based on class distributional discrepancies, allowing the student model to prioritize relevant information while minimizing interference from irrelevant knowledge. The multi-teacher approach with complementary selection ensures diverse knowledge coverage while preventing dilution from redundant information. By decoupling knowledge distillation into target-class and non-target-class components, the system can better manage the trade-off between plasticity (learning new information) and stability (preserving old knowledge), which is fundamental to preventing catastrophic forgetting in sequential learning scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

**Catastrophic Forgetting**: The tendency of neural networks to rapidly forget previously learned information when trained on new tasks. *Why needed*: Forms the core problem that SFedKD addresses in sequential federated learning. *Quick check*: Observe accuracy drop on previous tasks when training on new tasks in standard sequential learning.

**Knowledge Distillation**: A technique where a student model learns from a teacher model by mimicking its output distributions. *Why needed*: Enables knowledge transfer between models without sharing raw data, crucial for federated learning privacy requirements. *Quick check*: Compare student performance when trained with and without teacher supervision.

**Maximum Coverage Problem**: An optimization problem that seeks to select k subsets from a collection to maximize the total covered elements. *Why needed*: Forms the basis for the teacher selection mechanism to ensure diverse knowledge coverage. *Quick check*: Verify that selected teacher subsets cover a larger portion of the knowledge space than random selection.

**Class Distribution Discrepancy**: The difference in class proportions between teacher and student data distributions. *Why needed*: Enables adaptive weighting of teacher knowledge based on relevance to the student's learning context. *Quick check*: Measure performance improvement when using discrepancy-aware weighting versus uniform weighting.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Client -> Teacher Selection (Max Coverage) -> Discrepancy Analysis -> Weighted Knowledge Distillation -> Model Update -> Next Client

**Critical Path**: The sequence from teacher selection through discrepancy analysis to weighted knowledge distillation represents the most critical path, as errors in any of these steps directly impact the quality of knowledge transfer and overall model performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead from multiple teachers and discrepancy analysis against improved learning stability and performance. The greedy solution to the maximum coverage problem provides computational efficiency at the cost of potentially suboptimal teacher selection.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when teacher data distributions significantly differ from student data, excessive computation time due to large teacher pools, and potential knowledge dilution if teacher selection fails to ensure complementarity.

**First Experiments**:
1. Benchmark accuracy on Fashion-MNIST with varying numbers of teachers to validate the complementary selection mechanism
2. Compare discrepancy-aware weighting versus uniform weighting on CIFAR-10 to demonstrate the importance of adaptive knowledge transfer
3. Test catastrophic forgetting resistance by evaluating performance on previously seen classes after training on new classes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Assumes reliable estimation of class distribution differences between teacher and student data, which may be challenging in highly heterogeneous or privacy-constrained settings
- Greedy teacher selection provides only approximate solutions to the maximum coverage problem and may not identify globally optimal teacher subsets
- Effectiveness across diverse model architectures beyond tested CNNs and ResNet remains unverified

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in empirical results and performance improvements across tested datasets
- **Medium confidence** in theoretical soundness of discrepancy-aware weighting and teacher selection mechanisms given approximations involved
- **Low confidence** in generalizability to other model architectures, dataset types, and extreme heterogeneity scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test framework performance when client data distributions are completely unknown or only partially observable, simulating stricter privacy constraints
2. Evaluate method effectiveness with transformer-based architectures and other non-standard model types common in modern federated learning
3. Assess scalability and performance degradation when number of clients increases significantly beyond tested scenarios (e.g., 100+ clients)
