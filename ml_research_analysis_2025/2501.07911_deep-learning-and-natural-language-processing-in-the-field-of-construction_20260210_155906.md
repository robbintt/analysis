# Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing in the Field of Construction

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07911

- Primary result: Fine-tuned CamemBERT achieved 91.6% F1 for hypernym detection in French construction terminology

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the application of deep learning and NLP techniques to terminology extraction and hypernym relationship detection in the construction domain. The authors develop a multi-stage methodology for extracting domain-specific terminology from technical specifications, combining statistical analysis, linguistic patterns, and Internet queries. For hypernym detection, they compare classical embedding-based approaches with transformer models, demonstrating that fine-tuned CamemBERT outperforms other methods with 91.6% F1-score on a French construction-specific dataset.

## Method Summary
The methodology consists of two main components: terminology extraction and hypernym detection. For terminology, the authors extract n-grams from technical specifications, apply linguistic pattern filtering (NOUN-NOUN, NOUN-PREP-NOUN), prune candidates using Bing search query counts (threshold ≥10), and rank results using Z-scores against a generic corpus. For hypernym detection, they compare four composition methods (concat, product, diff, conjunction) with classical classifiers (SVM, Random Forests, MLP) using static embeddings, and evaluate transformer-based models (RoBERTa, CamemBERT, Llama-2, Mistral) fine-tuned end-to-end on labeled term pairs.

## Key Results
- Terminology extraction achieved 0.91 flexible evaluation accuracy through multi-stage pruning
- Classical embedding+classifier approaches (SVM + fastText) reached 84.91 F1 on VOCAGEN dataset
- Fine-tuned CamemBERT achieved best performance at 91.61±0.74 F1 on large embedding setting
- Web query pruning with threshold ≥10 significantly improved terminology precision
- POS pattern filtering (NOUN-NOUN, NOUN-PREP-NOUN) effectively reduced noise in n-gram extraction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multi-stage terminology extraction with statistical, linguistic, and web-based pruning yields high-precision domain terms. N-gram extraction → linguistic pattern filtering → internet query validation → Z-score ranking progressively eliminates noise while retaining domain-specific collocations. Core assumption: domain-relevant multi-word terms follow predictable POS patterns and appear in web search results. Break condition: novel or proprietary terms absent from web indices will have reduced recall.

### Mechanism 2
Vector composition operations (especially difference vectors) combined with classical classifiers can encode hypernym relationships. Embedding vectors for term pairs are composed via operations like y−x, and classifiers learn to distinguish hypernym pairs from non-hypernym pairs. Core assumption: hypernymy is encoded in the geometric relationship between word vectors; the difference vector captures directional semantic inclusion. Break condition: polysemous terms or domain-specific jargon with poorly estimated embeddings degrade accuracy.

### Mechanism 3
Fine-tuned transformer models outperform classical embedding+classifier pipelines for hypernym detection in specialized domains. Pre-trained masked language models are fine-tuned end-to-end on labeled hypernym pairs. Contextualized embeddings capture richer semantic relationships than static embeddings, and fine-tuning adapts these to the target task. Core assumption: pre-training corpus contains sufficient semantic knowledge transferable to hypernym detection. Break condition: target domain terminology largely absent from pre-training corpus with limited fine-tuning data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Distributional Semantics (Word Embeddings)**
  - Why needed here: Both embedding-based and transformer approaches rely on the principle that words with similar contexts have similar vector representations. Understanding how embeddings capture semantic relationships is prerequisite to interpreting why y−x might encode hypernymy.
  - Quick check question: Given embeddings for "kitchen" and "room," would you expect their difference vector to point in a direction similar to "bathroom" − "room"? Why or why not?

- **Concept: Taxonomic vs. Non-Taxonomic Relations**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly filters for "is-a" relationships (hypernymy) but notes that training data contains noise from "part-of" and other relations. Distinguishing these relation types is critical for dataset curation and error analysis.
  - Quick check question: Is "wheel" a hypernym or meronym of "car"? How would you label the pair (wheel, car) in a training dataset?

- **Concept: Masked vs. Causal Language Models**
  - Why needed here: The paper experiments with both masked models (CamemBERT, RoBERTa) and causal LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral). These architectures process input differently and may suit classification tasks differently.
  - Quick check question: Why might a bidirectional masked model outperform a left-to-right causal model for detecting whether (x, y) forms a hypernym pair?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Corpus collection → Preprocessing → N-gram extraction → POS tagging → Linguistic pattern filtering → Web query pruning → Z-score ranking → Manual evaluation → Hypernym pair labeling → Model training/fine-tuning → Inference

- **Critical path:** Corpus collection → Preprocessing → N-gram extraction → Pattern filtering → Web pruning → Z-score ranking → Manual evaluation → Hypernym pair labeling → Model training/fine-tuning → Inference on new term pairs

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Web query pruning: Improves precision but introduces latency and dependency on external API; threshold tuning is corpus-dependent
  - Static embeddings vs. transformers: Static embeddings are faster to train and inference, but transformers achieve higher F1 (91.6 vs. ~85) at cost of GPU requirements and longer training
  - Dataset balance: Authors generate negative pairs by random pairing; this may not reflect realistic hard negatives, potentially inflating performance

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Ambiguous terms: "coiffeuse" (vanity table vs. hairdresser) causes misclassification; consider sense-disambiguation preprocessing
  - Incomplete n-grams: "personne à mobilité" truncated from "personne à mobilité réduite"; adjust n-gram range or add n-gram completion heuristic
  - Out-of-domain web presence: Terms like "engin de guerre" appear due to legal text in CCTP; add domain-specific stoplist or constrain web search to construction-focused sources

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline: Replicate the embedding+classifier pipeline (fastText + SVM, diff composition) on VOCAGEN dataset; measure F1, precision, recall
  2. Ablation: Remove the web query pruning step and compare Z-score ranking alone vs. full pipeline on a held-out subset; quantify precision/recall tradeoff
  3. Model swap: Replace CamemBERT with a smaller model (CamemBERT-base vs. -large) and measure performance drop vs. inference speedup

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can an ensemble approach merging the outputs of distinct algorithms improve hypernym detection accuracy?
- Does utilizing an existing partner knowledge model as input enhance the system's prediction capabilities?
- Why did the domain-specific word embedding models underperform compared to generic models, and can this be remedied?

## Limitations
- VOCAGEN dataset and exact CCTP corpus are not publicly available, limiting reproducibility
- Random pairing to generate negative hypernym examples may not reflect realistic semantic relationships
- Results may not transfer to other specialized domains without sufficient fine-tuning data

## Confidence
- High confidence: Superior performance of fine-tuned CamemBERT (91.6% F1) over classical embedding-based methods
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of multi-stage terminology extraction pipeline (0.91 flexible accuracy)
- Low confidence: Claims about necessity of web query pruning without direct ablation validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation study removing web query pruning step to quantify its actual contribution
2. Apply best hypernym detection model to a different specialized domain (medical or legal) to test generalizability
3. Compare random negative sampling against hard negative mining strategies to determine if F1 scores are inflated
