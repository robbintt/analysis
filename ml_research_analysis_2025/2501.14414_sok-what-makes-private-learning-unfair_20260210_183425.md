# SoK: What Makes Private Learning Unfair?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.14414
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14414
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Systematic categorization of DP-induced unfairness factors into four layers (DP technique, ML algorithm, dataset, distribution), with causal analysis identifying dataset size and group distance to decision boundary as likely necessary conditions, while noise addition is the only necessary factor in the DP layer.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically analyzes factors contributing to differential privacy-induced unfairness in machine learning, organizing them into four layers: DP technique, ML algorithm & hyperparameters, training dataset, and underlying distribution. The authors conduct a causal analysis identifying that dataset size and group distance to the decision boundary are likely necessary conditions for unfairness exacerbation, while DP noise addition is the only necessary factor within the DP technique layer. They review existing mitigation strategies, highlighting limitations such as group label disclosure requirements, repeated data querying, and increased computational costs. The survey reveals that most mitigation efforts focus on the DP layer rather than addressing fundamental issues in the dataset and distribution layers, suggesting future research should target these lower layers.

## Key Results
- Gradient clipping in DP-SGD disproportionately harms underrepresented groups with larger gradient norms, causing directional and magnitude errors
- DP noise perturbs decision boundaries, disproportionately increasing misclassification for groups closer to those boundaries
- Smaller training datasets amplify noise sensitivity, increasing fairness disparities at a rate proportional to model parameters over dataset size (p/n)
- Most existing mitigation strategies focus on the DP layer rather than addressing fundamental issues in dataset and distribution layers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Gradient Clipping Induces Directional and Magnitude Errors
- Claim: The uniform gradient clipping threshold in DP-SGD disproportionately harms underrepresented or complex-distribution groups, exacerbating accuracy and risk disparities.
- Mechanism: A fixed clipping threshold (C) is applied to all per-sample gradients. Groups with larger average gradient norms (often minority groups) experience more frequent and severe clipping. This leads to two errors: magnitude reduction (smaller updates) and directional misalignment (changing the update vector's direction), distorting their contribution to model updates compared to groups with smaller gradients.
- Core assumption: Underrepresented groups have larger average gradient norms than majority groups, or their learning dynamics require larger gradient steps for equal convergence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-A] Describes Xu et al.'s finding that uniform clipping leads to uneven privacy-utility trade-offs for groups with larger gradients, and Esipova et al.'s conclusion that direction errors dominate magnitude errors in exacerbating disparity.
  - [abstract] States DP can "amplify existing disparities in its predictive performance across demographic groups."
  - [corpus] The paper *Mitigating Disparate Impact of Differentially Private Learning through Bounded Adaptive Clipping* proposes a direct fix for this mechanism, suggesting it is a recognized dominant source of disparate impact.
- Break condition: If group gradient norms are equalized before clipping (e.g., via input normalization) or if an adaptive, group-specific clipping threshold is used (as in DPSGD-F), this mechanism's contribution to disparity should diminish.

### Mechanism 2: DP Noise Perturbs Decision Boundaries Relative to Group Distances
- Claim: The necessary addition of noise for differential privacy perturbs the model's learned decision boundary, disproportionately increasing misclassification for groups whose data is closer to that boundary.
- Mechanism: DP-SGD adds calibrated noise to gradients, introducing variance into the learned decision boundary's position. Groups with data points closer to the boundary have a higher baseline risk of misclassification. The noise-induced perturbation shifts the boundary, causing a larger proportion of these "marginal" points to be misclassified compared to groups whose data is safely distant from the boundary.
- Core assumption: Different demographic groups have different average distances to the optimal decision boundary in the feature space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-D] Identifies "group distance to the decision boundary" as a key factor, stating groups closer to the boundary are more affected by noise-induced shifts.
  - [section V] Concludes that noise addition is the *only* necessary factor in the DP layer for exacerbation to occur, as it is intrinsic to the definition of DP.
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak for this specific geometric interpretation; the link is primarily derived from the surveyed papers' theoretical analysis.
- Break condition: If all groups are equidistant from the decision boundary, or if the noise magnitude is negligible (e.g., by using a very large dataset), the disparate impact of this mechanism should approach zero.

### Mechanism 3: Small Dataset Size Amplifies Noise Sensitivity
- Claim: A smaller training dataset increases the sensitivity of the learning algorithm, which necessitates larger DP noise for the same privacy guarantee, thereby amplifying performance disparities.
- Mechanism: The sensitivity (maximum impact of one data point) is inversely related to dataset size (n). For smaller n, higher sensitivity requires a larger noise scale (σ) to satisfy the privacy budget. This increased noise amplifies Mechanisms 1 and 2, leading to a larger disparity gap. The paper proves a bound showing disparity decreases at a rate proportional to model parameters over dataset size (p/n).
- Core assumption: The added noise scale is calibrated for total privacy loss and is not perfectly calibrated to equalize excess risk across groups.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-C] Theoretically and empirically links smaller dataset size to larger disparity, noting convergence to non-private disparity as n increases.
  - [section V] Identifies small dataset size as a "likely necessary condition" for unfairness exacerbation to manifest.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence contradicts this; it is a fundamental property of DP mechanisms.
- Break condition: As dataset size increases for a fixed model complexity, the noise scale decreases, reducing the disparity gap.

## Foundational Learning
- **Concept: Differential Privacy (DP) in Machine Learning**
  - Why needed here: This is the core intervention studied. The entire analysis is about how the mechanics of DP-SGD (clipping, noise) cause unfairness. Without understanding the baseline goal (protecting training data membership) and the standard mechanism (gradient perturbation), the analysis of its side effects is meaningless.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how DP-SGD modifies a standard SGD step to achieve a privacy guarantee?
- **Concept: Group Fairness Metrics (e.g., Accuracy Parity)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's outcome is "unfairness," defined by specific metrics. To understand the "exacerbation," one must first understand the baseline definitions of fairness (e.g., M(hθ; A) - M(hθ; B) from Eq. 3) and how they quantify disparity between groups A and B.
  - Quick check question: What does a non-zero value for M(hθ; A) - M(hθ; B) represent, and if this value increases after applying DP, what does it imply?
- **Concept: Decision Boundary Geometry**
  - Why needed here: Two key causal factors (group distance to boundary, noise perturbation) rely on a geometric interpretation of classification. Understanding that groups may lie at different distances from the decision boundary is crucial for grasping why noise has a disparate impact.
  - Quick check question: If group A's data points are, on average, closer to the decision boundary than group B's, and a fixed amount of noise is added to the boundary's position, which group's classification accuracy is likely to be more affected and why?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Underlying Distribution → Training Dataset → ML Algorithm & Hyperparameters → DP Technique (e.g., DP-SGD)
- **Critical path:** 1) Distribution & Dataset Layers determine "Distance to Decision Boundary" and "Dataset Size," establishing vulnerability. 2) DP Layer's Noise Addition (necessary factor) perturbs the decision boundary. 3) The vulnerability from (1) interacts with the perturbation from (2). 4) Gradient Clipping can further distort updates for groups with large gradients, compounding disparity.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Dataset Size vs. Privacy Utility (increasing size is most effective mitigation but often infeasible); Mitigation Complexity vs. Practicality (effective mitigations often require sensitive group labels); Model Capacity vs. Fairness (simpler models may attenuate disparity but at cost of utility).
- **Failure signatures:** Disparate Impact (widening gap in performance metrics between groups after DP); Minority Utility Collapse (underrepresented groups show disproportionately large accuracy drop); Clipping Saturation (complex/minority groups' gradients constantly clipped, destroying information content).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Quantify Baseline Disparity: Train baseline (non-private) and DP-SGD models on same dataset. Measure fairness metrics for both. Confirm if DP exacerbates gap.
  2. Isolate Layer Contributions: Run ablation studies. a) Vary only dataset size while keeping privacy budget constant to test Mechanism 3. b) Vary clipping threshold to test Mechanism 1.
  3. Test Decision Boundary Proximity: Using baseline model, compute average distance of each group's data points to decision boundary. Correlate this distance with magnitude of utility loss observed for that group under DP to validate Mechanism 2.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The causal analysis relies heavily on theoretical models and aggregated empirical evidence rather than systematic ablation studies across all datasets and model architectures
- Confidence in mechanisms as necessary conditions is limited by lack of direct experimental validation
- Focus on DP-SGD may not generalize to other DP techniques like PATE or different DP-SGD variants
- Survey lacks direct empirical validation of the geometric interpretation of group distance to decision boundary across multiple datasets

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** DP noise addition is a necessary factor for unfairness exacerbation within the DP layer (definitionally true as noise is intrinsic to DP)
- **Medium Confidence:** Gradient clipping as a significant contributor to directional and magnitude errors (based on Xu et al. and Esipova et al.'s findings)
- **Medium Confidence:** Theoretical link between small dataset size and increased disparity (supported by bound showing disparity decreases as p/n increases)
- **Low Confidence:** Geometric interpretation of group distance to decision boundary as a primary causal factor (lacks direct empirical validation across multiple datasets)

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on Dataset Size:** Systematically vary dataset size (n) across orders of magnitude while keeping all other factors constant. Measure change in fairness metrics to confirm theoretical bound that disparity decreases as p/n increases.
2. **Decision Boundary Proximity Validation:** For a given dataset and model, compute average distance of each group's data points to learned decision boundary. Train models with and without DP, then correlate group distance with magnitude of utility loss to validate geometric mechanism.
3. **Gradient Norm Analysis:** For each demographic group, calculate average per-sample gradient norm during training. Compare this with clipping threshold and resulting accuracy drop to quantify contribution of gradient clipping to unfairness.
