# Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs): An Application-Oriented Survey on RAG, Reasoning, and Agentic Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24476
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24476
- Reference count: 40
- This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of hallucination mitigation in large language models (LLMs), focusing on capability enhancement through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), reasoning augmentation, and their integration in Agentic Systems.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines hallucination mitigation strategies in LLMs by establishing a taxonomy that distinguishes knowledge-based hallucinations (factual errors) from logic-based hallucinations (reasoning failures). The paper presents a unified framework covering RAG, reasoning augmentation, and their integration in Agentic Systems, while highlighting applications across healthcare, law, finance, and education. It identifies key challenges including efficiency trade-offs, multi-modal hallucinations, and the need for standardized evaluation methods. The survey concludes that future progress requires systematic frameworks integrating retrieval and reasoning, supported by multi-dimensional detection and verification mechanisms to build LLMs that are both reliable and aligned with real-world application demands.

## Method Summary
The survey constructs a comprehensive taxonomy of hallucination mitigation strategies through systematic literature review. It organizes approaches into RAG-based methods (precise and broad retrieval), reasoning-based methods (CoT, tool-augmented, and symbolic), and their integration in Agentic Systems. The framework covers the full pipeline from intent understanding through retrieval, reasoning, and verification. The survey evaluates these approaches across application domains and benchmarks, identifying open challenges and future research directions. While the paper describes conceptual frameworks rather than specific implementations, it provides sufficient detail for practical reproduction of core components.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates *knowledge-based* hallucinations by grounding generation in external, verifiable sources rather than static parametric memory.
- **Mechanism:** The system retrieves documents relevant to a query and concatenates them with the input prompt. This forces the LLM to attend to specific context, reducing the probability of fabricating facts (e.g., inventing professional terms or misattributing discoveries).
- **Core assumption:** The retriever successfully identifies relevant, high-quality documents, and the generator correctly attends to this context over its internal weights.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] RAG expands knowledge boundaries... enabling access to up-to-date, accurate information.
  - [Section IV] "RAG effectively supplements factual knowledge... reducing factual errors caused by missing or outdated knowledge."
  - [corpus] "Removal of Hallucination on Hallucination" highlights that erroneous retrieval can mislead generation, reinforcing the dependency on retrieval quality.
- **Break condition:** Retrieval failure (noise or irrelevant docs) introduces "context contamination," causing the model to hallucinate based on wrong evidence.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Structured reasoning chains mitigate *logic-based* hallucinations by exposing intermediate steps and verifying causal links.
- **Mechanism:** Methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or Symbolic Reasoning decompose complex queries into sub-steps. This process audits the "reasoning chain" (e.g., mathematical derivations or logical deduction), preventing the model from making "reasoning leaps" that lead to incorrect conclusions despite correct premises.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM possesses sufficient inherent capability to follow the structured prompt or utilize the symbolic solver interface without deviating.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] Reasoning techniques help prevent logic-based hallucinations arising from broken or inconsistent reasoning chains.
  - [Section V] "CoT effectively mitigates logical hallucinations caused by issues such as skipped reasoning steps and causal confusion."
  - [corpus] Weak external evidence; mechanism relies primarily on the survey's synthesis of internal model dynamics.
- **Break condition:** "Overthinking" or excessive reasoning depth causes the model to dwell on irrelevant paths, introducing new errors or redundancy.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Agentic Systems mitigate *composite* hallucinations by integrating retrieval (knowledge) and reasoning (logic) within a dynamic planning loop.
- **Mechanism:** An agent decomposes a task, uses tools (like search) to fetch specific knowledge, and performs reasoning steps sequentially. If a step fails or information is missing, the agent can reflect and replan, addressing both factual gaps and logical flaws iteratively.
- **Core assumption:** The agent's planning module can effectively coordinate sub-tasks, and error propagation does not cascade through the multi-step workflow.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] Future progress requires systematic frameworks integrating retrieval and reasoning... supported by multi-dimensional detection.
  - [Section VI] "Agentic Systems... integrate retrieval for factual grounding with structured reasoning for logical consistency."
  - [corpus] "RAG-KG-IL" supports the efficacy of integrating RAG and Knowledge Graphs in multi-agent frameworks to reduce hallucinations.
- **Break condition:** Error accumulation across modules (e.g., a retrieval error misguiding the planner) leads to compounding failures.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Knowledge-based vs. Logic-based Hallucinations
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's central taxonomy dictates the solution strategy. You cannot fix a logic error (wrong deduction) solely with RAG, nor a factual gap with just CoT.
  - **Quick check question:** If an LLM correctly cites a law but misapplies it to the case facts, is this knowledge-based or logic-based? (Answer: Logic-based).

- **Concept:** "Lost-in-the-Middle" Phenomenon
  - **Why needed here:** Critical for RAG implementation. Models often ignore relevant information placed in the middle of a long context window.
  - **Quick check question:** Where should the most critical retrieved documents be placed in the prompt? (Answer: Beginning or end).

- **Concept:** Neuro-symbolic Integration
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how LLMs interface with strict logic engines (e.g., Python interpreters, solvers) explains how *Symbolic Reasoning* guarantees correctness where probabilistic text generation might fail.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does converting natural language to symbolic form improve math problem accuracy? (Answer: It shifts execution from probabilistic prediction to deterministic calculation).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - **RAG Module:** Query Rewriter -> Retriever (Sparse/Dense/Hybrid) -> Reranker -> Context Window
  - **Reasoning Module:** Prompt Engineer (CoT) or Tool Broker (API calls to calculators/search)
  - **Agent Core:** Planner -> Memory -> Tool Executor -> Reflector

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Intent Understanding (Pre-retrieval):** Accurate query rewriting is the highest leverage point; ambiguous queries lead to irrelevant retrieval.
  2. **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combining Sparse (keywords) and Dense (semantic) signals ensures robustness against vocabulary mismatch.
  3. **Verification (Post-retrieval/Reasoning):** Using "post-hoc checking" or "self-consistency" to validate outputs against retrieved evidence.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Precision vs. Breadth:** "Precise Retrieval" (Graph-RAG/KG) is better for domain-specific stability; "Broad Retrieval" (Web Search) is better for general coverage but introduces noise.
  - **Latency vs. Reliability:** Agentic loops (iterative retrieval/reasoning) increase accuracy but significantly raise latency and compute cost.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Hallucination on Hallucination:** Retrieving AI-generated or synthetic content from the web and treating it as ground truth.
  - **Context Contamination:** The model generates an answer that contradicts the retrieved documents because it prioritizes its internal parametric memory over the provided context.
  - **Overthinking:** Excessive CoT steps that drift away from the user's original intent, creating verbose but irrelevant logic chains.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline RAG:** Implement a standard Dense Retriever + LLM pipeline. Measure hallucination rate on a factual dataset (e.g., TruthfulQA) to establish a floor.
  2. **Hybrid RAG:** Add a Sparse Retriever (BM25) and a Reranker to the pipeline. Compare performance to see if lexical anchoring reduces "fabricated terminology" hallucinations.
  3. **Agentic Step:** Wrap the Hybrid RAG system in a ReAct (Reason + Act) loop. Allow the system to perform "self-correction" if the initial retrieval doesn't answer the query. Verify if logic-based errors decrease.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning be dynamically regulated to prevent "overthinking" while maintaining logical consistency?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] Section VIII.A notes CoT is prone to the challenge of "overthinking," requiring dynamic adjustment of reasoning depth to balance conciseness and thoroughness.
- **Why unresolved:** Current CoT methods lack self-regulation mechanisms to distinguish between necessary detail and redundant, error-prone reasoning paths.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of mechanisms that dynamically truncate or extend reasoning chains based on task complexity without degrading accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can RAG pipelines be modified to prevent retrieval failures or noisy data from becoming new sources of hallucination?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] Section VIII.A warns that without robust pipelines, RAG risks falling into a paradox of "mitigating hallucinations with hallucinations."
- **Why unresolved:** Models struggle to distinguish between retrieved "evidence" and noise, often leading to fact-contradictory generation based on bad retrieval.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Integration of robust source-credibility scoring that demonstrably reduces hallucinations even when fed corrupted retrieval data.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What standardized benchmarks are needed to evaluate composite hallucinations in agentic systems involving both retrieval and reasoning?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] Section VII.D states that existing benchmarks remain limited, with few jointly measuring knowledge- and logic-based hallucinations in agentic LLMs.
- **Why unresolved:** Current benchmarks focus on static outputs rather than end-to-end, process-level evaluation of dynamic tool-use workflows.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A benchmark suite that quantifies hallucination rates at every stage of an agent's execution path (planning, retrieval, synthesis).

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of post-hoc verification methods is assumed but not thoroughly benchmarked
- Integration of RAG and reasoning in Agentic Systems lacks specific implementation details and empirical validation across diverse domains
- The proposed solutions are largely theoretical frameworks rather than tested systems

## Confidence
- **High**: The taxonomy distinguishing knowledge-based from logic-based hallucinations is well-supported and actionable
- **Medium**: The mechanisms of RAG and reasoning augmentation are theoretically grounded but lack comprehensive empirical validation
- **Low**: The effectiveness of Agentic Systems in real-world applications remains largely unproven with limited case studies

## Next Checks
1. **Benchmark Validation**: Implement and test the proposed Hybrid RAG + Tool-Augmented Reasoning pipeline on TruthfulQA and LogicBench to measure actual hallucination reduction compared to baseline models.

2. **Real-World Application Test**: Deploy the Agentic System framework in a controlled healthcare or legal domain setting to evaluate practical effectiveness and identify domain-specific failure modes.

3. **Verification Method Evaluation**: Conduct ablation studies comparing different post-hoc verification techniques (self-consistency, debate-based, evidence scoring) to determine which provides the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.
