# Practical considerations when designing an online learning algorithm for an app-based mHealth intervention

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.08719
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08719
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposed contextual bandit algorithm balances exploration/exploitation for app notifications, achieving acceptable cumulative regret in simulations while being computationally tractable for mHealth trial deployment

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the practical challenges of designing an online learning algorithm for a mobile health (mHealth) intervention trial. The authors developed a reinforcement learning approach using contextual bandits to optimize app-based notifications in the LowSalt4Life 2 trial, which aimed to reduce sodium intake among hypertensive individuals. The algorithm sends notifications when participants are likely to open the app within 30 minutes, balancing exploration and exploitation while addressing practical constraints like computational cost and data quality.

The study highlights key challenges in implementing adaptive algorithms in real-world health interventions, including defining appropriate reward structures, determining optimization timescales, specifying robust statistical models, and handling missing data. Through simulation studies, the proposed algorithm demonstrated competitive performance against simpler and more complex alternatives while maintaining computational feasibility for actual trial deployment. The work provides valuable insights for researchers designing similar adaptive mHealth interventions.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a contextual bandit algorithm to optimize push notification timing for a mobile health app. The algorithm uses logistic regression with weakly informative priors to predict whether users will open the app within 30 minutes of receiving a notification, incorporating participant-specific features and contextual information. The model employs Thompson sampling for exploration-exploitation trade-off, with an optimization cycle running every two months to balance computational cost with learning effectiveness.

The statistical framework uses a hierarchical logistic regression model with participant-level random effects, implemented via Stan with NUTS sampling. The algorithm operates by first sampling from the posterior distribution of model parameters, then using these samples to make probabilistic decisions about notification timing. Key design decisions included using app engagement as a proxy reward for sodium reduction behavior, setting a two-month optimization period, and implementing weakly informative priors to handle separation and missing data issues common in mobile health studies.

## Key Results
- The proposed algorithm achieved acceptable cumulative regret across two simulation settings - one without contextual moderators and one with strong moderators
- Algorithm performance was comparable to both simpler and more complex alternatives while maintaining computational tractability for deployment
- The weakly informative prior specification successfully handled separation and missing data issues in the hierarchical logistic regression model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by leveraging contextual information to make personalized notification decisions that maximize user engagement. By using Thompson sampling, the algorithm maintains an appropriate balance between exploiting known effective strategies and exploring potentially better alternatives. The hierarchical model structure allows for personalization while sharing information across participants, and the two-month optimization cycle provides sufficient data for stable parameter estimation without excessive computational burden.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contextual Bandits:** Why needed - to personalize intervention delivery based on user characteristics and context; Quick check - algorithm explores/exploits based on posterior samples
- **Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling:** Why needed - to handle participant heterogeneity while borrowing strength across users; Quick check - random effects structure with weakly informative priors
- **Thompson Sampling:** Why needed - to balance exploration and exploitation in uncertain environments; Quick check - posterior sampling drives decision-making
- **Proximal Rewards:** Why needed - to use available engagement data as proxy for ultimate health outcomes; Quick check - app opens within 30 minutes as reward signal
- **Computational Scalability:** Why needed - to ensure algorithm runs efficiently in real-time trial conditions; Quick check - two-month optimization cycles reduce computational load
- **Missing Data Handling:** Why needed - mobile health data often has irregular collection patterns; Quick check - weakly informative priors accommodate incomplete data

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** User features -> Hierarchical Model -> Posterior Sampling -> Thompson Sampling -> Notification Decision -> Engagement Data -> Reward Update

**Critical Path:** User context → Model prediction → Thompson sampling → Decision → User response → Reward calculation → Model update

**Design Tradeoffs:** Computational cost vs. learning frequency (2-month cycles), model complexity vs. interpretability, exploration rate vs. user experience, proxy reward vs. true outcome measurement

**Failure Signatures:** Poor engagement → model uncertainty increases → exploration dominates → notification fatigue → disengagement → reward signal weakens

**First Experiments:** 1) A/B test with fixed notification schedule to establish baseline engagement, 2) Pilot with small user subset to validate reward structure, 3) Stress test with simulated missing data to verify robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Does proximal app engagement remain a valid proxy for the target behavior (making low-sodium choices) throughout the entire intervention, particularly in later stages where successful behavior change might reduce app dependency?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.1 states that in the final month of the study, if the intervention is successful, participants may use the app less while maintaining behavior, meaning "proximal app engagement will no longer be a good proxy." The authors explicitly call for a "critical analysis" to assess this suitability post-trial.
- Why unresolved: The trial was ongoing at the time of writing, and the correlation between the surrogate reward and the true behavioral outcome over time could not yet be assessed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Post-hoc analyses of the LS4L2 trial data correlating longitudinal patterns of app engagement with actual dietary sodium intake measurements (e.g., urinary sodium excretion).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, such as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) or penalty-based bandits, significantly outperform myopic contextual bandits in mHealth settings by better accounting for delayed effects like habituation and burden?
- Basis in paper: Section 5 (Discussion) states, "Contextual bandit algorithms are myopic... we may consider adding a penalty... Alternatively, we may consider using discounted reward or long-term average reward Markov Decision Process approaches."
- Why unresolved: While the authors identify this as a limitation of the current approach, they note that MDP approaches typically require significantly more data to learn effective policies than was available or feasible for the current trial design.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative simulation studies or subsequent trials that implement MDP-based algorithms and measure long-term user retention and habituation rates against the myopic contextual bandit baseline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can scalable approximate Bayesian methods or federated learning techniques successfully replace computationally expensive hierarchical models in large-scale mHealth trials without sacrificing the stability or personalization of the learning algorithm?
- Basis in paper: Section 5 identifies "computation and online data storage" as a critical area for future work as study sizes grow, specifically proposing "Scalable, approximate Bayesian methods... as well as federated learning techniques" to avoid fitting expensive hierarchical models.
- Why unresolved: The current study employed a computationally intensive hierarchical Bayesian model; the feasibility and performance stability of the proposed scalable alternatives in this specific context remain untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking studies demonstrating that federated or approximate methods achieve comparable cumulative regret and calibration to the centralized hierarchical model while reducing computational runtime and resource costs.

## Limitations
- Reliance on app engagement as an indirect proxy for the ultimate health outcome (sodium reduction) may not fully capture intervention effectiveness
- The 2-month optimization timescale may miss important temporal dynamics in user behavior and engagement patterns
- Simulation results are based on synthetic data and may not fully capture real-world complexities and user heterogeneity

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the technical implementation of the contextual bandit algorithm and its computational feasibility
- **Medium confidence** in the simulation results and algorithm performance relative to alternatives, given the simplified assumptions
- **Low confidence** in the translation from app engagement metrics to actual health outcomes without real-world validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a small-scale pilot study to validate the algorithm's assumptions about engagement patterns and reward structures with actual trial participants
2. Perform sensitivity analyses varying the optimization timescale (e.g., 1-week, 1-month intervals) to assess the impact on algorithm performance and computational requirements
3. Develop and validate a framework for converting app engagement metrics to more direct health outcome proxies before full trial deployment
