# Creating Targeted, Interpretable Topic Models with LLM-Generated Text Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.17445
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17445
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LLM-generated text augmentations improve topic model interpretability for domain-specific social science research questions.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes using GPT-4 to generate brief actor descriptions for news headlines, enriching short text documents with semantic context and real-world knowledge before applying BERTopic clustering. The method is demonstrated on 11,704 CRT-related headlines, producing highly interpretable actor-based topics (governors, legislators, teachers, parents) compared to baseline topic modeling of raw headlines. The approach addresses the sparsity problem in short-text topic modeling while maintaining unsupervised properties and interpretability.

## Method Summary
The method transforms short documents (news headlines) by using GPT-4 to generate actor descriptions that incorporate real-world knowledge, then applies standard BERTopic clustering to these enriched descriptions. The prompt asks GPT-4 to identify and briefly describe the primary actor in each headline, incorporating the research goal without specifying expected actors. This creates semantically richer input for topic modeling while preserving unsupervised clustering properties. The approach is demonstrated on CRT-related headlines from the GDELT database.

## Key Results
- BERTopic modeling using GPT-4 actor descriptions produced interpretable actor-based topics (governors, legislators, teachers, parents) with minimal human guidance
- Baseline BERTopic modeling using raw headlines yielded less interpretable mixed-theme clusters
- 2,795 documents were assigned to no topic in the augmented model, compared to 2,132 in the baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Enrichment for Short-Document Clustering
LLM-generated descriptions expand sparse short-text documents with contextual semantics, improving embedding quality for downstream clustering. Raw headlines contain few tokens, limiting embedding richness. GPT-4 generates actor descriptions that incorporate real-world knowledge, providing denser semantic signal for BERTopic's document embeddings to cluster around meaningful concepts.

### Mechanism 2: Research-Goal Injection via Prompt Design
Prompt engineering allows researchers to encode domain-specific research questions into the augmentation step without prescribing keyword priors. The prompt asks "What type of actor is the primary actor?" without specifying expected actors, guiding GPT-4 toward the research goal while avoiding researcher bias and supervision burden.

### Mechanism 3: Separation of Enrichment from Clustering
Decoupling semantic enrichment (LLM) from pattern discovery (BERTopic) preserves unsupervised clustering while improving interpretability. Rather than modifying the topic model itself, the approach transforms input documents. BERTopic operates unchanged on enriched text, maintaining its unsupervised properties.

## Foundational Learning

- **BERTopic Architecture**: Why needed here - The paper uses BERTopic as the clustering engine. Understanding that it combines document embeddings with c-TF-IDF topic representations explains why richer input text produces more interpretable topics. Quick check: Can you explain why BERTopic would produce better topics from "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Republican Party member known for conservative policies" than from "DeSantis Bans CRT"?

- **Short-Text Sparsity in Topic Models**: Why needed here - The core problem being solved is that headlines (~5-15 tokens) lack sufficient word co-occurrence signal for traditional topic models. Understanding this motivates why augmentation helps. Quick check: Why would LDA struggle more with a 10-word headline than a 500-word article, even if both discuss the same topic?

- **LLM Prompting for Structured Extraction**: Why needed here - The method depends on consistent extraction behavior from GPT-4. Understanding prompt design (explicit instructions, fallback handling) explains robustness. Quick check: What could go wrong if the prompt didn't include the fallback instruction for actor-less headlines?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw Documents (headlines) -> [GPT-4 API] <- Prompt template -> Enriched Documents (actor descriptions) -> [Sentence Transformer Embeddings] -> [UMAP Dimensionality Reduction] -> [HDBSCAN Clustering] -> [c-TF-IDF Topic Representation] -> Topic Assignments + KeyBERT Keywords

- **Critical path**: The GPT-4 augmentation step is the single point of failure. If actor descriptions are inaccurate or inconsistent, downstream clustering inherits these errors. The paper's qualitative review step is manual validation that should be systematized in production.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Cost vs. Quality**: GPT-4 API calls for 11,704 documents represents non-trivial expense; cheaper models may degrade extraction quality
  - **Specificity vs. Discovery**: The actor-focused prompt constrains output to actor-based themes; other latent patterns will be suppressed
  - **Reproducibility**: LLM outputs are non-deterministic; paper does not address temperature settings or reproducibility concerns

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Mixed-topic clusters appearing in augmented output indicate enrichment is failing to create semantic separation
  - High "No assignment" rate (4,927 documents or 42%) exceeding acceptable loss thresholds
  - Hallucinated actors in GPT-4 descriptions not present in original headlines

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline replication: Run BERTopic on raw headlines to confirm baseline produces mixed-topic clusters
  2. Augmentation quality audit: Sample 100 headlines; manually evaluate GPT-4 actor descriptions for accuracy
  3. Prompt sensitivity test: Compare three prompt variations on a 500-document subset to assess research-goal injection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can the quality and accuracy of LLM-generated text augmentations be systematically evaluated across diverse applications? The authors note future work could more thoroughly evaluate augmentation quality beyond qualitative review.

- Does this augmentation technique remain effective when applied to long-form documents, or is it restricted to short-text contexts? The paper states the approach "is mainly applicable to topic modeling using very short text documents" and suggests verifying utility in other contexts.

- How sensitive are the resulting topics to the specific phrasing of the prompt used to generate text augmentations? The authors used a specific prompt but did not test alternative prompt formulations.

## Limitations

- Method effectiveness depends on prompt design and LLM capability, which may vary across domains where actor identification is less straightforward
- Paper does not address reproducibility concerns with non-deterministic LLM outputs or cost implications of scaling
- Results rely on qualitative interpretability assessment rather than quantitative metrics, making systematic comparison difficult

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The actor-based topic clusters in Table 2 are interpretable and demonstrate clear improvement over the baseline mixed-topic clusters in Table 3
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that prompt-based research-goal injection works without researcher supervision is supported qualitatively but not rigorously tested
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the approach to domains beyond actor extraction is not demonstrated and may require different prompt engineering strategies

## Next Checks

1. Test prompt sensitivity by comparing actor-focused, theme-focused, and neutral summarization prompts on a 500-document subset to assess whether research-goal injection generalizes beyond actor extraction

2. Implement quantitative metrics (e.g., coherence scores, topic diversity) to complement qualitative interpretability assessments and enable systematic comparison with alternative approaches

3. Conduct cost-benefit analysis by running the pipeline with smaller/faster LLM models to determine the performance threshold where augmentation quality degrades significantly
