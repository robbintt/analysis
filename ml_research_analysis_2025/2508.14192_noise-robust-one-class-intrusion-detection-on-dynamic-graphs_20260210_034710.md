# Noise Robust One-Class Intrusion Detection on Dynamic Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.14192
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14192

- Primary result: RTGN-SVDD achieves 84.4% ROC-AUC at 50% noise vs 57.4% for baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of intrusion detection in dynamic network graphs under noisy conditions. The authors propose RTGN-SVDD, a probabilistic extension to Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data Description (TGN-SVDD), which predicts Gaussian distribution parameters for each network event to enhance robustness against noise. The model employs a two-score system: one to distinguish noisy events and another for attack detection. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset with synthetic noise demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline TGN-SVDD, with ROC-AUC scores improving from 57.4% to 84.4% at 50% noise levels on Tuesday data.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces RTGN-SVDD, which extends the TGN-SVDD model by predicting Gaussian distribution parameters (mean and variance) for each network event. This probabilistic approach allows the model to quantify uncertainty and distinguish between normal events and noise. The model uses two separate scores: one to identify noisy events and another to detect attacks. By modeling each event as a Gaussian distribution rather than a point estimate, RTGN-SVDD can better handle noisy data while maintaining its one-class learning capability for anomaly detection in dynamic graphs.

## Key Results
- RTGN-SVDD achieves ROC-AUC of 84.4% at 50% noise level on Tuesday data, compared to 57.4% for baseline TGN-SVDD
- Performance improvements increase with higher noise levels, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in noisy environments
- The two-score system successfully separates noise detection from attack detection tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The probabilistic extension works by modeling each network event as a Gaussian distribution rather than a single point estimate. This allows the model to quantify uncertainty and distinguish between normal variability and actual noise or attacks. By predicting distribution parameters, RTGN-SVDD can identify events that fall far from their expected distributions as potential noise, while still maintaining sensitivity to genuine anomalies that represent attacks. The two-score system enables separate optimization for noise filtering and attack detection, preventing these competing objectives from interfering with each other.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs)**: Why needed - Handle dynamic graph data with temporal dependencies. Quick check - Model processes node interactions over time with memory.
- **Support Vector Data Description (SVDD)**: Why needed - One-class classification for anomaly detection. Quick check - Defines hypersphere boundary around normal data.
- **Gaussian Distribution Modeling**: Why needed - Quantify uncertainty and handle noise. Quick check - Each event represented by mean and variance parameters.
- **Two-Score System**: Why needed - Separate optimization for noise vs attack detection. Quick check - Distinct loss functions for each detection task.
- **CIC-IDS2017 Dataset**: Why needed - Benchmark for intrusion detection with labeled attacks. Quick check - Contains realistic network traffic patterns.
- **Synthetic Noise Injection**: Why needed - Evaluate robustness under controlled conditions. Quick check - Noise added at varying percentages (10%, 30%, 50%).

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Events -> TGN Backbone -> Gaussian Parameter Prediction -> Noise Score + Attack Score -> Classification

**Critical Path**: The model processes temporal events through the TGN backbone, which maintains node embeddings and temporal memory. These embeddings are then passed through separate heads that predict Gaussian parameters for uncertainty quantification. The two-score system processes these distributions to generate noise and attack detection scores independently.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The probabilistic extension increases model complexity and computational overhead compared to standard TGN-SVDD. However, this tradeoff is justified by the significant performance gains in noisy environments. The two-score system adds architectural complexity but enables better separation of noise filtering from attack detection tasks.

**Failure Signatures**: The model may struggle with non-Gaussian noise distributions or when noise patterns are highly similar to actual attack patterns. Performance degradation could occur if the Gaussian assumption breaks down or if the two-score system cannot adequately separate the detection tasks.

**First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate baseline TGN-SVDD performance without noise, 2) Test RTGN-SVDD with varying noise percentages (10%, 30%, 50%), 3) Compare ROC-AUC scores between models across different days of CIC-IDS2017 dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Future work could extend the model to additional datasets and integrate its noise quantification with other detection systems.

## Limitations
- Evaluation conducted primarily on synthetic noise injected into a single dataset (CIC-IDS2017)
- Gaussian distribution assumption may not capture all types of noise distributions encountered in practice
- Computational overhead from predicting distribution parameters is not explicitly discussed

## Confidence
- High Confidence: RTGN-SVDD model architecture and its improvement over baseline TGN-SVDD on the tested dataset
- Medium Confidence: Generalizability of results to other datasets and real-world noise scenarios
- Medium Confidence: Practical applicability in real-time intrusion detection systems given no performance overhead analysis

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate RTGN-SVDD on additional real-world network datasets with naturally occurring noise patterns to assess generalizability beyond synthetic noise injection
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the noise detection score versus the attack detection score in the two-score system
3. Perform computational complexity analysis comparing RTGN-SVDD with TGN-SVDD to determine real-time deployment feasibility and resource requirements
