# Multi-modal Data Spectrum: Multi-modal Datasets are Multi-dimensional

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.23499
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23499
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Primary result:** Multi-modal datasets exhibit significant variation in modality dependencies, with many containing strong uni-modal biases that models exploit despite being designed for multi-modal evaluation.

## Executive Summary
This work presents a large-scale empirical analysis of multi-modal dependencies across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks. Using input permutation techniques, the study quantifies how much models rely on each modality independently versus their interaction. The findings reveal that many multi-modal datasets contain strong uni-modal biases, and models—particularly larger ones—exploit these shortcuts rather than performing genuine multi-modal reasoning. Efforts to eliminate text-only dependencies have often inadvertently introduced image-only biases, highlighting the need for more principled benchmark design and evaluation methods.

## Method Summary
The method uses input permutation to quantify intra-modality (reliance on a single modality) and inter-modality (synergy between modalities) dependencies. For each sample, one or both modalities are replaced with random instances from the dataset, preserving marginal distributions while breaking inter-modality links. Four conditions are evaluated: normal (both modalities intact), text-only (shuffled image), image-only (shuffled text), and random (both shuffled). The performance gaps between conditions reveal each modality's contribution. The study uses Cambrian-1 models (8B, 13B, 34B) with majority-vote ensemble aggregation across benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Significant variation exists in modality dependencies both across and within benchmarks
- Many datasets exhibit strong uni-modal biases despite being designed for multi-modal evaluation
- Larger models often become more adept at exploiting uni-modal artifacts rather than improving cross-modal integration
- Efforts to mitigate text-only dependencies have frequently introduced image-only biases instead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Intra-modality Dependency Exploitation
Models can achieve high benchmark accuracy by relying on a single modality while ignoring the other, without engaging in genuine multi-modal reasoning. When datasets contain strong correlations between one modality and the target label, models learn to predict answers using only that modality, treating the other as noise. This exploits statistical shortcuts rather than integrating information across modalities.

### Mechanism 2: Input Permutation for Dependency Attribution
Permuting one modality while keeping the other intact provides quantitative measures of each modality's marginal contribution. By replacing modality A with a random sample from the dataset distribution, inter-modality dependency is broken while preserving marginal statistics. Performance degradation relative to normal inputs indicates reliance on the permuted modality.

### Mechanism 3: Uni-modal Bias Migration Through Benchmark Iteration
Efforts to eliminate text-only biases in benchmarks often inadvertently introduce image-only biases, shifting rather than solving the underlying problem. Benchmark designers weaken one modality's predictive power to force multi-modal reasoning, but without measuring all dependency types, new shortcuts emerge—visual patterns correlated with answers become exploitable.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Intra-modality vs Inter-modality Dependencies (Uniqueness vs Synergy)**
  - Why needed here: The analytical framework depends on distinguishing whether a target label can be predicted from one modality alone (uniqueness) or requires their interaction (synergy)
  - Quick check question: Given a VQA dataset, can you identify at least one question type where the answer is predictable from the question text alone without seeing the image?

- **Concept: Permutation-based Attribution Methods**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why shuffling is preferred over zeroing or perturbation is critical for correctly interpreting dependency scores
  - Quick check question: Why does replacing an image with a blank (zeros) risk confounding dependency measurement compared to replacing it with another valid image from the dataset?

- **Concept: Aggregate Metrics Masking Subgroup Artifacts**
  - Why needed here: A benchmark can appear balanced overall while containing strong uni-modal biases in specific subcategories, leading to misleading conclusions
  - Quick check question: If a dataset shows 50% accuracy with text-only inputs (matching random chance for 4-way MCQ), what additional analysis should you perform before concluding it requires multi-modal reasoning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Vision encoder (SigLIP ViT, DINOv2, ConvNeXt variants in Cambrian-1) -> Text encoder (Llama-3 8B, Vicuna-1.5 13B, Nous-Yi 34B) -> Fusion/connector layer (aligns vision and text representations)

- **Critical path:** 1) Select benchmark dataset and baseline MLLM (not trained on target dataset) 2) Generate predictions under all four permutation conditions 3) Compare performance gaps: Normal - Text-permuted (image contribution), Normal - Image-permuted (text contribution) 4) Stratify by subcategory to detect localized biases 5) Aggregate across multiple models to reduce single-model inductive bias

- **Design tradeoffs:** Single model vs ensemble (faster vs more robust), shuffling vs zeroing (valid inputs vs simpler but OOD risk), granularity of analysis (aggregate metrics vs subcategory analysis)

- **Failure signatures:** Text-only performance significantly above random on "vision-heavy" benchmarks, image-only performance significantly above random on "reasoning-heavy" benchmarks, larger models showing increased uni-modal exploitation, high confidence predictions on permuted inputs

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Replicate four-condition permutation evaluation on single benchmark using one model size 2) Stratify results by question type or subject category to identify localized uni-modal biases 3) Compare dependency profiles across model scales (8B vs 34B) on text-dominant and image-dominant benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How can multi-modal models be effectively trained to perform meaningful abstention when inputs are ambiguous or irrelevant?** The paper identifies that current methods like adding "None of the above" options are insufficient, and calls for future research to develop methods for meaningful abstention.

- **How can automated evaluation frameworks be advanced to reliably assess open-ended multi-modal responses?** The authors note the field's reliance on Multiple-Choice VQA (MCVQA) as a limitation and propose moving to open-ended generation as a crucial future direction, but acknowledge the difficulty of automatic evaluation for free-form responses.

- **Can model architectures or training objectives be modified to ensure that scaling improves inter-modality reasoning rather than merely enhancing the exploitation of uni-modal shortcuts?** The study demonstrates that larger models often become more adept at exploiting uni-modal artifacts to achieve high performance, masking a lack of true multi-modal reasoning.

## Limitations

- Permutation-based attribution assumes models treat shuffled inputs as valid data rather than detecting corruption, which may not hold for all architectures
- The study relies on a single model family (Cambrian-1) and may not generalize across different MLLM architectures
- While permutation preserves marginal distributions, it may introduce implausible combinations that could affect model behavior in ways not fully characterized

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Intra-modality dependencies exist across benchmarks and models exploit these shortcuts
- **Medium confidence:** Larger models are more prone to uni-modal exploitation (based on scaling trends but limited to three model sizes)
- **Medium confidence:** Bias migration occurs when addressing known failure modes (empirical observation across benchmarks but mechanism not fully characterized)

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture generalization test:** Replicate the permutation analysis using different MLLM families (e.g., GPT-4V, Claude-3, Gemini Pro) to verify findings are not Cambrian-1-specific

2. **Shuffling validity validation:** Compare permutation results against controlled zero-input baselines to quantify how much model behavior changes when inputs are clearly invalid versus subtly corrupted

3. **Subgroup dependency mapping:** Extend the analysis to create benchmark-level dependency heatmaps showing which question types/subjects exhibit strongest uni-modal biases, enabling targeted benchmark redesign
