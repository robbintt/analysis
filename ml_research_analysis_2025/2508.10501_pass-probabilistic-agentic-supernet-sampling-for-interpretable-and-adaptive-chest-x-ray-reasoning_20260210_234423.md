# PASS: Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling for Interpretable and Adaptive Chest X-Ray Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.10501
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10501
- Authors: Yushi Feng; Junye Du; Yingying Hong; Qifan Wang; Lequan Yu
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: Achieves 91.22% accuracy on CAB-E benchmark with interpretable, probability-annotated reasoning paths

## Executive Summary
PASS introduces a probabilistic agentic supernet for multimodal chest X-ray reasoning that learns task-conditioned distributions over a multi-tool graph. The system generates interpretable, probability-annotated workflows for post-hoc audit and clinical safety while incorporating personalized memory and early-exit mechanisms. Through a three-stage training pipeline (expert warm-up, contrastive path ranking, cost-aware RL), PASS balances accuracy with computational cost. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the CAB-E benchmark while providing transparent reasoning paths suitable for high-stakes clinical deployment.

## Method Summary
PASS employs a probabilistic agentic supernet architecture that learns a task-conditioned distribution over a multi-tool graph for chest X-ray analysis. The system integrates multimodal inputs (images and text) and produces interpretable workflows annotated with probabilities. Key innovations include evolving personalized memory for adaptive reasoning, early-exit mechanisms for efficiency, and a three-stage training pipeline combining expert warm-up, contrastive path ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. The approach emphasizes both performance and interpretability, generating transparent reasoning paths that support post-hoc auditing and clinical safety validation.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.22% on the CAB-E benchmark
- Demonstrates high semantic alignment with low hallucination rates compared to baselines
- Provides interpretable probability-annotated reasoning paths suitable for clinical audit and safety

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PASS succeeds by treating reasoning as a probabilistic sampling problem over a multi-tool graph rather than a fixed pipeline. The task-conditioned distribution allows the model to dynamically select appropriate tools and reasoning paths based on specific clinical queries. The three-stage training pipeline progressively refines the model: expert warm-up establishes baseline capabilities, contrastive path ranking learns to distinguish effective reasoning paths, and cost-aware RL optimizes for both accuracy and computational efficiency. Personalized memory enables adaptive reasoning that evolves with use, while early-exit mechanisms prevent unnecessary computation when confident answers emerge.

## Foundational Learning

**Probabilistic supernet sampling**: Why needed - enables dynamic tool selection and reasoning path generation; Quick check - verify that sampled paths vary appropriately across similar but distinct queries

**Contrastive path ranking**: Why needed - learns to distinguish effective from ineffective reasoning sequences; Quick check - measure ranking accuracy on known good vs. bad paths

**Cost-aware reinforcement learning**: Why needed - balances computational efficiency with diagnostic accuracy; Quick check - validate that accuracy improves with controlled increases in computation budget

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input (Image + Text) -> Feature Extractor -> Probabilistic Agent -> Multi-tool Graph -> Reasoning Path Generator -> Output (Diagnosis + Probability Annotations)

**Critical path**: The probabilistic agent selecting tools from the multi-tool graph represents the core innovation, as this enables dynamic reasoning rather than fixed pipelines

**Design tradeoffs**: Prioritizes interpretability and clinical safety over raw speed, accepting computational overhead for transparent reasoning paths that support auditability

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance may manifest as either (1) overly confident but incorrect reasoning paths, or (2) excessive computational costs without accuracy gains, indicating issues with the RL cost optimization

**3 first experiments**:
1. Validate tool selection diversity across different clinical queries
2. Test early-exit effectiveness on simple vs. complex cases
3. Measure reasoning path interpretability through radiologist feedback

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- The complexity of the three-stage training pipeline may limit practical deployment and fine-tuning in clinical settings
- Long-term adaptability to evolving medical knowledge and practices is not thoroughly addressed

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| State-of-the-art accuracy on CAB-E benchmark | High |
| Interpretability and clinical safety benefits | Medium |
| Long-term adaptability and generalization | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct multi-center clinical trials across different hospitals and patient demographics to assess real-world performance and generalizability

2. Perform longitudinal studies (6-12 months) to evaluate system performance over time and its ability to incorporate evolving medical knowledge

3. Engage practicing radiologists in hands-on evaluations focusing on interpretability, efficiency, and impact on diagnostic accuracy and workflow
