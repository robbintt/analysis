core_contribution: SPDNet addresses the challenge of accurate residential electricity
  demand forecasting by introducing a novel deep learning framework that combines
  seasonal-trend decomposition with periodical decomposition. The Seasonal-Trend Decomposition
  Module (STDM) separates input data into trend, seasonal, and residual components,
  while the Periodical Decomposition Module (PDM) uses Fast Fourier Transform to identify

# SPDNet: Seasonal-Periodic Decomposition Network for Advanced Residential Demand Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.22485
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22485
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms traditional and advanced models on residential electricity demand forecasting with superior MSE/MAE metrics

## Executive Summary
SPDNet introduces a novel deep learning framework for residential electricity demand forecasting by combining seasonal-trend decomposition with periodical decomposition. The model separates input data into trend, seasonal, and residual components, then applies Fast Fourier Transform to identify dominant periods and reshape data into 2D tensors. These tensors are processed through specialized submodules using 1D convolution, transformer-based encoder, and 2D convolution to capture sharp fluctuations, global patterns, and periodic correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
SPDNet processes multivariate time series through a two-module architecture. The Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Module (STDM) uses 1D convolutions with varying kernel sizes to extract trend and seasonal components from input data. The Periodical Decomposition Module (PDM) applies FFT to identify dominant periods, reshapes 1D sequences into 2D tensors, and processes them through three parallel branches: 1D convolution for local fluctuations, transformer encoder for global context, and 2D convolution for inter-period dependencies. The outputs from both modules are fused using weighted summation with learnable coefficients.

## Key Results
- Achieves superior forecasting accuracy on residential electricity load data compared to RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, ConvLSTM, Transformer, Informer, Crossformer, DLinear, PatchTST, and TimesNet
- Demonstrates significant improvements in both Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error metrics
- Shows enhanced computational efficiency while maintaining high prediction accuracy
- Validated on real-world residential electricity load data with 15-minute intervals from Kansas, USA

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Decomposition for Variance Reduction
The STDM module reduces learning complexity by separating input signals into distinct temporal components. By extracting trend, seasonality, and residual components independently, subsequent modules can focus on modeling specific dynamics rather than simultaneously learning long-term trends and short-term seasonality.

### Mechanism 2: Structure-Preserving 1D-to-2D Transformation
The PDM uses FFT to identify dominant periods and reshapes 1D time series into 2D tensors where rows represent periods and columns represent time steps. This transformation allows 2D convolutional kernels to capture both intra-period temporal correlations and inter-period spatial-like relationships simultaneously.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Branch Specialized Processing
The parallel processing architecture allows specialized architectures to handle distinct temporal features more efficiently than a monolithic approach. Three parallel submodules process the 2D tensors for sharp fluctuations, global dependencies, and periodic correlations, with outputs aggregated additively.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (STL)**
  - Why needed: Understanding how to separate trend from seasonality is crucial for debugging STDM outputs
  - Quick check: Can you manually sketch the separation of a raw demand curve into its trend and seasonal components?

- **Concept: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for Frequency Analysis**
  - Why needed: FFT determines the row/column dimensions of 2D tensors in PDM
  - Quick check: Given a sampling rate and sequence length, how do you convert an FFT index into a physical period (e.g., hours/days)?

- **Concept: 2D Convolutions on Temporal Data**
  - Why needed: Understanding how Conv2D kernels slide across periods to extract inter-period correlations
  - Quick check: In a tensor of shape [Batch, Periods, TimeSteps], how does a 3×3 kernel differ from a 1×3 kernel?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Input: Multivariate time series [B, S, N]
  - STDM Branch: Conv1D (Trend) → Conv1D (Seasonal) → Residual Calculation → Summation → Linear Projection
  - PDM Branch: FFT → Top-k Selection → Reshape to 2D [B, p_i, f_i, N]
    - Sub-branch A (Short): 1D Conv (local fluctuations)
    - Sub-branch B (Long): Reverted Embedding → Transformer Encoder (global patterns)
    - Sub-branch C (Periodic): 2D Conv (inter-period relations)
  - Fusion: Weighted Aggregation (α₁PDM + α₂STDM)

- **Critical path:** The PDM FFT calculation and subsequent reshape. Incorrect period detection corrupts the 2D tensor structure, causing downstream convolutions and transformers to learn from meaningless data.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Fixed vs. Dynamic Periods: Model assumes detected periods remain stable for forecast horizon
  - Parallel vs. Sequential Branches: Parallel processing enables faster computation but may miss conditional relationships between feature types

- **Failure signatures:**
  - FFT Aliasing: Short sequence lengths prevent resolution of long periods (e.g., weekly seasonality)
  - Padding Artifacts: Excessive padding relative to actual data causes Conv layers to learn padding boundaries
  - STDM Smoothing: Oversized trend kernels remove valid peaks, preventing seasonal component capture

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. STDM Isolation: Run only STDM branch to establish decomposition-only baseline
  2. Sensitivity to k: Vary number of dominant periods (k=1, 3, 5) to test period dependence
  3. PDM Ablation: Disable Transformer and 2D Conv branches separately to quantify individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can SPDNet be modified to improve forecasting accuracy for rare or anomalous consumption patterns?
- What specific performance trade-offs exist for peak versus off-peak forecasting that are obscured by aggregate error metrics?
- How robust is the FFT in PDM when applied to highly noisy residential data lacking clear periodicity?

## Limitations

- Additive decomposition assumption may fail if residential demand exhibits multiplicative seasonality or non-stationary trend-seasonality relationships
- FFT-based period detection assumes harmonic, stable periodicities that may not hold for residential loads affected by behavioral changes
- 2D reshaping introduces rigid alignment constraints that could misalign temporal features if periods drift over time

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Hierarchical decomposition approach is well-established in time series literature; MSE/MAE improvements are directly measurable
- **Medium Confidence:** Novel 2D reshaping technique effectiveness depends on period stability, not fully validated across varying forecast horizons
- **Low Confidence:** Optimal parameter selection (kernel sizes, FFT periods k, branch weights) not rigorously justified and may be dataset-specific

## Next Checks

1. Sensitivity Analysis of FFT Period Selection: Systematically vary k (1, 2, 3, 5) and measure MSE/MAE impact across different prediction horizons

2. Ablation Study of PDM Submodules: Disable Transformer and 2D Conv branches separately while keeping STDM constant to quantify individual contributions

3. Robustness to Data Shifts: Test model on residential data from different geographic regions or consumption patterns to assess generalization beyond Kansas dataset
