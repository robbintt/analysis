# A Comparative Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models for 2D Object Detection under SOTIF Conditions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22830
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22830
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: LVLMs outperform YOLOv5 in recall by >25% for complex natural scenarios, while YOLOv5 excels in geometric precision

## Executive Summary
This paper benchmarks ten Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for 2D object detection under SOTIF (Safety of the Intended Functionality) conditions, addressing perception insufficiencies in adverse driving environments. Using the PeSOTIF dataset and a visual-prompting pipeline, the authors evaluate LVLMs against YOLOv5 as a baseline. Key findings show that top-performing LVLMs, notably Gemini 3 and Doubao, surpass YOLOv5 in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, while YOLOv5 retains an edge in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations. These results highlight LVLMs' complementary strengths in semantic reasoning and robustness, positioning them as potential high-level safety validators in automated driving systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comparative evaluation framework using the PeSOTIF dataset, which captures diverse SOTIF scenarios including adverse weather, lighting variations, and occlusion conditions. A visual-prompting pipeline serves as the interface between raw imagery and LVLM processing, enabling object detection through language-conditioned reasoning. The evaluation benchmarks ten LVLMs against YOLOv5, measuring performance across recall, precision, and geometric accuracy metrics. Synthetic perturbations are applied to assess robustness under controlled stress conditions, while complex natural scenarios test real-world applicability.

## Key Results
- Gemini 3 and Doubao achieve >25% higher recall than YOLOv5 in complex natural scenarios
- YOLOv5 maintains superior geometric precision in synthetic perturbation tests
- LVLMs demonstrate complementary semantic reasoning capabilities for safety validation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The visual-prompting pipeline leverages LVLM's language-conditioned reasoning to enhance object detection in scenarios where geometric precision is secondary to semantic understanding. LVLMs' transformer-based architectures may better capture contextual relationships between objects and environmental factors in SOTIF conditions, compensating for their geometric limitations through superior semantic reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- SOTIF conditions: Safety scenarios beyond traditional perception limits, critical for autonomous driving validation
- Visual-prompting pipeline: Interface enabling LVLM-based detection through language-conditioned reasoning
- PeSOTIF dataset: Specialized benchmark capturing adverse driving conditions for safety assessment

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Raw imagery -> Visual-prompting pipeline -> LVLM processing -> Object detection output
**Critical Path:** Image preprocessing → Prompt engineering → LVLM inference → Post-processing → Detection results
**Design Tradeoffs:** LVLM semantic reasoning vs. YOLOv5 geometric precision; recall vs. precision balance
**Failure Signatures:** LVLM struggles with precise bounding boxes under synthetic perturbations; YOLOv5 limitations in complex semantic reasoning
**First Experiments:** 1) Baseline YOLOv5 performance validation, 2) LVLM recall evaluation on PeSOTIF, 3) Synthetic perturbation robustness testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do LVLMs perform across different types of SOTIF conditions not covered in the PeSOTIF dataset?
- What is the impact of visual-prompting pipeline variations on detection consistency across different LVLM architectures?
- Can temporal consistency be improved for dynamic SOTIF scenarios using LVLM-based approaches?

## Limitations
- Single dataset (PeSOTIF) limits generalizability to all SOTIF conditions
- Visual-prompting pipeline introduces potential detection inconsistency across architectures
- Absence of temporal consistency analysis for dynamic SOTIF scenarios

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** LVLM superiority in recall under complex natural conditions (Gemini 3, Doubao results)
**Medium Confidence:** LVLM geometric precision limitations in synthetic perturbations
**Medium Confidence:** Complementary role of LVLMs as safety validators

## Next Checks
1. Expand evaluation to multiple datasets representing diverse SOTIF conditions, including adverse weather, lighting variations, and occlusion scenarios
2. Implement ablation studies on the visual-prompting pipeline to quantify its impact on detection performance across different LVLM architectures
3. Conduct longitudinal analysis incorporating temporal consistency metrics to assess LVLM performance in dynamic SOTIF scenarios
