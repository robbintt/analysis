# ReInAgent: A Context-Aware GUI Agent Enabling Human-in-the-Loop Mobile Task Navigation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07988
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07988
- Reference count: 24
- Achieves 25% higher success rate than Mobile-Agent-v2 on complex tasks with information dilemmas

## Executive Summary
ReInAgent introduces a human-in-the-loop multi-agent framework that dynamically manages information dilemmas in mobile GUI task automation. By integrating proactive user-agent interaction with slot-based information management, it resolves ambiguous, incremental, and conflicting task requirements during execution. The system comprises three specialized agents—an information-managing agent for clarifying instructions and updating task slots, a decision-making agent for hierarchical planning and sequential execution, and a reflecting agent for validating information consistency and summarizing task history.

Experimental results demonstrate ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate than Mobile-Agent-v2 on complex tasks involving information dilemmas, with 0.85 information consistency and 0.93 conflict capture rates. Integrating app-specific knowledge further boosts success by 12% and efficiency by 18%, demonstrating the framework's adaptability and reliability in real-world mobile scenarios.

## Method Summary
ReInAgent employs a slot-based information management system where task requirements are stored in structured slots that can be updated dynamically during execution. The framework uses a three-agent architecture: an information-managing agent that clarifies ambiguous instructions and updates task slots through proactive user interaction, a decision-making agent that performs hierarchical planning and executes tasks sequentially based on the slot information, and a reflecting agent that validates information consistency and maintains task history summaries. The system actively engages users when information dilemmas arise, presenting conflicting or ambiguous information and seeking clarification before proceeding with task execution.

## Key Results
- Achieves 25% higher success rate than Mobile-Agent-v2 on complex tasks involving information dilemmas
- Demonstrates 0.85 information consistency and 0.93 conflict capture rates in managing dynamic task requirements
- App-specific knowledge integration boosts success rate by 12% and efficiency by 18%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a dynamic feedback loop between user input and agent decision-making. When information dilemmas arise—such as ambiguous instructions, incremental information requirements, or conflicting task elements—the information-managing agent proactively engages the user to clarify requirements and update the slot-based information structure. This clarified information then flows to the decision-making agent, which uses hierarchical planning to break down complex tasks into executable steps while maintaining awareness of the current slot states. The reflecting agent continuously validates that slot updates maintain consistency and summarizes historical interactions to prevent future conflicts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Slot-based information management**: Required to structure dynamic task requirements that can be updated during execution; quick check: verify slots can be modified without disrupting ongoing task flow
- **Hierarchical task planning**: Needed to break down complex mobile GUI interactions into manageable sequential steps; quick check: confirm decomposition maintains task dependencies
- **Proactive user engagement**: Essential for resolving information dilemmas in real-time rather than failing silently; quick check: measure response time when user clarification is requested
- **Information consistency validation**: Critical for preventing conflicting task states across multiple execution steps; quick check: verify no contradictory slot values exist simultaneously
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Required to balance specialized functions while maintaining coherent task execution; quick check: ensure agents communicate without creating bottlenecks
- **App-specific knowledge integration**: Needed to handle domain-specific GUI patterns and interaction flows; quick check: confirm knowledge improves task completion on specialized apps

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Information-Managing Agent -> Decision-Making Agent -> Reflecting Agent -> Information-Managing Agent

**Critical Path**: User instruction → Information-Managing Agent clarification → Slot update → Decision-Making Agent planning → Task execution → Reflecting Agent validation → Slot consistency check

**Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritizes user involvement over autonomous completion, accepting slower execution for higher accuracy; trades computational overhead for improved information quality through multiple validation passes

**Failure Signatures**: User disengagement leading to stalled clarification requests; inconsistent slot updates causing planning failures; reflecting agent unable to resolve persistent conflicts

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test slot update propagation timing when multiple information dilemmas occur simultaneously
2. Measure decision-making agent planning accuracy with partial vs. complete slot information
3. Evaluate reflecting agent conflict resolution effectiveness on synthetic contradictory task scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on constructed information dilemma scenarios rather than naturally occurring user interactions, limiting ecological validity
- Lacks comprehensive user experience studies to validate practical usability of slot-based interface in real-world scenarios
- Absolute performance levels on complex tasks remain unclear without detailed baseline comparisons

## Confidence
- Technical framework design and multi-agent architecture: **High**
- Reported performance improvements (25%, 12%, 18%): **Medium**
- Human-in-the-loop integration mechanism: **Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user experience studies with diverse participants performing real-world mobile tasks to evaluate practical usability of slot-based information interface
2. Test ReInAgent on naturally occurring information dilemmas collected from real user interactions rather than constructed scenarios
3. Perform ablation studies removing each agent component to quantify individual contributions and identify potential redundancy
