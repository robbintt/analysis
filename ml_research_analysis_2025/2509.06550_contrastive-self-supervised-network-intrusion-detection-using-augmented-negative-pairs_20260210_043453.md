# Contrastive Self-Supervised Network Intrusion Detection using Augmented Negative Pairs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.06550
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06550
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CLAN achieves AUROC improvement of 0.031370 over leading SSL approaches and 0.056484 over anomaly detection methods on Lycos2017 dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CLAN, a novel self-supervised learning approach for network intrusion detection that treats augmented samples as negative pairs rather than positive pairs. This contrasts with existing contrastive methods and enables learning a single cohesive distribution of benign traffic rather than distinct distributions for each sample. The approach is evaluated on the Lycos2017 dataset, where it achieves significant improvements in binary classification with an AUROC improvement of 0.031370 over leading SSL approaches and 0.056484 over anomaly detection methods. When fine-tuned on limited labelled data for multi-class classification, CLAN outperforms existing SSL models across various training set sizes, except when training on 256 samples per class where it is marginally outperformed by BYOL.

## Method Summary
CLAN uses a modified MLP architecture that projects input flows through a learned representation space. During pretraining, the model learns to distinguish between original benign samples and their augmented versions using a contrastive loss function that treats augmented samples as negative pairs. The augmentation strategy involves uniform resampling of features with configurable probability and range. After pretraining, a centroid of the benign embeddings is computed and cached for inference. During inference, new samples are scored based on their cosine distance to this centroid, with a tunable threshold to classify as benign or malicious. For multi-class classification, the model is fine-tuned on limited labeled data by appending a linear classification head.

## Key Results
- Binary classification: CLAN achieves mean AUROC of 0.958591 on Lycos2017 dataset, improving over leading SSL approaches by 0.031370 and anomaly detection methods by 0.056484
- Multi-class classification: CLAN outperforms existing SSL models across various training set sizes when fine-tuned on limited labeled data
- Computational efficiency: CLAN requires only O(1) complexity for inference compared to O(N_train) for existing approaches
- At 256 samples per class for fine-tuning, CLAN is marginally outperformed by BYOL

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CLAN works by learning a unified representation of benign traffic rather than separate representations for each sample. By treating augmented versions of samples as negative pairs, the model is forced to learn the underlying distribution of benign traffic rather than memorizing individual samples. This creates a cohesive representation space where benign samples cluster together and can be distinguished from potential anomalies. The approach leverages the intuition that malicious traffic should be dissimilar to benign traffic, and that augmented benign samples represent a plausible "surrogate" for malicious traffic during training.

## Foundational Learning
- Contrastive learning basics: Learning representations by comparing similar and dissimilar pairs. Needed because CLAN uses a novel contrastive loss. Quick check: Understand positive vs negative pairs in standard contrastive learning.
- Self-supervised learning in cybersecurity: Using unlabeled data to learn representations for security tasks. Needed because the paper focuses on self-supervised intrusion detection. Quick check: Know why labeled data is scarce in cybersecurity.
- Network flow analysis: Understanding how network traffic is represented as flows with features. Needed because the dataset uses network flows. Quick check: Be familiar with common network flow features.
- Anomaly detection foundations: Methods for identifying unusual patterns in data. Needed because intrusion detection is framed as anomaly detection. Quick check: Understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection.
- Centroid-based classification: Using a representative point to classify new samples. Needed because CLAN uses a centroid for inference. Quick check: Know how cosine distance relates to similarity.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input features -> MLP Encoder -> Embedding space -> Contrastive Loss (pretraining) OR Linear Head (fine-tuning)

Critical path: The critical path for pretraining is Input -> Encoder -> Embedding -> Loss computation. For inference, it's Input -> Encoder -> Embedding -> Centroid distance computation -> Classification.

Design tradeoffs:
- Using augmentations as negatives vs positives: This is the core innovation that enables learning a unified benign distribution
- Single centroid vs per-sample representations: Reduces inference complexity from O(N_train) to O(1)
- Uniform resampling augmentation: Simple but effective way to create negative pairs

Failure signatures:
- Representation collapse: All embeddings become identical, leading to poor discrimination
- Overfitting to augmentation patterns: Model learns to distinguish augmentations rather than benign/malicious patterns
- Poor minority class performance: Strong overall metrics but weak performance on rare attack types

First experiments:
1. Verify the augmentation process creates sufficiently diverse negative pairs by visualizing embedding distributions
2. Test the centroid-based inference approach on held-out benign data to ensure it captures the benign distribution
3. Run ablation study comparing CLAN loss with standard contrastive loss (treating augmentations as positives)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How robust is CLAN when the benign training dataset is contaminated with unlabeled malicious traffic? The method assumes all training data is benign, which may not hold in real-world environments.
- To what extent does the specific choice of the surrogate distribution (augmentation function) ψ(x) impact the model's ability to approximate the malicious distribution? The paper uses uniform resampling but doesn't evaluate alternative augmentation strategies.
- Does learning a single cohesive benign distribution improve cross-domain generalization compared to existing sample-specific SSL approaches? Experiments are restricted to the Lycos2017 dataset.

## Limitations
- Assumes benign-only training data, which may not be realistic in practice
- Performance at 256 samples per class for fine-tuning is marginally worse than BYOL
- Limited evaluation to a single dataset (Lycos2017) without cross-domain validation

## Confidence
High: Binary classification results and computational efficiency claims
Medium: Multi-class few-shot classification results (narrow loss to BYOL at 256 samples per class)
Low: Cross-domain generalization and robustness to label noise (not experimentally validated)

## Next Checks
1. Verify that the random-search-selected hyperparameters are optimal by testing sensitivity to learning rate, batch size, and augmentation parameters
2. Confirm the preprocessing steps (normalization, feature selection) match the paper's implementation
3. Test the centroid-based inference approach on held-out benign data to ensure stability and proper threshold calibration
