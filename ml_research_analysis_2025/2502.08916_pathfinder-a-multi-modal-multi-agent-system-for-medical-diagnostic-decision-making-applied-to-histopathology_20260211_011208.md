# PathFinder: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent System for Medical Diagnostic Decision-Making Applied to Histopathology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.08916
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08916
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 74% accuracy on 4-class melanoma classification, outperforming human experts by 9%

## Executive Summary
PathFinder is a multi-modal, multi-agent AI system that emulates how expert pathologists diagnose diseases from whole slide images (WSIs) in histopathology. It integrates four agents: Triage (classifies WSI as benign or risky), Navigation (iteratively focuses on diagnostically significant regions), Description (generates natural language summaries of patches), and Diagnosis (synthesizes findings into final classification). Unlike traditional approaches that analyze patches independently, PathFinder mimics the iterative, multi-scale diagnostic process used by pathologists. Experiments on skin melanoma diagnosis show PathFinder achieves 74% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8% and surpassing the average performance of human pathologists by 9%. The system provides inherent explainability through natural language descriptions of diagnostically relevant patches, with qualitative analysis showing the Description Agent's outputs are comparable to GPT-4o.

## Method Summary
PathFinder processes gigapixel whole slide images through a four-stage pipeline. The Triage Agent uses transformer-based multiple instance learning to filter benign cases with 91% accuracy. For risky cases, the Navigation Agent iteratively generates importance maps conditioned on aggregated text embeddings from prior patch descriptions, selecting diagnostically relevant regions. The Description Agent generates concise natural language summaries using a Quilt-LLaVA 7B model fine-tuned on histopathology image-text pairs. The Diagnosis Agent synthesizes 10 descriptions into a final classification using GPT-2 with LoRA fine-tuning. The system evaluates five different trajectories per WSI with majority voting to reduce variance from stochastic patch selection. The architecture is trained on the M-Path Skin Biopsy dataset with 238 cases, achieving 74% accuracy on four-class melanoma classification.

## Key Results
- PathFinder achieves 74% accuracy on 4-class melanoma classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8%
- The system surpasses average human pathologist performance by 9% (74% vs 65%) on the same task
- T5-based Navigation Agent significantly outperforms CLIP-based alternatives (74% vs 62%), validating the importance of text-conditioned visual attention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Iterative text-conditioned navigation outperforms single-pass visual selection by accumulating diagnostic evidence across patches.
- **Mechanism:** The Navigation Agent generates importance maps conditioned on aggregated text embeddings from prior Description Agent outputs. At iteration t, the importance map M^(t) = f_Nav(I^(t), E^(t-1)) where E^(t-1) is the mean of T5-encoded descriptions. This creates a feedback loop: patches → descriptions → text embeddings → refined importance maps → better patches.
- **Core assumption:** Text embeddings from histopathology descriptions capture diagnostically relevant semantic information that can guide visual attention more effectively than visual features alone.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Navigation and Description Agents iteratively focus on significant regions, generating importance maps and descriptive insights"; [section 5.2] "T5-based navigator significantly outperformed its CLIP-based counterpart (74% vs 62%)"; [section 5.2] "Vision-Only Navigator performed... 64%, indicating that both pure statistical and learned 'sampling'... has limited effectiveness"; [corpus] WSI-Agents paper confirms collaborative multi-agent systems outperform single models for WSI analysis (FMR=0.566)
- **Break condition:** If descriptions are low-quality or hallucinated, the T5 encoder propagates noise, degrading navigation. Paper notes: "a more powerful text encoder like T5 can actually be detrimental when processing lower-quality descriptions."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Specialized agent decomposition with sequential handoffs enables modular optimization and explainability.
- **Mechanism:** Four agents with distinct objectives: Triage (binary classification) → Navigation (region selection) → Description (patch captioning) → Diagnosis (multi-class synthesis). Each agent is trained independently on task-specific data, allowing targeted improvements without retraining the full pipeline.
- **Core assumption:** The diagnostic process can be decomposed into sequential sub-tasks without losing critical interdependencies.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "integrates four AI agents—the Triage Agent, Navigation Agent, Description Agent, and Diagnosis Agent—that collaboratively navigate WSIs"; [section 4.1] Triage Agent achieves 91% accuracy on binary classification, filtering benign cases early; [section 5.2] "without the Triage Agent, the performance of the best Pathfinder-variant dropped below baselines, likely due to Quilt-LLaVA's train dataset's bias toward malignant cases"; [corpus] MAM framework validates role-specialized collaboration for multi-modal diagnosis (FMR=0.545)
- **Break condition:** Error cascades—Triage misclassifications prevent Navigation/Description from running on false negatives; Description hallucinations mislead Diagnosis.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multiple trajectory sampling with majority voting reduces variance from stochastic patch selection.
- **Mechanism:** For each WSI, generate n=5 trajectories (each with 10 patches) using probabilistic sampling from importance maps. Each trajectory produces an independent diagnosis via the Diagnosis Agent. Final classification uses majority voting across trajectories.
- **Core assumption:** Diagnostic uncertainty is primarily due to patch selection variance, not fundamental model limitations.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4.4] "For each WSI... we generated five (n=5) different trajectories, each containing ten patch descriptions, to capture various examination patterns"; [section 5.2] "majority voting is performed on the predictions from the 5 selected trajectories"; [figure 3] Ablation shows accuracy increases from ~65% (1 trajectory) to ~74% (5 trajectories), then plateaus; [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for trajectory voting in pathology; related work on multi-agent debate exists but not for WSI
- **Break condition:** If trajectories are highly correlated (sampling similar patches), voting provides no benefit. Randomness injection via LLaMA rephrasing aims to prevent this.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for gigapixel images**
  - **Why needed here:** WSIs contain 100,000+ patches—cannot process all. MIL treats a WSI as a "bag" of patch instances with a single label. PathFinder's Triage Agent uses transformer-based MIL (PPEG positional encoding, multi-scale convolutions) to classify without exhaustive patch analysis.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a WSI with 500 patches and binary label (benign/malignant), how would ABMIL aggregate patch features vs. PathFinder's Triage Agent?

- **Concept: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for histopathology**
  - **Why needed here:** Description Agent must generate medically meaningful captions. Quilt-LLaVA is instruction-tuned on histopathology image-text pairs to produce concise findings (e.g., "proliferation of atypical melanocytes" vs. generic image descriptions).
  - **Quick check question:** What domain-specific terminology would a general VLM (e.g., LLaVA) miss that Quilt-LLaVA captures for melanoma patches?

- **Concept: Text-conditioned visual attention**
  - **Why needed here:** Navigation Agent conditions U-Net decoder on text embeddings to produce spatial importance maps. Understanding how text queries modulate visual feature maps is essential for debugging navigation failures.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the T5 encoder's representation of "atypical melanocytic proliferation" differ from CLIP's, and why does the 77-token limit matter for aggregating multiple patch descriptions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  WSI Input → Triage Agent (transformer MIL)
           ↓ [if risky]
           → Navigation Agent (U-Net + T5 conditioning) ↔ Description Agent (Quilt-LLaVA 7B)
           ↓ [10 iterations × 5 trajectories]
           → Diagnosis Agent (GPT-2 + LoRA classifier head)
           ↓ [majority vote]
           → Final Classification (4 classes)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Triage Agent filters ~15% of cases as benign (Class 1), exiting early
  2. Navigation Agent generates importance map, samples patch coordinates
  3. Description Agent produces concise caption for sampled patch
  4. Text embedding updates, loop repeats 10× per trajectory
  5. Diagnosis Agent classifies from 10 descriptions, repeat 5× for voting

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **LLM-based Navigator vs. U-Net:** Initial LLaVA-based navigator overfit to center patches with limited data (Appendix 2). U-Net with text conditioning proved more data-efficient.
  - **GPT-2 vs. larger LLMs for Diagnosis:** GPT-2 chosen for resource constraints; paper suggests larger LLMs could improve performance.
  - **Exhaustive vs. selective sampling:** Exhaustive (all patches) achieves 68% vs. selective navigation at 74%—irrelevant patches add noise.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Triage false negatives: benign cases sent through full pipeline unnecessarily
  - Navigator center bias: repetitive selection of central patches (indicates overfitting)
  - Description hallucinations: medically implausible findings mislead Diagnosis
  - Low trajectory diversity: voting accuracy plateaus early (check patch overlap between trajectories)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Triage Agent validation:** Run Triage Agent on held-out WSIs, measure Class 1 vs. Non-Class 1 F1. Target: >0.90 accuracy per Appendix Table 1.
  2. **Navigation ablation:** Compare 3 Navigator variants (Vision-Only, CLIP-conditioned, T5-conditioned) on a single WSI. Visualize importance maps—T5 should show focused attention on diagnostically relevant regions.
  3. **Description quality check:** Sample 20 patches, generate descriptions with Quilt-LLaVA vs. LLaVA-Med. Have pathologist rate correctness/relevance per Section 5.1 protocol. Target: comparable to GPT-4o (Figure 4).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does replacing the GPT-2 backbone in the Diagnosis Agent with larger state-of-the-art LLMs significantly improve diagnostic accuracy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note in Section 5.2 that "utilizing larger LLMs could further improve diagnostic outcomes" compared to the currently used GPT-2.
- **Why unresolved:** Resource constraints and dataset size led the authors to select GPT-2; the potential performance ceiling with larger models remains untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation of the PathFinder pipeline substituting the Diagnosis Agent with models like LLaMA-3-70B or GPT-4 on the M-Path dataset.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can the framework effectively detect and mitigate "occasional hallucinations" produced by the Description Agent to prevent error propagation?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Discussion section lists "occasional hallucinations by the Description Agent" as a factor that could affect the accuracy and transparency of the decision-making process.
- **Why unresolved:** The current architecture relies on the Description Agent's output for the Navigation Agent; no internal validation mechanism for description accuracy was implemented.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A module or prompt-engineering strategy that filters or corrects erroneous descriptions before they condition the Navigation Agent.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can PathFinder maintain its performance advantage when applied to a more diverse range of histopathology datasets beyond skin melanoma?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Limitations section states the reliance on pre-existing datasets and suggests "enhancing dataset diversity" as a necessary step for future work.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study is restricted to the M-Path skin biopsy dataset; the generalizability of the specific Triage and Navigation heuristics to other tissue types is unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking PathFinder on multi-organ datasets (e.g., TCGA) or other complex diagnostic tasks like breast or prostate cancer classification.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Can the system's computational efficiency be optimized to support deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify "significant computational resources" as a challenge that currently hinders adoption in resource-constrained settings.
- **Why unresolved:** The iterative nature of the Navigation and Description agents involves running large vision-language models repeatedly, which is computationally expensive.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A system optimization (e.g., model quantization or distillation) that reduces inference time and hardware requirements without degrading diagnostic accuracy.

## Limitations
- Dataset size constraints: The M-Path dataset contains only 238 cases, limiting generalizability and showing signs of Triage Agent overfitting
- Black-box components: The Diagnosis Agent relies on GPT-2 with LoRA fine-tuning, creating an opaque decision-making process
- Evaluation scope: Results validated only on skin melanoma classification; performance on other cancer types remains unknown
- Single pathologist ground truth: All trajectory annotations collected from one board-certified pathologist, raising concerns about inter-observer variability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: PathFinder's architectural design (four-agent decomposition) and its superiority over single-agent baselines (74% vs 62-64% accuracy) are well-supported by ablation studies
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about exceeding human expert performance (74% vs 65%) are credible but based on a small sample size (10 pathologists, one dataset)
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that PathFinder "emulates how expert pathologists diagnose diseases" lacks empirical validation beyond trajectory similarity to one pathologist's viewing patterns

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test PathFinder on histopathology datasets from other cancer types (e.g., breast, lung) to assess generalization beyond skin melanoma
2. **Multi-pathologist trajectory analysis**: Compare PathFinder's trajectories against multiple pathologists' viewing patterns to evaluate true emulation of diagnostic processes
3. **Error analysis on Triage Agent**: Conduct detailed false negative/false positive analysis on the Triage Agent to quantify the risk of Class 1 cases being missed in the screening phase
