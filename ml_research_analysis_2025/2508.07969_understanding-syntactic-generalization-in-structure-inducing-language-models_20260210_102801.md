# Understanding Syntactic Generalization in Structure-inducing Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.07969
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07969
- **Authors:** David Arps; Hassan Sajjad; Laura Kallmeyer
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GPST shows most consistent performance on syntactic generalization, particularly on long-distance dependencies in formal languages and German/Chinese minimal pair benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically evaluates three structure-inducing language model architectures—Structformer, UDGN, and GPST—on natural languages (English, German, Chinese) and synthetic formal bracketing languages (Dyck). The study investigates syntactic generalization, representation consistency, and learning dynamics. While none of the architectures dominates across all metrics, GPST shows the most consistent performance, particularly on long-distance dependencies in formal languages and German/Chinese minimal pair benchmarks. All SiLMs exhibit significant variation in induced syntactic representations across training runs, with Structformer performing poorly on formal languages due to uniform head distributions. The study introduces a novel minimal pair benchmark for Dyck languages to evaluate grammatical generalization and demonstrates that small models on synthetic data provide valuable testbeds for architectural evaluation.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three SiLM architectures on natural language datasets (BabyLM English, German, Chinese) and synthetic Dyck languages. Models are trained with ~15M parameters on natural language and ~2M on formal languages, using 3 seeds per architecture. Training runs for 500K steps on natural language with batch size 1024 and learning rate 5e-5. Evaluation includes UAS/F-score against gold parses, t_x-consistency across seeds, and minimal pair benchmarks (BLiMP, mBLIMP, ZhoBLiMP). The paper introduces a novel Dyck minimal pair benchmark to test grammatical generalization and uses pseudo-log-likelihood for masked models.

## Key Results
- GPST outperforms other architectures on long-distance dependencies in bracketing expressions and German/Chinese minimal pair benchmarks
- All SiLMs exhibit low consistency in induced syntactic representations across training runs
- Structformer fails on formal languages, producing almost uniform dependency distributions
- Small models on synthetic data provide valuable testbeds for architectural evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Explicit Constituent Modeling via Shift-Reduce Parsing (GPST)
GPST handles long-distance dependencies more effectively by explicitly generating a binary constituency tree using shift-reduce parsing during the generative process. It uses an inside-outside autoencoder to create span representations, then a generative transformer predicts discrete shift/reduce actions alongside tokens. This forces the model to commit to a specific hierarchical structure incrementally, reducing the representational bottleneck seen in soft-attention constraints.

### Mechanism 2: Attention Constraint via Probabilistic Dependency Graphs (StructFormer/UDGN)
StructFormer and UDGN induce syntax by predicting a probabilistic adjacency matrix H that restricts self-attention to syntactically related tokens. A parser module predicts H, which is multiplied by attention weights to mask out non-dependent tokens. The model learns H via the gradient of the masked language modeling loss.

### Mechanism 3: Early Stabilization of Syntactic Representations
Syntactic representations (t_x) generally stabilize early in training (within 50k steps) and change minimally thereafter, even as language modeling perplexity continues to improve. The structural inductive bias rapidly finds a local optimum for the syntactic structure that satisfies the primary language modeling loss.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Dyck Languages (Synthetic Benchmarks)**
  - Why needed here: Used as "testbeds" to evaluate hierarchical learning without natural language noise
  - Quick check question: How does Dyck-u differ from standard Dyck-k? (Answer: Unspecified brackets simulate underspecification in agreement, like "The fish [swims/swim].")

- **Concept: Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) vs. F-Score**
  - Why needed here: Different metrics used for different architectures' induced trees
  - Quick check question: Why UAS for StructFormer/UDGN and F-score for GPST? (Answer: SF/UDGN induce dependency graphs, while GPST induces constituency trees.)

- **Concept: t_x-Consistency**
  - Why needed here: A major finding is that SiLMs suffer from low consistency across training runs
  - Quick check question: If two models produce trees with 20 UAS similarity, what does that imply? (Answer: The syntax is likely an artifact of initialization/optimization rather than robust extraction from data.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - StructFormer: Input → Front Transformer Layers → CNN Parser (predicts Distance δ, Height τ) → Dependency Matrix H → Back Transformer Layers (Attention masked by H)
  - UDGN: Input → BiLSTM Parser (predicts Dependency Matrix H) → Dependency Graph Network (Gated Attention using H)
  - GPST: Input → Inside-Outside Autoencoder (Prunes spans, computes i_i,j, o_i,j) → Generative Transformer (Takes span embeddings, predicts Shift/Reduce actions + Tokens)

- **Critical path:**
  - For GPST, the pruning heuristic in the autoencoder is the bottleneck
  - For StructFormer, the parser's O(n³) space complexity for computing possible heads is the critical hardware constraint

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - GPST: Highest structural consistency and best on long-range dependencies, but slowest training
  - StructFormer: Fastest on natural language, but prone to inducing trivial/uniform structures on formal languages
  - Baseline Transformers: Outperform SiLMs on simple English minimal pairs but fail on long-range Dyck generalization

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Uniform Head Distribution: (SF) Check entropy of dependency matrix H
  - Left-Branching Bias: (GPST) Check if F-score is artificially high due to left-branching defaults
  - Multi-token Word Fragmentation: (SF/UDGN) Models attach subword tokens to each other rather than word head

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train chosen architecture on Dyck-u dataset; verify >90% accuracy on minimal pair benchmark
  2. Train 3 instances on same English data with different seeds; measure t_x-consistency (UAS between induced trees)
  3. Evaluate trained model on generalization split of Dyck languages with distance 24-48; compare against Transformer baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Do specific linguistic phenomena or structural ambiguities cause high variance in induced syntactic representations across training runs?
  - Basis: Section 7 notes induced representations are not stable and calls for future work to identify which phenomena lead to stable structures
  - Why unresolved: Paper quantifies inconsistency but doesn't correlate with specific grammatical constructions
  - What evidence would resolve it: Fine-grained error analysis mapping specific dependency types to divergence scores between model seeds

- **Open Question 2:** Do small vocabularies inherently limit the syntactic induction capabilities of SiLMs compared to natural language settings?
  - Basis: Discussion notes models on synthetic data with small vocabularies showed reduced induction capabilities
  - Why unresolved: Unclear if failure is due to small vocabulary size or simplicity of grammar/entropy in synthetic data
  - What evidence would resolve it: Controlled ablation study training SiLMs on natural language data with artificially restricted vocabularies

- **Open Question 3:** Can efficiency optimizations be applied to GPST without degrading its superior consistency in long-distance dependency handling?
  - Basis: Section 7 states future efforts must explore efficiency gains because GPST is slowest despite being most robust
  - Why unresolved: Complex loss function and autoencoder components may be sensitive to precision loss or pruning
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments benchmarking GPST performance on Dyck languages when trained with mixed precision or reduced autoencoder depth

## Limitations

- Synthetic vs. natural language transfer remains uncertain; formal languages provide controlled testbeds but differ substantially from natural language syntax
- Study evaluates induced structures through parsing metrics rather than downstream task performance, raising questions about real-world applicability
- Paper identifies StructFormer's uniform head distributions on formal languages but doesn't deeply investigate architectural modifications to resolve this limitation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence (9/10):** Empirical finding that SiLMs exhibit low consistency across training runs is well-supported by systematic experimentation with three seeds per architecture
- **Medium Confidence (6/10):** Claim that GPST "outperforms" other architectures on long-distance dependencies holds for specific formal language benchmarks but doesn't generalize across all metrics
- **Low Confidence (3/10):** Assertion that "small models on synthetic data provide valuable testbeds" lacks direct evidence linking synthetic benchmark performance to real-world model selection strategies

## Next Checks

1. **Downstream Task Transfer:** Train a SiLM architecture on synthetic data, then fine-tune on a natural language task (e.g., semantic parsing or text classification) to measure whether synthetic pre-training provides measurable benefits

2. **Parser Refinement Experiment:** For StructFormer's uniform head issue on formal languages, implement a regularization technique (e.g., entropy penalty on H) and measure whether this resolves the structural collapse while maintaining performance on natural language tasks

3. **Consistency Improvement Study:** Design an architectural modification (e.g., consistency regularization during training or ensemble methods) to improve t_x-consistency across seeds, then measure the trade-off between consistency gains and language modeling performance
