# Reward Dimension Reduction for Scalable Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.20957
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20957
- **Reference count:** 24
- **Primary result:** Achieves 8.3x and 37.9x hypervolume improvements over baselines in 5D and 16D environments

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the scalability challenges of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) by introducing a reward dimension reduction method. The core idea is to design an affine transformation function that reduces the dimensionality of the reward space while preserving Pareto-optimality. The method uses a row-stochastic, positive matrix for the transformation and trains a reconstructor network to minimize reconstruction loss. The approach is tested on two environments: a 5-dimensional LunarLander and a 16-dimensional traffic light control task. Results show significant improvements over baseline methods, with hypervolume increases of 8.3x and 37.9x in the respective environments, while also reducing sparsity. The method demonstrates superior performance in both hypervolume and sparsity metrics, indicating effective scaling of MORL algorithms to higher-dimensional reward spaces.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a reward dimension reduction approach for scalable MORL by learning an affine transformation matrix that projects high-dimensional rewards into a lower-dimensional space while preserving Pareto optimality. The transformation matrix is constrained to be positive and row-stochastic through Softmax parameterization. A reconstructor network is trained simultaneously to minimize the reconstruction loss between original and transformed-then-reconstructed rewards. This joint optimization ensures that the reduced representation retains sufficient information for optimal policy learning. The method is integrated with a base MORL algorithm (Yang et al. 2019) and evaluated on two challenging environments: a 5-dimensional LunarLander and a 16-dimensional traffic light control task. Key hyperparameters include Adam learning rate of 0.0003, buffer sizes of 52k (Traffic) and 1M (Lunar), reconstructor hidden size of 32, and dropout rate of 0.75 for the Traffic environment.

## Key Results
- Achieves 8.3x higher hypervolume in 5D LunarLander environment compared to baselines
- Achieves 37.9x higher hypervolume in 16D traffic light control environment compared to baselines
- Demonstrates significant reduction in sparsity metric across both environments
- Ablation studies confirm the critical importance of positivity constraints and dropout regularization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by learning a low-rank affine transformation that preserves the Pareto front structure in the reduced space. The row-stochastic constraint ensures that the transformation preserves the relative importance of objectives, while the positivity constraint guarantees that the learned policies remain Pareto-optimal in the original space. The reconstructor network provides an information bottleneck that forces the transformation to retain only the most relevant reward information, effectively filtering out noise and redundant dimensions. This combination allows the MORL algorithm to learn effectively in the reduced space while still producing optimal policies in the original high-dimensional reward space.

## Foundational Learning

### Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
- **Why needed:** MORL algorithms must balance multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously, which becomes exponentially harder as the number of objectives increases
- **Quick check:** Verify that hypervolume and EUM metrics are being computed correctly for multi-dimensional Pareto fronts

### Affine Transformation with Constraints
- **Why needed:** The transformation must preserve Pareto optimality while reducing dimensionality, requiring specific mathematical constraints
- **Quick check:** Ensure the Softmax parameterization maintains row-stochasticity (row sums ≈ 1) throughout training

### Reconstruction Loss as Regularization
- **Why needed:** Forces the dimension reduction to retain sufficient information for optimal policy learning in the original space
- **Quick check:** Monitor reconstruction error to ensure the transform isn't losing critical information

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Base MORL Algorithm (Yang et al. 2019) -> Reward Transformation (A) -> Q-Network Training -> Policy Output
Reconstructor Network (g_φ) -> Reconstruction Loss -> A and g_φ Updates

### Critical Path
1. Transform rewards: r' = Ar
2. Update Q-network using transformed rewards
3. Update transformation matrix A and reconstructor g_φ using reconstruction loss
4. Apply dropout to g_φ during training

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Dimension choice:** Lower dimensions improve scalability but risk losing critical information
- **Constraint strength:** Tighter constraints (more positive) better preserve optimality but may limit expressiveness
- **Reconstruction weight:** Higher weight improves fidelity but may slow convergence

### Failure Signatures
- **Rank collapse in A:** Rows become nearly identical, losing diversity in the reduced space
- **Zero hypervolume:** Policies are not Pareto-optimal in original space (often due to broken positivity constraint)
- **High reconstruction error:** Transformation is losing too much information

### Three First Experiments
1. **Test positivity constraint:** Remove positivity constraint and verify hypervolume drops to zero as shown in Table 4
2. **Ablate reconstructor dropout:** Compare sparsity with and without dropout on g_φ to reproduce Table 5 results
3. **Monitor row-stochasticity:** Track row sums of A during training to ensure they remain close to 1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Traffic network topology and specific route configurations are not fully specified, which may impact reproducibility of the 16D environment results
- Exact preference sampling parameters for the Dirichlet distribution during training are not detailed
- Softmax parameterization details for ensuring row-stochasticity are implied but not fully described

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core methodology of using affine transformation with row-stochastic constraints and reconstruction loss is clearly described and supported by ablation studies showing importance of positivity constraints.

**Medium Confidence:** The reported hypervolume improvements (8.3x and 37.9x) are likely reproducible given the clear methodology, though exact environmental configurations may affect magnitude.

**Medium Confidence:** The sparsity reduction claims are well-supported by ablation studies, but depend on correct implementation of dropout in the reconstructor.

## Next Checks

1. **Verify matrix A positivity constraint:** Test that removing the positivity constraint on A results in zero hypervolume as shown in Table 4, confirming this is critical for Pareto optimality.

2. **Test reconstructor dropout sensitivity:** Run ablation with and without dropout on g_φ to confirm the dramatic sparsity improvement observed in Table 5.

3. **Validate row-stochasticity maintenance:** Monitor the row sums of A during training to ensure they remain close to 1, confirming the Softmax parameterization effectively enforces this constraint.
