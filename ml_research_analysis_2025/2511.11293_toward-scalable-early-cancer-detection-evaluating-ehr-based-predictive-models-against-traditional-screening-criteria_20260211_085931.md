# Toward Scalable Early Cancer Detection: Evaluating EHR-Based Predictive Models Against Traditional Screening Criteria

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11293
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11293
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: EHR-based models achieved 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases compared to traditional risk factors across 26 cancer types

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates electronic health record (EHR)-based predictive models for early cancer detection, comparing them to traditional risk factors. Using data from over 865,000 participants, baseline EHR models achieved 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases compared to traditional factors like family history or genetic mutations. The EHR foundation model, trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types. These results demonstrate that EHR-based models can more effectively identify high-risk individuals, offering a scalable and precise tool for early cancer detection and advancing population-level cancer prevention.

## Method Summary
The study employed a comprehensive analysis of EHR data from 865,000+ participants to develop and evaluate predictive models for early cancer detection. Researchers compared traditional risk factors (family history, genetic mutations) against baseline EHR models and an advanced EHR foundation model trained on patient trajectories. The models were assessed across 26 different cancer types, with enrichment ratios calculated to measure the models' ability to identify true cancer cases. The foundation model leveraged comprehensive patient histories rather than relying on single-point risk assessments.

## Key Results
- Baseline EHR models achieved 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases compared to traditional screening criteria
- The EHR foundation model trained on patient trajectories further improved predictive performance across all 26 cancer types
- Models demonstrated superior ability to identify high-risk individuals compared to conventional family history and genetic mutation-based approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that comprehensive patient trajectory data captured in EHR systems contains richer, more nuanced risk signals than traditional single-factor screening approaches. By analyzing longitudinal health patterns rather than isolated risk factors, the models can identify subtle early warning signs that precede cancer development. The foundation model's ability to learn from diverse patient populations and capture complex temporal relationships in health data enables more accurate risk stratification than conventional methods that rely on limited genetic or familial information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Enrichment ratio calculation**: Why needed - to quantify model performance improvement over baseline methods; Quick check - verify that enrichment > 1 indicates better performance than random selection
- **Patient trajectory modeling**: Why needed - captures longitudinal health patterns that precede cancer diagnosis; Quick check - ensure temporal ordering of events is preserved in training data
- **Multi-cancer type modeling**: Why needed - enables scalable screening across different cancer types; Quick check - validate performance consistency across diverse cancer types
- **Foundation model pretraining**: Why needed - leverages large-scale health data to learn general patterns before cancer-specific fine-tuning; Quick check - measure transfer learning effectiveness across cancer types
- **Risk stratification**: Why needed - identifies high-risk individuals for targeted screening; Quick check - compare positive predictive values against clinical screening thresholds

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw EHR data -> Data preprocessing -> Foundation model pretraining -> Cancer-specific fine-tuning -> Enrichment ratio evaluation -> Clinical validation

**Critical Path**: Data collection and preprocessing -> Foundation model training on patient trajectories -> Fine-tuning for specific cancer types -> Performance evaluation against traditional screening methods

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritized comprehensive data utilization over model interpretability, accepting potential "black box" predictions in exchange for improved detection rates. The foundation model approach trades computational complexity for better generalization across cancer types.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on rare cancer types, overfitting to specific demographic groups, failure to capture novel cancer presentations not present in training data, reduced effectiveness when applied to populations with different healthcare utilization patterns than training data.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Compare enrichment ratios of baseline EHR models versus traditional risk factors for common cancer types (breast, lung, colorectal)
2. Evaluate foundation model performance across different demographic subgroups to assess fairness and generalizability
3. Test model sensitivity to missing or incomplete EHR data to understand robustness in real-world deployment scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited availability of specific performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values) for individual cancer types
- Potential dataset-specific biases that may affect generalizability to other healthcare systems
- Broad comparison between EHR models and traditional risk factors without granular analysis of performance variations across different risk factor categories

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Overall scalability and feasibility of EHR-based approaches for cancer detection, supported by large sample size (865,000+ participants) and comprehensive comparison methodology
- **Medium confidence**: Specific enrichment ratio claims (3-6× improvement) due to limited detailed performance metrics and potential dataset-specific biases

## Next Checks
1. Conduct external validation using independent healthcare systems with different demographic compositions to assess model generalizability
2. Perform head-to-head comparisons with established clinical screening protocols in prospective studies to evaluate real-world impact on early detection rates
3. Implement rigorous bias and fairness assessments across different demographic groups to ensure equitable model performance
