# Discovering dynamical laws for speech gestures

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.04849
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04849
- **Reference count:** 16
- **Primary result:** Sparse symbolic regression discovers second-order linear models for most speech gestures, but cubic nonlinearities are required for approximately one-third of cases.

## Executive Summary
This study uses sparse symbolic regression to discover dynamical models of speech gestures from articulatory kinematic data. A data-driven approach identified a second-order linear model as highly accurate for the majority of gestures, but a nonlinear (cubic) force was necessary to properly model approximately one-third of cases. This confirms that articulatory dynamics are fundamentally nonlinear during gestural activation. The work validates data-driven model discovery as a valuable tool for understanding the dynamical principles that govern speech production.

## Method Summary
The study applies sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to discover symbolic differential equations governing speech gestures. The method uses the PySINDy library with STLSQ optimizer for first-order models and Constrained SR3 for second-order models. The pipeline segments articulatory trajectories by velocity zero-crossings, fits individual models, then aggregates structure through ensembling. Models are evaluated using variance-weighted R² scores and qualitative Hooke portraits (position vs. acceleration).

## Key Results
- Second-order linear models achieve excellent fits for most speech gestures
- Approximately one-third of gestures require cubic nonlinear terms for accurate modeling
- Discovered models show underdamped (not critically damped) dynamics
- Linear models produce high R² scores but fail to capture anharmonic velocity profiles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)
The system discovers interpretable dynamical equations by balancing model complexity against error using sparse regression. The algorithm constructs a library of candidate functions and solves for sparse coefficient matrix that maps these functions to time derivatives of state variables. By thresholding small coefficients to zero, it discards negligible terms, enforcing parsimony. The underlying dynamics of speech gestures are governed by a small number of active terms, making the true system sparse in the chosen basis.

### Mechanism 2: Second-Order Underdamped Dynamics
Speech gestures are better modeled as underdamped oscillators rather than the traditionally assumed critically damped systems. The discovered linear model often results in damping coefficient near zero, implying the system reaches its target through specific trajectory shape potentially requiring "deactivation" mechanism to stop at target rather than asymptotically settling via damping.

### Mechanism 3: Nonlinear (Cubic) Restoring Force
A nonlinear term (specifically cubic) is required to capture dynamics of approximately one-third of speech gestures, specifically those exhibiting anharmonic profiles. The cubic term acts as nonlinear restoring force that depends on movement amplitude, allowing the model to reproduce observed asymmetries or complex velocity profiles that linear harmonic oscillators cannot fit.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Differential Equation Order (First vs. Second Order)**
  - **Why needed here:** The study explicitly contrasts first-order models with second-order models. Understanding that physical motion involves acceleration is crucial to seeing why first-order model failed to capture Hooke portrait geometry.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the model predict velocity based only on position (1st order), or acceleration based on velocity and position (2nd order)?

- **Concept: Sparsity & Regularization (Pareto Front)**
  - **Why needed here:** The core logic of discovery method is "Pareto optimality"—finding simplest equation that explains most data. Without this concept, one might assume neural network is better than discovered symbolic equations.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does algorithm set coefficient values to zero during optimization process?

- **Concept: Phase Space & Hooke Portraits**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper moves beyond simple R² error metrics to validate models using Hooke portraits. The failure of 1st-order model was diagnosed not by error magnitude, but by qualitative shape of these plots.
  - **Quick check question:** In a Hooke portrait, what does straight line imply about system's restoring force compared to curved line?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** XRMB data -> Velocity segmentation -> SINDy discovery (STLSQ/SR3) -> Model ensembling -> Evaluation (R² + Hooke portraits)

- **Critical path:** The velocity segmentation is most fragile step. The paper excludes 37% of trajectories due to segmentation issues. If segmentation fails to isolate single "gesture," dynamical model discovery will try to fit overlapping or passive movements, leading to complex or erroneous equations.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - STLSQ vs. SR3: STLSQ is simpler but can produce unphysical coupling in 2nd-order equations. SR3 is computationally heavier but allows constraints to maintain physical interpretability.
  - Critical vs. Underdamping: The paper trades stability of critical damping for accuracy of underdamped models, which necessitates hypothesizing external "suppression" mechanism to stop gesture.

- **Failure signatures:**
  1. High R², Poor Dynamics: 1st-order model might show R² ≈ 0.96 but produce Hooke portrait that is uniformly nonlinear compared to quasi-linear data.
  2. Oscillation: Continuing linear simulation past empirical duration causes trajectory to oscillate wildly, indicating model relies on precise deactivation timing.
  3. SR3 Non-convergence: When adding cubic terms, optimizer may fail to find stable coefficients if data is noisy or amplitude-dependence is inconsistent.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate Recovery: Generate synthetic data using known damped harmonic oscillator and verify if STLSQ pipeline recovers exact coefficients and equation structure.
  2. Library Stress Test: Run discovery pipeline on test set using 4th-degree polynomial library; confirm if model complexity increases without improving Hooke portrait linearity.
  3. Segmentation Sensitivity: Alter velocity threshold used for segmentation to see if proportion of "linear" vs. "nonlinear" discovered models shifts significantly.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Is a cubic term on velocity necessary to fully encompass the range of speech movement dynamics?
- Do the discovered dynamical laws generalize to languages other than English?
- How do discovered gestural dynamics couple with the dynamics of neural planning fields?
- Can data-driven model discovery accurately identify parameters for temporally overlapping or coupled gestures?

## Limitations
- Reliance on effective gesture segmentation excludes 37% of trajectories
- Theoretical justification for cubic nonlinearities in speech gestures is sparse
- Robustness of SR3 optimization for discovering cubic terms across different datasets remains uncertain

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Discovery of underdamped second-order linear dynamics as dominant model
- **Medium Confidence:** Assertion that approximately one-third of gestures require cubic nonlinearities
- **Medium Confidence:** Effectiveness of SINDy framework for discovering parsimonious dynamical models

## Next Checks
1. Apply discovered models to unseen speakers from XRMB corpus to assess robustness of "1/3 nonlinear" proportion
2. Test impact of varying velocity threshold parameters for segmentation on final proportion of linear vs. nonlinear models
3. Validate model discovery pipeline on different articulatory dataset (e.g., EMA or ultrasound) to confirm generality of findings
