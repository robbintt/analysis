# A perishable ability? The future of writing in the face of generative artificial intelligence

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.19427
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19427
- **Authors**: Evandro L. T. P. Cunha
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Key outcome**: The article explores the possibility that human writing abilities may decline significantly or even disappear due to increased reliance on generative AI tools.

## Executive Summary
This article explores the possibility that human writing abilities may decline significantly or even disappear due to increased reliance on generative artificial intelligence tools. Drawing parallels with the abandonment of Linear B script during the Greek Dark Ages, the author argues that writing, like other technologies, is not immune to obsolescence if it becomes unnecessary for a community. Despite ChatGPT's argument that AI lacks true creativity and emotional connection, the article suggests that the convenience and adequacy of AI-generated text could lead humans to outsource writing tasks, gradually eroding their own writing skills. The author concludes that this scenario, while speculative, warrants consideration given the rapid advancement of AI technologies.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a theoretical argument supported by historical analogy and qualitative demonstrations using ChatGPT. The author draws parallels between the abandonment of Linear B script (~1200 BCE) and potential writing obsolescence due to AI. The methodology involves literature synthesis of historical sources on Linear B cessation and anecdotal interactions with ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) from September 4, 2023, including prompts for writing tasks and counterargument generation. No quantitative analysis or reproducible computational methodology is employed.

## Key Results
- Human writing ability may decline if AI tools sufficiently satisfy communicative needs
- Writing could become obsolete like Linear B when no longer necessary for a community
- AI-generated text may be "good enough" to reduce incentive for humans to maintain writing skills

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Disuse-Induced Skill Atrophy
- Claim: IF humans substantially reduce writing practice due to AI outsourcing, THEN writing ability may degrade over time.
- Mechanism: Writing is a practiced skill → AI tools reduce the need to write manually → reduced practice leads to skill erosion → across generations, the skill may become rare or specialized.
- Core assumption: Writing ability requires ongoing practice to maintain (similar to driving or other procedural skills).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "lower volume of written text production by humans" linked to potential ability loss
  - [section 3] Parallel drawn to "decline in human ability to drive cars due to the advent of autonomous vehicles"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; no corpus papers empirically demonstrate skill atrophy from AI use
- Break condition: If humans maintain deliberate writing practice despite AI availability, or if AI-assisted writing still requires substantial human cognitive engagement.

### Mechanism 2: Convenience-Driven Outsourcing
- Claim: IF AI-generated text satisfies communicative intentions efficiently, THEN economic and practical incentives will favor AI over human writing.
- Mechanism: AI text generation is faster/lower effort → individuals choose convenience → reduced investment in writing skill development → systemic decline in writing competence.
- Core assumption: Humans tend to optimize for convenience when output quality is "good enough."
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "less incentive for individuals to acquire or maintain proficiency"
  - [section 4] ChatGPT-generated love letter example: communicative intention satisfied without genuine emotion
  - [corpus] "Approaching the Limits to EFL Writing Enhancement with AI-generated Text" shows students integrating AI text into their writing
- Break condition: If writing provides intrinsic cognitive benefits (learning, reasoning) that users value beyond output quality.

### Mechanism 3: Institutional Support Withdrawal
- Claim: IF the social systems that sustain writing as a skill collapse or shift, THEN writing ability may be abandoned even if technically useful.
- Mechanism: Writing persists through institutional reinforcement (schools, professional requirements) → institutions shift to AI-mediated workflows → infrastructure for teaching/rewarding writing diminishes → skill becomes specialized or lost.
- Core assumption: Technology persistence depends on institutional support, not just inherent utility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] Linear B abandonment was "deliberate" when the palace administrative system collapsed
  - [section 2] "there was no longer a need or system in place to maintain it"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related papers discuss AI integration but not institutional collapse scenarios
- Break condition: If institutions maintain writing as a required competency regardless of AI capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

- **Technology abandonment patterns**
  - Why needed here: The paper's argument rests on historical precedent (Linear B) that useful technologies can be abandoned when social conditions change.
  - Quick check question: Can you name a technology that was widely used, then abandoned, not because it stopped working, but because social/economic conditions changed?

- **Passive vs. active literacy**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between reading comprehension (passive) and writing production (active)—these could diverge in an AI-mediated future.
  - Quick check question: Could someone lose the ability to produce text while retaining the ability to understand it?

- **Communicative intention vs. production method**
  - Why needed here: The paper argues AI can satisfy communication goals without human writing, decoupling intent from production.
  - Quick check question: If an AI-generated message achieves your goal, does the method matter?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map** (sociotechnical system):
  - Human writers (skill holders, practitioners)
  - AI text generators (replacement/augmentation layer)
  - Institutions (schools, workplaces, credentialing bodies)
  - Economic incentives (cost, speed, scalability)
  - Cultural norms (value placed on "authentic" human expression)

- **Critical path**: Writing practice → skill maintenance → institutional reinforcement → intergenerational transmission. AI tools can interrupt at any node.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Efficiency vs. skill preservation
  - AI augmentation (human-in-the-loop) vs. AI replacement (human-out-of-loop)
  - Universal writing literacy vs. elite/specialist writing class

- **Failure signatures** (hypothesized indicators, not measured in paper):
  - Longitudinal decline in writing assessment scores
  - Increased AI-detection rates in educational/professional contexts
  - Workforce surveys showing reduced confidence in independent writing
  - Curriculum shifts reducing writing requirements

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Longitudinal cohort study comparing writing skill trajectories in high-AI-use vs. low-AI-use populations (controlling for education, profession).
  2. Institutional analysis: track changes in writing requirements across educational systems and hiring practices over 5-10 years.
  3. Behavioral experiment: measure willingness to outsource writing tasks as AI quality and convenience vary (establish dose-response relationship between AI capability and human effort reduction).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Will the widespread outsourcing of text production to generative AI lead to a significant, cross-generational decline in human writing proficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author posits that humans may "have lost or significantly decreased their ability to write due to the outsourcing of this activity to machines."
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes the possibility based on historical parallels and current trends, but the actual rate and extent of skill atrophy in the general population remain unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies comparing writing skill metrics (e.g., syntactic complexity, vocabulary range) in cohorts with high versus low exposure to generative AI tools.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can a society maintain the cognitive benefits of literacy (e.g., critical thinking, reasoning) if the population shifts entirely to "passive literacy"?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The text describes a scenario of "passive literacy," where individuals retain the ability to read but lose the ability to produce text.
- Why unresolved: The author notes that writing is proven to benefit learning and structuring thoughts, but it is unstated whether reading alone is sufficient to maintain these cognitive faculties in a population.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative psychological studies assessing critical thinking and reasoning capabilities in participants who only read versus those who actively write.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the historical abandonment of the Linear B script a valid predictive model for the potential obsolescence of writing due to AI?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper relies heavily on the analogy between the collapse of Mycenaean palace systems (which ended Linear B use) and the current rise of AI.
- Why unresolved: The causal mechanisms differ: Linear B was abandoned following societal collapse and the specific loss of a bureaucratic administrative class, whereas AI adoption is driven by technological convenience and efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of technology abandonment following systemic collapse versus convenience-driven displacement in other domains (e.g., navigation, arithmetic).

## Limitations
- The argument is speculative and theoretical, relying on historical analogy (Linear B abandonment) rather than empirical evidence of writing skill decline from AI use.
- No longitudinal data exists to demonstrate actual skill atrophy from AI writing tool adoption.
- The paper does not distinguish between writing for functional communication versus writing as a cognitive/learning tool, which may have different vulnerability to AI outsourcing.

## Confidence
- **Medium confidence** in the core mechanism (disuse-induced skill atrophy) - well-supported by general skill maintenance literature but not yet demonstrated specifically for writing in AI contexts.
- **Medium confidence** in the historical parallel (Linear B abandonment) - the analogy is plausible but the social conditions differ significantly from modern AI adoption.
- **Low confidence** in quantitative predictions about the pace or extent of writing ability decline - no empirical basis for timeline or severity estimates.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal studies comparing writing skill trajectories in populations with high vs. low AI writing tool usage, controlling for education and profession.
2. Analyze institutional trends in writing requirements across educational systems and professional credentialing over the next 5-10 years to detect early signs of institutional withdrawal.
3. Perform behavioral experiments measuring willingness to outsource writing tasks as AI quality and convenience vary, establishing dose-response relationships between AI capability and human effort reduction.
