# Action-Driven Processes for Continuous-Time Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.26672
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26672
- Reference count: 16
- Introduces action-driven processes (ADPs) as a framework for continuous-time systems with both continuous state changes and discrete discontinuous transitions.

## Executive Summary
Action-driven processes (ADPs) provide a formal framework for modeling continuous-time systems where actions trigger discontinuous state transitions. The paper establishes two equivalent formulations of ADPs - Independent Action Arrivals (IAA) and Action After Arrival (AAA) - and demonstrates their connection to semi-Markov processes. The key theoretical contribution shows that maximum entropy reinforcement learning can be formulated as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between policy-driven and reward-driven distributions for ADPs, without requiring the optimality variables typically used in control-as-inference approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces ADPs through two equivalent formulations: IAA where each action type has its own Poisson arrival process, and AAA where a single wait time is sampled followed by action selection. The framework connects to maximum entropy RL by defining a true distribution with fixed arrival rate ρ and policy πθ, and a model distribution with action rates λ(a,s) = e^{r(a,s)}. The KL divergence between these distributions decomposes to yield the maximum entropy RL objective. A uniformization method is provided for discrete-time simulation.

## Key Results
- ADPs unify continuous state evolution with discrete action-triggered transitions via two equivalent formulations
- Maximum entropy reinforcement learning emerges from KL divergence minimization between true and model distributions without requiring optimality variables
- Semi-Markov processes are a special case of ADPs where only one non-trivial action exists

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Action-driven processes unify continuous state evolution with discrete action-triggered transitions via two equivalent formulations.
- Mechanism: In IAA, each action type has its own Poisson process; in AAA, a single wait time is sampled then an action drawn. Equivalence holds via rate conversion λ'ₓ(t) = Σₐ λₓₐ(t) and probability conversion p'ₓₐ(t) = λₓₐ(t)/λₓ(t).
- Core assumption: Actions trigger state transitions; between arrivals, state may evolve continuously but no information flows between components.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "actions trigger discontinuous state transitions and enable the flow of information"; [Section 3.3] shows equivalence derivation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Maximum entropy reinforcement learning emerges from KL divergence minimization without optimality variables.
- Mechanism: Define true distribution q with fixed rate ρ and policy πθ; define model p with rates λ(a,s) = e^{r(a,s)}. KL divergence decomposes to yield objective: Σₙ E[r(Aₙ,Sₙ₋₁)] - E[H(πθ(·|Sₙ₋₁))].
- Core assumption: True wait time is exponential with constant rate ρ, sufficiently large to make auxiliary terms vanish.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] KL minimization "is equivalent to maximum entropy reinforcement learning"; [Section 4] shows objective derivation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Semi-Markov processes are a special case of ADPs with one non-trivial action.
- Mechanism: ADPs generalize semi-Markov processes by allowing multiple concurrent action types with independent arrival rates. Transition rate λ^{(β)}_{xy}(t) = Σₐ p^{(β)}_{xay}(t) · P(arrival via action a at t|x).
- Core assumption: Finitely many actions; wait time distributions depend only on current state and time since last arrival.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3.1] "Semi-Markov processes are a special case in which the transitions are triggered by a single non-trivial action."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Poisson processes and exponential wait times**
  - Why needed here: The entire ADP framework builds on actions arriving via (possibly inhomogeneous) Poisson processes; understanding that wait times are exponentially distributed when rates are constant is essential.
  - Quick check question: Given a homogeneous Poisson process with rate λ, what is the probability density of the first arrival time after t=0?

- Concept: **KL divergence decomposition**
  - Why needed here: The paper's main theoretical result relies on chain-rule decomposition of I(X;Y) = I(X|Y) + I(Y) to separate state transitions from action selection.
  - Quick check question: If p(x,y) = p(x)p(y|x), how does D_KL(q||p) decompose in terms of conditional divergences?

- Concept: **Maximum entropy RL objective**
  - Why needed here: The paper shows this objective emerges naturally; knowing the standard form E[Σr] + E[H(π)] helps recognize what the derivation targets.
  - Quick check question: What happens to the entropy bonus term if the policy becomes deterministic?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - State tracker → Action samplers → Transition kernel → Policy module → Reward encoder

- Critical path: Sample wait times → Select action → Apply transition → Update state → Compute KL objective → Optimize policy parameters

- Design tradeoffs:
  - IAA vs AAA: IAA is conceptually cleaner for concurrent systems; AAA is computationally simpler (one wait time sample per step)
  - Uniformization rate λ: Higher λ gives finer-grained embeddings but more computational overhead
  - Inverse temperature β: Higher β → deterministic action selection (zero temperature limit), lower β → more exploration

- Failure signatures:
  - Divergent wait times if rates λₓₐ(t) become negative or undefined
  - Non-integrable path densities if infinite trivial actions occur between non-trivial ones
  - Objective collapse if ρ is not sufficiently large relative to λ(Sₙ₋₁)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Validate IAA-AAA equivalence**: Implement both formulations on a simple 2-action system; verify identical trajectory distributions over 10K samples.
  2. **Maximum entropy recovery**: On a discrete state space with known optimal policy, confirm that minimizing KL divergence recovers the max-entropy RL solution as ρ → ∞.
  3. **Spiking neuron sanity check**: Model a 2-neuron integrate-and-fire network; verify that spike timing distributions match theoretical Poisson predictions under fixed input current.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific variational inference algorithms can be derived from the action-driven process formulation to optimize control policies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they will "develop learning algorithms based on information-theoretic strategies derived from variational inference" in future work.
- Why unresolved: While the paper establishes the theoretical link between ADPs and MaxEnt RL via KL divergence, it does not propose concrete algorithmic implementations for policy optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: The derivation of policy gradient or EM-based algorithms that specifically leverage the ADP wait-time distributions and action rates.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can diverse spiking neural network (SNN) architectures be modeled within the ADP framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion outlines future work on "modeling different kinds of spiking neural networks using ADPs."
- Why unresolved: The paper uses integrate-and-fire networks only as an illustrative example (Example 3) and does not validate the framework on complex SNN topologies or learning rules.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of ADPs to model distinct SNN types (e.g., Hodgkin-Huxley or Izhikevich models) and their learning dynamics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the derived maximum entropy objective degrade when the wait time rate ρ is finite rather than "sufficiently large"?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4 proves the equivalence to maximum entropy RL only for "sufficiently large ρ", implying the approximation may fail or behave differently at smaller scales.
- Why unresolved: The sensitivity of the objective function to the magnitude of ρ is not analyzed, leaving a potential stability or convergence gap for practical applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: An error bound analysis or empirical simulation showing the divergence between the ADP objective and standard MaxEnt RL as ρ decreases.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the category theoretic foundations of Action-Driven Processes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose exploring the "category theoretic foundations of ADPs where the objects are states and the morphisms are actions."
- Why unresolved: The current paper focuses on stochastic process definitions and RL connections without formalizing the compositional structure of the processes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal categorization of ADPs, likely within a symmetric monoidal category, providing diagrammatic representations for process composition.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation: Theoretical derivations without concrete experimental results
- Abstract assumptions: Core equivalence relies on specific mathematical conditions that may not hold practically
- Implementation details missing: Critical parameters like uniformization rate ρ, policy parameterization, and reward scaling are not specified

## Confidence
- High confidence: The mathematical derivation of IAA-AAA equivalence and KL divergence decomposition are rigorous and internally consistent
- Medium confidence: The connection between maximum entropy RL and variational inference is theoretically sound but depends on the constant-rate assumption
- Low confidence: Claims about ADP applications to spiking neural networks and categorical foundations lack empirical support

## Next Checks
1. **IAA-AAA equivalence verification**: Implement both formulations on a simple 2-action system; verify identical trajectory distributions over 10K samples to confirm the mathematical equivalence.

2. **Maximum entropy RL recovery**: On a discrete state space with known optimal policy, confirm that minimizing KL divergence recovers the max-entropy RL solution as ρ → ∞, testing the theoretical connection.

3. **Spiking neuron simulation**: Model a 2-neuron integrate-and-fire network; verify that spike timing distributions match theoretical Poisson predictions under fixed input current, validating the ADP framework for neural systems.
