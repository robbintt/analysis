# Synthetic Object Compositions for Scalable and Accurate Learning in Detection, Segmentation, and Grounding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09110
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09110
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Models trained on 100K SOC images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) by +24-36% AP, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Synthetic Object Compositions (SOC), a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates large-scale, high-quality synthetic images for object detection, instance segmentation, and visual grounding. SOC composes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation and camera configuration augmentation, with generative harmonization and mask-area-weighted blending to ensure photorealism. Models trained on just 100K SOC images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) and other synthetic pipelines by +24-36%, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO. SOC is particularly effective in low-data regimes, yielding +6.59 AP on 1% COCO data. The controllability of SOC also enables targeted data generation for intra-class referring, a diagnostic grounding task requiring fine-grained attribute discrimination.

## Method Summary
SOC generates synthetic object segments using FLUX-1-dev and extracts clean masks with DIS (dichotomous image segmentation). These segments are composed into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation, where depth and spatial position are sampled independently of object category to break spurious correlations. Generative harmonization via IC-Light performs inpainting and relighting, followed by mask-area-weighted blending in LAB color space to preserve fine details on small objects while maintaining global photorealism. Camera augmentation applies random zoom and depth-of-field blur. The pipeline generates pixel-perfect annotations (bounding boxes, occlusion-adjusted masks, and referring expressions via QwQ-32B), eliminating label noise typical in pseudo-labeling approaches. Models are trained in two stages: synthetic pretraining followed by real data fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- SOC-50K (50K images) yields +9.7 LVIS AP vs. GRIT's +7.0 despite 400× fewer images
- SOC achieves +10.9 AP on LVIS, +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO, and +6.59 AP on 1% COCO data
- 3D geometric layout augmentation provides +1.43 AP improvement over random 2D layouts on zero-shot COCO instance segmentation
- Mask-area-weighted blending preserves small object details, improving LVIS-Mini AP from 36.3 to 38.6

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Pixel-perfect annotations reduce label noise
SOC generates object segments on white backgrounds and extracts clean masks, then composes scenes while preserving ground truth annotations throughout. This eliminates detector-inherited noise typical in pseudo-labeling approaches.

### Mechanism 2: 3D geometric layout breaks category-position correlations
Depth and spatial position are sampled independently of object category (p(d_i, X_i, Y_i | c_i) = p(d_i, X_i, Y_i)), preventing models from exploiting spurious correlations like "cars appear large and near the bottom."

### Mechanism 3: Mask-area-weighted blending preserves fine details
IC-Light performs inpainting and relighting, but can distort small objects. SOC re-blends original segments with harmonized outputs using blending weight α_i based on object size, preserving details on small objects while achieving global photorealism.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pseudo-labeling vs. ground-truth synthesis**
  - Why needed: SOC's core innovation is generating annotations during composition rather than post-hoc labeling
  - Quick check: Can you explain why a detector's output on a synthetic image might be less accurate than the original generation mask?

- **Concept: Perspective projection and depth-size confounds**
  - Why needed: The 3D layout augmentation relies on understanding that apparent object size = (focal length × physical size) / depth
  - Quick check: If you double an object's depth while halving its physical size, does its projected 2D size change?

- **Concept: Domain gap in synthetic-to-real transfer**
  - Why needed: SOC acknowledges remaining texture/material differences as a limitation
  - Quick check: Why might a model that achieves high accuracy on synthetic data still fail on real test images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Object segment generation → 3D layout composition → generative harmonization → camera augmentation → annotation computation
- **Critical path:** Object segments → 3D layout composition → generative harmonization → camera augmentation → annotation computation. The harmonization + blending step is where most visual artifacts are addressed.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Photorealism vs. annotation accuracy (IC-Light can distort objects; blending recovers accuracy), layout diversity vs. physical plausibility (category-independent sampling breaks shortcuts but creates "unnatural" scenes), scale vs. segment reuse (segment diversity matters more than image count)
- **Failure signatures:** Models learn edge artifacts (likely missing or underweighted blending), poor rare-class performance (check category sampling balance), inconsistent grounding expressions (verify QwQ-32B prompts include spatial relationships)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train Mask2Former on 10K SOC images (zero-shot COCO), verify ~12.8 AP
  2. Compare inpainting-only vs. inpainting + blending on held-out validation set, target ~2+ AP difference
  3. Compare zero-shot performance on synthetic vs. real validation sets, large gap (>15 AP) suggests remaining artifacts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can integrating fine-grained relation control into the SOC pipeline significantly improve model performance on tasks specifically requiring inter-object interaction reasoning?
- Does the lack of explicit 3D geometry priors in the SOC composition phase limit the utility of these synthetic datasets for depth estimation and novel-view synthesis tasks?
- To what extent does the exclusion of amorphous "stuff" region annotations hinder model performance on panoptic segmentation compared to instance-level tasks?

## Limitations
- SOC's generation pipeline requires substantial infrastructure (FLUX-1-dev, DIS, IC-Light) that may not be universally accessible
- Synthetic-real domain gap remains a challenge, requiring fine-tuning on real data for optimal performance
- The synthetic compositions prioritize object-centric scenes with thing-only segments, limiting applicability to tasks requiring stuff classes or dense scene understanding

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Synthetic data quality advantages and relative performance gains vs. baseline methods are well-supported
- **Medium Confidence**: Mechanism claims about why SOC works are logically sound but lack direct empirical isolation in some cases
- **Low Confidence**: Long-tail performance improvements on rare classes rely heavily on balanced sampling strategy but lack detailed per-category analysis

## Next Checks
1. Measure zero-shot performance on real validation sets before and after harmonization steps to isolate how much blending vs. generative harmonization reduces the synthetic-real gap
2. Conduct per-category breakdown of LVIS AP gains to identify whether improvements are uniform across rare classes or concentrated in specific categories
3. Benchmark the end-to-end generation pipeline against alternative synthetic approaches to determine if AP gains justify additional computational overhead
