core_contribution: 'This study demonstrates that generative large language models,
  when fine-tuned on synthetic and MIMIC-CXR radiology reports, significantly improve
  error detection in radiology reports. Using zero-shot prompting, the fine-tuned
  Llama-3-70B-Instruct model achieved the highest F1 scores across all error types:
  0.769 for negation errors, 0.772 for left/right errors, 0.750 for interval change

# Generative Large Language Models Trained for Detecting Errors in Radiology Reports

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.04336
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04336
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fine-tuned LLMs achieved F1 scores up to 0.828 for detecting radiology report errors

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the application of generative large language models (LLMs) for detecting errors in radiology reports. The researchers fine-tuned models on synthetic and MIMIC-CXR data, focusing on four error types: negation errors, left/right errors, interval change errors, and transcription errors. Using zero-shot prompting, the fine-tuned Llama-3-70B-Instruct model demonstrated superior performance with macro-F1 scores reaching 0.780 overall. Real-world validation showed that radiologists confirmed errors detected by the models in 163 out of 200 reports, indicating high practical utility.

## Method Summary
The study employed a fine-tuning approach where generative LLMs were trained on synthetic radiology reports and MIMIC-CXR data to detect four specific error types. The researchers used zero-shot prompting to evaluate model performance, comparing fine-tuned models against baseline models. Validation was conducted through radiologist review of model-detected errors in a sample of 200 real-world reports. The fine-tuning process involved optimizing the models to recognize patterns associated with each error type while maintaining contextual understanding of radiology report language.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Llama-3-70B-Instruct achieved highest F1 scores: 0.769 (negation), 0.772 (left/right), 0.750 (interval change), 0.828 (transcription)
- Overall macro-F1 score of 0.780 across all error types
- Radiologists confirmed errors in 99/200 reports (accuracy 0.495), with 163 reports confirmed by at least one radiologist (accuracy 0.815)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The fine-tuning process enables LLMs to develop specialized pattern recognition capabilities for radiology report errors. By training on both synthetic and real-world data, the models learn to identify linguistic cues and contextual patterns associated with each error type. The zero-shot prompting approach allows the fine-tuned models to generalize their learned capabilities to new reports without requiring additional task-specific training, demonstrating that the models have developed robust internal representations of radiology report structure and error patterns.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Zero-shot prompting**: Allows models to perform tasks without specific training examples for that task
   - Why needed: Enables evaluation of model's general understanding without task-specific fine-tuning
   - Quick check: Compare zero-shot performance against few-shot and full fine-tuning approaches

2. **Synthetic data generation**: Creating artificial radiology reports with controlled error types
   - Why needed: Provides large volumes of training data with known error patterns
   - Quick check: Measure synthetic data quality through human evaluation of realism

3. **Error type categorization**: Systematic classification of radiology report errors
   - Why needed: Enables targeted model training and evaluation for specific error patterns
   - Quick check: Validate error categories through expert consensus and inter-rater reliability

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Synthetic Data Generation -> Model Fine-tuning -> Zero-shot Evaluation -> Radiologist Validation

**Critical Path**: The fine-tuning process is critical, as it directly impacts model performance. Starting with synthetic data generation, the fine-tuned models are then evaluated using zero-shot prompting, with final validation by radiologists.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study chose fine-tuning over prompt engineering for better performance, but this requires more computational resources. Using synthetic data enables large-scale training but may introduce domain shift compared to real reports.

**Failure Signatures**: Models may struggle with complex contextual errors, rare medical terminology, or subtle negation patterns. Performance degradation is expected when encountering report formats or institutions not represented in training data.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test model performance on synthetic data with varying levels of error complexity
2. Evaluate zero-shot performance across different radiology report formats
3. Compare fine-tuned model accuracy against human radiologist error detection rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on synthetic data may not fully capture real-world complexity
- Limited validation set size (200 reports) constrains generalizability
- Lack of detailed analysis on false positive/negative rates

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Fine-tuned LLMs can detect specific error types with F1 scores 0.750-0.828
- **Medium confidence**: Overall clinical utility for error detection
- **Medium confidence**: Specific performance metrics due to limited validation methodology

## Next Checks

1. Test fine-tuned models on radiology reports from multiple hospitals to assess generalizability

2. Conduct comprehensive radiologist evaluation with formal disagreement resolution process

3. Implement clinical pilot study to evaluate real-time performance and workflow impact
