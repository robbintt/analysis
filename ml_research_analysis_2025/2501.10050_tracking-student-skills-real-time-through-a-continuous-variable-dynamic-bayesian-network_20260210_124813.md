# Tracking student skills real-time through a continuous-variable dynamic Bayesian network

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10050

- Primary result: PDT models student skill success rates as full probability distributions using beta conjugate priors in a DBN, enabling real-time updates and uncertainty quantification

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Performance Distribution Tracing (PDT), a method for tracking student skill success rates in real-time. Unlike traditional approaches that estimate a single success probability, PDT models the entire probability distribution of success rates using continuous random variables in a Dynamic Bayesian Network. By employing beta distributions as conjugate priors, PDT can analytically update success rate distributions upon new observations, enabling both real-time updates and explicit uncertainty quantification. The method incorporates domain knowledge through links between related skills and allows combining data from similar skills to improve estimates.

## Method Summary
PDT represents each student's skill success rate as a continuous random variable with a probability density function (PDF) expressed as a linear combination of beta distribution basis functions. When a student attempts an exercise, the system updates the coefficient vector representing this PDF using Bayes' law, which is analytically tractable due to the beta conjugate prior property. The method incorporates smoothing between consecutive executions to account for learning effects and time decay, with the smoothing order dynamically adjusted based on practice count and time since last exercise. Skills can be linked through composite relationships or correlations, allowing data pooling across the skill graph. The framework supports both real-time updates and explicit uncertainty quantification, addressing a key limitation of traditional Knowledge Tracing approaches.

## Key Results
- PDT's skill level estimates were perceived as realistic by approximately 100 students in experiments
- The system encouraged practice and produced recommendations that students accepted at similar rates to those from live teachers
- The approach provides both explainability and accuracy indications, filling a gap in Knowledge Tracing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Using beta distributions as conjugate priors enables real-time analytical updates of success rate distributions. The success rate for each skill is modeled as a continuous random variable with a PDF expressed as a linear combination of beta distribution basis functions. When a new observation (success/failure) arrives, Bayes' law updates the coefficient vector through a deterministic rule: on success, coefficients shift toward higher indices; on failure, toward lower indices. Because beta distributions are conjugate priors for Bernoulli likelihoods, the posterior remains in the same functional form, avoiding numerical integration. The core assumption is that the true success rate is approximately stationary within the time window between observations; learning effects are handled separately through smoothing.

### Mechanism 2
Smoothing between consecutive executions quantifies uncertainty from learning effects and time decay. A joint prior correlates successive success rates (ak, ak+1) with correlation ρ = ns/(ns+2). The smoothing step applies this prior to widen the distribution, reducing peakedness. The smoothing order ns is dynamically set: larger ns (60–120) when heavily practiced (less learning uncertainty), smaller ns (20–40) after long time gaps (more forgetting uncertainty). The core assumption is that learning causes gradual drift in success rates, which can be modeled as uncertainty injection rather than directional bias (the prior is symmetric around ak = ak+1).

### Mechanism 3
Composite skills and correlated skills enable data pooling across the skill graph, improving estimates for sparsely practiced skills. Exercises and composite skills are defined through probability polynomials (using and/or/pick/part operators). When an exercise involving multiple skills is attempted, each skill's distribution updates proportionally to its inferred contribution—the algorithm "blames" the weaker skill more on failure. Distributions from subskills, direct practice, and correlated skills are merged by multiplying their coefficient vectors and renormalizing, analogous to Bayesian fusion of conditionally independent evidence. The core assumption is that skill success rates are conditionally independent given the student's underlying abilities; correlations between skills are captured through explicit joint priors rather than latent factors.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Beta distribution and conjugate priors
Why needed here: The entire PDT representation builds on expressing success rate PDFs as linear combinations of beta PDFs. Without understanding that conjugate priors preserve distribution families under Bayesian updates, the coefficient-based update rules appear arbitrary.
Quick check question: If a Beta(α, β) prior observes 3 successes and 2 failures, what are the posterior parameters?

### Concept: Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs)
Why needed here: PDT is structured as a DBN where nodes are continuous random variables (success rates) that evolve over time. Understanding temporal dependency and conditional independence in DBNs clarifies why smoothing and merging operations are separated.
Quick check question: In a DBN, what does the Markov assumption imply about the relationship between ak and ak+2 given ak+1?

### Concept: Probability polynomials and basis function expansion
Why needed here: Exercise success rates are computed by evaluating polynomials over skill success rates. The inference step requires taking expected values of basis functions applied to these polynomials—this is where the mathematical machinery connects to predictions.
Quick check question: If x = a·b (and-operator) and E[a] = 0.7, E[b] = 0.6 with independence, what is E[x]?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Database -> Update engine -> Smoothing module -> Inference module -> Merge module

### Critical path
1. On exercise completion → identify involved skills → fetch stored coefficients from database
2. Apply smoothing to each skill's coefficients (accounts for time/practice decay since last access)
3. If skill has subskills/correlations → perform inference and merge steps per Figure 4 flow
4. Update each involved skill's coefficients using the observation and probability polynomial
5. Store updated c* (not the smoothed version) back to database

### Design tradeoffs
- **Smoothing order ns**: Higher values = less uncertainty injection, faster convergence but slower adaptation to real learning. The paper uses adaptive ns (20–120) as a compromise.
- **Basis function order**: Each observation increases order by 1 (or by polynomial degree for multi-skill exercises). Long practice histories produce high-order coefficient vectors. The paper doesn't specify truncation, but repeated smoothing naturally reduces order to ns.
- **Correlation modeling depth**: The paper recommends limiting to skill pairs; groups of 3+ correlated skills are rare and computationally heavier.

### Failure signatures
- **Coefficients becoming negative**: Numerical instability during repeated updates/merges. Mitigation: renormalize and enforce non-negativity after each operation.
- **Distributions not narrowing with more data**: Smoothing order ns may be set too low for heavily practiced skills, or correlated skills with conflicting data are being merged incorrectly.
- **Exercise predictions disagreeing with observed success rates**: Check probability polynomial construction; operator semantics (and/or/pick/part) may not match actual exercise structure.

### First 3 experiments
1. **Single-skill tracking validation**: Initialize with flat prior c = [1]; simulate 20 alternating success/failure observations; verify coefficients converge toward a peaked distribution around 0.5 with appropriate variance reduction.
2. **Smoothing decay calibration**: For a fixed coefficient vector, apply smoothing with ns values 4, 16, 64, 128; confirm that higher ns preserves distribution shape while lower ns flattens toward uniform.
3. **Multi-skill blame attribution**: Set up skill A (E[a] = 0.9, narrow distribution) and skill B (E[b] = 0.3, narrow); simulate failure on exercise X = and(A, B); verify that B's distribution shifts more dramatically than A's after the update.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the joint prior for subsequent skill executions be modified to incorporate an inherent learning bias? The authors note the current symmetric prior assumes ak+1 has the same mean as ak, but suggest "it may be sensible to skew this prior" to encourage improvement, explicitly labeling this a subject for future research. The current conjugate prior (Eq. 10) is symmetric and does not model the expectation that students generally improve over time.

### Open Question 2
How can the PDT framework be extended to model and update skill estimates for collaborative student exercises? The paper identifies the handling of student collaborations as a "more interesting extension," asking how to predict the success rate of a pair and update individual coefficients based on joint work. The current algorithm is designed for individual agents; merging distributions or handling dependencies for group work is not yet defined.

### Open Question 3
Can PDT be statistically compared to other Knowledge Tracing algorithms using a fair and standardized metric? The authors state a useful next step is to "statistically evaluate the algorithm" against others, though they note difficulties due to differing data requirements and output formats (distributions vs. single numbers). Standard datasets often lack the necessary skill links PDT requires, and standard metrics do not typically evaluate the accuracy of full probability distributions.

## Limitations
- Dataset specifics are unclear: The paper mentions ~100 students but doesn't provide details about exercise structure, skill graph complexity, or how skills were defined
- Dynamic hyperparameter selection relies on domain-specific heuristics that require manual tuning per implementation context
- Numerical stability issues can arise during repeated coefficient updates and merges, though mitigation strategies are not discussed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The mathematical framework (beta conjugate priors, DBN structure, probability polynomials) is internally consistent and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Practical performance claims (student perception, recommendation acceptance) are based on the 2023 experiment paper rather than this one
- **Medium confidence**: Dynamic hyperparameter heuristics (ns selection based on time/practice) are described but not rigorously validated across diverse learning scenarios

## Next Checks
1. **Single-skill convergence test**: Simulate 50 alternating success/failure observations on a single skill with flat prior; verify the coefficient distribution converges to a peaked shape around 0.5 with decreasing variance.
2. **Smoothing sensitivity analysis**: For a fixed coefficient vector, apply smoothing with ns = 4, 16, 64, 128; measure changes in distribution mean, variance, and shape to confirm expected decay behavior.
3. **Multi-skill blame attribution validation**: Set up two skills with known means (0.9 and 0.3); simulate failure on their AND combination; verify the weaker skill's distribution updates more significantly than the stronger one.
