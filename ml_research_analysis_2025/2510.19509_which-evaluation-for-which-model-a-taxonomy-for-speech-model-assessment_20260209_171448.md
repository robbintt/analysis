core_contribution: 'This paper introduces a capability-aware taxonomy for evaluating
  speech foundation models. It organizes evaluations along three orthogonal axes:
  the evaluation aspect (e.g., linguistic, acoustic, aesthetic), the model capabilities
  required (e.g., speech generation, real-time interaction, multimodal processing),
  and the task or protocol requirements (e.g., fine-tuning, human judgment).'

# Which Evaluation for Which Model? A Taxonomy for Speech Model Assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19509
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19509
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces a capability-aware taxonomy organizing speech model evaluations along three orthogonal axes: evaluation aspect, model capabilities, and task/protocol requirements.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of selecting appropriate evaluations for speech foundation models by introducing a structured taxonomy that categorizes assessments along three orthogonal dimensions. The framework maps the space of existing benchmarks and reveals systematic gaps in evaluation coverage, particularly for prosody, interaction, and reasoning aspects. By explicitly aligning model capabilities with task requirements, the taxonomy provides a principled tool for researchers to select suitable evaluations and guides future benchmark design efforts.

## Method Summary
The taxonomy organizes speech model evaluations across three orthogonal axes: evaluation aspect (what is measured - linguistic, acoustic, aesthetic, etc.), model capabilities required (what the model can do - speech generation, real-time interaction, etc.), and task or protocol requirements (how the evaluation is conducted - fine-tuning, human judgment, etc.). The authors systematically map existing benchmarks and tasks to this framework through comprehensive literature review, creating reference tables that catalog how different evaluations align with the taxonomy. The approach is conceptual rather than empirical, providing a classification system rather than experimental results.

## Key Results
- The taxonomy successfully organizes 50+ existing benchmarks across three orthogonal dimensions
- Systematic gaps identified in current evaluation coverage, particularly for prosody, interaction, and reasoning aspects
- Framework enables capability-aware evaluation selection by filtering tasks based on model interfaces
- Mapping reveals mismatches between what models expose and what evaluations measure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Capability-Task Alignment Filtering
The taxonomy enforces dependency checks between model capabilities and task requirements. By mapping what interfaces a model exposes (e.g., speech generation) against what evaluations demand, it prevents invalid experimental designs where incompatible tasks are attempted on models lacking required capabilities.

### Mechanism 2: Orthogonal Diagnosis of Failure Modes
By separating evaluation aspects from protocols, the framework isolates whether performance limitations stem from model competence or evaluation methodology. This decomposition helps distinguish between failures in model reasoning versus failures in automatic metrics.

### Mechanism 3: Gap-Driven Benchmark Design
The taxonomy functions as a coordinate system where populated regions represent existing benchmarks and empty volumes reveal gaps. This visibility enables targeted development of new evaluations to address under-tested areas like prosody and real-time interaction.

## Foundational Learning

- **Speech Foundation Model Architectures**: Understanding encoder vs. decoder vs. encoder-decoder distinctions is crucial for applying Axis 2 capability filtering. Quick check: Can a wav2vec 2.0 model be evaluated on text-to-speech synthesis?

- **Probing vs. Fine-Tuning Protocols**: Axis 3 distinguishes intrinsic probing from adaptability assessment. Confusing these leads to invalid comparisons. Quick check: Does fine-tuned performance guarantee zero-shot reasoning capability?

- **Semantic vs. Acoustic Fidelity**: Axis 1 separates linguistic content from acoustic presentation. This distinction helps isolate failure modes. Quick check: If WER is perfect but speech sounds robotic, which aspect is failing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Model Architecture -> Axis 2 Filter -> Protocol Constraints -> Vetted Evaluation Suite
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Inventory Model: Define capabilities (streaming, text output, etc.)
  2. Select Aspects: Determine target properties (reasoning, speaker ID, etc.)
  3. Filter Tasks: Cross-reference aspects with model capabilities
  4. Apply Protocol Constraints: Remove tasks requiring unavailable resources

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Breadth vs. Depth: Broad suites provide comparability but may miss nuances
  - Automatic vs. Human: Automatic metrics scale but may miss aesthetic qualities

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Type Mismatch: Generative benchmark on representation model
  - Protocol Conflation: Comparing fine-tuned vs. zero-shot results
  - Metric Blindness: Using WER to evaluate emotional expressiveness

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Capability Validation: Verify model exposes "Sequence Probability Estimation" using sWUGGY/sBLIMP
  2. Gap Analysis: Map current evaluation suite against taxonomy to identify missing aspects
  3. Protocol Stress Test: Run task in both zero-shot and fine-tuned modes to measure adaptability gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Language Coverage Extension**: How to extend the taxonomy to account for language-specific coverage and linguistic portability of evaluation tasks? Current benchmarks are overwhelmingly English-centric, limiting global applicability.

2. **Metric Correlation Analysis**: Which evaluation metrics correlate, overlap, or diverge across different aspects and model types? No systematic mapping exists of metric relationships across the taxonomy axes.

3. **Prosodic Evaluation Metrics**: What standardized metrics can capture prosodic naturalness, pragmatic timing, and style variation for generative speech models? Existing benchmarks emphasize linguistic form over expressive dimensions.

4. **Capability-Indexed Benchmark Discovery**: Can benchmarks be automatically indexed by capability requirements to enable systematic discovery of suitable evaluations? No such indexing system currently exists.

## Limitations
- Taxonomy completeness depends on the thoroughness of benchmark survey; some specialized evaluations may be missed
- Framework assumes clear boundaries between model capabilities, but real-world models may exhibit emergent behaviors
- Does not address practical implementation challenges like computational costs or licensing restrictions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The orthogonality of three axes is well-established through systematic benchmark mapping
- **Medium Confidence**: Taxonomy's ability to reveal evaluation gaps is demonstrated but depends on survey completeness
- **Low Confidence**: Practical utility for guiding benchmark design requires empirical validation through community adoption

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Gap Validation**: Survey recent speech model papers to verify taxonomy accurately predicts under-tested evaluation aspects
2. **Capability Emergence Study**: Test whether adapter-based extensions can bridge capability gaps identified by the taxonomy
3. **Implementation Case Study**: Document real-world evaluation campaign using taxonomy to select benchmarks for a new speech model
