## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a value-aware personalized search model (VAPS) that addresses limitations in consultation-based search personalization by assessing the true value of user-AI consultation history. Unlike prior methods that rely solely on semantic similarity, VAPS evaluates consultation value using three dimensions: Scenario Scope Value (domain relevance), Time Decay Value (temporal freshness), and Posterior Action Value (user action validation). The model employs a consultation-action interaction module and an explicit alignment objective to selectively incorporate high-value consultations.

Experiments on commercial and Amazon datasets demonstrate VAPS significantly outperforms baselines in both retrieval and ranking scenarios, achieving substantial improvements in NDCG and MRR metrics. The approach effectively addresses the limitation of semantic-only methods by aligning consultation value with user actions, demonstrating robust performance across different search contexts.

## Method Summary
The value-aware personalized search model (VAPS) evaluates consultation value through three dimensions: Scenario Scope Value assesses domain relevance, Time Decay Value measures temporal freshness, and Posterior Action Value validates user action relevance. The model uses a consultation-action interaction module that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess value, and an explicit alignment objective to selectively incorporate high-value consultations. This framework moves beyond semantic similarity by incorporating behavioral signals and temporal factors to determine which consultation history should influence personalized search results.

## Key Results
- VAPS achieves up to 8.1% relative improvement in NDCG@20 for ranking tasks compared to baselines
- MRR@10 improves by 10.7% in ranking performance with VAPS implementation
- Model shows significant performance gains in both retrieval and ranking scenarios across commercial and Amazon datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works by recognizing that not all consultation history is equally valuable for personalization. Instead of treating all past interactions as equally important based on semantic similarity, VAPS evaluates each consultation's true relevance through three complementary dimensions. The Scenario Scope Value ensures consultations are domain-relevant, Time Decay Value prioritizes recent interactions, and Posterior Action Value validates whether user actions align with consultation content. This multi-dimensional assessment, combined with the consultation-action interaction module, allows the system to selectively incorporate only high-value consultations that genuinely inform user intent.

## Foundational Learning

**Consultation Value Assessment** - Why needed: Traditional semantic similarity fails to capture true consultation relevance. Quick check: Evaluate if consultations from different domains show appropriate value differentiation.

**Time Decay Mechanisms** - Why needed: User preferences evolve over time, making recent interactions more relevant. Quick check: Measure performance degradation when using older consultation history.

**Posterior Action Validation** - Why needed: User actions provide ground truth for consultation effectiveness. Quick check: Compare model performance when incorporating vs. ignoring user action signals.

**Explicit Alignment Objectives** - Why needed: Ensures model optimization directly targets value-aware personalization. Quick check: Test whether alignment objectives improve downstream ranking metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: User Queries -> Consultation History -> Value Assessment Module -> Consultation-Action Interaction -> Search Ranking Module -> Results

Critical Path: The most critical component is the consultation-action interaction module, which determines which high-value consultations influence search results. This module must accurately assess value across all three dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Design Tradeoffs: The model trades computational overhead for accuracy by using LLM-based value assessment. While this provides nuanced evaluation, it may impact scalability compared to simpler similarity-based approaches.

Failure Signatures: The model may fail when user actions don't reliably indicate consultation value, or when domain boundaries are ambiguous, leading to incorrect Scenario Scope Value assessments.

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study removing each value dimension to quantify individual contributions
2. Cross-domain testing to evaluate generalization beyond e-commerce
3. Scalability testing with varying consultation history sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Reliance on LLM-based value assessment may limit scalability and introduce computational overhead
- Assumption that posterior actions directly indicate consultation value may not hold across all user behaviors
- Commercial dataset used for evaluation is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility and independent validation

## Confidence

High confidence in retrieval and ranking performance improvements, as these are supported by experimental results on both commercial and Amazon datasets with established baselines.

Medium confidence in the generalizability of the value assessment framework across different search domains, as evaluation is primarily focused on e-commerce contexts.

Low confidence in the scalability of the consultation-action interaction module, as the paper does not provide extensive analysis of computational overhead or performance with large-scale consultation histories.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing each value dimension to quantify their individual contributions and validate the necessity of all three components.

2. Test the model's performance on non-commercial search domains (e.g., academic, news, or healthcare search) to evaluate domain generalization.

3. Implement and evaluate the model on open-source consultation datasets to enable reproducibility and community validation of the results.
