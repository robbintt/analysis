# Learn to Change the World: Multi-level Reinforcement Learning with Model-Changing Actions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15056
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15056
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: Multi-level RL framework where agents can modify environment transition dynamics, achieving up to 84% improvement over baseline approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel multi-level reinforcement learning framework where agents can actively modify the environment's transition dynamics through model-changing actions. The authors propose the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov decision process (MCTVMDP), which separates primitive actions from model-changing actions in a hierarchical structure. The framework allows upper-level MDPs to select transition kernels that configure lower-level MDPs, which then operate under those configurations.

The key contribution is demonstrating that agents can learn to improve their rewards by actively changing the environment's dynamics rather than simply adapting to fixed dynamics. The approach combines convex optimization methods for continuous configuration spaces with multi-level value iteration algorithms, providing theoretical performance guarantees. Numerical experiments on synthetic environments, Cartpole, and Block-world demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing significant improvements in returns compared to traditional RL methods.

## Method Summary
The framework formulates reinforcement learning with model-changing actions through a hierarchical structure. Upper-level MDPs select transition kernels that configure lower-level MDPs, which then operate under those configurations. For the continuous configuration special case, the authors linearize the objective function and solve a convex optimization problem. The bi-level value iteration algorithm iteratively optimizes primitive policies in the lower level and configuration policies in the upper level. The method includes both convex optimization for continuous configurations and value iteration for discrete configurations, with theoretical guarantees under certain assumptions about transition dynamics estimation.

## Key Results
- Optimal configuration can improve returns by up to 84% compared to baseline approaches
- The method performs close to oracle solutions while being adaptable to complex, continuous environments
- Strong performance demonstrated on synthetic environments, Cartpole benchmark, and Block-world environment
- Theoretical convergence guarantees provided for the bi-level value iteration algorithm

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hierarchical structure allows agents to learn not just how to act within an environment, but how to modify the environment itself to improve long-term rewards. By separating primitive actions from model-changing actions, the framework creates a powerful abstraction where agents can reason about both immediate task execution and long-term environment shaping. The convex optimization approach for continuous configurations enables efficient computation of optimal configuration policies, while the value iteration framework provides a scalable method for discrete configurations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Markov Decision Processes**: Foundation for modeling sequential decision-making problems with state transitions and rewards. Needed because the framework builds on MDP theory to create hierarchical structures. Quick check: Verify understanding of Bellman equations and value iteration.
- **Convex Optimization**: Used for solving the continuous configuration problem through linearization. Needed because it provides efficient methods for finding optimal configuration policies. Quick check: Understand how linearization transforms the objective into a solvable convex form.
- **Multi-level Optimization**: The hierarchical structure where upper-level decisions affect lower-level problem formulation. Needed because it enables environment modification as part of the decision process. Quick check: Verify understanding of bilevel optimization and value iteration in hierarchical settings.
- **Transition Kernel Estimation**: Empirical frequency-based estimation of transition matrices from trajectories. Needed because the theoretical guarantees assume known dynamics, but practical implementation requires estimation. Quick check: Understand the convergence bounds for empirical transition estimation.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Upper MDP -> Transition Kernel Configuration -> Lower MDP -> Primitive Actions -> Environment
**Critical Path**: Upper-level VI selects configuration → Configuration sets transition kernel → Lower-level VI computes optimal policy → Execute primitive actions → Observe rewards → Update both levels
**Design Tradeoffs**: Continuous vs discrete configuration spaces (convex optimization vs value iteration), known vs estimated dynamics (theoretical guarantees vs practical implementation), single vs multi-level iteration convergence speed.
**Failure Signatures**: 
- Convex optimization infeasibility (row-sum constraints violated)
- Upper-level VI divergence (λ not strictly less than 1)
- Poor performance from inaccurate transition estimation (|D| too small)
**First Experiments**:
1. Implement synthetic TVCMDP with provided P₁, P₂ matrices and test convex optimization under different budget constraints
2. Run bi-level value iteration on synthetic bi-level MDP with 6-state lower level to verify convergence
3. Cartpole experiment with 4 configured environments using specified parameters to reproduce 84% improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees assume known transition dynamics, but practical implementation requires estimation, creating a gap between theory and practice
- Scalability to high-dimensional continuous control problems remains unclear due to discrete or structured configuration space requirements
- The approach assumes differentiable transition kernels for continuous configuration, which may not hold for complex physical systems
- No empirical validation of the assumed H_L = H_U = 1000 iterations sufficiency for convergence across different problem instances

## Confidence
- **High**: Mathematical formulation of MCTVMDP and bi-level value iteration algorithm is well-specified and theoretically sound
- **Medium**: Empirical results on synthetic and Cartpole experiments are reproducible given specified parameters
- **Medium**: 84% improvement claim is supported but depends on specific baseline choice and environment configurations

## Next Checks
1. Implement sensitivity analysis for exponential cost parameters α and β across [0.1, 2.0] and [0.01, 0.5] to measure impact on convergence and performance
2. Evaluate algorithm performance with progressively smaller trajectory sets (|D| = 100, 500, 1000) to assess sample efficiency and estimation error effects
3. Test method on a more complex continuous control benchmark (e.g., LunarLanderContinuous-v2) to evaluate scalability beyond Cartpole domain
