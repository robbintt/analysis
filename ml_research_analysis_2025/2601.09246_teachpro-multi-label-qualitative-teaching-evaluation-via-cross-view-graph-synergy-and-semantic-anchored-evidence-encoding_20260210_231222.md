# TeachPro: Multi-Label Qualitative Teaching Evaluation via Cross-View Graph Synergy and Semantic Anchored Evidence Encoding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09246
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09246
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Novel multi-label qualitative teaching evaluation framework achieving 80.49% accuracy and 76.72% F1 score

## Executive Summary
TeachPro addresses the critical need for comprehensive teaching evaluation by moving beyond traditional single-dimensional sentiment analysis to provide multi-label, dimension-specific assessments of teaching performance. The framework tackles the challenge of extracting actionable pedagogical insights from unstructured student feedback by combining syntactic and semantic analysis through a cross-view graph synergy network. This approach enables educators and institutions to identify specific strengths and weaknesses across multiple teaching dimensions, providing more granular and actionable feedback than conventional evaluation methods.

The system demonstrates superior performance on a novel benchmark dataset constructed from real teaching feedback, achieving significant improvements over baseline sentiment analysis approaches. By aligning student comments with pedagogical dimensions through semantic anchoring and evidence encoding, TeachPro provides interpretable results that directly connect student feedback to specific aspects of teaching quality, enabling more targeted instructional improvement efforts.

## Method Summary
TeachPro introduces a novel multi-label qualitative teaching evaluation framework that combines a dimension-anchored evidence encoder with a cross-view graph synergy network. The approach processes student comments through multiple syntactic and semantic views, then integrates these perspectives using graph-based attention mechanisms to capture relationships between feedback and pedagogical dimensions. The framework employs a semantic anchoring mechanism to align student comments with specific teaching dimensions, while the evidence encoder extracts rationale spans that justify the dimensional assessments. This multi-faceted approach enables fine-grained evaluation across multiple teaching quality dimensions simultaneously, addressing the limitations of traditional binary or single-label sentiment analysis approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves 80.49% accuracy and 76.72% F1 score on benchmark dataset
- Outperforms existing sentiment analysis approaches for multi-label teaching evaluation
- Demonstrates strong calibration quality and interpretable evidence alignment with human-annotated rationale spans
- Successfully identifies specific teaching dimension strengths and weaknesses from unstructured feedback

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TeachPro's effectiveness stems from its ability to capture both syntactic patterns and semantic relationships in student feedback through multiple processing views. The cross-view graph synergy network enables the model to integrate complementary information from different perspectives, while the semantic anchoring mechanism ensures that assessments are grounded in specific pedagogical dimensions. By simultaneously considering multiple teaching dimensions and providing evidence-based justifications, the framework generates more nuanced and actionable evaluations than traditional approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Pedagogical Dimensions**: Categories of teaching quality (e.g., clarity, engagement, organization)
  - Why needed: Provides structured framework for evaluating teaching quality
  - Quick check: Are dimensions comprehensive and mutually exclusive?
- **Semantic Anchoring**: Process of connecting textual evidence to specific dimensions
  - Why needed: Ensures evaluations are grounded in specific aspects of teaching
  - Quick check: Is anchoring consistent across similar comments?
- **Cross-View Graph Synergy**: Integration of multiple processing perspectives through graph networks
  - Why needed: Captures relationships that single-view approaches miss
  - Quick check: Do different views provide complementary information?
- **Evidence Encoding**: Extraction and representation of rationale spans justifying evaluations
  - Why needed: Provides interpretability and actionable feedback
  - Quick check: Are evidence spans relevant and comprehensive?
- **Multi-Label Classification**: Assigning multiple labels to single input instances
  - Why needed: Teaching quality involves multiple simultaneous dimensions
  - Quick check: Can model handle overlapping or conflicting dimensions?
- **Graph Attention Mechanisms**: Weighted integration of node relationships in graph networks
  - Why needed: Identifies important relationships between feedback and dimensions
  - Quick check: Are attention weights interpretable and consistent?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Student Comments -> Dimension-anchored Encoder -> Cross-view Graph Synergy Network -> Multi-label Output + Evidence Spans
- **Critical Path**: Input preprocessing → Dimension anchoring → Graph construction → Attention-based fusion → Classification output
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balances model complexity with interpretability; prioritizes dimension-specific accuracy over overall sentiment classification
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on ambiguous feedback; reduced accuracy with limited training data; computational overhead with large-scale processing
- **First Experiments**: 1) Single-dimension vs. multi-dimension evaluation comparison, 2) Syntactic-only vs. semantic-only processing ablation study, 3) Graph attention weight interpretability analysis
