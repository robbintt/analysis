# Zero-Shot Performance Prediction for Probabilistic Scaling Laws

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16743
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16743
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Zero-shot learning curve prediction for NLP models using hierarchical multitask GP with latent variables, achieving scaling law accuracy close to ground truth at reduced computational cost.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting learning curves for NLP models when data for certain model configurations is missing. The authors propose a hierarchical multitask Gaussian Process framework that leverages correlations across tasks through latent variables, enabling zero-shot prediction of unseen learning curves. The method combines this with active learning to efficiently query the most informative model configurations, ultimately producing probabilistic scaling laws with significantly reduced computational requirements compared to traditional approaches.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a latent variable multi-output Gaussian Process (MaGP) to model learning curves organized in a two-layer hierarchy (e.g., model architecture dimensions). The framework introduces shared mean functions for the upper hierarchy and task-specific latent variables for the lower hierarchy, capturing correlations between different model configurations. Predictions are made by integrating over the latent variables, and scaling laws are estimated through Monte Carlo simulation of the predicted curves. The method employs active learning to query curves with highest predictive variance, optimizing the trade-off between information gain and computational cost.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot prediction outperforms competitive baselines (DHGP, BNN) on three NLP datasets with up to 30 learning curves
- Scaling law predictions are close to ground truth with significantly reduced computational cost
- Active learning strategy reduces scaling law uncertainty more efficiently than random or size-based querying

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** If NLP learning curve data is organized into a bi-level hierarchy (e.g., model architecture dimensions or language families), a model can share statistical strength across tasks to predict unseen curves (zero-shot) with limited data.
- **Mechanism:** The approach uses a latent variable multi-output Gaussian Process (MaGP) with shared mean function for upper hierarchy and task-specific latent variables for lower hierarchy, forcing the model to learn commonalities before differentiating specific curves.
- **Core assumption:** The dataset possesses an exchangeable bi-level hierarchical structure.
- **Evidence anchors:** Experiments with "exchanged hierarchies" show robust performance; hierarchical structures are often present in compositional data.
- **Break condition:** Fails when interpolating between unseen architectural parameters (e.g., predicting 768-embedding curve when only 512 and 1024 exist).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Modeling correlations between tasks via latent variables enables zero-shot prediction by inferring the relationship between seen and unseen configurations.
- **Mechanism:** The model introduces latent variable h_t ~ N(0, I) for each task, and the predictive distribution integrates over these variables, smoothing predictions based on correlation distance.
- **Core assumption:** Tasks are correlated (e.g., larger models generally have lower loss).
- **Evidence anchors:** "To model correlations between tasks, a latent variable h_t is introduced..."; correlations among tasks facilitate zero-shot prediction.
- **Break condition:** Fails with very small datasets (< 5 curves) or excessive noise.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** An active learning strategy that queries the learning curve with the highest predictive variance reduces the error of the final scaling law more efficiently than querying by model size.
- **Mechanism:** The model calculates mean variance of unobserved curves and iteratively trains on the most uncertain curve to maximize information gain per training run.
- **Core assumption:** Predictive variance is a reliable proxy for the value of information regarding scaling law parameters.
- **Evidence anchors:** Active Learning consistently results in more certain AbC values compared to Random Order or Largest First; maintains lower error and variance across queries.
- **Break condition:** If the cost of training the "most uncertain" model is prohibitively high compared to the budget.

## Foundational Learning

**Gaussian Processes (GPs)**
- **Why needed here:** The core engine (MaGP) is a GP. You must understand kernel functions and how they define smoothness and covariance between data points.
- **Quick check question:** Can you explain how a GP defines a distribution over functions rather than just point estimates?

**Multi-Task Learning (MTL)**
- **Why needed here:** The paper frames scaling law prediction as an MTL problem where different model sizes or language pairs are different "tasks."
- **Quick check question:** How does sharing representations between tasks help when data for a specific task (a specific model size) is missing?

**Scaling Laws (Power Laws)**
- **Why needed here:** The target output is a functional form l(c) = (c/c_0)^(-γ). Understanding the log-log linear relationship is required to interpret the results.
- **Quick check question:** In the context of this paper, what does the "compute-efficient frontier" represent in a log-log plot?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Logarithmic step size/z-score normalized performance -> Hierarchical GP (MaGP) with shared mean function g(x) + Latent variables h_t -> Posterior predictive distribution q(l_*) for missing curves -> Monte Carlo sampling of predicted curves to fit scaling law parameters

**Critical path:** Defining the Hierarchy. The system relies on the user correctly mapping data to the two levels (e.g., Level 1: Embedding Size, Level 2: Layers).

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Inducing Points vs. Speed:** Fewer points increase speed but may lose fine-grained curve details.
- **AbC vs. Cost:** Active Learning minimizes error but may select computationally expensive models.

**Failure signatures:**
- High MNLPD indicates uncertainty or excessive noise
- Exploding BNN Loss with limited data (< 100 points) causes severe overfitting

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Hierarchy Validation:** Run the model on nanoGPT and swap hierarchy levels to confirm exchangeability and performance stability.
2. **Ablation on Sample Size:** Train with full curves vs. subsampled curves (11 points) to verify robustness to limited observation windows.
3. **Query Strategy Comparison:** Compare "Random" vs. "Active Learning" queries to visualize reduction in scaling law uncertainty over time.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the latent variable multi-output GP framework be adapted to effectively interpolate across architectural grids for unseen hyperparameter configurations?
- How can active learning query strategies be optimized to balance the reduction of predictive uncertainty against the computational cost of acquiring training data?
- Does the bi-level hierarchical structure and the performance advantage of MaGP persist when applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) with significantly larger parameter counts and compute budgets?

## Limitations
- Cannot interpolate to unseen values of embedding parameters; requires exact grid configurations from training data
- Computational efficiency claims rely on limited compute range that may not generalize to extreme-scale training
- Latent variable correlation mechanism becomes unstable with very small datasets or excessive noise

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** The hierarchical GP architecture and its ability to model task correlations through latent variables is well-established.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim that this approach generalizes across diverse NLP datasets is supported but limited, with higher error rates in bilingual experiments.

**Low Confidence:** The computational cost reduction claims are difficult to verify without access to full experimental infrastructure.

## Next Checks
1. **Hierarchy Interpolation Test:** Attempt to predict learning curves for architectural parameters between training set extremes to test interpolation capabilities.
2. **Noise Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically add Gaussian noise to bilingual dataset at increasing levels to establish noise tolerance threshold.
3. **Compute Range Extrapolation:** Validate scaling law predictions beyond stated range (10^23 FLOPs) by training extremely large models and comparing predicted vs actual performance.
