# Scaling Law Phenomena Across Regression Paradigms: Multiple and Kernel Approaches

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.01314
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01314
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Extends scaling law phenomena from linear regression to multiple and kernel regression settings

## Executive Summary
This paper extends scaling law phenomena from linear regression to multiple and kernel regression settings. While previous work established scaling laws for simple linear models, this work demonstrates that similar predictable scaling behaviors persist in more expressive regression paradigms. The authors prove generalization error bounds for sketched multiple and kernel regression, establishing that under assumptions of Gaussianity, well-specified models, and power law eigenvalue decay, the error exhibits predictable power-law relationships with sketch dimension and sample size.

## Method Summary
The authors extend scaling law analysis to multiple and kernel regression by proving generalization error bounds for sketched regression in these settings. They decompose the total error into irreducible, approximation, and excess components, and derive explicit scaling relationships under specific assumptions. The theoretical framework builds upon previous work on linear regression scaling laws but incorporates the additional complexity of multiple regression and kernel methods.

## Key Results
- Proves generalization error bounds for sketched multiple and kernel regression
- Establishes power-law scaling relationships between error and sketch dimension/sample size
- Shows approximation error scales as Θ(1/M^{a-1}) where M is sketch dimension and a relates to eigenvalue decay
- Demonstrates that scaling law phenomena persist beyond simple linear regression

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The theoretical framework leverages decomposition of generalization error into irreducible, approximation, and excess components. Under Gaussianity assumptions and power-law eigenvalue decay, the approximation error exhibits predictable power-law behavior with respect to sketch dimension. The excess error components involve terms dependent on effective sample size and learning rate, enabling explicit scaling relationships to be derived.

## Foundational Learning

**Gaussianity Assumption**: Data distributions assumed to be Gaussian for mathematical tractability. *Why needed*: Enables closed-form expressions for error bounds. *Quick check*: Verify normality tests on real data before applying bounds.

**Power-law Eigenvalue Decay**: Covariance matrix eigenvalues decay according to power law. *Why needed*: Critical for deriving power-law scaling relationships. *Quick check*: Plot eigenvalue spectrum to verify decay pattern.

**Well-specified Models**: Assumes the true data generating process matches the model class. *Why needed*: Simplifies error decomposition and analysis. *Quick check*: Compare training error vs irreducible error to detect misspecification.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data generation -> Feature mapping -> Kernel computation -> Sketching -> Optimization -> Error decomposition

**Critical Path**: The core theoretical path follows: Assumptions → Error Decomposition → Bound Derivation → Scaling Law Formulation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The paper trades mathematical tractability (Gaussian assumptions) for broader applicability, focusing on theoretically clean results rather than empirical robustness.

**Failure Signatures**: When assumptions are violated (non-Gaussian data, misspecified models, different eigenvalue decay), the derived scaling laws may not accurately predict actual error behavior.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify eigenvalue decay patterns in real datasets
2. Test error decomposition on synthetic data matching assumptions
3. Compare theoretical bounds with empirical error measurements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Strong Gaussianity assumption may not hold in real-world regression scenarios
- Well-specified model assumption eliminates analysis of misspecification effects
- Theoretical bounds rely heavily on specific assumptions without extensive empirical validation

## Confidence
High confidence in theoretical bounds for specific settings analyzed
Medium confidence for broader applicability beyond stated assumptions

## Next Checks
1. Validate the theoretical bounds on real-world datasets with varying correlation structures and noise levels to assess robustness beyond Gaussian assumptions
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of each assumption (Gaussianity, well-specification, power-law decay) on the accuracy of the scaling law predictions
3. Compare the derived scaling laws with empirical observations from large-scale regression tasks, particularly those involving kernel methods, to evaluate practical utility
