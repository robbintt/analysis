# GPT Editors, Not Authors: The Stylistic Footprint of LLMs in Academic Preprints

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17327
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17327
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: LLM use in academic preprints is uniform across documents, suggesting authors use LLMs for editing rather than partial content generation.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) are used for complete text generation or editing/translation in academic preprints. The authors train a Bayesian classifier to detect LLM-generated text and apply Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) changepoint detection to measure stylistic segmentation. Using arXiv papers from 2021 and 2023-2025, they find no correlation between LLM-attributed language and stylistic segmentation after controlling for text length. This suggests LLM use is uniform across documents, indicating authors primarily use LLMs for editing rather than partial content generation. The classifier achieved 66% accuracy in distinguishing human from GPT-regenerated text, with segmentation analysis showing higher PELT thresholds for human texts with LLM additions compared to fully LLM-generated or original human texts.

## Method Summary
The authors trained a Bayesian log-odds classifier on word frequency differences between human academic writing and GPT-regenerated text. They applied this classifier to arXiv preprints from 2021 (baseline) and 2023-2025 (analysis). PELT changepoint detection measured stylistic segmentation by identifying boundaries in the cumulative log-odds sequence. The threshold multiplier required to eliminate changepoints quantified stylistic homogeneity. After Z-score normalization within length bins, they tested whether classifier scores correlated with PELT thresholds to determine if LLM use created internal stylistic boundaries.

## Key Results
- The classifier achieved 66% accuracy in distinguishing human from GPT-regenerated text
- PELT thresholds were significantly higher for segmented texts (human + LLM addition) than original or fully-regenerated texts (p < 0.01)
- After length normalization, no correlation existed between classifier scores and PELT thresholds (r = -0.0233, p > 0.2), indicating uniform LLM application
- Length correlated with both classifier scores (r ≈ -0.72) and PELT thresholds (r ≈ 0.88), requiring normalization for valid analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bayesian log-odds classifiers can detect aggregate LLM word distribution patterns even with modest per-word signal.
- Mechanism: Word frequency ratios between human and LLM-generated corpora are computed, smoothed, and converted to log-odds scores. Each document receives a cumulative score reflecting how many LLM-associated words appear relative to human-associated ones. The classifier achieved 66% accuracy on held-out validation data.
- Core assumption: LLMs have detectable stylistic preferences (e.g., "delve," "efficiency," "realm") that differ from human academic writing patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "a Bayesian classifier trained on GPT-regenerated text"
  - [section]: Tables 3-4 show LLM-associated words with log odds > 5.6 (e.g., "confidence" at 6.71) versus human-associated words (e.g., "because" at -6.79)
  - [corpus]: Neighbor paper "A Stylometric Application of Large Language Models" demonstrates LLMs can distinguish authorship styles, supporting stylistic detectability.
- Break condition: If adversarial paraphrasing or diverse LLMs dilute word-frequency signatures, classifier signal degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PELT changepoint detection quantifies stylistic homogeneity by measuring how much noise is required to eliminate detected boundaries.
- Mechanism: PELT identifies changepoints in the cumulative log-odds sequence. The threshold multiplier is iteratively raised until no changepoints remain; higher thresholds indicate tightly-clustered stylistic segments requiring more noise to mask. Length and variance are normalized.
- Core assumption: Partial LLM generation creates abrupt stylistic transitions detectable as changepoints.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3]: "the threshold multiplier captures the degree to which the LLM-associated words within a paper are clumped together"
  - [section]: Table 2 shows segmented texts (human + LLM addition) have significantly higher PELT thresholds than original or fully-regenerated texts (p < 0.01)
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence for PELT-specific methodology; this appears novel to this paper.
- Break condition: If editing uniformly transforms text without creating stylistic discontinuities, PELT cannot distinguish editing from generation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The absence of correlation between classifier scores and PELT thresholds (after length normalization) indicates uniform LLM application across documents.
- Mechanism: Both classifier scores and PELT thresholds correlate with document length. After Z-score normalization within length bins, the correlation between them disappears (r = -0.0233, p > 0.2). This suggests LLM use does not create internal stylistic boundaries.
- Core assumption: Uniform application means either whole-document editing or whole-document generation; the method cannot distinguish these two cases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LLM-attributed language is not predictive of stylistic segmentation, suggesting that when authors use LLMs, they do so uniformly"
  - [section]: Table 5 shows original correlation of -0.6409 drops to -0.0233 after normalization
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus validation of this inference; this is the paper's central novel claim.
- Break condition: If partial generation happens at sentence-level granularity rather than section-level, PELT may lack resolution to detect it.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Naive Bayes classification
  - Why needed here: Understanding how word-level probabilities aggregate into document-level scores.
  - Quick check question: Why does smoothing (adding 10⁻⁴) prevent log(0) errors?

- Concept: Changepoint detection
  - Why needed here: PELT segments time-series-like data; here, the "time" is document position.
  - Quick check question: What does a higher penalty threshold imply about the underlying signal?

- Concept: Confounding variable control
  - Why needed here: Document length spuriously correlated both variables; normalization was essential.
  - Quick check question: What would happen if length weren't controlled?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion (arXiv API) -> Section extraction (regex for headers) -> Text cleaning -> GPT regeneration (for training) -> Bayesian classifier training -> Per-document log-odds computation -> PELT changepoint analysis -> Threshold multiplier search -> Correlation analysis with length normalization

- Critical path:
  1. Curate 2021 pre-LLM data (n=205 after filtering) for clean human baseline
  2. Regenerate with GPT-3.5 to create paired LLM-human training data
  3. Train classifier and validate accuracy (66%)
  4. Validate PELT on synthetic segmented data (human + LLM addition)
  5. Apply to 2023-2025 corpus (n=2408) and correlate classifier scores with PELT thresholds

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Restricted to Abstract/Introduction/Conclusion (excludes Methods/Results where partial generation may differ)
  - Single LLM (GPT-3.5) for training; may not generalize to Claude, LLaMA, etc.
  - Population-level inference; cannot certify individual papers

- Failure signatures:
  - Low classifier accuracy (<55%) would indicate word-frequency signal is too weak
  - PELT thresholds not differentiating segmented from uniform texts in validation
  - Persistent correlation after normalization would indicate uncontrolled confounders

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate classifier on a held-out subset with a different LLM (e.g., Claude) to test generalization.
  2. Apply PELT with varying window sizes to test whether finer-grained partial generation is detectable.
  3. Stratify analysis by discipline to check whether uniform-use patterns hold across fields with different LLM adoption rates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can automated methods successfully distinguish between LLM-assisted editing (Case 2) and complete LLM generation (Case 4)?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state on page 3 that "determining whether the role of the LLM in the writing process was editing or complete generation is an open problem," noting that current work struggles to distinguish these two cases.
  - Why unresolved: The study's methodology identifies uniform usage but cannot differentiate between a fully human text edited by an LLM and a text entirely fabricated by an LLM, as both result in a uniform stylistic footprint.
  - What evidence would resolve it: The development of classifiers that can detect the residual "human noise" or specific structural artifacts present in edited text but absent in fully generated text.

- **How do researchers qualitatively integrate LLMs into their writing workflows?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] In the Limitations section (page 7), the authors assert that "the picture won't be complete without a more thorough qualitative study to explain when and how researchers use LLMs."
  - Why unresolved: Quantitative stylometric analysis can detect the presence of LLMs but cannot capture the author's intent, the specific prompts used, or whether the tool was used for ideation versus polishing.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Survey data or interview-based studies that correlate specific writing behaviors with the stylistic metrics observed in the text analysis.

- **Are the stylistic markers of LLM usage consistent across different models and robust against adversarial paraphrasing?**
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes in Limitations (page 7) that the word distributions of GPT 3.5 Turbo may not represent all LLMs and that "adversarial techniques to overcome detection" complicate the field.
  - Why unresolved: The Bayesian classifier relies on specific word odds (e.g., "efficacy," "realm") which likely differ across models (e.g., Claude, Llama) and can be obscured by prompts designed to evade detection.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A cross-model validation study testing the classifier and PELT segmentation on texts generated by a diverse set of contemporary LLMs and paraphrasing tools.

## Limitations

- The classifier was trained exclusively on GPT-3.5 outputs, which may not generalize to other LLMs that academic authors actually use.
- The study focuses on Abstract/Introduction/Conclusion sections, potentially missing partial generation in Methods or Results sections where it might be more prevalent.
- The inference about uniform LLM use relies on multiple assumptions about what stylistic segmentation would look like and cannot distinguish between whole-document editing and whole-document generation.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The classifier achieves 66% accuracy in distinguishing human from GPT-regenerated text, and the PELT methodology correctly identifies higher thresholds for segmented validation data (p < 0.01).
- **Medium confidence**: The length-normalized correlation analysis is methodologically rigorous, but the inference about uniform LLM use relies on multiple assumptions about what stylistic segmentation would look like.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability to other LLMs and academic disciplines, given the single-model training and lack of field-specific analysis.

## Next Checks

1. Test classifier generalization by retraining on a held-out subset using a different LLM (e.g., Claude or LLaMA) and measuring accuracy on the same validation set.
2. Apply PELT with varying window sizes to determine whether finer-grained partial generation (sentence-level) is detectable that the current analysis might miss.
3. Stratify the 2023-2025 corpus by academic discipline to check whether uniform-use patterns hold across fields with potentially different LLM adoption rates and writing conventions.
