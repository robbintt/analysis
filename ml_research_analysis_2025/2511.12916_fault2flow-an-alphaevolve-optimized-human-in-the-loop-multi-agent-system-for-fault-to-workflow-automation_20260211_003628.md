# Fault2Flow: An AlphaEvolve-Optimized Human-in-the-Loop Multi-Agent System for Fault-to-Workflow Automation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12916
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12916
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Achieves 100% topological consistency (TC=1.0) and high semantic fidelity in transforming transformer fault diagnosis regulations into executable n8n workflows

## Executive Summary
Fault2Flow is a multi-agent system that automates the transformation of regulatory fault diagnosis documents into executable workflows. The system employs a staged pipeline approach that first extracts logic from regulations, converts it into fault trees, and then uses AlphaEvolve optimization before generating n8n workflows. Human-in-the-loop verification ensures accuracy throughout the process. Experiments on transformer fault diagnosis demonstrate perfect topological consistency and high semantic fidelity while significantly reducing expert workload compared to manual methods.

## Method Summary
Fault2Flow transforms regulatory fault diagnosis PDFs into executable n8n workflows through a staged multi-agent pipeline. The process begins with MinerU extracting structured Markdown from PDFs, followed by a Mind Map Agent generating PlantUML representations of diagnostic logic. A Fault Tree Agent converts these into PASTA-formatted fault trees, which AlphaEvolve then optimizes for structural coherence. The Workflow Construction Agent traverses the optimized PASTA structure to generate n8n configurations, and a Workflow Verification Agent synthesizes test cases to validate correctness through iterative refinement. The system stores structured data in MySQL and embeddings in Milvus, with a Vue3 frontend for human oversight.

## Key Results
- Achieves 100% topological consistency (TC=1.0) when mapping PASTA fault trees to n8n workflows
- Maintains high semantic fidelity (E2ERC=1.0) with all diagnostic paths reachable
- Outperforms end-to-end approaches with TC=1.0 vs. <0.94 and E2ERC=1.0 vs. <0.72
- Substantially reduces expert workload through automated intermediate representation verification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Staged transformation through intermediate representations preserves logical structure better than end-to-end approaches.
- Mechanism: The pipeline decomposes the complex text-to-workflow task into three distinct stages: (1) Markdown parsing via MinerU, (2) Mind Map + PASTA fault tree generation, (3) n8n workflow synthesis. Each stage produces a verifiable intermediate artifact that experts can inspect and correct before proceeding.
- Core assumption: Errors compound less severely when caught and corrected at each stage compared to single-pass generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "extracts and structures regulatory logic into PASTA-formatted fault trees" before workflow synthesis
  - [section 4, Table 1] Fault2Flow models achieve TC=1.0 and E2ERC=1.0 vs. end-to-end baselines showing TC<0.94 and E2ERC<0.72
  - [corpus] Related work on staged diagnosis exists (e.g., "United We Stand" on multi-task fault diagnosis), but no direct comparison to staged vs. end-to-end workflow generation found
- Break condition: If intermediate representations (mind maps, fault trees) contain semantic errors that experts fail to catch, downstream workflow synthesis will inherit and potentially amplify these errors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: AlphaEvolve optimization improves structural coherence of generated fault trees and mind maps through iterative evolutionary refinement.
- Mechanism: AlphaEvolve employs a multi-island evolutionary strategy where subpopulations evolve independently with periodic elite exchange. Each iteration samples a parent program and "inspiration" programs from an elite archive, composes them into a joint prompt, and uses the LLM to generate improved candidates evaluated on readability and logical validity.
- Core assumption: The fitness function (readability + logical validity) correlates with downstream workflow correctness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "AlphaEvolve employs a multi-island evolutionary strategy where multiple subpopulations evolve independently while periodically exchanging elite individuals"
  - [section 3, Figure 2] Shows before/after mind map optimization, though detailed metrics on improvement magnitude not provided
  - [corpus] ATHENA paper (arXiv:2512.03476) describes similar evolutionary optimization for numerical algorithms, but corpus lacks direct validation for workflow/ fault tree domains
- Break condition: If the fitness function poorly approximates true workflow quality, optimization may converge on locally-optimal but practically-incorrect structures.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Automated test synthesis and verification provides feedback-driven correction for workflow generation.
- Mechanism: The Workflow Verification Agent prompts an LLM to synthesize test samples with expected fault-trigger outcomes, executes these against the generated n8n workflow, and feeds failure traces back for iterative refinement until validation succeeds or iteration limits are reached.
- Core assumption: LLM-synthesized test cases provide sufficient coverage of edge cases in the original fault logic.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "The system prompts the LLM to synthesize test samples and expected results... If outputs match expectations, verification succeeds. Otherwise, the failure traces are fed back to the model to guide refinement"
  - [section 3] "This verification loop confirmed that all diagnostic paths were reachable and that the workflow's behavior was semantically identical to the logic in the original PASTA model"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation of LLM-based test synthesis for fault diagnosis workflows
- Break condition: If synthesized tests miss critical edge cases or contain incorrect expected values, verification may pass flawed workflows.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and PASTA DSL**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses PASTA-formatted fault trees as the canonical intermediate representation for fault logic. Understanding how FTA models causal relationships (gates, leaf nodes, thresholds) is prerequisite to evaluating the extraction and optimization quality.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a PASTA fault tree represents the conditional logic "IF C2H2/C2H4 < 0.1 AND CH4/H2 > 1.0 THEN low-temperature-overheating"?

- Concept: **Evolutionary Optimization (Multi-Island Strategy)**
  - Why needed here: AlphaEvolve is positioned as a core innovation for improving logical structure. Understanding island-based population dynamics, elite migration, and fitness-based selection is necessary to diagnose optimization failures or tune parameters.
  - Quick check question: What happens to convergence if the migration interval between islands is too frequent vs. too rare?

- Concept: **n8n Workflow Automation Platform**
  - Why needed here: The final output format is n8n-executable workflows. Understanding n8n's node types, trigger specifications, and API structure is required to validate whether the Workflow Construction Agent produces deployable artifacts.
  - Quick check question: How would you manually verify that an n8n workflow's IF/ELSE branching correctly mirrors a PASTA fault tree's logic gates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PDF Extraction (MinerU) -> Mind Map Agent -> Fault Tree Agent -> AlphaEvolve Optimizer -> Workflow Construction Agent -> Workflow Verification Agent
- Critical path: The verification loop (Workflow Verification Agent -> test synthesis -> execution -> feedback -> regeneration) is the critical reliability mechanism. If this loop is bypassed or broken, workflow correctness cannot be assured.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Staged vs. End-to-End**: Staged approach achieves higher TC/E2ERC (1.0 vs. <0.94/<0.72) but requires more integration points and expert checkpoints.
  - **Human-in-the-Loop vs. Full Automation**: Expert verification improves accuracy but scales linearly with expert availability. The paper claims "substantially reduced" workload but does not quantify time savings.
  - **AlphaEvolve Optimization vs. Single-Pass**: Adds computational overhead (evolutionary iterations) for improved structure; paper does not report optimization time.
- Failure signatures:
  - **Low TC (<1.0)**: Indicates PASTA-to-n8n translation lost nodes or edges; check Workflow Construction Agent traversal logic.
  - **Low E2ERC (<1.0)**: Indicates unreachable diagnostic paths; check IF/ELSE branch conditions in generated workflow.
  - **Verification loop exhaustion**: Test synthesis may be generating incorrect expected values, or workflow logic is fundamentally flawed; inspect failure traces.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the three-ratio method case study (Section 3) with a different LLM (e.g., GPT-4.1 instead of Qwen3-80B) and compare TC, E2ERC, and LRM scores to validate reproducibility claims.
  2. Ablate AlphaEvolve by running the Mind Map -> Fault Tree pipeline without optimization; measure structural degradation in generated PASTA code and downstream workflow quality.
  3. Test robustness by introducing deliberate errors into expert-verified mind maps; measure whether Verification Agent catches semantic drift before workflow activation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does Fault2Flow performance generalize to power grid fault domains beyond transformer diagnosis (e.g., switchgear, transmission lines, renewable integration points)?
- How can real-time operational feedback be integrated for adaptive workflow refinement without disrupting live grid operations?
- How does system performance scale with dataset size and regulatory document complexity?

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on expert-designed fault trees as ground truth, preventing assessment of generalization to novel regulatory content
- No quantification of computational overhead from AlphaEvolve optimization or expert time savings
- Workflow Verification Agent's reliance on LLM-synthesized test cases introduces potential coverage gaps without independent validation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The staged pipeline architecture is sound and the reported topological consistency (TC=1.0) and semantic fidelity (E2ERC=1.0) are internally consistent with the described verification methodology.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of AlphaEvolve optimization is supported by qualitative before/after mind map comparisons but lacks quantitative metrics on improvement magnitude or runtime overhead.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about "substantially reduced" expert workload are not substantiated with time measurements or comparative workload analysis.

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization Testing**: Apply Fault2Flow to a new transformer fault diagnosis standard with no overlap in expert-designed trees to assess cross-document accuracy retention.
2. **Test Case Coverage Analysis**: Manually inspect a subset of LLM-synthesized test cases to measure edge case coverage and identify systematic gaps in fault logic detection.
3. **Ablation Study on AlphaEvolve**: Run the full pipeline with and without AlphaEvolve optimization across multiple fault diagnosis cases, measuring changes in LRM scores, workflow correctness rates, and generation time.
