# Exploring the Influence of Relevant Knowledge for Natural Language Generation Interpretability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24179
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24179

- Key result: Removing relevant external knowledge drops NLG performance from 91% to 6% on commonsense plausibility and concept coverage

## Executive Summary
This study examines how external knowledge impacts the performance of natural language generation (NLG) models in a commonsense reasoning task. The authors extend the CommonGen dataset by integrating ConceptNet relations and creating a benchmark that includes automatically generated and manually annotated outputs. They evaluate the T5-Large model's sentence generation under two conditions: using full external knowledge versus using filtered knowledge with highly relevant relations removed. Through a three-stage interpretability method—removing key knowledge, regenerating sentences, and manually assessing plausibility and concept coverage—the study finds that sentences generated with full knowledge achieve 91% correctness on both criteria, while filtered knowledge reduces performance drastically to 6%. These results highlight the critical role of relevant external knowledge in maintaining coherence and concept coverage in NLG, and underscore the need for evaluation frameworks that capture underlying reasoning beyond surface-level metrics.

## Method Summary
The study extends CommonGen by integrating ConceptNet relations to create a benchmark with both automatically generated and manually annotated outputs. T5-Large is used to generate sentences under two conditions: with full external knowledge or with filtered knowledge where highly relevant relations are removed. A three-stage interpretability method is employed: (1) manually identifying and removing key relations, (2) regenerating sentences with filtered knowledge, and (3) manually assessing plausibility and concept coverage. The evaluation focuses on 121 concept-sentence pairs where external knowledge showed improvement, with total relations reduced from 1635 to 976 after filtering.

## Key Results
- Full knowledge generation achieved 91% correctness across both commonsense plausibility and concept coverage criteria
- Filtering out highly relevant relations reduced performance to just 6% correctness
- Only 8 out of 42 meaningful sentences using full knowledge covered all concepts from the concept set
- The drastic performance drop demonstrates that relevant external knowledge is causally essential for coherent commonsense generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Relevant external knowledge causally enables coherent commonsense generation; its absence degrades both plausibility and concept coverage.
- Mechanism: Knowledge relations from ConceptNet provide semantic scaffolding that guides the model to connect input concepts meaningfully. When high-relevance relations are removed, the model loses bridging inferences, forcing it to either omit concepts or generate incoherent sentences.
- Core assumption: The manual filtering process correctly identifies "highly relevant" relations; T5-Large's behavior generalizes to other encoder-decoder LLMs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91% correctness across both criteria, while filtering reduced performance drastically to 6%"
  - "only 8 out of 42 meaningful sentences used all the words from the concept set... a considerably low result compared to the 91%"
- Break condition: If knowledge retrieval provides irrelevant or misleading relations, performance degrades even with "full" knowledge—the mechanism depends on knowledge quality, not just quantity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Misleading knowledge causes concept omission as a fallback strategy.
- Mechanism: When external knowledge conflicts with intended word sense (polysemy mismatch), the model often excludes the problematic word entirely rather than integrate it incorrectly. This is an emergent error-avoidance behavior.
- Core assumption: The observed omissions reflect model uncertainty resolution rather than random generation failures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "the external knowledge associated with certain words is misleading... the system often omits the problematic word... and chooses to exclude it instead"
  - Example: "watch" relations refer only to the object, so model generates "A man is looking at a window" omitting "watch"
- Break condition: If the model has strong prior associations for a word sense, it may override misleading external knowledge; mechanism is weaker for high-frequency concepts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Weak indirect knowledge connections can still enable coherent generation through compositional inference.
- Mechanism: Even without explicit relations linking concepts, background knowledge allows the model to compose coherent outputs through implicit reasoning chains.
- Core assumption: T5-Large's pre-training includes sufficient world knowledge to make these compositional leaps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - "the given knowledge establishes a slight connection among words... indirectly helps the model generate a coherent and accurate sentence"
  - Example: concepts ["boat", "sail", "day"] produce "Boats sail on a sunny day" despite no explicit inter-concept relations
- Break condition: When concepts share no semantic neighborhood even indirectly, compositional inference fails; the mechanism requires at least peripheral conceptual overlap.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Relations (ConceptNet structure)
  - Why needed here: The entire methodology depends on retrieving, filtering, and interpreting semantic relations like "RelatedTo," "AtLocation," "IsA." Without understanding KG triple structure, you cannot reason about what "removing relevant relations" means.
  - Quick check question: Given concepts ["dog", "leash"], what ConceptNet relation types would help connect them for sentence generation?

- Concept: Encoder-Decoder Text-to-Text Framework (T5 architecture)
  - Why needed here: T5-Large treats all tasks as text-to-text, with prefixes controlling behavior. Understanding how external knowledge is concatenated to inputs explains why knowledge quality directly affects outputs.
  - Quick check question: How does T5's prefix-based task specification differ from prompting a decoder-only LLM?

- Concept: Constrained Generation Evaluation (coverage + plausibility)
  - Why needed here: Standard NLG metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) measure surface similarity, not whether all required concepts appear or whether output is commonsense-plausible. The paper's dual-criteria evaluation is the diagnostic tool.
  - Quick check question: A generated sentence is fluent but omits one required concept—does it pass coverage? Does it pass commonsense?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Concept set → ConceptNet retrieval → Relation extraction → Knowledge concatenation → T5-Large generation → Manual evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Concept set → ConceptNet API query → Relation extraction
  2. Relations + concepts → T5-Large prompt construction
  3. Generated sentence → Manual dual-criteria evaluation
  4. Ablation: Filter "highly relevant" relations → Regenerate → Compare

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Knowledge quantity vs. relevance: More relations increase noise; filtering improves precision but risks removing useful context
  - Automatic vs. manual filtering: Paper uses human judgment (659/1635 relations removed); automating this requires a relevance classifier
  - Single-model vs. multi-model validation: Results specific to T5-Large; generalization untested

- Failure signatures:
  - Polysemy mismatch: Knowledge provides wrong word sense → concept omission
  - Isolated concepts: No semantic bridges between concepts → incoherent or incomplete sentences
  - Surface-level metrics pass, semantic evaluation fails: 8% of "full knowledge" outputs passed commonsense but failed coverage

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the ablation on 20 concept sets: Compare full vs. filtered knowledge generation, measure coverage/commonsense manually to validate the 91% → 6% drop.
  2. Test polysemy robustness: For 10 ambiguous words (e.g., "bank," "watch," "fall"), retrieve ConceptNet relations and classify whether relations match intended sense; measure correlation with generation success.
  3. Compare knowledge sources: Replace ConceptNet with WordNet definitions or Wikidata relations; evaluate whether relation type distribution affects the ablation magnitude.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the critical influence of relevant external knowledge on coherence and coverage generalize to languages other than English?
- Basis in paper: The authors state in the Future Work section: "we plan to investigate the impact of external knowledge in multilingual settings to determine whether its influence is consistent across languages or language-dependent."
- Why unresolved: The current study and the KITGI dataset are constructed solely based on the English CommonGen dataset, leaving the dynamics of knowledge integration in morphologically rich or low-resource languages unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the KITGI benchmark to a multilingual dataset and replicating the knowledge removal experiments to see if the performance drop (91% to 6%) is replicated across different linguistic structures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the observed effects of knowledge integration be replicated in NLP tasks outside of constrained commonsense generation?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly propose: "this approach could be applied to other NLP tasks to assess whether knowledge integration yields similar effects beyond text generation."
- Why unresolved: The methodology was tailored to the CommonGen task (generating a sentence from concepts); it is unclear if removing key knowledge causes similar failures in tasks like summarization, dialogue, or question answering where the constraints differ.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the three-stage interpretability method (key knowledge removal and regeneration) to tasks like abstractive summarization and measuring the impact on factual consistency metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the source and retrieval method of external knowledge affect the interpretability and performance of NLG models?
- Basis in paper: The paper concludes by noting it would be valuable to "explore more advanced knowledge retrieval and integration methods to evaluate how different types and sources of knowledge influence model performance."
- Why unresolved: This study relied specifically on ConceptNet relations and a "top-5" retrieval heuristic; it is unknown if denser knowledge sources (e.g., Wikipedia) or different retrieval techniques (e.g., dense passage retrieval) would show the same sensitivity to filtering.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis where the T5-Large model is augmented with different knowledge sources (e.g., ATOMIC vs. ConceptNet) and different retrieval strategies, followed by the same filtering and manual evaluation process.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Do larger, decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit the same drastic performance degradation when relevant external knowledge is removed as the T5-Large model?
- Basis in paper: The study relies exclusively on the T5-Large encoder-decoder model. The authors acknowledge the rapid advancements in LLMs but do not test if models with significantly larger parametric knowledge (e.g., GPT-4 or Llama 3) can compensate for the removal of specific external relations better than T5.
- Why unresolved: Larger models may possess sufficient internalized commonsense knowledge to buffer the removal of external cues, potentially resulting in a performance drop less severe than the 91% to 6% observed in this study.
- What evidence would resolve it: Repeating the KITGI evaluation protocol using state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs to compare their robustness against the removal of relevant relations compared to T5-Large.

## Limitations
- Manual knowledge filtering process introduces subjectivity without documented criteria beyond "highly relevant"
- Reliance on T5-Large alone limits claims about broader LLM behavior
- Binary manual evaluation lacks explicit inter-annotator agreement scores
- Relatively small evaluation set (121 instances) raises concerns about statistical power

## Confidence
- High confidence: The experimental design for testing knowledge relevance through controlled ablation is sound and well-executed. The 91% vs. 6% performance drop under different knowledge conditions is internally consistent.
- Medium confidence: Claims about polysemy-induced omission as an emergent error-avoidance behavior are plausible but lack corpus-level validation.
- Low confidence: Generalization claims beyond T5-Large and the CommonGen dataset are not supported. The specific manual filtering criteria and annotation rubrics are underspecified.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the ablation on 20 concept sets: Generate sentences with full vs. filtered knowledge using the same three-stage interpretability method. Measure coverage and commonsense manually to confirm the 91% → 6% performance drop.
2. Test polysemy robustness: For 10 ambiguous words (e.g., "bank," "watch," "fall"), retrieve ConceptNet relations and classify whether relations match intended sense. Measure correlation between relation relevance and generation success.
3. Compare knowledge sources: Replace ConceptNet with WordNet definitions or Wikidata relations. Evaluate whether different knowledge structures produce similar ablation magnitudes, testing the mechanism's dependence on knowledge type.
