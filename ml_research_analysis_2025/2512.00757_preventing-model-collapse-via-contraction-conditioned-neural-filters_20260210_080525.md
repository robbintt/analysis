# Preventing Model Collapse via Contraction-Conditioned Neural Filters

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.00757
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00757
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Primary result:** A neural filter based on contraction operators prevents model collapse in recursive training, eliminating the need for superlinear sample growth required by prior methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of model collapse in recursive training of generative models, where repeated sampling and parameter updates cause the model to drift away from the true data distribution. The authors propose a neural filter that learns to enforce contraction conditions on parameter error dynamics, theoretically ensuring convergence even with constant sample sizes. Unlike prior approaches requiring superlinear sample growth to reduce variance, this method actively steers parameter estimates toward the true distribution through a learned neural network. The approach bridges control theory with deep learning by incorporating Lyapunov stability principles into the loss function, providing an end-to-end solution for sustainable model training.

## Method Summary
The method involves training a neural network filter that outputs selection weights for synthetic data points in recursive parameter estimation. The filter is trained using a combined loss function consisting of classification loss and contraction loss. The contraction loss enforces Lyapunov stability by penalizing parameter estimates that violate contraction conditions. For exponential family distributions, the filter computes weighted sufficient statistics to update parameter estimates while maintaining stability. The approach is validated through controlled experiments comparing filtered and unfiltered recursive training under different sample growth rates.

## Key Results
- The neural filter effectively prevents model collapse in exponential family distributions where unfiltered approaches diverge
- Parameter estimates converge to true values regardless of sample growth rate when using the contraction filter
- The method achieves superior performance compared to unfiltered approaches, particularly when sample growth is slow
- Theoretical analysis shows estimation errors converge probabilistically under mild assumptions about noise decay

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Contraction-Conditioned Error Dynamics
The filter prevents model collapse by enforcing a stochastic contraction condition on parameter error dynamics. It learns a pullback operator that actively steers estimates toward the true parameter basin, contrasting with passive approaches that rely on increasing sample sizes. The convergence guarantee requires noise variance to decay and a function c(e) to bound the contraction strength.

### Mechanism 2: Physics-Informed Regularization (Loss Design)
The neural network learns stability constraints through a combined loss function. The contraction loss acts as a physics-informed regularizer that penalizes violations of Lyapunov stability conditions, forcing the network to select data points that pull the error toward zero. This bridges control theory with deep learning by making stability a learned objective.

### Mechanism 3: Sufficient Statistics Selection
For exponential families, the filter maintains estimation integrity by weighting synthetic data points to preserve sufficient statistics. By optimizing weights via the contraction loss, the filter ensures statistics remain within the region of attraction for the true parameter, effectively filtering out collapse-inducing noise.

## Foundational Learning

- **Model Collapse**: Understanding this as a random walk with accumulating variance is essential to grasp why a pullback force (contraction) is the solution.
  - Quick check: In this paper, does model collapse occur because the model loses diversity, because the error diverges, or both?

- **Contraction Mapping**: The theoretical guarantee rests on Banach's fixed-point theorem principles. You must understand that a contraction operator reduces the distance to a target point with every iteration.
  - Quick check: If an operator A satisfies A^T P A ⪯ (1-c)P, what happens to the norm of the error vector e after applying A?

- **Lyapunov Stability**: The loss function is built around a Lyapunov function V(e) = e^T P e. The goal is to ensure V(e) decreases over time.
  - Quick check: Why is the term e_new^T P e_new used in the loss function instead of simple Euclidean distance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input data -> PCA reduction -> FilterNet (MLP) -> Selection weights w_i -> Weighted sufficient statistics -> Parameter estimate θ_new
- **Critical path:** The differentiable path from MLP weights φ to parameter estimate θ_new. Forward pass calculates sufficient statistics, estimates θ_new, and evaluates contraction condition. Backward pass adjusts φ to minimize violation.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Filter strictness vs. data starvation (strong filter may reject too many points), computational cost (calculating estimation and second-order loss inside training loop).
- **Failure signatures:** Gradient conflict between classification and stability objectives, reference drift if θ_good is inaccurate.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Collapse: Train recursive generative model without filter to observe divergence rate as random walk drift.
  2. Filter Ablation: Train with only classification loss vs. classification plus contraction loss to test if classification alone prevents collapse.
  3. Sample Size Stress Test: Run full system with fixed sample size to verify parameter error decreases or stabilizes, contrasting with superlinear growth requirements of prior work.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can the approach be extended beyond exponential family distributions to general parametric families or non-parametric settings?**
  - Basis: The paper states it needs to know the specific distribution type and estimation method as a limitation, with experiments only covering exponential families.
  - Why unresolved: The framework relies on exponential family properties (sufficient statistics, closed-form MLE) that may not transfer to arbitrary distributions.

- **How can the reference parameter θ_good be obtained in fully unsupervised settings without access to ground-truth labels or initial high-quality data?**
  - Basis: Section 5.3 states the filter's performance depends on high-quality reference parameter θ_good, which may not always be accessible in fully unsupervised settings.
  - Why unresolved: Training requires labeling samples based on proximity to true parameters, presupposing knowledge unavailable in practice.

- **Can the theoretical framework be extended to handle partial estimation scenarios where only subsets of parameters are estimated at each iteration?**
  - Basis: Section 6.2 states "In the future, we will consider the theoretical framework when there is partial estimation" as explicit future work.
  - Why unresolved: Current theory assumes full parameter estimation; partial estimation introduces different error dynamics.

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness relies on Assumptions 2.1 and 2.3 being met; violations of these assumptions may break theoretical convergence guarantees.
- The approach is validated only on synthetic Gaussian data from exponential families, with unclear generalizability to other distribution families or real-world data.
- The reference parameter θ_good must be available for training, limiting applicability to fully unsupervised settings where such references are unavailable.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The theoretical framework for contraction-based stability and the basic neural filter architecture are well-defined and internally consistent.
- **Medium Confidence:** Empirical demonstration of preventing model collapse in controlled synthetic experiments is convincing but based on a relatively small number of iterations (50).
- **Low Confidence:** The method's robustness to noise distribution violations, performance on non-exponential family distributions, and scalability to high-dimensional real-world datasets are not thoroughly addressed.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Assumption Violations:** Systematically test filter performance when Assumption 2.1 (noise decay) is violated by introducing persistent noise or non-vanishing bias into the recursive training loop.

2. **Generalization to Non-Exponential Families:** Extend experiments to non-exponential family distributions (e.g., mixture models, heavy-tailed distributions) to assess broader applicability and identify potential failure modes.

3. **Scalability and Real-World Validation:** Apply the contraction-conditioned filter to a real-world recursive training task (e.g., data augmentation in image generation or language modeling) and evaluate its impact on preventing model collapse compared to standard techniques.
