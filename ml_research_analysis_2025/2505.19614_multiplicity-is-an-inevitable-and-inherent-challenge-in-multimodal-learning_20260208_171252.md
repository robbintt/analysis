# Multiplicity is an Inevitable and Inherent Challenge in Multimodal Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.19614
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19614
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Multiplicity—many-to-many alignment in multimodal data—is an inevitable challenge that current one-to-one approaches cannot fully address, requiring new frameworks, datasets, and evaluation metrics.

## Executive Summary
This position paper argues that multiplicity—the many-to-many alignment nature of multimodal data—is an inevitable and inherent challenge in multimodal learning. Current approaches assuming one-to-one deterministic mappings fail to capture the rich, task-dependent ambiguity and representational asymmetries across modalities. Multiplicity manifests throughout the learning pipeline: it introduces input and matching ambiguity during training, compromises reliability in retrieval-based evaluation, and affects dataset quality. The paper highlights that scaling models and datasets under the one-to-one assumption cannot fully resolve these issues. Future research should focus on multiplicity-aware frameworks, novel dataset construction protocols, and architectures capable of representing multiple valid interpretations, such as probabilistic embeddings or conditional modeling. Addressing multiplicity is essential for building robust, scalable multimodal systems that truly reflect the complexity of real-world multimodal relationships.

## Method Summary
The paper analytically demonstrates multiplicity's impact through three main mechanisms: gradient mismatch in contrastive learning when unannotated positives exist (K>1), unreliable R@K metrics that ignore semantically valid retrieved items, and quadratic growth of cross-modal relationships making exhaustive annotation infeasible. The core argument is validated through COCO Caption statistics showing 8.5× more valid matches than annotated, and by proposing probabilistic embeddings and ranking-based metrics (mAP@R) as partial solutions. The work synthesizes theoretical analysis with empirical evidence to establish multiplicity as a fundamental challenge rather than a dataset-specific issue.

## Key Results
- Multiplicity causes systematic gradient mismatch in contrastive training when K>1 valid positives exist but only one is annotated
- Standard R@K retrieval metrics poorly correlate with human preference while mAP@R shows strong correlation
- COCO Caption dataset exhibits ~8.5× more valid cross-modal matches than originally annotated
- Quadratic growth of relationships makes exhaustive annotation infeasible as datasets scale

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contrastive training objectives systematically push semantically similar pairs apart when datasets assume one-to-one mappings but data exhibits many-to-many relationships.
- Mechanism: Standard contrastive loss computes gradients that pull the positive pair together while pushing the query away from all other instances in the batch. When K>1 valid positives exist but only one is annotated, the gradient term Σ(p_j - p*_j)g(y_j) actively repels the query from unannotated-but-valid matches, distorting the embedding space proportional to K.
- Core assumption: The paper assumes semantically similar inputs within a modality can be approximated to a shared representation region, making cross-modal matching stochastic.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "most current approaches are built on the assumption of a deterministic, one-to-one alignment... This oversimplifies real-world multimodal relationships"
  - [section 3.1]: "the gradient pulls f(x1) away from g(y+) despite their semantic similarity... As K increases, this mismatch amplifies, leading to slower convergence"
  - [corpus]: Related work "Multimodal Negative Learning" (arXiv:2510.20877) addresses modality imbalance but doesn't directly validate this gradient mismatch mechanism; corpus evidence is weak for this specific claim.
- Break condition: If datasets had exhaustive many-to-many annotations, or if K=1 for all instances (no unannotated positives), this mechanism would not manifest.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-modal retrieval benchmarks using Recall@K metrics systematically underestimate model quality when multiple valid targets exist per query.
- Mechanism: R@K checks only whether the single annotated positive appears in top-K results, ignoring whether other retrieved items are semantically valid. Ranking-based metrics like mAP@R correlate better with human preference because they measure overall ranking quality across multiple positives.
- Core assumption: Human annotators can reliably identify semantic validity across retrieved results.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "compromises reliability in retrieval-based evaluation"
  - [section 4.1]: Fig. 4 shows mAP@R correlates highly with human preference (HP) scores while R@K metrics are often irrelevant; "R@K is not only less informative... but can also be misleading"
  - [corpus]: Corpus lacks direct validation of mAP@R vs R@K correlation; paper relies on internal citations (Chun et al. 2022).
- Break condition: If each query truly has only one valid match, or if evaluation uses ranking metrics over multiple verified positives, this unreliability diminishes.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Quadratic growth of potential cross-modal relationships makes exhaustive annotation infeasible, causing false negatives that cascade through training and evaluation.
- Mechanism: Adding one new pair (x,y) to a dataset of size N can create O(N) new implicit relationships with existing instances. For underspecified inputs (e.g., caption "photo"), this amplifies multiplicity dramatically. Datasets like COCO Caption show ~8.5× more valid matches than annotated.
- Core assumption: Semantic similarity between instances in one modality implies cross-valid relationships with instances paired in the other modality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2]: "the number of meaningful relationships can grow quadratically with the dataset size"
  - [section 3]: "the average number of plausible human-verified positive images/captions for each caption/image is 8.5/17.9 (originally 1/5)"
  - [corpus]: Related work on missing modalities (arXiv:2511.12034) addresses representation learning gaps but doesn't validate this annotation scaling argument.
- Break condition: If datasets restrict instances to narrowly defined, non-overlapping semantic content, quadratic relationship growth is constrained.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning objectives (e.g., InfoNCE, triplet loss)
  - Why needed here: The paper's core argument depends on understanding how contrastive gradients behave when false negatives exist in the batch.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the contrastive loss gradient pushes a query away from all non-matched items in the batch?

- Concept: Aleatoric vs epistemic uncertainty
  - Why needed here: The paper frames multiplicity as aleatoric uncertainty (inherent data ambiguity) rather than noise, requiring solutions that model uncertainty rather than eliminate it.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between uncertainty that can be reduced with more data versus uncertainty inherent to the task?

- Concept: Retrieval evaluation metrics (R@K, mAP, nDCG)
  - Why needed here: Understanding why R@K fails under multiplicity requires knowing what these metrics measure and their assumptions about ground truth.
  - Quick check question: Why does Recall@K treat a ranked list with the positive at position K the same as one with the positive at position 1?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Standard pipeline: Uni-modal encoders → shared embedding space → contrastive loss → R@K evaluation
  Multiplicity-aware additions: Probabilistic embeddings (distributions instead of points), multiple embeddings per instance, conditional encoders with task/context inputs, mAP@R or human-aligned metrics

- Critical path:
  1. Identify multiplicity sources in your data (intra-modal variability, modality asymmetry, task ambiguity)
  2. Audit training for false negative rate (sample pairs and human-verify if unannotated positives exist)
  3. Choose mitigation: probabilistic embeddings for uncertainty, or conditional inputs to disambiguate

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Probabilistic embeddings: Better uncertainty quantification, modest empirical gains per paper, added computational cost
  - Multiple fixed embeddings: Conceptually fits multiplicity, inflexible if concepts exceed pre-defined slots
  - Filtering for specificity (e.g., HYPE): Reduces multiplicity at data level, may discard useful diversity

- Failure signatures:
  - Training loss plateaus while validation R@K improves but semantic quality degrades
  - Retrieved items look semantically correct to humans but score as failures
  - Models overfit to annotation artifacts rather than semantic content

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Audit your dataset: Sample 100-500 query-target pairs, have annotators verify if unannotated matches in top-50 are semantically valid; estimate false negative rate
  2. Compare metrics: Run existing model on retrieval task, compute both R@K and mAP@R; check if rankings correlate
  3. Pilot probabilistic embeddings: Replace deterministic embeddings with Gaussian distributions (mean + variance), train with appropriate divergence loss; compare embedding space geometry

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a unified training framework be developed that systematically addresses both input and matching ambiguity while maintaining the scalability of current one-to-one models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.2 states that "the field lacks a unified framework that systematically addresses multiplicity in multimodal training," noting that current solutions like probabilistic embeddings show only modest empirical gains.
- Why unresolved: Existing probabilistic or mixture-based architectures have not yet demonstrated clear performance advantages or stability at the scale of large foundation models like CLIP.
- What evidence would resolve it: A multiplicity-aware architecture that scales efficiently to billions of samples and outperforms deterministic baselines on uncertainty-aware benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What scalable dataset construction protocols can effectively minimize structural multiplicity, such as underspecification, without compromising the semantic diversity required for general-purpose tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 calls for "scalable dataset construction protocols that explicitly minimize structural multiplicity," suggesting that filtering should move beyond coarse alignment to target specific ambiguity sources.
- Why unresolved: Current filtering heuristics based on alignment scores (e.g., CLIP similarity) fail to distinguish between high-similarity "underspecified" instances (e.g., captions like "a photo") and high-quality pairs, inadvertently introducing noise.
- What evidence would resolve it: A data curation pipeline that quantifiably reduces false negative rates in the resulting dataset without causing a drop in downstream zero-shot classification performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can cross-modal retrieval metrics be redesigned to robustly account for multiple valid targets without relying on infeasible exhaustive human annotation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.1 argues that standard Recall@K metrics are "misleading" and "irrelevant" to human preference (Fig. 4), creating a need for "more reliable evaluation metrics for retrieval benchmarks under multiplicity."
- Why unresolved: Ranking-based metrics like mAP@R require knowledge of all positives, which is impossible to annotate completely due to the quadratic growth of relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of an automatic evaluation metric that correlates significantly better with human preference scores than Recall@K on standard retrieval benchmarks.

## Limitations

- The paper's claims about multiplicity-induced gradient mismatches rely on the assumption that contrastive objectives treat semantically valid unannotated pairs as strict negatives, which requires empirical validation across diverse datasets
- The proposed metric shift (mAP@R over R@K) is compelling but requires broader validation across different retrieval tasks and model families
- Scaling solutions' limitations and the relative effectiveness of different multiplicity-aware approaches across tasks remain uncertain

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Multiplicity exists in real datasets (COCO statistics verified); R@K fails to capture semantic quality; quadratic relationship growth limits annotation feasibility
- **Medium Confidence**: Gradient mismatch mechanism described; mAP@R correlates better with human preference; probabilistic embeddings help
- **Low Confidence**: Scaling solutions' limitations; relative effectiveness of different multiplicity-aware approaches across tasks

## Next Checks

1. Audit your dataset's multiplicity: Sample 500-1000 pairs, use multiple heterogeneous retrieval models to find top-25 candidates, and have human annotators verify valid matches. Calculate the ratio of discovered vs. annotated positives.
2. Test metric correlation: Run an existing multimodal retrieval model, compute both R@K and mAP@R, and compare correlations with human preference scores from pairwise comparisons.
3. Pilot probabilistic embeddings: Replace deterministic embeddings with Gaussian distributions, train with KL divergence loss, and measure embedding space geometry and retrieval quality.
