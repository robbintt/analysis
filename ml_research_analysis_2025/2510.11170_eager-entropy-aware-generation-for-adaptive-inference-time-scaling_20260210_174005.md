core_contribution: This paper introduces EAGER, an entropy-aware decoding method for
  adaptive inference-time scaling in language models. The method monitors token-level
  entropy during generation and branches only at high-entropy tokens, thereby avoiding
  redundant computation in low-entropy regions while focusing compute where uncertainty
  is high.

# EAGER: Entropy-Aware GEneRation for Adaptive Inference-Time Scaling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11170
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11170
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Up to 65% token reduction and 37% Pass@k improvement over parallel sampling

## Executive Summary
EAGER introduces a training-free adaptive inference method that monitors token-level entropy during LLM generation and branches only at high-entropy tokens. The method operates in two stages: an entropy-guided generation phase (EAGER-init) that prunes unnecessary generations, and a budget reallocation phase that directs saved compute to more challenging prompts. By focusing computation where model uncertainty is highest, EAGER achieves up to 65% reduction in token generation and up to 37% improvement in Pass@k accuracy compared to standard parallel sampling, with consistent gains across models (3B to 20B parameters) and tasks including math, science, and code generation.

## Method Summary
EAGER is a two-stage, training-free adaptive inference method for language models. Stage 1 (EAGER-init) monitors token-level entropy during generation using top-K entropy (K=20) and branches only when entropy exceeds threshold θ, creating at most M parallel sequences. At branching points, the method selects top-2 tokens and continues generation. Stage 2 implements budget reallocation, identifying saturating prompts (those hitting M cap) and redistributing saved budget uniformly, capped at 2M additional sequences. The method uses temperature τ=0.6, top-p=0.95, and a 32k context window, with θ∈[1.8, 2.7] and M∈{1,4,8,16,24,32} as key hyperparameters.

## Key Results
- Up to 65% reduction in token generation compared to Full Parallel Sampling
- Up to 37% improvement in Pass@k accuracy across benchmarks
- Consistent gains across model scales (3B to 20B parameters) and tasks (math, science, code)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EAGER works by dynamically allocating compute based on model uncertainty signals. The entropy-aware branching mechanism identifies tokens where the model is uncertain (high entropy) and creates multiple sequences only at these critical decision points, while following a single path through low-entropy regions. This approach avoids redundant computation in predictable text while maintaining diversity where it matters most. The budget reallocation phase further improves efficiency by recognizing when prompts are saturating (reaching M cap) and redistributing saved compute to more challenging prompts that would benefit from additional diversity.

## Foundational Learning

**Top-K Entropy**: Measures uncertainty by computing entropy over the top-K predicted tokens. Why needed: Quantifies model confidence at each generation step to guide branching decisions. Quick check: Verify entropy values are higher for ambiguous tokens (e.g., ambiguous pronouns) versus predictable tokens (e.g., common function words).

**Branching Factor M**: Maximum number of parallel sequences maintained during generation. Why needed: Controls computational budget and prevents exponential growth in sequence count. Quick check: Monitor sequence count during generation to ensure it never exceeds M.

**Entropy Threshold θ**: Cutoff value determining when to branch based on entropy. Why needed: Filters out low-uncertainty tokens to avoid unnecessary branching. Quick check: Plot entropy distribution across tokens to verify threshold captures meaningful uncertainty peaks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Prompt -> Token Generator -> Entropy Monitor -> Branching Controller -> Sequence Pool -> Output Selection

**Critical Path**: Token generation → entropy computation → branching decision → sequence continuation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational efficiency (by avoiding redundant generation) for potential accuracy gains (by focusing diversity where uncertainty is highest). Lower entropy thresholds increase branching frequency and computational cost but may improve accuracy on challenging prompts.

**Failure Signatures**: Repetitive token generation (e.g., "The answer is: The answer is:...") indicates insufficient temperature or entropy threshold issues. Too few branches (ending with 1-2 sequences) suggests entropy threshold set too high.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement top-K entropy computation and verify it correctly identifies high-entropy tokens on a simple prompt
2. Test EAGER-init with θ=2.0, M=32 on a math problem subset and measure #Tokens vs baseline
3. Validate prefix reuse by tracking actual token savings across branches during generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can alternative uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., KL divergence, semantic entropy) outperform top-K token entropy for guiding branching decisions in EAGER? The paper suggests this as a promising direction but only evaluates top-K entropy.

**Open Question 2**: How can the entropy threshold θ be automatically selected or adapted per model and task without manual tuning? The paper notes that optimal θ remains task- and model-dependent but provides no adaptive selection mechanism.

**Open Question 3**: Does EAGER's efficiency and performance advantage persist at much larger model scales (e.g., 70B+ parameters)? The paper only evaluates models from 3B to 20B parameters.

## Limitations

- Exact "longest thinking configuration" settings per model are unspecified, though this refers to model-specific reasoning modes
- Sequence termination conditions beyond EOS token detection lack full specification
- The 1000-token entropy monitoring halt condition implementation details are unclear
- Method shows sensitivity to temperature settings, with potential repetitive generation issues

## Confidence

- High confidence in core entropy-aware branching mechanism (EAGER-init) and implementation
- Medium confidence in budget reallocation phase effectiveness due to sparse details
- Medium confidence in cross-model generalization given consistent 3B-20B results
- Low confidence in exact hyperparameter sensitivity without full ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test entropy threshold sensitivity by running EAGER-init across θ ∈ [1.8, 2.7] on math problem subset to quantify efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
2. Validate prefix reuse mechanism by instrumenting generation pipeline to track actual token savings from shared prefixes across branches
3. Test failure mode handling by deliberately setting temperature too low (τ=0.1) and entropy threshold too high (θ=3.0) to verify recommended diagnostics for repetitive generation and insufficient branching
