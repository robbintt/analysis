# A Unified Theory of Sparse Dictionary Learning in Mechanistic Interpretability: Piecewise Biconvexity and Spurious Minima

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.05534
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05534
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Introduces first unified theoretical framework for sparse dictionary learning (SDL) in mechanistic interpretability, proving SDL is piecewise biconvex and characterizing spurious minima; proposes feature anchoring to improve feature recovery.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first unified theoretical framework for sparse dictionary learning (SDL) in mechanistic interpretability, showing that diverse methods like sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders can be cast as a single piecewise biconvex optimization problem. The authors prove that SDL optimization is biconvex within fixed activation pattern regions and characterize its global solution set, demonstrating that the problem is fundamentally underdetermined—multiple solutions can achieve zero reconstruction loss without recovering interpretable ground-truth features. To validate their theory, they design the Linear Representation Bench with fully accessible ground-truth features and propose feature anchoring, a method-agnostic technique that constrains learned features to known semantic directions, substantially improving feature recovery across synthetic benchmarks and real neural representations.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes SDL as piecewise biconvex optimization and introduces the Linear Representation Bench (synthetic dataset with n=1000 ground-truth features) to validate theoretical predictions. They implement encoder-decoder architectures with various activations (ReLU, TopK, etc.) and propose feature anchoring—constraining k encoder rows/decoder columns to known semantic directions via an additional loss term. The anchoring loss removes rotational degrees of freedom in latent space, forcing convergence toward ground truth configurations. Experiments compare standard SDL variants against anchored versions on both synthetic benchmarks and real CLIP embeddings, measuring feature recovery via cosine similarity to ground truth.

## Key Results
- Proves SDL is piecewise biconvex within activation pattern regions under extreme sparsity (S→1)
- Characterizes spurious partial minima with polysemanticity and dead neurons as pervasive phenomena
- Demonstrates feature anchoring improves GT Recovery from ~0% (ReLU) or ~84% (TopK) to higher baselines
- Shows theoretical framework explains feature absorption through hierarchical concept structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Piecewise Biconvex Optimization
- **Claim:** SDL optimization is biconvex (convex in $W_D$ for fixed $W_E$ and vice versa) within fixed activation pattern regions $\Omega_A$.
- **Mechanism:** Under extreme sparsity ($S \to 1$), the loss decomposes into independent per-feature reconstruction terms. When the activation pattern (which neurons fire for which features) is fixed, the activation function becomes locally linear, allowing the problem to reduce to alternating convex sub-problems.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: Extreme sparsity ($S \to 1$) ensures features activate independently, preventing cross-term interference in the Hessian.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Theorem 3.2] proves convexity in $W_D$ and $W_E$ over $\mathbb{R}^{n_r \times n_q} \times \Omega_A$.
  - [Section 3.2] states the loss exhibits bi-convex structure over activation pattern regions.
  - [Corpus] SplInterp (arXiv:2505.11836) discusses improving SAE training but lacks this specific biconvex theoretical grounding.
- **Break condition:** If sparsity $S$ drops significantly, simultaneous feature activations introduce non-linear interactions, invalidating the independent decomposition and potentially destroying the convexity within $\Omega_A$.

### Mechanism 2: Spurious Minima from Underdetermination
- **Claim:** SDL admits partial minima with positive loss where neurons are polysemantic or dead, because the zero-loss solution set is underdetermined.
- **Mechanism:** The system $w_r^d = W_D \sigma(W_E w_p^d)$ is linear in $W_D$ and effectively linear in $W_E$ (locally). When latent dimension $n_q$ exceeds feature count $n$, multiple configurations satisfy the reconstruction requirement without aligning with ground truth features.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: The ground truth features are linearly independent and distinct; otherwise, "polysemantic" solutions might actually be valid basis changes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Theorem 3.4] characterizes the necessary conditions for zero loss, showing the system is underdetermined.
  - [Example 3.5] constructs a specific spurious partial minimum with polysemanticity and dead neurons.
  - [Corpus] Related papers on concept consistency (arXiv:2505.20254) observe feature inconsistency, which aligns with the theoretical non-identifiability shown here.
- **Break condition:** If $n_q \le n$ (fewer latents than features) and features strictly require basis expansion, the underdetermined degrees of freedom vanish, likely removing these specific spurious minima.

### Mechanism 3: Feature Anchoring as Identifiability Constraint
- **Claim:** Constraining a subset of encoder rows and decoder columns to known semantic directions reduces the solution manifold, forcing convergence toward the ground truth configuration.
- **Mechanism:** The anchoring loss $L_{anchor}$ removes rotational degrees of freedom in the latent space. By pinning $k$ features, the optimizer cannot rotate the entire basis to a spurious configuration without incurring high anchoring penalty.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: The anchor directions $\tilde{w}_p, \tilde{w}_r$ accurately represent ground truth semantics.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.2] defines the anchored SDL objective $L_{SDL-FA}$.
  - [Table 1] shows Feature Anchoring improving GT Recovery from ~% (ReLU) or ~84% (TopK) to higher baselines.
  - [Corpus] Corpus evidence for this specific technique is weak; related work focuses on architecture tweaks rather than geometric constraints.
- **Break condition:** If the provided anchor features are noisy, non-orthogonal, or semantically impure (e.g., polysemantic class embeddings), the constraint may force the model to learn incorrect representations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Biconvex Optimization**
  - **Why needed here:** The core theoretical contribution relies on identifying SDL not as general non-convex optimization, but as biconvex. This explains why alternating minimization (fix $W_E$, solve $W_D$) is stable but simultaneous updates might fail.
  - **Quick check question:** If I freeze the decoder $W_D$, is the gradient of the encoder $W_E$ guaranteed to point toward a global minimum of the *current sub-problem*?

- **Concept: The Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH)**
  - **Why needed here:** The theoretical proofs (Theorems 3.1-3.4) depend entirely on the assumption that ground truth features are linear directions ($x_p = W_p x$). The "identifiability" discussed is strictly geometric.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the theory hold if concepts are represented non-linearly (e.g., via circular representations for periodic features)?

- **Concept: Partial Minima vs. Local Minima**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper proves SDL has "spurious partial minima." These are points where the loss is stationary for $W_D$ given $W_E$ and vice versa, but not jointly optimal. This distinguishes "stuck training" from "bad local valleys."
  - **Quick check question:** Why is finding a point where $\nabla_{W_D} L = 0$ and $\nabla_{W_E} L = 0$ not sufficient to guarantee a global minimum in biconvex problems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Input/Target: $x_p$ (e.g., activations) and $x_r$ (reconstruction target)
  - Encoder ($W_E$): Maps input to latent sparse code
  - Activation ($\sigma$): Enforces sparsity (ReLU, TopK)
  - Decoder ($W_D$): Reconstructs target from latent code
  - Anchors: Subset of fixed vectors $\tilde{w}$ constraining specific dimensions of $W_E, W_D$

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate/Load representation pairs $(x_p, x_r)$
  2. Initialize $W_E, W_D$
  3. Apply activation $\sigma$ (e.g., TopK)
  4. Compute $L_{recon} + \lambda L_{anchor}$
  5. Update weights (ideally alternating or standard gradient descent with careful learning rates)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Latent Dimension ($n_q$):** Higher $n_q$ improves capacity but increases the underdetermined solution space (Theorem 3.4), raising the risk of spurious minima.
  - **Sparsity (S/k):** Higher sparsity validates the theoretical assumptions and improves biconvexity approximation but may discard necessary information.
  - **Anchoring Strength ($\lambda_{anchor}$):** Too high breaks reconstruction; too low fails to resolve identifiability.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Dead Neurons:** Latent dimensions never activate (Theorem 3.7 suggests these are linked to spurious partial minima structures).
  - **Feature Absorption:** A "Dog" neuron fires only for "Poodle," while a separate neuron fires for "Dog AND NOT Poodle" (Theorem 3.10).
  - **Zero Loss, Zero Recovery:** Reconstruction error is near zero, but the cosine similarity of learned directions to ground truth is random (Figure 4).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Verify Underdetermination:** Train a ReLU SAE on the Linear Representation Bench with $n_q \gg n$. Confirm that you achieve near-zero loss but 0% Ground Truth Recovery.
  2. **Validate Anchoring:** Re-run the experiment, but apply Feature Anchoring to just 10% of the ground truth features. Verify if this "pulls" the rest of the basis into alignment.
  3. **Induce & Fix Absorption:** Create a synthetic dataset with hierarchical concepts (Parent -> Children). Train a TopK SAE, identify feature absorption, and check if neuron resampling or anchoring the parent concept resolves it.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can Global Optimization for biconvex Problems (GOP) provide certificates of global optimality and systematically escape spurious partial minima in SDL training?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Appendix F: "applying Global Optimization for biconvex Problems (GOP)... could provide certificates of global optimality and systematically escape spurious partial minima."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper establishes piecewise biconvexity (Theorem 3.2) but does not implement or analyze GOP algorithms for SDL.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical comparison showing GOP-based training achieves provably global minima, with runtime analysis on realistic problem scales.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the convergence rates for gradient-based methods on SDL and the sample complexity bounds for feature recovery?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Appendix F: "future work should establish convergence rates for gradient descent and sample complexity bounds for feature recovery."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper characterizes minima but provides no guarantees on whether gradient descent converges to global vs. spurious minima.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Theoretical bounds on steps-to-convergence and number of samples needed to recover features with high probability.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the theoretical framework be extended to moderate sparsity regimes where feature co-activation occurs frequently?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Appendix F: "Extending results beyond the S→1 regime to handle feature co-activation would broaden practical applicability."
- **Why unresolved:** Key results including Theorem 3.1 rely on extreme sparsity (S→1); bounds degrade for moderate sparsity commonly observed in practice.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Revised loss approximation and identifiability conditions that account for multi-feature co-activation patterns.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can high-quality anchor features be automatically discovered without external supervision?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Appendix F: "Developing methods to automatically discover high-quality anchors without external supervision would make feature anchoring more practical."
- **Why unresolved:** Feature anchoring currently requires known semantic directions (class labels or ground-truth access), limiting real-world applicability.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An unsupervised anchor selection method achieving comparable GT Recovery to supervised anchoring on the Linear Representation Bench.

## Limitations

- The biconvexity proof relies heavily on extreme sparsity assumptions (S→1) that may not hold in practical SAE training, where S is typically 0.05-0.1. The theoretical guarantees may not extend to these regimes.
- The Linear Representation Hypothesis assumes ground truth features are linear and distinct. Real neural features may exhibit hierarchical, compositional, or non-linear structure that violates these assumptions.
- Feature anchoring assumes anchor directions accurately capture ground truth semantics. In practice, obtaining pure, non-polysemantic anchor features may be challenging, potentially limiting the method's effectiveness.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The piecewise biconvex structure is mathematically rigorous within the specified activation regions, and the underdetermination characterization (Theorem 3.4) is well-supported.
- **Medium Confidence:** The theoretical framework provides valuable intuition for why standard SAE training fails, but the gap between S→1 assumptions and practical training regimes introduces uncertainty.
- **Low Confidence:** The effectiveness of feature anchoring on real neural representations depends heavily on anchor quality, which is not thoroughly validated beyond synthetic benchmarks.

## Next Checks

1. **Sparsity Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary sparsity levels (S=0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 0.99) and measure how biconvexity breaks down and spurious minima increase. This would quantify the practical limits of the theoretical framework.

2. **Non-Linear Feature Benchmark:** Extend the Linear Representation Bench to include hierarchical, compositional, or circular features. Test whether the theoretical predictions about feature absorption and polysemanticity still hold under these conditions.

3. **Anchor Quality Sensitivity:** Generate synthetic datasets where ground truth features have varying degrees of polysemanticity or noise. Test how anchor quality (purity, orthogonality) affects feature anchoring performance, and whether there's a threshold below which anchoring becomes ineffective.
