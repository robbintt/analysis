# IoDResearch: Deep Research on Private Heterogeneous Data via the Internet of Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01553
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01553
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: IoDResearch achieves 82.64 F1 on digital object retrieval, 79.98 accuracy on single-domain QA, and 8.31/8.23 LLM scores for report writing, outperforming RAG and Deep Research baselines.

## Executive Summary
IoDResearch introduces a Deep Research framework that leverages the Internet of Data (IoD) paradigm to enable reliable research on private heterogeneous data. The system transforms raw data into FAIR-compliant Digital Objects enriched with metadata, vector embeddings, and knowledge graphs, supporting multi-granularity retrieval and reasoning. A multi-agent system comprising Planner, Worker, and Reporter teams with integrated checking capabilities delivers superior performance across digital object retrieval, question answering, and scientific report generation tasks. Experiments on a newly created IoD DeepResearch Benchmark demonstrate clear advantages over traditional RAG and single-pass generation approaches, particularly in handling complex cross-domain queries and producing structured research outputs.

## Method Summary
IoDResearch employs a three-layer architecture processing raw heterogeneous data through digital object encapsulation, knowledge refinement, and agentic orchestration. The system uses MinerU to parse data into Digital Objects with persistent DOIs and L2-DOs for document chunks, then enriches these with LLM-generated metadata and extracts atomic knowledge units and knowledge graphs. A multi-agent framework with Planner, Worker, and Reporter teams performs iterative planning, retrieval, and validation to generate reliable answers and structured reports. The approach integrates MCP-wrapped retrieval tools supporting DO-level, chunk-level, and fine-grained search operations, evaluated across three benchmark tasks on a 500+ document multi-domain dataset.

## Key Results
- Digital object retrieval achieves 82.64 F1, outperforming baselines through multi-granularity indexing
- Single-domain question answering reaches 79.98 accuracy, demonstrating strong performance on domain-specific queries
- Cross-domain question answering achieves 59.40 accuracy, revealing challenges in knowledge integration across domains
- Report writing receives 8.31/8.23 LLM scores for single/cross-domain tasks, validated by expert evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Granularity Heterogeneous Graph Indexing
The three-layer representation (Digital Objects, Atomic Knowledge, Knowledge Graphs) enables matching at different semantic granularities, preventing "lost in the middle" issues of long-context RAG. Queries can hit exact facts, relational paths, or broad semantic themes depending on their nature.

### Mechanism 2: Agentic Self-Correction and Iterative Planning
The multi-agent framework with Planner, Worker, and Reporter teams, including a dedicated Checker node, reduces hallucinations and improves report coherence through feedback loops that validate outputs against retrieved context.

### Mechanism 3: LLM-Enhanced Metadata Enrichment
Automatic metadata generation using LLMs bridges vocabulary gaps between user queries and document terminology, significantly boosting retrieval recall compared to manually annotated metadata by extracting implicit information like hypothetical questions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Digital Object Architecture (DOA) & FAIR Principles**: Understanding DOA is essential as IoDResearch builds on IoD paradigm where Digital Objects have persistent identifiers (DOIs), metadata, and standard interfaces ensuring Findability and Interoperability of private data. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between a file path and a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) in the context of data persistence?

- **Atomic Knowledge vs. Knowledge Graphs**: The system separates fine-grained facts (Atomic Knowledge, e.g., "Melting point = 3200K") from relational structures (Knowledge Graphs, e.g., "Material A is used in Process B"). This distinction is key to understanding multi-granularity retrieval logic. Quick check: Would a query asking for a specific numerical value rely on the Knowledge Graph or Atomic Knowledge store?

- **RAGAS Evaluation Framework**: IoDResearch uses RAGAS metrics (Context Precision, Context Recall, etc.) to evaluate Task 2. Understanding these metrics is necessary to interpret experimental results and why IoDResearch claims superiority over baselines like Naive RAG. Quick check: Does a high "Context Precision" score mean the system retrieved all relevant documents, or only that the retrieved documents were mostly relevant?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input (Raw Heterogeneous Data) → MinerU (parsing) → Digital Object Layer (DOI assignment, L2-DO chunking) → Knowledge Refinement Layer (Vector DB, Graph DB, Atomic Store) → Planner (query decomposition) → Worker Team (IoD search tools + reflection) → Reporter Team (Writer + Checker) → Output (Structured Scientific Report / Answer)

- **Critical path**: The Knowledge Refinement Layer. If entity extraction or atomic fact distillation fails here, downstream agents will have poor retrieval material, leading to hallucinations in the final report.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Pre-processing Cost vs. Query Speed (heavy computation during data ingestion makes queries fast but ingestion slow), Complexity vs. Robustness (multi-agent system adds latency and orchestration complexity traded for higher reliability in long-horizon research tasks).

- **Failure signatures**: Cross-domain performance drop (59.40 vs 79.98 accuracy), Graph sparsity preventing multi-hop reasoning, and over-conservatism in the Checker node potentially rejecting correct novel inferences.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run a specific fact query (e.g., "melting point of Ti3SiC2") and trace if it retrieves from Atomic Knowledge store vs. vector store, 2) Ingest a long PDF and verify if a middle-document query correctly resolves to the specific L2-DO chunk, 3) Run report writing task with and without Checker Node to observe factual consistency score differences.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does IoDResearch performance scale when applied to significantly larger datasets (millions of documents) compared to the 500-document benchmark?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The benchmark uses only ~500 documents (~6M tokens); the paper claims IoD enables cross-domain data infrastructures but does not evaluate scalability.
- Why unresolved: Scalability with respect to index size, retrieval latency, and multi-agent coordination remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments reporting retrieval F1, QA accuracy, and latency metrics across datasets of increasing scale (e.g., 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M documents).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can IoDResearch reduce the cross-domain vs. single-domain performance gap, and which components (knowledge graphs, multi-agent planning, or metadata enrichment) drive cross-domain transfer?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Tables show a ~20-point accuracy gap between cross-domain (59.40) and single-domain (79.98) QA.
- Why unresolved: The paper reports the gap but does not isolate its causes or propose targeted improvements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies on cross-domain tasks varying knowledge-graph connectivity, agent planning depth, and metadata richness to measure their individual contributions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is IoDResearch when LLM-based metadata enrichment or knowledge-graph construction introduces noisy or hallucinated extractions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Metadata enrichment and knowledge-graph extraction rely on LLMs, yet no analysis of error propagation or noise tolerance is provided.
- Why unresolved: Errors in metadata or entity/relation extraction could degrade retrieval and reasoning without detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled injection of noise into metadata and knowledge graphs, followed by measurement of retrieval F1 and QA accuracy degradation rates.

## Limitations
- The IoD DeepResearch Benchmark dataset and exact evaluation scripts are not publicly available, making independent validation difficult
- Significant performance degradation in cross-domain scenarios (59.40 accuracy vs. 79.98 for single-domain) suggests limited generalization across knowledge boundaries
- LLM-based metadata enrichment process lacks transparency in prompt design and quality control mechanisms

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Multi-granularity retrieval architecture design, multi-agent workflow structure, basic performance superiority over naive RAG baselines
- **Medium Confidence**: Specific numerical performance claims, effectiveness of knowledge graph indexing, impact of Checker node on hallucination reduction
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability claims to other private data domains, scalability to enterprise-scale datasets, long-term maintenance of knowledge graph consistency

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce Cross-Domain Gap: Independently verify the performance difference between single-domain (79.98) and cross-domain (59.40) question answering by testing on alternative multi-domain datasets
2. Metadata Quality Audit: Sample and evaluate the factual accuracy of LLM-generated metadata to quantify potential noise injection in retrieval
3. Checker Node Ablation Study: Conduct controlled experiments measuring hallucination rates with and without the Checker node across diverse query types to validate its effectiveness
