# SEED: Spectral Entropy-Guided Evaluation of SpatialTemporal Dependencies for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.14718
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14718
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series forecasting, excelling in long-term predictions across multiple domains

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SEED, a novel framework for multivariate time series forecasting that addresses three key challenges: disrupted temporal self-dependencies, ignored negative correlations, and lack of temporal awareness in spatial modeling. The method uses spectral entropy to evaluate each variable's regularity, dynamically balancing between channel-independent and channel-dependent strategies. It introduces a Signed Graph Constructor to preserve negative correlations and a Context Spatial Extractor to model temporal-aware spatial features. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in long-term forecasting tasks across multiple domains.

## Method Summary
SEED addresses multivariate time series forecasting challenges through three core innovations. First, it employs spectral entropy to evaluate variable regularity, dynamically switching between channel-independent and channel-dependent processing strategies. Second, it introduces a Signed Graph Constructor that preserves both positive and negative correlations between variables, unlike traditional methods that only capture positive relationships. Third, it implements a Context Spatial Extractor that models spatial dependencies with temporal awareness, enabling more accurate long-term forecasting. The framework combines these elements within a unified architecture that processes temporal and spatial features simultaneously while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance across 12 real-world multivariate time series datasets
- The framework demonstrates superior performance in long-term forecasting tasks compared to existing methods
- Experimental results show significant improvements in prediction accuracy across multiple domains including energy, traffic, and finance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SEED's effectiveness stems from its holistic approach to addressing fundamental limitations in current multivariate time series forecasting methods. By using spectral entropy to dynamically evaluate variable regularity, the framework can adaptively apply the most appropriate processing strategy for each variable, improving overall prediction accuracy. The Signed Graph Constructor's ability to capture both positive and negative correlations provides a more complete representation of variable relationships, while the Context Spatial Extractor's temporal-aware spatial modeling enables better long-term predictions by considering how spatial relationships evolve over time.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spectral Entropy**: A measure of signal regularity that helps identify stable versus chaotic variables; needed to dynamically adapt processing strategies based on variable characteristics; quick check: compare entropy values across different time series domains
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Used to model variable relationships; needed to capture complex dependencies between multiple time series; quick check: verify graph connectivity patterns match domain knowledge
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Employed for temporal modeling; needed to focus on relevant time steps and capture long-range dependencies; quick check: analyze attention weight distributions for interpretability

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input -> Spectral Entropy Evaluator -> Channel-Independent/Channel-Dependent Selector -> Temporal Extractor -> Signed Graph Constructor -> Context Spatial Extractor -> Output

**Critical Path**: The most important processing sequence is: Input → Spectral Entropy Evaluator → Dynamic Strategy Selection → Temporal Processing → Signed Graph Construction → Context-Aware Spatial Modeling → Forecasting Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances computational efficiency with modeling accuracy by using spectral entropy to avoid unnecessary complex processing for regular variables while maintaining sophisticated modeling for chaotic variables. The Signed Graph Constructor adds complexity but captures crucial negative correlations that traditional methods miss.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when spectral entropy evaluation fails to accurately capture variable regularity, when the signed graph construction cannot properly represent complex multivariate interactions, or when the context spatial extractor cannot effectively model temporal evolution of spatial dependencies.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Ablation study to isolate the impact of spectral entropy-guided variable selection on forecasting performance
2. Comparison of signed versus unsigned graph construction on datasets with known negative correlations
3. Evaluation of temporal-aware spatial modeling versus static spatial modeling on long-term forecasting tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on spectral entropy for variable regularity evaluation may be computationally expensive for very high-dimensional time series
- The Signed Graph Constructor's effectiveness in capturing negative correlations needs further validation in scenarios with complex multivariate interactions
- The Context Spatial Extractor's temporal-aware spatial modeling could face scalability challenges with extremely long time series or high-frequency data

## Confidence
- **State-of-the-art performance claims**: Medium-High
- **Computational efficiency claims**: Medium
- **Scalability to high-dimensional data**: Low-Medium
- **Robustness to noise and missing data**: Not extensively evaluated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of spectral entropy-guided variable selection, Signed Graph Constructor, and Context Spatial Extractor on forecasting performance
2. Evaluate SEED's performance on extremely high-dimensional time series datasets (e.g., 1000+ variables) to assess scalability and computational efficiency
3. Test the framework's robustness to varying levels of noise and different types of missing data patterns to determine its practical applicability in real-world scenarios
