core_contribution: AQUAH automates end-to-end hydrologic modeling using vision-enabled
  LLMs to process Earth observation data, configure the CREST model, and generate
  analyst-ready reports from natural language prompts. The system autonomously retrieves
  terrain, forcing, and gauge data; selects optimal outlets via visual reasoning;
  initializes parameters using retrieval-augmented generation; runs simulations; and
  produces publication-quality PDFs without manual intervention.

# AQUAH: Automatic Quantification and Unified Agent in Hydrology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.02936
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02936
- Reference count: 32
- Automates hydrologic modeling from EO data using vision-enabled LLMs

## Executive Summary
AQUAH is an autonomous hydrologic modeling system that transforms natural language prompts into complete CREST model simulations and publication-ready reports. By integrating vision-enabled large language models with Earth observation data processing, the system can automatically retrieve terrain, forcing, and gauge data, configure hydrologic models, and generate analyst-ready reports without manual intervention. The system achieves physically plausible results comparable to expert calibration while dramatically reducing the expertise and time required for hydrologic analysis.

## Method Summary
AQUAH operates through an autonomous workflow that begins with natural language prompts, retrieves relevant geospatial data through API calls, and employs vision models for geospatial reasoning tasks like outlet selection. The system uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to initialize CREST model parameters based on historical data, then runs simulations and produces comprehensive PDF reports. The architecture leverages multimodal capabilities of modern LLMs to process both textual instructions and visual geographic data, enabling end-to-end automation of traditionally manual hydrologic modeling tasks.

## Key Results
- Automated reports scored 7.01/10 average across four quality axes in benchmark tests
- Claude-4 Opus achieved highest performance among tested LLM agents
- Vision-driven outlet selection produces physically plausible results comparable to expert calibration
- Successfully automates entire workflow from data retrieval to report generation without human intervention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages vision-enabled LLMs to perform geospatial reasoning tasks that traditionally required expert domain knowledge. By combining multimodal processing with RAG-based parameter initialization, AQUAH can interpret natural language prompts, understand geographic contexts from imagery, and apply appropriate hydrologic principles automatically. The integration of EO data streams with LLM capabilities enables autonomous decision-making throughout the modeling pipeline.

## Foundational Learning

- **EO Data Processing**: Satellite imagery and geospatial data handling - needed for automated data retrieval; quick check: can interpret common satellite data formats and resolutions
- **Vision Model Integration**: Using vision models for geospatial analysis - needed for automated outlet selection; quick check: can validate visual reasoning outputs against known geographic features
- **RAG Parameterization**: Retrieval-augmented generation for model configuration - needed for automated parameter initialization; quick check: can assess parameter plausibility against historical records
- **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Effective natural language instruction design - needed for reliable system operation; quick check: can formulate prompts that yield consistent, accurate responses

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Natural Language Prompt -> Data Retrieval -> Vision Analysis -> RAG Parameterization -> CREST Simulation -> Report Generation

**Critical Path**
The most time-sensitive path is Data Retrieval -> Vision Analysis -> RAG Parameterization, as these sequential steps must complete before simulation can begin. Any delays in API responses or vision model processing directly impact total workflow time.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The system trades computational resources for automation, requiring significant processing power for vision models and LLM operations. While this increases operational costs compared to manual modeling, it dramatically reduces expertise barriers and time requirements. The choice of CREST model provides physical realism but limits flexibility compared to more configurable alternatives.

**Failure Signatures**
Common failure modes include API rate limiting during data retrieval, vision model misinterpretation of geographic features leading to incorrect outlet selection, and RAG parameter initialization producing physically unrealistic values. These typically manifest as incomplete reports, simulation crashes, or implausible hydrologic results.

**First Experiments**
1. Test system with simple prompt on single basin to verify end-to-end functionality
2. Validate vision model's outlet selection accuracy against known good outlets
3. Compare RAG-generated parameters with expert-calibrated values for baseline assessment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to ungauged or data-scarce regions remains unproven
- Reliance on high-quality EO data streams may limit applicability in regions with sparse observational networks
- Evaluation metrics are inherently subjective and may not fully capture technical accuracy

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Technical feasibility of integrating vision models with LLMs for geospatial reasoning and parameter configuration
- **Medium Confidence**: Comparative performance across different LLM agents and sensitivity to prompt engineering variations
- **Low Confidence**: Long-term reliability under changing climate regimes and adaptability to non-U.S. basins

## Next Checks
1. Apply AQUAH to 10-15 basins outside the USGS HydroAtlas benchmark to assess robustness
2. Simulate performance during extreme weather events to evaluate parameter stability
3. Deploy in collaborative setting with hydrologists to gather qualitative feedback on workflow efficiency
