# A synthetic dataset of French electric load curves with temperature conditioning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.14046
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14046
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Synthetic French residential load curves at 30-min resolution conditioned on temperature, with high fidelity, utility, and privacy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a conditional latent diffusion model for generating synthetic French residential electricity load curves at 30-minute resolution, conditioned on outdoor temperature, contracted power, and time-of-use pricing plans. The model extends standard diffusion with cross-attention mechanisms to handle both static (e.g., contracted power) and time-varying (e.g., temperature) exogenous variables. Trained on 17,000 one-year load curves from 94 French departments, the synthetic data achieves discriminative scores close to zero (0.037 vs 0.357 for TimeGAN), strong utility in load forecasting and classification tasks (near-equivalent to real data), and robust privacy protection (MIA attacks close to random at 0.2% TPR at 0.1% FPR). The dataset is released publicly and supports energy modeling applications under GDPR constraints.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a conditional latent diffusion model that generates synthetic electricity load curves conditioned on temperature, contracted power, and time-of-use pricing. The model extends standard diffusion with cross-attention mechanisms to handle both static and time-varying exogenous variables. It is trained on 17,000 one-year residential load curves from 94 French departments at 30-minute resolution. The diffusion process is conditioned on temperature profiles, contracted power levels, and TOU plans to generate realistic synthetic load curves that preserve statistical properties while ensuring privacy.

## Key Results
- Discriminative scores close to zero (0.037 vs 0.357 for TimeGAN), indicating high fidelity
- Near-equivalent utility in load forecasting and classification tasks compared to real data
- Robust privacy with MIA attacks close to random at 0.2% TPR at 0.1% FPR

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The conditional latent diffusion model works by extending standard diffusion with cross-attention mechanisms that can handle both static (e.g., contracted power) and time-varying (e.g., temperature) exogenous variables. During training, the model learns to denoise corrupted load curves while conditioning on temperature profiles, contracted power levels, and TOU plans. This conditioning allows the model to capture the complex relationships between temperature and electricity consumption patterns. The latent space representation helps compress the temporal information while maintaining key statistical properties, and the cross-attention mechanism ensures that exogenous variables are properly integrated throughout the denoising process.

## Foundational Learning
- Latent diffusion models: Why needed - to generate high-quality time series while handling the high dimensionality of load curves; Quick check - verify the model can reconstruct training data after denoising
- Cross-attention mechanisms: Why needed - to properly integrate both static and time-varying conditioning variables; Quick check - ensure conditioning variables meaningfully affect generated samples
- Temperature-conditioning for load forecasting: Why needed - temperature is a primary driver of residential electricity consumption; Quick check - validate correlation between generated loads and input temperature profiles
- Time-of-use pricing impact: Why needed - TOU plans significantly affect consumption patterns; Quick check - verify generated loads reflect different TOU plan characteristics
- Privacy-preserving synthetic data: Why needed - to enable data sharing under GDPR while maintaining utility; Quick check - membership inference attack performance
- Load curve disaggregation: Why needed - to understand individual appliance consumption patterns; Quick check - validate disaggregation accuracy against ground truth

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Temperature/Contracted Power/TOU -> Cross-Attention -> Latent Diffusion -> Synthetic Load Curve

Critical path: Conditioning variables → Cross-attention layers → U-Net denoising blocks → Output layer

Design tradeoffs: The model balances between fidelity (realistic-looking curves), utility (preserving statistical properties for forecasting), and privacy (protecting individual data). Using latent space reduces computational complexity but may lose fine-grained temporal details. Cross-attention allows flexible conditioning but increases model complexity.

Failure signatures: Poor conditioning variable integration leads to temperature-insensitive synthetic loads; overfitting shows up as unrealistic peak loads; privacy failures manifest as successful membership inference attacks; utility failures appear as degraded forecasting performance.

First experiments:
1. Generate synthetic loads using only temperature conditioning and compare to real data correlations
2. Test conditioning on contracted power alone to verify static variable integration
3. Evaluate cross-attention effectiveness by comparing with models using only concatenation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly mentioned in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Generalizability to regions outside France and non-residential load profiles is uncertain
- Training data covers only 17,000 one-year curves, potentially missing extreme weather events
- Evaluation focuses on discriminative accuracy and utility but lacks testing under diverse climate change scenarios

## Confidence
High: Model's ability to generate realistic synthetic load curves conditioned on temperature, contracted power, and TOU plans, given strong discriminative scores and near-equivalent utility in forecasting and classification tasks.

Medium: Privacy guarantees, as MIA results show good protection but are based on limited attacks.

Low: Claims about dataset's utility in long-term energy system planning, as this was not explicitly tested.

## Next Checks
1. Test synthetic data generation under extreme temperature scenarios (heatwaves, cold snaps) not present in training data to assess robustness.
2. Evaluate synthetic data performance in multi-year energy system optimization models to verify utility beyond short-term forecasting.
3. Conduct additional privacy assessments using different attack models and larger-scale membership inference to further validate claimed privacy guarantees.
