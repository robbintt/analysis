# Model management to support systems engineering workflows using ontology-based knowledge graphs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.09596
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09596
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Framework using ontologies and knowledge graphs to manage system engineering workflows, artifacts, and their relationships, demonstrated on a drivetrain smart sensor case study.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for managing models and artifacts in systems engineering workflows using ontologies and knowledge graphs. The core idea is to formally define workflows, their related artifacts, and their relationships using the Ontology Modeling Language (OML), enabling versioning, querying, and reasoning on stored data. The framework includes tools for designing workflows, enacting them, and storing artifacts in a federated knowledge graph infrastructure. Applied to a drivetrain smart sensor system case study, the framework demonstrates improvements in storage, versioning, and information access, addressing challenges like artifact management, traceability, and repeatability in complex engineering workflows.

## Method Summary
The framework leverages ontologies and knowledge graphs to manage system engineering workflows and artifacts. Workflows and artifacts are formally defined using OML, then transformed into OWL/RDF and stored in a Fuseki SPARQL server. The Workflow Enactment Engine (WEE) executes FTG+PM models, recording event traces directly to Fuseki. Federation Services (Spendpoint) enable cross-domain querying. The framework was applied to a drivetrain smart sensor case study, demonstrating the ability to trace artifacts through the workflow, infer new knowledge, and improve information retrieval. Key components include Rosetta IDE for OML, adaptors for parsing source files, and SHACL for consistency checks.

## Key Results
- Framework enables fine-grained traceability and repeatability of system engineering workflows.
- Demonstrated reduction in information retrieval time (~2 weeks saved) in drivetrain case study.
- Successfully integrated Federation Services for cross-domain querying of artifacts.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by formally representing workflows and artifacts as ontologies, enabling structured storage, versioning, and querying. By transforming domain-specific formats (e.g., CBD, Draw.io) into OML, then into RDF/OWL, the system leverages SPARQL and SHACL for reasoning and consistency checks. Federation Services allow querying across heterogeneous data sources, enhancing traceability and knowledge inference.

## Foundational Learning
- **OML (Ontology Modeling Language):** Used to formally define workflows and artifacts. *Why needed:* Provides a structured, machine-readable way to represent engineering concepts. *Quick check:* Can you create a simple OML description of a workflow step?
- **RDF/OWL:** Semantic web standards for representing and reasoning about data. *Why needed:* Enables integration with SPARQL servers and reasoning engines. *Quick check:* Can you convert an OML file to OWL/RDF using the provided tools?
- **SPARQL:** Query language for RDF data. *Why needed:* Allows complex queries across stored artifacts and workflows. *Quick check:* Can you write a SPARQL query to retrieve all artifacts related to a specific workflow activity?
- **Federation Services (Spendpoint):** Middleware for cross-domain querying. *Why needed:* Enables querying across distributed data sources. *Quick check:* Can you configure a local Spendpoint service and execute a federated query?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Rosetta IDE -> OML Descriptions -> Adaptors (Python/Jinja2) -> OWL/RDF -> Fuseki SPARQL Server <- WEE (Workflow Enactment Engine) <- FTG+PM Models

**Critical Path**
Design workflow in Rosetta -> Parse artifacts with adaptors -> Convert OML to OWL/RDF -> Load into Fuseki -> Enact workflow with WEE -> Query and reason with SPARQL/SHACL

**Design Tradeoffs**
- OML lacks built-in versioning, requiring full data duplication for each version (not scalable).
- Translation from OML to OWL/RDF breaks abstraction, leading to cryptic error messages.
- Federation Services add complexity but enable cross-domain querying.

**Failure Signatures**
- OML conversion fails due to non-conformance with vocabularies.
- SPARQL queries hang or return empty results due to misconfigured Federation Services.
- WEE fails to record process traces if the FTG+PM model is invalid.

**First Experiments**
1. Install Rosetta IDE and Jena Fuseki, then run the mass-spring-damper example through the complete OML → OWL → RDF pipeline.
2. Deploy the WEE web application and execute a simple FTG+PM process model to generate a process trace.
3. Set up a local Spendpoint service and verify federated SPARQL queries across two data sources.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can a scalable, queryable versioning system be integrated into the RDF/SPARQL architecture to replace the "poor man's" full-copy approach?
- Can the framework be effectively applied to a complete system development lifecycle?
- Can a native reasoner and query language be developed to operate directly on OML?

## Limitations
- Current versioning method duplicates data for every version, not scalable.
- Framework not yet applied to full system development lifecycle, only experimentation phase.
- OML lacks native reasoner and query language, requiring translation to OWL/RDF.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The conceptual framework for ontology-based workflow management and artifact versioning is clearly articulated and supported by the methodology description.
- **Medium Confidence:** The transformation pipeline from domain-specific formats to RDF/OWL and the SPARQL querying capabilities are reproducible with access to the Rosetta tooling and vocabulary definitions.
- **Low Confidence:** The integration of Federation Services for cross-domain querying and the full execution of the drivetrain smart sensor case study are difficult to replicate without access to the specific middleware setup and case study data.

## Next Checks
1. **Environment Setup Validation:** Install Rosetta IDE, Jena Fuseki, and the referenced adaptor services. Attempt to run the mass-spring-damper example through the complete OML → OWL → RDF pipeline to verify tooling compatibility.
2. **Federation Services Integration Test:** Set up a local Spendpoint service and verify that SPARQL queries with the SERVICE keyword can be correctly routed and resolved across a federated data source.
3. **Case Study Reconstruction:** Recreate the drivetrain workflow scenario using synthetic or placeholder data for the kinematic estimator, torque profiles, and sensor logs, then validate the ability to trace artifacts through the workflow using SPARQL queries.
