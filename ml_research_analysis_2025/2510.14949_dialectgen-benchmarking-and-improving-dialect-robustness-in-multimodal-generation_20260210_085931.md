# DialectGen: Benchmarking and Improving Dialect Robustness in Multimodal Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.14949
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14949
- Reference count: 21
- 48.17% performance drops observed when dialect words are used in multimodal generation

## Executive Summary
DialectGen addresses a critical gap in multimodal generation by benchmarking dialect robustness across image and video models. The benchmark evaluates six English dialects with over 4,200 validated prompt pairs, revealing substantial performance degradation when dialectal variations are introduced. Current mitigation strategies like fine-tuning and prompt rewriting show limited effectiveness, improving dialect performance by less than 7% while harming standard American English (SAE) outputs. The authors introduce a novel encoder-based method that teaches text encoders to recognize dialect features while preserving SAE performance, achieving near-SAE dialect accuracy with minimal performance trade-offs.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed DialectGen, a large-scale benchmark evaluating dialect robustness in multimodal generation systems. The benchmark spans six English dialects and contains over 4,200 validated prompts paired with Standard American English equivalents. To address the performance gap, they developed a general encoder-based method that trains text encoders to recognize dialect features while maintaining SAE performance. This approach was applied to Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL models, demonstrating significant improvements in dialect generation accuracy without substantial degradation of SAE outputs.

## Key Results
- Performance drops up to 48.17% when single dialect words are used versus SAE equivalents
- Fine-tuning and prompt rewriting improve dialect performance by less than 7% while harming SAE performance
- Encoder-based method raises dialect performance to SAE parity (+34.4%) with near-zero SAE performance cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The encoder-based method works by explicitly teaching text encoders to recognize and appropriately handle dialectal features during the encoding process. By training the encoder to distinguish between SAE and dialectal inputs while maintaining the ability to produce high-quality SAE outputs, the model develops a more robust understanding of linguistic variation. This approach differs from traditional fine-tuning by focusing on the text encoding stage rather than modifying the entire generation pipeline, allowing for better preservation of SAE performance while improving dialect handling.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dialectal variation in language models**: Understanding how linguistic variations affect model performance - needed to identify the scope of the robustness problem
- **Multimodal generation pipeline**: Knowledge of how text encoders interact with visual generation components - needed to identify where interventions are most effective
- **Encoder-decoder architecture**: Understanding the separation between text processing and image generation - needed to develop targeted solutions
- **Benchmark construction methodology**: Principles for creating validated prompt pairs - needed to ensure reliable evaluation
- **Performance trade-off analysis**: Techniques for measuring and minimizing performance degradation across different linguistic variants

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Text Encoder -> Dialect Recognition Module -> Generation Decoder -> Output
**Critical Path**: The text encoding stage is the critical intervention point, as dialect recognition must occur before image generation begins
**Design Tradeoffs**: The method prioritizes SAE performance preservation over maximum dialect improvement, accepting moderate dialect gains to avoid degrading standard outputs
**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation manifests as semantic misalignment between dialect inputs and generated outputs, with up to 48.17% accuracy drops
**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Validate dialect recognition accuracy across all six dialects using held-out test sets
2. Measure SAE performance degradation when dialect recognition is activated
3. Compare generation quality metrics between encoder-based method and traditional fine-tuning approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dialect coverage limited to only six English dialects, restricting generalizability to other languages and dialect families
- Encoder-based mitigation tested only on diffusion models (SD 1.5 and SDXL), leaving effectiveness on other architectures uncertain
- Current mitigation approaches show fundamental limitations with only 7% improvement ceiling for traditional methods

## Confidence
- Dialect Coverage Limitation: Medium
- Model Architecture Dependency: Low
- Performance Trade-offs Assessment: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the encoder-based dialect recognition method on non-diffusion architectures including large language models and video generation models to assess architectural generalizability
2. Expand dialect coverage to include non-English languages and regional variants to evaluate cross-linguistic robustness
3. Conduct longitudinal studies measuring performance stability across multiple training epochs and varying dataset sizes to assess scalability limits
