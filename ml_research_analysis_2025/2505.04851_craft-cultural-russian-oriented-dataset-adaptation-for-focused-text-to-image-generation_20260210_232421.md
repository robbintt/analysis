# CRAFT: Cultural Russian-Oriented Dataset Adaptation for Focused Text-to-Image Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.04851
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04851
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fine-tuned Kandinsky 3.1 on Russian cultural dataset shows competitive performance against DALL-E 3 for culturally-specific prompts

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the cultural awareness gap in text-to-image generation models, which often struggle to accurately represent non-Western cultural elements due to dataset biases. The authors propose CRAFT, a methodology for collecting and processing high-quality, culturally-specific data to improve model understanding of Russian cultural concepts. They manually curated a dataset of ~200K text-image pairs covering 17 categories of Russian cultural code, including famous personalities, literature, cuisine, and traditions. After filtering and captioning the data, they fine-tuned Kandinsky 3.1, resulting in significantly improved generation quality for Russian cultural prompts. Human evaluation showed competitive performance against leading models like DALL-E 3, with marked improvement over previous versions.

## Method Summary
The authors developed CRAFT (Cultural Russian-Oriented Dataset Adaptation) by first collecting a large corpus of Russian cultural content from public sources including Wikipedia, VK, and Reddit. They then manually curated ~200K text-image pairs across 17 categories representing Russian cultural code. The dataset underwent filtering to remove low-quality and inappropriate content, followed by automated captioning and post-processing to enhance text descriptions. The curated dataset was used to fine-tune Kandinsky 3.1, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. The approach focuses on targeted cultural adaptation rather than full model retraining, enabling efficient improvement in cultural representation.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Kandinsky 3.1 on CRAFT dataset showed competitive performance against DALL-E 3 for Russian cultural prompts
- Human evaluation confirmed significant improvement in cultural authenticity and prompt alignment compared to baseline Kandinsky 3.1
- Model demonstrated enhanced ability to generate culturally specific concepts like traditional Russian cuisine, folklore, and historical figures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by directly addressing the cultural bias inherent in mainstream text-to-image datasets, which are predominantly Western-centric. By curating a high-quality, culturally-specific dataset covering Russian cultural concepts, the fine-tuning process allows the model to learn the semantic associations and visual representations unique to Russian culture. The manual curation ensures data quality and cultural accuracy, while the comprehensive coverage across 17 categories provides diverse training signals. This targeted adaptation improves the model's cultural understanding without requiring full retraining, making it an efficient approach to enhancing cultural relevance.

## Foundational Learning
- Cultural bias in AI models: Western-centric training data leads to poor representation of non-Western concepts
  - Why needed: Explains the motivation for cultural adaptation in text-to-image generation
  - Quick check: Compare model performance on Western vs. non-Western cultural prompts

- Fine-tuning vs. full retraining: Efficient adaptation of pre-trained models through targeted dataset curation
  - Why needed: Justifies the methodology choice and resource efficiency
  - Quick check: Compare performance gains from fine-tuning vs. computational cost

- Cultural code concepts: Systematic categorization of cultural elements (personalities, traditions, cuisine, etc.)
  - Why needed: Provides framework for comprehensive cultural dataset construction
  - Quick check: Verify category coverage and cultural relevance through expert review

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Kandinsky 3.1 (pre-trained) -> CRAFT Dataset (curated Russian cultural data) -> Fine-tuning process -> Improved cultural representation

Critical Path:
Data collection and curation → Dataset filtering and captioning → Fine-tuning Kandinsky 3.1 → Human evaluation of cultural authenticity

Design Tradeoffs:
- Manual curation ensures quality but limits scalability
- Focused cultural adaptation improves specific performance but may not generalize to other cultures
- Fine-tuning is computationally efficient but may not fully overcome dataset bias

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance on Russian cultural prompts indicates insufficient fine-tuning or dataset coverage
- Cultural inaccuracies suggest annotation errors or inadequate representation in training data
- Overfitting to Russian concepts may manifest as reduced performance on general prompts

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline Kandinsky 3.1 on Russian cultural prompts to establish performance gap
2. Test fine-tuned model on held-out Russian cultural prompts to measure improvement
3. Compare cultural authenticity scores between fine-tuned model and DALL-E 3 on shared prompt set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relatively small dataset size (~200K) compared to typical large-scale pretraining corpora may limit generalization
- Manual curation process introduces potential subjectivity in category selection and annotation
- Evaluation relies heavily on human judgment for cultural authenticity, which may not capture technical generation quality

## Confidence
High: Cultural bias exists in text-to-image models; methodology for Russian cultural data collection is sound
Medium: Quantitative evaluation results and relative performance improvements are valid but limited in scope
Low: Broader claims about methodology's generalizability across different cultural contexts without additional validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-cultural evaluation by testing the fine-tuned model on non-Russian cultural prompts to assess generalization limits
2. Perform ablation studies varying dataset size and category composition to determine minimum effective training data requirements
3. Implement automated metrics for cultural authenticity evaluation alongside human judgment to enable larger-scale benchmarking and reproducibility
