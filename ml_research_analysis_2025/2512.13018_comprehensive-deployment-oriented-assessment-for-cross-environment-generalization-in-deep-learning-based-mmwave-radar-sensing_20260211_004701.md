# Comprehensive Deployment-Oriented Assessment for Cross-Environment Generalization in Deep Learning-Based mmWave Radar Sensing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13018
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13018
- Authors: Tomoya Tanaka; Tomonori Ikeda; Ryo Yonemoto
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: Amplitude-based weighting preprocessing and transfer learning enable robust cross-environment generalization in mmWave radar people counting

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the critical challenge of spatial generalization in deep learning-based mmWave radar sensing for indoor people counting applications. The research presents a comprehensive evaluation of preprocessing techniques, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning approaches for cross-environment adaptation. Through systematic experimentation across multiple datasets collected from different spatial configurations, the authors demonstrate that amplitude-based weighting preprocessing combined with transfer learning creates a robust framework for maintaining accurate performance when deploying radar sensing systems across diverse environments.

The proposed methodology achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, with the sigmoid-based amplitude weighting preprocessing reducing root mean squared error by 50.1% and mean absolute error by 55.2% compared to baseline methods in cross-environment testing. Transfer learning proves essential for handling large spatial shifts, achieving 82.1% and 91.3% reductions in RMSE and MAE respectively with only 540 target-domain samples. These findings establish practical guidelines for developing deployable radar sensing systems that maintain robust accuracy across varying environmental conditions.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comprehensive experimental framework evaluating three key approaches for cross-environment generalization: preprocessing techniques, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning. Preprocessing methods include amplitude-based weighting with sigmoid functions and filtering techniques. Data augmentation employs Mixup and CutMix strategies to generate synthetic training samples. Transfer learning involves fine-tuning models pretrained on source-domain data using limited target-domain samples. The evaluation spans multiple datasets collected from different spatial configurations to assess cross-environment performance, with metrics including RMSE and MAE for people counting accuracy.

## Key Results
- Sigmoid-based amplitude weighting preprocessing achieved 50.1% RMSE and 55.2% MAE reduction in cross-environment testing
- Transfer learning with 540 target-domain samples achieved 82.1% RMSE and 91.3% MAE reductions for large spatial shifts
- Data augmentation provided up to 8.8% MAE improvement when combined with preprocessing and transfer learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of the proposed approach stems from the combination of amplitude-based preprocessing that emphasizes informative radar features and transfer learning that adapts to domain-specific characteristics. The sigmoid-based weighting function effectively normalizes and emphasizes relevant signal components while suppressing noise, creating more robust feature representations. Transfer learning leverages knowledge from the source domain while fine-tuning to capture the specific characteristics of the target environment with minimal additional training data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-environment generalization**: Critical for deploying ML models across varying physical conditions and spatial configurations
- **Amplitude-based preprocessing**: Normalizes and enhances signal features to improve model robustness to environmental variations
- **Data augmentation**: Synthetic sample generation helps models generalize beyond training distribution
- **Transfer learning**: Enables rapid adaptation to new environments with limited target-domain data
- **mmWave radar signal processing**: Understanding how radar signals vary across different spatial configurations
- **Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE)**: Quantitative measures for assessing prediction accuracy in regression tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Transfer Learning -> Evaluation
**Critical Path**: Amplitude weighting preprocessing → Base model training → Fine-tuning with target samples → Cross-environment evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Preprocessing complexity vs. performance gain
- Augmentation diversity vs. computational cost
- Transfer learning sample size vs. adaptation accuracy
- Model complexity vs. deployment efficiency

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor preprocessing leads to feature noise and inconsistent predictions
- Insufficient target samples cause incomplete transfer learning adaptation
- Over-aggressive augmentation creates unrealistic training samples

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline model performance comparison across source and target environments
2. Individual preprocessing technique evaluation on cross-environment accuracy
3. Transfer learning effectiveness with varying numbers of target-domain samples

## Limitations
- Findings primarily limited to controlled indoor environments with people counting tasks
- Evaluation focuses on relatively small spatial shifts that may not capture full real-world complexity
- Dataset scale (5,395 training samples) may not represent full variability of deployment scenarios
- Computational costs constrain exploration of more extensive augmentation techniques

## Confidence
**High Confidence Claims**:
- Sigmoid-based amplitude weighting preprocessing demonstrates consistent cross-environment performance improvements
- Transfer learning with 540 target-domain samples achieves significant error reductions for large spatial shifts

**Medium Confidence Claims**:
- Data augmentation provides measurable but modest benefits for cross-environment generalization
- Integration of amplitude-based preprocessing with transfer learning creates robust deployment framework

**Low Confidence Claims**:
- Generalizability to outdoor environments or different sensing tasks beyond people counting
- Optimal balance between augmentation strategies and transfer learning effectiveness across diverse scenarios

## Next Checks
