# PromptTailor: Multi-turn Intent-Aligned Prompt Synthesis for Lightweight LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21725
- Reference count: 40
- Lightweight system that generates high-quality prompts from user intent with only three model calls

## Executive Summary
PromptTailor is a lightweight system that generates high-quality prompts from user intent by fine-tuning a quantized Llama3-8B model with a LoRA adapter on 12,300 synthetic dialogues. It uses a novel "capabilities" mechanism to ensure prompts align with user intent while leaving room for optimization. The system requires only three model calls, compared to nine for state-of-the-art methods, and outperforms chain-of-thought prompting while matching or surpassing other optimization techniques in human and LLM-based evaluations.

## Method Summary
PromptTailor generates high-quality prompts from user intent by fine-tuning a quantized Llama3-8B model with a LoRA adapter on 12,300 synthetic dialogues. The system uses a novel "capabilities" mechanism to ensure prompts align with user intent while leaving room for optimization. The approach requires only three model calls, compared to nine for state-of-the-art methods, and is evaluated against chain-of-thought prompting and other optimization techniques.

## Key Results
- Requires only three model calls versus nine for state-of-the-art methods
- Outperforms chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses other optimization techniques
- Human preference scores show improvement over baseline prompts (3.8-3.9 rating scale)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PromptTailor works by using a compact student model (quantized Llama3-8B with LoRA fine-tuning) guided by powerful teacher models to generate optimized prompts. The "capabilities" mechanism ensures prompts align with user intent while maintaining flexibility for optimization. The system's efficiency comes from reducing the number of required model calls from nine to three, making it practical for real-world deployment.

## Foundational Learning
- **Quantized LLMs**: Reduced precision models for efficiency - needed to make Llama3-8B lightweight enough for rapid deployment
- **LoRA fine-tuning**: Parameter-efficient adaptation technique - allows quick customization without full model retraining
- **Synthetic dialogue generation**: Automated dataset creation - enables scaling to 12,300 examples without manual annotation
- **Prompt optimization**: Iterative refinement of input instructions - critical for improving LLM output quality
- **Capabilities mechanism**: Intent alignment framework - ensures generated prompts match user goals while allowing optimization flexibility
- **Cross-model evaluation**: Testing performance across different LLM architectures - validates generalizability beyond single model families

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: User Intent -> Capabilities Parser -> Prompt Generator (Llama3-8B + LoRA) -> Output Refinement -> Optimized Prompt

**Critical path**: User intent is parsed through the capabilities mechanism, passed to the fine-tuned prompt generator, and refined into an optimized prompt ready for deployment

**Design tradeoffs**: Prioritized efficiency (3 model calls vs 9) over maximum possible optimization quality, chose lightweight fine-tuning over full model training, used synthetic data over expensive human annotation

**Failure signatures**: Prompts may lose alignment with complex intents, efficiency gains might diminish on edge devices with limited compute, synthetic training data may not cover all real-world use cases

**First experiments to run**:
1. Test PromptTailor on domain-specific datasets (legal, medical, technical) to assess capability generalization
2. Conduct large-scale A/B tests with real users to validate human preference metrics in production environments
3. Evaluate computational overhead and latency in cloud vs edge deployments to quantify practical efficiency gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Human preference scores (3.8-3.9) indicate improvement over baseline prompts but reveal persistent quality gaps
- Synthetic dialogue dataset size (12,300 examples) may limit coverage of complex, nuanced intents
- Long-tail failure modes in diverse domains are unexplored

## Confidence
- Efficiency gains over SoTA (3 vs 9 model calls): **High**
- Human preference improvements over baseline prompts: **Medium**
- "Capabilities" mechanism ensuring robust intent alignment: **Medium**
- Cross-model benefits for weaker LLMs: **Medium**
- Long-term stability and generalizability: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Test PromptTailor on domain-specific datasets (legal, medical, technical) to assess capability generalization beyond synthetic dialogues
2. Conduct large-scale A/B tests with real users to validate human preference metrics in production environments
3. Evaluate computational overhead and latency in cloud vs edge deployments to quantify practical efficiency gains
