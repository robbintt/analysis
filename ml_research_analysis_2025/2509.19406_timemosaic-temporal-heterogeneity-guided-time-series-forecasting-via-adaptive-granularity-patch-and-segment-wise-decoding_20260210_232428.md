# TimeMosaic: Temporal Heterogeneity Guided Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Granularity Patch and Segment-wise Decoding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.19406
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19406
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves state-of-the-art long-term forecasting and competitive short-term performance across 9 real-world datasets

## Executive Summary
TimeMosaic addresses temporal heterogeneity in multivariate time series forecasting through a dual-adaptive framework. The method tackles input-side variability by employing adaptive patch embedding that dynamically adjusts granularity based on local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity. For output-side asymmetry, it uses segment-wise prompt tuning to treat each prediction segment as a related subtask, enabling horizon-specific specialization. Evaluated across 9 real-world datasets with unified experimental settings, TimeMosaic demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting while maintaining competitive results in short-term tasks. The framework also scales effectively to large pretraining settings, delivering performance comparable to time series foundation models while maintaining moderate model size and efficient inference.

## Method Summary
TimeMosaic introduces a novel forecasting framework that addresses two forms of temporal heterogeneity in multivariate time series: input-side variability in local information density and output-side asymmetry in prediction horizons. The method employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity based on local complexity, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity. This allows the model to capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader temporal structures. Additionally, segment-wise prompt tuning treats each prediction segment as a related subtask, enabling horizon-specific specialization that improves forecast accuracy across different prediction horizons. The framework was evaluated on 9 real-world datasets with unified experimental settings, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting and competitive results in short-term tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-term time series forecasting across 9 real-world datasets
- Demonstrates competitive results in short-term forecasting tasks while maintaining efficiency
- Scales effectively to large pretraining settings, delivering performance comparable to time series foundation models with moderate model size

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TimeMosaic works by addressing the fundamental challenge of temporal heterogeneity in time series data. The adaptive patch embedding mechanism dynamically adjusts the granularity of temporal analysis based on local information density, allowing the model to capture both detailed local patterns and broader structural trends. This adaptive approach prevents the loss of critical information that occurs with fixed granularity methods. The segment-wise prompt tuning component treats each prediction horizon as a related but distinct subtask, enabling the model to specialize its forecasting approach for different temporal scales. This dual-adaptation strategy allows TimeMosaic to handle the complex, non-uniform temporal patterns present in real-world time series data more effectively than traditional fixed-granularity approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Adaptive Patch Embedding**
- *Why needed*: Fixed granularity approaches struggle with varying information density across time series, leading to either loss of detail or excessive noise.
- *Quick check*: Verify that the adaptive mechanism correctly identifies and adjusts to local complexity patterns in benchmark datasets.

**Segment-wise Prompt Tuning**
- *Why needed*: Different prediction horizons require different modeling approaches, but traditional methods treat all horizons uniformly.
- *Quick check*: Compare forecast accuracy across different horizons when using segment-wise versus uniform prompt tuning.

**Temporal Heterogeneity**
- *Why needed*: Real-world time series exhibit varying information density and pattern scales that must be addressed for accurate forecasting.
- *Quick check*: Analyze model performance on synthetic datasets with controlled heterogeneity patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input Time Series -> Adaptive Patch Embedding -> Temporal Encoder -> Segment-wise Prompt Tuning -> Output Predictor

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows from input time series through adaptive patch embedding, where granularity is dynamically determined based on local information density. This is followed by temporal encoding to capture temporal dependencies, then segment-wise prompt tuning for horizon-specific specialization, and finally the output predictor that generates forecasts.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework balances computational efficiency with forecasting accuracy by dynamically adjusting granularity rather than using fixed approaches. While adaptive methods add computational overhead, they provide significant accuracy gains, particularly for long-term forecasting. The segment-wise approach increases model complexity but enables horizon-specific optimization that improves overall performance.

**Failure Signatures**
Potential failure modes include over-adaptation leading to excessive granularity changes that lose temporal coherence, and insufficient adaptation that fails to capture critical local patterns. The segment-wise approach may also struggle with extremely short prediction horizons where horizon-specific specialization provides minimal benefit.

**First Experiments**
1. Test adaptive patch embedding on synthetic datasets with known complexity patterns to verify granularity adjustment behavior.
2. Compare segment-wise prompt tuning against uniform tuning across different horizon lengths to quantify specialization benefits.
3. Evaluate model performance on datasets with varying levels of temporal heterogeneity to assess robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on nine real-world datasets without extensive ablation studies to isolate component contributions
- Claims of "state-of-the-art performance" lack detailed statistical significance testing across benchmarks
- Comparison with established foundation models appears limited in scope and doesn't fully characterize performance trade-offs across diverse temporal patterns

## Confidence

- **Adaptive patch embedding effectiveness**: Medium confidence
- **Segment-wise prompt tuning benefits**: Medium confidence
- **State-of-the-art long-term forecasting performance**: Medium confidence
- **Scalability to foundation model settings**: High confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies that systematically disable or modify the adaptive patch embedding and segment-wise prompt tuning components to quantify their individual contributions to overall performance.

2. Perform comprehensive statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) across all benchmark datasets to validate the claimed performance improvements over baselines.

3. Test the framework's robustness on synthetic datasets with controlled temporal heterogeneity patterns and varying noise levels to better understand its generalization capabilities across different types of temporal structures.
