# The Self-Improvement Paradox: Can Language Models Bootstrap Reasoning Capabilities without External Scaffolding?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.13441
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13441
- Reference count: 11
- LLMs improve mathematical reasoning by 28.8 percentage points using synthetic self-generated data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CRESCENT, a framework for self-improving large language models without external supervision. CRESCENT generates high-quality domain-specific question-answer pairs through bait prompting, rejection sampling-based diversification, and majority voting-based consensus enhancement. Experiments demonstrate that CRESCENT-generated data significantly improves mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs while preserving general performance. The method outperforms existing approaches like Magpie in generating domain-specific data and serves as an effective knowledge distillation technique.

## Method Summary
CRESCENT employs a three-stage pipeline to generate high-quality training data: first, "bait prompting" generates raw question-answer pairs from seed questions; second, rejection sampling with iterative diversification expands and refines the dataset while avoiding duplication; third, majority voting-based consensus enhancement filters the dataset to retain only the most reliable answers. The framework was applied to generate 150K math problem-solution pairs, which were then used to fine-tune Llama3-8B-Instruct, resulting in significant improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Llama3-8B-Instruct improved from 34.5% to 63.3% on GSM8K in 0-shot settings using CRESCENT-generated data
- Outperformed Magpie in generating domain-specific data with better diversity and quality
- Performance plateaued between 75k-150k samples, suggesting optimal data volume range
- Knowledge distillation effectiveness demonstrated through transfer of reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CRESCENT leverages the model's existing capabilities through structured prompting and quality filtering. The bait prompting technique extracts the model's latent reasoning patterns by presenting carefully constructed prompts that encourage detailed solution generation. The rejection sampling mechanism ensures diversity while maintaining quality by iteratively refining outputs. Majority voting creates a consensus-based quality filter that elevates the most reliable reasoning patterns. This combination enables the model to distill its own knowledge without external supervision, effectively bootstrapping improved reasoning capabilities from within.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bait prompting**: A prompting strategy that elicits detailed responses by structuring the input to encourage comprehensive generation; needed to extract raw question-answer pairs from the base model, quick check: does the prompt structure influence response quality?
- **Rejection sampling with diversification**: An iterative sampling method that filters and expands outputs while avoiding duplicates; needed to build a diverse yet high-quality dataset, quick check: how does diversity correlate with model improvement?
- **Majority voting-based consensus**: A filtering mechanism where multiple model outputs are compared and only consistent answers are retained; needed to enhance data quality and reliability, quick check: does consensus correlate with correctness?
- **Knowledge distillation**: The process of transferring knowledge from a larger or more capable model to a smaller one; needed to improve the student model's reasoning capabilities using synthetic data, quick check: does distilled knowledge generalize beyond training distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Bait Prompting -> Rejection Sampling (Diversification) -> Majority Voting (Consensus Enhancement) -> Fine-tuning Dataset
**Critical Path:** The quality of bait prompting directly determines the initial dataset quality, which affects all downstream stages. The diversification stage must balance variety with coherence, while consensus enhancement serves as the final quality gate.
**Design Tradeoffs:** Higher diversity in diversification may introduce noise but improves coverage; stricter consensus thresholds improve quality but may reduce dataset size and diversity.
**Failure Signatures:** Poor bait prompting leads to low-quality initial data; insufficient diversification creates dataset collapse; overly strict consensus filters eliminate valid alternative solutions.
**First Experiments:** 1) Test bait prompting with varying prompt structures on a small seed set; 2) Run diversification with different rejection thresholds to find optimal balance; 3) Evaluate consensus voting with varying quorum requirements.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the CRESCENT framework effectively bootstrap capabilities in domains other than mathematical reasoning, such as coding or logical deduction?
- Basis in paper: The authors state in the Limitations section that "experiments in this paper are confined to evaluating its effectiveness in improving math reasoning capabilities" and that extensions to other domains are "subject to future work."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the mechanisms of "bait prompting" and majority voting (consensus enhancement) are uniquely suited to the structured nature of math problems or if they generalize to tasks with less verifiable answers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the CRESCENT workflow to non-math benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval for coding or LogiQA) showing statistically significant improvements over the baseline model.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can CRESCENT be applied to unaligned base models, or is it strictly dependent on the instruction-following capabilities of aligned chat models?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes in the Limitations that "CRESCENT is designed for aligned chat models" and the authors "did not investigate whether the same approach can be used... for base models without instruction tuning."
- Why unresolved: The "bait prompting" step relies on the model understanding a specific instruction to generate raw questions; base models may fail to follow this prompt, causing the pipeline to break.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study applying the identical CRESCENT pipeline to a base model (e.g., Llama3-base) and evaluating its ability to generate usable data and improve performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does increasing synthetic data volume beyond the observed plateau (75k-150k samples) eventually lead to model collapse or performance regression?
- Basis in paper: Figure 7 shows performance stabilizing between 75k and 150k, and Section 4.4 notes this "suggesting an upper limit." The introduction also cites literature (Shumailov et al.) warning of model collapse.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies a plateau but does not test the limits of recursive self-training. It remains uncertain if pushing data volume further maintains the plateau or induces the "collapse" discussed in related literature.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training the model on significantly larger synthetic datasets (e.g., 500k or 1M samples) or for multiple iterative "generations" to analyze the long-term trajectory of performance.

## Limitations
- Limited to aligned chat models; effectiveness on base models remains unexplored
- Primary evaluation focused on mathematical reasoning tasks, with unclear generalizability to other domains
- Potential for model collapse with excessive recursive self-training not fully investigated

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core methodology of CRESCENT is well-described and reproducible; mathematical reasoning improvements clearly demonstrated
- **Medium confidence**: Claims of outperforming Magpie and knowledge distillation effectiveness require more rigorous multi-dataset validation
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to non-mathematical tasks and long-term self-improvement dynamics remain largely unexplored

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain generalization**: Test CRESCENT-generated data on non-mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., commonsense reasoning, scientific reasoning) to assess domain transferability and identify potential performance trade-offs.

2. **Scalability analysis**: Evaluate CRESCENT's effectiveness across different model sizes (both teacher and student) and architectures to determine optimal conditions for self-improvement and identify potential limitations with larger or smaller models.

3. **Long-term self-improvement dynamics**: Implement iterative applications of CRESCENT to assess whether continuous self-improvement leads to sustained performance gains or plateaus, and examine the quality evolution of generated data over multiple iterations.
