# Voice Conversion for Lombard Speaking Style with Implicit and Explicit Acoustic Feature Conditioning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.09310
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09310
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Implicit conditioning via style reconstruction loss achieves comparable intelligibility gains to explicit acoustic feature conditioning while better preserving speaker identity in Lombard-style voice conversion.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating Lombard-style speech for voice conversion without requiring expensive Lombard recordings from target speakers. The authors propose a method that converts speaker identity while preserving the Lombard speaking style characteristics that improve intelligibility in noisy conditions. They compare two conditioning approaches: explicit conditioning using acoustic features (f0, spectral energy, spectral tilt) extracted via WORLD vocoder, and implicit conditioning using a style reconstruction loss that preserves Lombard prosody through a frozen classifier. Experiments show the implicit method achieves similar intelligibility gains to explicit conditioning while better preserving speaker identity, with spectral tilt and energy features being most beneficial for modeling the Lombard effect.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a CopyCat-style many-to-many voice conversion architecture with three training stages. First, a binary style classifier (Lombard vs. neutral) is trained on mel-spectrograms to distinguish speaking styles. Second, the voice conversion model is trained with a reference encoder that takes source mel-spectrograms and speaker embeddings, a VAE bottleneck with KL divergence loss, and a decoder that generates target mel-spectrograms. For explicit conditioning, WORLD vocoder features (f0, mgc0 spectral energy, mgc1 spectral tilt) are extracted from source speech and fed directly to the decoder. For implicit conditioning, the frozen style classifier provides a style reconstruction loss that enforces preservation of Lombard characteristics. Target speaker embeddings are calculated as centroids across all their training data to stabilize identity transfer.

## Key Results
- Implicit conditioning via style reconstruction loss achieves comparable intelligibility gains to explicit conditioning in high noise conditions
- Spectral energy (mgc0) and spectral tilt (mgc1) features are most beneficial for Lombard style modeling
- Implicit conditioning better preserves speaker identity than explicit conditioning, with f0 features actually harming female speaker identity preservation
- The proposed method enables synthetic Lombard dataset generation for TTS systems without requiring Lombard speech recordings from target speakers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Implicit conditioning via a style reconstruction loss forces the voice conversion model to preserve the Lombard speaking style without manual feature engineering.
- **Mechanism:** A pre-trained classifier (discriminator) evaluates the generated mel-spectrogram to predict if it matches the "Lombard" class. The binary cross-entropy loss from this classifier backpropagates into the generator, penalizing outputs that drift toward a "neutral" style. This creates a learning signal that preserves style attributes that are otherwise difficult to define explicitly.
- **Core assumption:** The style classifier successfully learns a robust representation of the Lombard effect that generalizes across different speakers during the initial training phase.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Implicit conditioning using a style reconstruction loss trained with a classifier to preserve Lombard speaking style."
  - [section 3.3] "This loss forces the model to generate mel-spectrograms that preserve the source style, given the features that the style classifier learned representations."
  - [corpus] "Discl-VC" paper mentions disentangled tokens for style control; this paper implements a similar separation via an auxiliary loss.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Explicit conditioning on spectral energy (mgc0) and spectral tilt (mgc1) significantly improves intelligibility in high-noise conditions by directly altering the vocal tract response.
- **Mechanism:** By extracting these features from the source waveform using the WORLD vocoder and feeding them directly into the decoder (bypassing the bottleneck), the model forces the output to match the energy distribution and spectral sharpness of the source Lombard speech. This mimics the natural human tendency to boost mid-range frequencies in noise.
- **Core assumption:** The chosen explicit features (mgc0, mgc1) are sufficient causal factors for the intelligibility gain, and pitch (f0) is less critical for the Lombard effect than spectral features (confirmed by results for female speakers where f0 was harmful).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Spectral energy and tilt features being most beneficial for Lombard style modeling."
  - [section 3.2] "We consider f0, mgc0 (spectral energy) and mgc1 (spectral tilt)... feed them to the decoder, to condition the model."
  - [section 4] "Experiments on explicit modeling confirm previous studies on the importance of spectral tilt and energy."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Using the centroid (mean) of speaker embeddings stabilizes speaker identity transfer by reducing frame-level variance.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of conditioning the model on a single utterance's embedding (which carries prosody specific to that sentence), the model uses the average embedding vector calculated across the target speaker's entire dataset. This smooths out incidental variations, providing a stable "timbre target" for the decoder.
- **Core assumption:** The speaker verification model used to generate embeddings creates a linear space where averaging vectors yields a valid representation of the speaker's core vocal characteristics.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2] "The target speaker embedding is the centroid of all embeddings from that speaker's training data."
  - [corpus] Related works like "ReStyle-TTS" and "GSA-TTS" utilize similar style/speaker aggregation techniques to normalize references.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: The Lombard Effect**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the biological phenomenon being modeled. You must understand that Lombard speech isn't just "louder" speech; it involves specific acoustic shifts (longer duration, higher F0, flatter spectral tilt, boosted mid-frequencies) that serve as the ground truth for the system.
  - **Quick check question:** If a speaker raises their volume but does not change their spectral tilt or vowel duration, is this considered the Lombard effect?

- **Concept: Vocoder Features (WORLD/STRAIGHT)**
  - **Why needed here:** The "explicit conditioning" relies on extracting mgc0 and mgc1. You need to know that these are features derived from the mel-cepstrum, representing the spectral envelope, which correlates with vocal tract shape and intelligibility.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would mgc1 (spectral tilt) be more correlated with intelligibility in noise than the fundamental frequency (f0)?

- **Concept: Non-Parallel Voice Conversion (Many-to-Many)**
  - **Why needed here:** The system uses a "CopyCat" architecture which does not require matching text or time-alignment between the source (Lombard) and target (Neutral) speakers. Understanding how this is achieved via reference encoders and embeddings is key to the architecture.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a non-parallel VC model ensure the converted speech says the correct phonemes if it is not explicitly aligned with the source text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Reference Encoder -> VAE Bottleneck -> Decoder (with optional explicit conditioning) -> Mel-Spectrogram Output

- **Critical path:**
  1. Pre-processing: Extract mel-spectrograms and speaker embeddings (calculate centroid)
  2. Stage I: Train the Style Classifier on labeled Lombard/Neutral data until convergence
  3. Stage II: Train the VC Model. The source mel goes through the encoder; the target embedding goes to the decoder. The output is judged by L1 reconstruction loss and the frozen Style Classifier
  4. Inference: Drop the classifier. Input source Lombard audio + target speaker ID → Output Target Lombard Audio

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Implicit vs. Explicit: Implicit is lower maintenance (no feature engineering) and preserves speaker identity better, but acts as a "black box." Explicit offers precise control over acoustics but requires distinct vocoder extraction and can harm identity preservation (as seen with f0 in female speakers)
  - Fusion: Combining both (L_s + mgc0/mgc1) offers the best theoretical performance but increases architectural complexity and training time

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Robotic Prosody: The paper notes that resulting samples can have "robotic prosody" due to the recording task limitations
  - Intelligibility Drop in High Noise: If the model relies solely on the baseline VC without L_s or explicit features, intelligibility drops significantly (SIIB scores drop ≈ 30-40% in high noise)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validity: Train the baseline CopyCat model without any conditioning. Measure SIIB scores in noise to quantify how much Lombard style is naturally lost during standard voice conversion
  2. Feature Ablation (Explicit): Train three separate models conditioned only on f0, only on mgc0, and only on mgc1. Compare SIIB gains to identify which specific acoustic feature drives the intelligibility improvement
  3. Identity vs. Style Trade-off: Run MUSHRA tests comparing the "Implicit (L_s)" model against the "Explicit (f0+mgc0+mgc1)" model specifically for Speaker Similarity to verify if the implicit method truly preserves identity better than the explicit fusion

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system trained on synthetic Lombard data generated by this voice conversion model achieve comparable performance to one trained on real recordings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state future work would "train and evaluate TTS models trained on synthetic Lombard data generated with our model."
- Why unresolved: This study only evaluated the quality of the voice conversion output itself (synthetic speech), not a generative TTS system built upon that synthetic data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Intelligibility and naturalness scores of a TTS model fine-tuned on the converted data compared to a TTS model fine-tuned on ground-truth Lombard recordings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can adversarial learning techniques further improve the disentanglement of source speaker identity from explicit Lombard acoustic features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion suggests adversarial learning could be explored "to further disentangle source speaker identity from the explicit features."
- Why unresolved: The current implicit method improves identity preservation over baseline, but the paper suggests adversarial methods could push this boundary further by preventing identity leakage.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of speaker similarity and intelligibility scores between the proposed reconstruction-loss model and a model trained with adversarial gradient reversal layers.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does incorporating explicit duration modeling into the voice conversion framework yield additional intelligibility benefits for Lombard speech?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that their models "do not alter the durations," which is a known characteristic of Lombard speech that "could further benefit the intelligibility."
- Why unresolved: The current architecture (CopyCat) maintains source duration, leaving the potential intelligibility gains from Lombard-specific temporal modifications (e.g., vowel lengthening) unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Subjective and objective intelligibility tests comparing the current fixed-duration model against a model modified to predict and apply Lombard-style duration patterns.

## Limitations

- The style classifier generalization across speakers is not extensively validated, creating uncertainty about whether learned representations transfer beyond training domain
- CopyCat architecture specifics are underspecified (encoder/decoder dimensions, attention mechanisms, phoneme extraction methods), making exact reproduction difficult
- The implicit method acts as a "black box" providing no interpretability into which specific Lombard characteristics are actually preserved

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The empirical finding that spectral energy (mgc0) and spectral tilt (mgc1) features are more beneficial for Lombard intelligibility than pitch (f0), supported by both objective SIIB scores and the ablation study showing f0 harmed female speaker performance
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that implicit conditioning preserves speaker identity better than explicit conditioning, based on MUSHRA tests, though the statistical significance testing methodology (Holm-Bonferroni correction) suggests careful analysis but limited sample sizes
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that the implicit method eliminates the need for manual feature engineering without trade-offs, as the "black box" nature of the style reconstruction loss provides no interpretability into which Lombard characteristics are actually preserved

## Next Checks

1. **Classifier Generalization Test:** Evaluate the frozen style classifier on a completely held-out speaker dataset (not used in either classifier or VC training) to verify that the learned Lombard representations generalize across speaker identities rather than memorizing training speaker characteristics

2. **Feature Attribution Analysis:** Use gradient-based interpretability methods (e.g., Grad-CAM on the classifier's decision layer) to identify which spectral regions the implicit loss is actually preserving, and compare these to the explicit features (mgc0, mgc1) to validate that they capture similar acoustic phenomena

3. **Cross-Domain Robustness:** Test the converted speech intelligibility in multiple noise types beyond speech-shaped noise (e.g., babble noise, factory noise, cafeteria noise) to verify that the Lombard effect preservation generalizes to real-world acoustic conditions rather than overfitting to the specific noise profile used in training
