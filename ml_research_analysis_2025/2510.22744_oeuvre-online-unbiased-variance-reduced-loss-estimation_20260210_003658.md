# OEUVRE: OnlinE Unbiased Variance-Reduced loss Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.22744
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22744
- Authors: Kanad Pardeshi; Bryan Wilder; Aarti Singh
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: OEUVRE achieves accurate online loss estimation with constant memory/time via recursive updates using current and previous model evaluations

## Executive Summary
OEUVRE is an online loss estimator that tracks the expected loss of models that update over time. It evaluates each incoming sample on both the current and previous model, updating the estimate recursively in constant time and memory. The method uses algorithmic stability to set weights that minimize variance, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Theoretical guarantees include convergence in L2, convergence rates, and concentration bounds tied to the stability rate of the learning algorithm.

## Method Summary
OEUVRE estimates online loss by recursively combining evaluations from consecutive model versions. For each incoming sample z_t, it computes losses using both the current model f_t and previous model f_{t-1}, then updates the estimate L_t = ℓ_t(z_t) + (1−γ_t)[L_{t-1} - ℓ_{t-1}(z_t)]. The weight γ_t is chosen to minimize variance based on algorithmic stability bounds. Adaptive hyperparameter estimation during a burn-in period (t_0=30) allows OEUVRE to work without oracle knowledge of stability constants. The estimator operates in constant memory and time per sample while providing theoretical convergence guarantees.

## Key Results
- OEUVRE matches or outperforms multiple baseline estimators (sliding windows, fading factors, exponential moving averages, ADWIN) even with oracle-tuned baselines
- Theoretical guarantees include L2 convergence, convergence rates scaling with algorithmic stability, and concentration bounds
- Experiments demonstrate robust performance across diverse settings: linear regression, logistic regression, expert advice, and neural networks
- Adaptive hyperparameter estimation works without asymptotically affecting convergence rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Evaluating each incoming sample on both current and previous models enables variance-reduced loss estimation through recursive updates.
- Mechanism: The estimator uses the difference between consecutive model evaluations as a control variate. The weight γ_t balances between trusting fresh evaluation (high variance, no bias) and accumulated estimate (lower variance but potentially stale). Past evaluation ℓ_{t-1}(z_t) is correlated with ℓ_t(z_t) because both use the same sample, allowing variance cancellation.
- Core assumption: The conditional variance of the difference between consecutive loss evaluations, σ²_t = Var(ℓ_t(Z) - ℓ_{t-1}(Z) | F_{t-1}), is bounded and decreases as the model stabilizes.
- Break condition: When σ_t ≥ b (sudden large model change), γ*_t = 1, effectively resetting the estimator and discarding past information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Convergence rate of the estimator is directly governed by the algorithmic stability rate of the underlying learning algorithm.
- Mechanism: Algorithmic stability bounds how much a single new sample can change the learned function. If the learner is β_t-uniformly stable, then σ_t ≤ β_t. Theorem 4 proves Var(M_t) ≤ O(max{1/t, σ_t}), meaning faster-stabilizing algorithms yield faster-converging estimates.
- Core assumption: The learning algorithm admits known or estimable stability bounds, and σ_t → 0 as t → ∞.
- Break condition: For algorithms without established stability bounds, heuristic σ_t approximations may be inaccurate, degrading empirical performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hyperparameters (stability constant c and variance bound b) can be estimated adaptively from observed data without asymptotically affecting convergence rates.
- Mechanism: During a burn-in period, collect samples to estimate ˆb² and ˆc². Lemma 9 proves that misspecifying constants by a factor only affects variance by that same factor squared, preserving convergence order.
- Core assumption: Burn-in samples are representative of subsequent data distribution (i.i.d. condition).
- Break condition: For highly non-stationary data where burn-in distribution diverges from later data, adaptive constants may become misestimated.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Martingale difference sequences and martingale CLT**
- Why needed here: The centered estimator M_t/Γ_t forms a martingale, enabling proof of asymptotic normality and concentration bounds.
- Quick check question: Given a sequence X_n adapted to filtration F_n, can you state the martingale property E[X_n | F_{n-1}] = X_{n-1} and explain why it simplifies variance analysis?

**Concept: Uniform stability of learning algorithms**
- Why needed here: Uniform stability provides the bound σ_t ≤ β_t, connecting optimization dynamics to estimation guarantees.
- Quick check question: If algorithm A is β_t-uniformly stable, what does ||ℓ(f_t(x), y) - ℓ(f_{t-1}(x), y)||_∞ ≤ β_t imply about how fast the model changes?

**Concept: Prequential (interleaved test-then-train) evaluation**
- Why needed here: OEUVRE builds on prequential evaluation but adds double evaluation to reduce variance; understanding why naive prequential estimates are non-i.i.d. motivates the approach.
- Quick check question: Why does evaluating on z_t before using it for training create a sequence of losses that is not i.i.d., even when data are i.i.d.?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Double evaluator -> Model cache -> Recursive updater -> Stability estimator -> γ_t optimizer

**Critical path:**
1. Receive z_t = (x_t, y_t)
2. Evaluate ℓ_{t-1}(z_t) using cached f_{t-1}
3. Update f_{t-1} → f_t using z_{t-1} (prequential: train on previous sample)
4. Evaluate ℓ_t(z_t) using new f_t
5. Compute γ*_t from Eq. 3 using current ˆσ_t = ˆc·r(t), ˆb, V↑_{t-1}
6. Update L_t via recursive formula
7. If t < t_0: update ˆc, ˆb estimates

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Burn-in length (t_0): Longer burn-in → better constant estimates but delayed useful output; paper uses t_0 = 30
- Exact vs heuristic stability: Exact bounds (Table 1) give theoretical guarantees; heuristic σ_t ≈ C'||η_t ⊙ g_t||_∞ used for neural networks in experiments
- Batch vs single-sample: Batch mode (Appendix A) reduces variance by factor B but requires caching B samples

**Failure signatures:**
- High run-to-run variance in bias → heuristic σ_t approximation unreliable (observed for AdamW in MNIST experiments)
- Poor tracking of sudden distribution shifts → estimator designed for gradual drift; abrupt changes may trigger γ_t = 1 reset but tracking lags
- Convergence stalls at non-zero error → check if stability rate r(t) is misspecified or if data violates i.i.d. assumption

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Linear regression with OGD (learning rate η_0/√t) on synthetic data with known O(1/√t) stability: verify baseline RMSE matches Figure 2 and that γ_t decays as expected
2. Expert advice task with Hedge algorithm, comparing Beta vs Bernoulli loss distributions: confirm OEUVRE outperforms best-tuned baselines per Figure 3a and observe how loss distribution affects variance
3. Neural network with AdamW on MNIST: replicate Figure 7 results, specifically noting where heuristic σ_t approximation causes variance in bias across runs, identifying failure modes for adaptive optimizers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: Can OEUVRE be extended to non-stationary settings with formal guarantees, such as through mixing assumptions on the data distribution or combination with adaptive windowing techniques?
- Basis in paper: Discussion section states: "Extending OEUVRE to non-stationary settings via mixing assumptions on the data or combining OEUVRE with windowing is a key next step."
- Why unresolved: Current theoretical guarantees assume i.i.d. data. Experiments show OEUVRE handles gradual/seasonal drift reasonably but degrades with abrupt drift.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified OEUVRE algorithm with proven convergence rates under mixing conditions, or a hybrid OEUVRE-windowing method with theoretical guarantees for abrupt change detection.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: Can systematic L² stability theory be developed for online learning algorithms to provide tighter variance bounds and faster convergence rates for OEUVRE?
- Basis in paper: Section 4 states: "The development of systematic L² stability theory for online learning would immediately translate to improved OEUVRE guarantees."
- Why unresolved: Current analysis uses L∞ uniform stability bounds, which are well-established but potentially looser than L² bounds since the L∞ norm upper-bounds the L² norm.
- What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of L² stability bounds for common online algorithms (FTL, OMD, FTRL) and demonstration of improved OEUVRE convergence rates when using these tighter bounds.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: How can stability-based tuning for adaptive optimizers like Adam be formalized to provide reliable OEUVRE estimates for neural network training?
- Basis in paper: Neural networks section states: "Further investigation of stability-based tuning for adaptive learning rates remains important future work." Experiments show high variance in bias estimates when using heuristic stability approximations.
- Why unresolved: The analysis requires pre-determined weight sequences, excluding algorithms with adaptive learning rates. Heuristic approximations (σ_t ≈ C'||η_t ⊙ g_t||_∞) show practical promise but lack theoretical justification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Provable stability bounds for adaptive optimizers, or empirically validated heuristic approximations with bounded approximation error that preserve OEUVRE's convergence guarantees.

## Limitations
- Performance depends on accurate stability characterization, which may not be available for many modern algorithms
- Burn-in period assumption that initial samples are representative may fail for non-stationary data streams
- Algorithm-specific stability rate specifications are still required, inheriting some algorithm-dependent limitations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core recursive estimator structure and its constant memory/time properties; empirical superiority over baseline estimators across multiple tasks
- **Medium confidence**: The adaptive hyperparameter estimation mechanism; the theoretical convergence guarantees assuming correct stability bounds
- **Low confidence**: Performance guarantees for algorithms without known stability bounds; robustness to non-i.i.d. data distributions

## Next Checks
1. **Stability approximation sensitivity**: Systematically vary the heuristic constant C' in σ_t ≈ C'||η_t ⊙ g_t||_∞ for AdamW experiments to quantify how sensitive OEUVRE performance is to this approximation.

2. **Burn-in period ablation**: Repeat key experiments (linear regression, logistic regression) with varying burn-in periods (t_0 = 10, 30, 100) to measure the tradeoff between constant estimation quality and evaluation delay.

3. **Non-stationary data evaluation**: Test OEUVRE on synthetic data with abrupt distribution shifts after the burn-in period to quantify performance degradation when the i.i.d. assumption is violated.
