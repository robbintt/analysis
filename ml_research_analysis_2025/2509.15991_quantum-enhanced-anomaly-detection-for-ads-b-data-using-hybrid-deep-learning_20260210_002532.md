# Quantum Enhanced Anomaly Detection for ADS-B Data using Hybrid Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.15991
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15991
- **Reference count:** 31
- **Key outcome:** Hybrid quantum-classical neural network achieves 90-94% accuracy for ADS-B anomaly detection, matching classical baselines.

## Executive Summary
This study explores quantum machine learning for detecting spoofing attacks in Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data, a critical aviation safety system. The researchers developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network (H-FQNN) that integrates quantum circuits with classical layers to identify trajectory-based anomalies in flight data. The model was trained on a publicly available ADS-B dataset containing various attack scenarios and compared against a traditional fully connected neural network. Results show the quantum-enhanced architecture achieves competitive performance with accuracies between 90.17% and 94.05%, demonstrating the feasibility of applying quantum methods to aviation cybersecurity applications.

## Method Summary
The research implements a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for binary anomaly detection in ADS-B data. The architecture combines three classical dense layers with one quantum Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) layer. Input data undergoes z-score normalization and feature selection to six ADS-B features (latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity, heading, time). The quantum layer uses angle embedding via RX gates followed by strongly entangling circuits with rotation and CNOT gates. Both H-FQNN and classical FNN baselines were trained using Adam optimizer (LR=0.02) for 150 epochs with BCEWithLogitsLoss and CrossEntropyLoss functions. Performance was evaluated on stratified 70/20/10 train/val/test splits.

## Key Results
- H-FQNN achieves 90.17%-94.05% accuracy across different qubit configurations
- Optimal performance observed with six qubits in the quantum layer
- F1 scores reach 93.99% for H-FQNN, closely matching classical FNN performance
- BCEWithLogitsLoss provides slightly better results than CrossEntropyLoss for this hybrid architecture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** A hybrid quantum-classical architecture enables anomaly detection by mapping classical flight features into a high-dimensional Hilbert space where separability may be more efficient.
- **Mechanism:** The H-FQNN preprocesses data classically before passing it to a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC). The VQC uses angle embedding (RX gates) to encode features into qubit rotation angles. A strongly entangling ansatz (rotations + CNOTs) then creates quantum correlations, effectively searching for a decision boundary in a 2^n dimensional space before measuring expectation values.
- **Core assumption:** The quantum feature map provided by the angle embedding preserves the structural information of the ADS-B data better than, or at least comparably to, classical weight matrices.
- **Evidence anchors:** "...processing speed and effectively handling the high dimensionality associated with complex datasets" [abstract]; "...quantum circuit contains qubits equal to the number of features, which are embedded with an RX gate, passed through strongly entangling circuits..." [section IV.A]
- **Break condition:** If the "barren plateau" phenomenon occurs (gradients vanish), the classical optimizer cannot update the quantum circuit parameters, and learning stops.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Constraining the quantum layer to 6 qubits provides an optimal balance between model expressibility and trainability for this specific ADS-B dataset.
- **Mechanism:** The study reduced the dataset to 6 features (latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity, heading, time). By matching the qubit count to the feature count (n=6), the model utilizes the Hilbert space dimension (2^6=64) without introducing redundant parameters that increase noise or computational cost without performance gain.
- **Core assumption:** The correlation between the number of physical features and the number of qubits is roughly linear for this anomaly detection task.
- **Evidence anchors:** "...optimal performance was closely tied to the number of qubits used... six qubits were chosen as a practical balance..." [section V]; "...filtering process effectively reduced the dataset to six essential features." [section IV.D]
- **Break condition:** If qubit count significantly exceeds meaningful feature correlations (e.g., >8 qubits for this data), the model risks overfitting or computational diminishing returns.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The choice of loss function (BCEWithLogitsLoss vs. CrossEntropyLoss) acts as a critical hyperparameter that determines the gradient flow from the classical output layer back to the quantum variational weights.
- **Mechanism:** The hybrid model requires gradient descent through the quantum circuit. The paper compares two loss configurations. The results suggest that the internal sigmoid logic of BCEWithLogitsLoss coupled with one-hot encoding aligns slightly better with the probability distributions output by the quantum measurement layer than standard CrossEntropy.
- **Core assumption:** The simulator provides a smooth, differentiable approximation of the quantum measurement expectations required for backpropagation.
- **Evidence anchors:** "With the BCEWithLogitsLoss, both models performed closely, with the H-FQNN achieving an F1 score of 93.29%..." [section V]; "BCEWithLogitsLoss... enables gradient updates in both classical and hybrid quantum-classical models." [section IV.E]
- **Break condition:** If the loss function is incompatible with the measurement output format (e.g., expectation values [-1, 1] vs probabilities [0, 1]), gradients will be incorrect and the model will fail to converge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core "quantum layer" replacing or enhancing the classical hidden layer. You must understand that the "weights" of this layer are actually rotation angles of quantum gates.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a Variational Quantum Classifier differ from a classical neural network layer in terms of parameter representation?

- **Concept: Angle Embedding (Feature Mapping)**
  - **Why needed here:** The model does not feed raw numbers directly into the quantum state; it encodes ADS-B data into the rotation angles of qubits. Understanding this mapping is essential for debugging data preprocessing.
  - **Quick check question:** If an ADS-B velocity value is normalized to 0.5, how is that physically represented in the quantum circuit using RX gates?

- **Concept: ADS-B Security Context**
  - **Why needed here:** To interpret results, one must understand that "anomalies" are not random noise but specific attack vectors like "ghost aircraft" or "trajectory manipulation."
  - **Quick check question:** Why is the "normal-to-attack ratio" a critical preprocessing step for training this specific detector?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input(6) → Dense(6, ReLU) → Dense(6, ReLU) → VQC(6 qubits, RX embedding, 2 strongly entangling layers, Pauli-Z measurement) → Dense(2) → Sigmoid/Softmax → Binary Classification

- **Critical path:** The interface between the classical PyTorch tensor and the PennyLane quantum node (QNode). The torch.nn.Module must correctly interface with the quantum simulator to allow backpropagation through the quantum circuit.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Simulation vs. Hardware:** This architecture was tested on a noise-free simulator (Pennylane). Deploying on real NISQ hardware would introduce decoherence and noise, likely degrading the 90-94% accuracy.
  - **Qubit Count:** Increasing qubits increases Hilbert space capacity (expressibility) but exponentially increases simulation time and circuit depth.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Stagnant Loss:** The model fails to improve beyond random guessing (50%), often due to incorrect gradient wiring between the classical optimizer and the quantum circuit parameters.
  - **Data Imbalance Collapse:** If the normal-to-attack ratio is too high during training without stratified sampling, the model predicts "normal" for everything to minimize loss.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Replication:** Implement the FNN (Classical) model with 6 features and BCEWithLogitsLoss to verify the ~93% accuracy benchmark.
  2. **Hybrid Integration:** Replace the central classical layer with a Pennylane StronglyEntanglingLayers QNode. Verify that gradients are flowing (check .grad on epoch 1).
  3. **Qubit Sweep:** Run the H-FQNN with 4, 6, and 8 qubits to replicate the finding that 6 qubits provides the optimal performance-efficiency balance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the presence of quantum hardware noise (decoherence and gate errors) on real Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices affect the classification accuracy of the H-FQNN compared to noise-free simulation results?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state future work involves "testing QML models on real quantum hardware" and acknowledge a key limitation: "all experiments were conducted on noise-free quantum simulators [which] does not account for real-world noise."
- **Why unresolved:** The simulation assumes ideal quantum states, whereas physical qubits suffer from noise that disrupts the superposition and entanglement properties essential to the model.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks of the H-FQNN model running on physical quantum processors (e.g., IBM Quantum) showing accuracy and F1 scores under NISQ conditions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the H-FQNN model demonstrate superior performance or efficiency compared to state-of-the-art classical anomaly detection algorithms, rather than just the baseline Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN) used here?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion suggests "implementing more in-depth benchmarking against state-of-the-art classical anomaly detection models."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study only establishes parity with a simple classical baseline; it does not prove an advantage over more sophisticated classical methods commonly used in cybersecurity.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative results showing the H-FQNN outperforming advanced classical architectures (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) on the same ADS-B dataset.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the proposed architecture robust against complex ADS-B attack vectors beyond trajectory manipulation, such as ghost aircraft injection or velocity anomalies?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The methodology notes the selected dataset "contains basic trajectory manipulation attacks" and "does not represent the full range of known ADS-B operational threats."
- **Why unresolved:** The model was trained and validated exclusively on a specific subset of spoofing attacks (latitude/longitude drift) and may not generalize to other attack types.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation results of the trained model on distinct ADS-B threat datasets containing injection or modification attacks outside the training distribution.

## Limitations

- **Noise-free simulation:** All experiments conducted on noise-free quantum simulators, not accounting for real-world quantum hardware noise that would likely degrade performance.
- **Limited attack scope:** The dataset contains only basic trajectory manipulation attacks and does not represent the full range of known ADS-B operational threats.
- **Narrow classical comparison:** The study only benchmarks against a simple fully connected neural network, without testing more sophisticated classical anomaly detection methods.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The hybrid architecture successfully trains and achieves competitive accuracy (90-94%) compared to the classical baseline. The optimal qubit count of 6 is empirically validated within this specific dataset context.
- **Medium Confidence:** The quantum layer provides any actual advantage over classical methods for this task. The performance gap between H-FQNN and FNN is marginal, suggesting the quantum component may not be essential for this particular problem.
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about the quantum circuit's superior handling of "high dimensionality" are not substantiated, as the actual feature count (6) is relatively low. The study does not demonstrate quantum advantage in terms of computational efficiency or accuracy improvement.

## Next Checks

1. **Hardware Validation:** Deploy the trained H-FQNN model on actual quantum hardware (e.g., IBM Quantum) to measure performance degradation from noise and compare against simulator results.
2. **Expanded Classical Baseline:** Implement and compare against multiple classical anomaly detection methods (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Deep Autoencoders) to establish whether the quantum approach offers advantages beyond a simple neural network.
3. **Feature Space Expansion:** Test the model with additional ADS-B features (e.g., vertical rate, squawk code, timestamp granularity) to evaluate whether quantum advantage scales with feature dimensionality.
