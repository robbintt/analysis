# Distributed Multi-Head Learning Systems for Power Consumption Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.12133
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12133
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DMH-E achieves 14.5%-24.0% lower MAE than state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a distributed multi-head learning system (DMH) for predicting AGV power consumption in smart factories. The system addresses noise interference, data privacy, and communication efficiency by grouping features using Pearson correlation, applying multi-head learning to isolate noise, and using split learning to distribute computation between AGVs and a central server. The DMH-E variant (Ensemble) is recommended for its balance of performance, privacy, and transmission efficiency, achieving top-2 robustness across multiple datasets.

## Method Summary
The DMH system groups features by Pearson correlation with power consumption, assigning them to H=3 groups with thresholds [0, 0.05, 0.20, 1.0]. Each group feeds a dedicated head network (LSTM, CNN, or MLP variants) on the AGV client. Head outputs are transmitted to a central server running a prediction network (3-layer MLP) that aggregates them into final power predictions. The split learning architecture reduces client-to-server transmission by factor W (window size=5). DMH-E uses heads to predict power directly, while DMH-T predicts intermediate features with loss balancing based on homoscedastic uncertainty.

## Key Results
- DMH-E achieves 14.5%-24.0% lower MAE than state-of-the-art methods across AIUT, BMW, and Husky datasets
- System maintains top-2 performance in robustness tests predicting 5-10 time steps ahead
- Transmission cost reduced to 1/W of full-feature baseline while preserving privacy
- DMH-E recommended over DMH-T for better efficiency and privacy trade-offs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Correlation-based feature grouping with multi-head learning reduces noise interference compared to single-head approaches.
- Mechanism: Features are grouped by Pearson correlation with power consumption. Each group feeds a dedicated head network, isolating low-correlation (noisier) features from high-correlation ones. Head outputs are aggregated by a prediction network.
- Core assumption: Features with similar correlation magnitudes share noise characteristics; separating them allows heads to learn group-specific patterns without interference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Multi-head learning mechanisms are proposed in DMH to reduce noise interference and improve accuracy."
  - [section V-D] Figure 3 shows progressive MAE/MSE reduction from BS → FS-S → DMH, demonstrating incremental benefit of feature engineering then multi-head learning.
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence. Related work (arXiv:2501.12136) extends DMH with multi-head embedding for federated settings but does not independently validate the noise-isolation claim.
- Break condition: If feature correlations shift significantly between training and deployment (distribution drift), grouping becomes misaligned. BMW dataset results show degraded performance, which authors attribute to "large difference in Pearson's correlation coefficients between training and testing datasets."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Split learning architecture reduces client-to-server transmission by factor of W (window size) while preserving privacy.
- Mechanism: Head networks execute on AGV (client), producing compact predictions (F G′ values or preliminary P′). Only these outputs transmit to server—never raw features or full model weights. Server runs prediction network and returns gradients.
- Core assumption: Communication bottleneck dominates system constraints; intermediate predictions are lower-dimensional than raw windowed features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Reducing the client-to-server transmission cost to 1/W, where W is feature window size."
  - [section III-B1] "The client should transmit all F Gh,t−i, h = 1,...,H and i = 1,...,W, which requires large transmission bandwidth." Split design avoids this.
  - [corpus] No independent validation of 1/W claim found in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If prediction horizon increases (predicting t+N where N >> 1), head network output dimensionality may grow. Very small window sizes (W ≤ 2) yield marginal savings.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Loss balancing based on homoscedastic uncertainty stabilizes multi-task training for DMH-T.
- Mechanism: Dynamic multipliers Mh,i scale each head's loss based on running standard deviation ratio. Prevents high-magnitude feature losses from dominating gradient updates.
- Core assumption: Different feature groups have heterogeneous loss scales; unweighted summation biases learning toward high-variance heads.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-B3] "Predictions have different loss distributions, which may cause gradients to concentrate on several large losses."
  - [section V-C, Table X] Loss balancing improves MAE by up to 5.8% on Husky-B but degrades performance on Husky-C. Results are conditional, not universally positive.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers evaluate this specific loss balancing approach.
- Break condition: When training data is scarce (few-shot regime like Husky-C: 5 training trials), variance estimates become unreliable, potentially harming performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Pearson Correlation for Feature Selection**
  - Why needed here: Entire feature grouping mechanism (Eq. 1-2) depends on computing correlation coefficients Cm between each feature and power consumption P.
  - Quick check question: Given a feature with values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and target P with values [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], what is the correlation coefficient? (Answer: 1.0, perfectly linear)

- Concept: **Split Learning Forward/Backward Pass**
  - Why needed here: Architecture splits computation between client and server; understanding gradient flow is essential for debugging distributed training.
  - Quick check question: In split learning, what does the server send back to the client after computing loss? (Answer: Gradients at the split point, not the full model update)

- Concept: **Multi-Task Loss Weighting**
  - Why needed here: DMH-T has H+1 losses (H feature predictions + 1 power prediction). Naive summation risks gradient imbalance.
  - Quick check question: If loss A has magnitude 1000 and loss B has magnitude 0.1, what happens if you sum them directly for backpropagation? (Answer: Gradients dominated by A; B effectively ignored)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Feature engineering module → H head networks (Client/AGV) → Prediction network (Server) → Final power prediction

- Critical path:
  1. Offline: Compute correlations → assign features to H groups → set thresholds
  2. Training (per batch): Pack windowed features → forward through head nets → transmit outputs → server prediction → compute loss → backprop gradients → return gradients to clients
  3. Inference: Same forward path, no gradient exchange

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **DMH-T vs DMH-E**: DMH-T predicts intermediate features (interpretable, more transmitted data M values). DMH-E predicts power directly at heads (less transmission H values, less interpretability). Paper recommends DMH-E for efficiency and privacy.
  - **H (number of groups)**: Higher H = finer noise isolation but more head networks to train. Paper uses H=3 with thresholds 0.05, 0.20.
  - **W (window size)**: Larger W captures more history but increases raw transmission cost for non-split baselines. Paper uses W=5.

- Failure signatures:
  - **BMW-style degradation**: Training/test correlation mismatch causes poor generalization. Monitor correlation stability across trials.
  - **Loss imbalance**: If one head's loss dominates (check Mh,i multipliers hitting bounds 0.1 or 10), gradient flow is skewed.
  - **Few-shot failure**: Husky-C (5 training trials) shows loss balancing can hurt. Consider disabling for small datasets.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce AIUT baseline**: Train DMH-E with LSTM heads (best performer on AIUT per Table VI). Verify MAE ≈ 589. Validate transmission reduction by logging bytes sent client→server vs. full-feature baseline.
  2. **Ablate feature grouping**: Compare (a) proposed correlation-based grouping vs. (b) random assignment vs. (c) single head. Quantify grouping contribution.
  3. **Stress test loss balancing**: Train DMH-T on Husky-C with and without loss balancer. Reproduce Table X degradation to understand boundary conditions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance highly dataset-dependent; BMW results show significant degradation when training/test correlation distributions differ
- Loss balancing shows mixed results, improving some datasets while degrading others
- Transmission savings assume W≥3; small windows yield minimal reduction
- Claims lack independent validation in corpus papers

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: DMH-E architecture design and general framework validity
- **Medium Confidence**: Noise reduction claims (supported by progressive MAE/MSE reductions but lacks ablation on feature grouping alone)
- **Low Confidence**: Universal superiority claims (performance highly dataset-dependent; BMW results specifically contradict robustness claims)

## Next Checks
1. **Correlation Drift Test**: Measure Pearson correlation stability across training/test splits on BMW dataset. If correlations shift >0.2 between sets, the grouping mechanism is fundamentally misaligned.
2. **Transmission Cost Audit**: Instrument DMH-E to log actual bytes transmitted client→server during training. Verify 1/W reduction holds across all window sizes tested.
3. **Loss Balancing Sensitivity**: Systematically test DMH-T with varying training set sizes (5, 10, 50 trials) to characterize when loss balancing helps vs. harms. Compare to simple gradient clipping as baseline.
