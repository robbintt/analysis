# Probabilistic Guarantees for Reducing Contextual Hallucinations in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.00641
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00641
- Authors: Nils Rautenberg; Sven Schippkus
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Provides probabilistic guarantees for reducing contextual hallucinations through repeated executions and voting, with exponential decay in failure probability

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses contextual hallucinations in LLMs by formalizing "specific tasks" as fixed-input scenarios with deterministic correctness criteria. The authors propose a method that achieves probabilistic guarantees against hallucinations by executing the task multiple times independently and using an LLM-as-a-judge to select the correct output. The key insight is that repeated independent executions exponentially reduce the probability that all outputs are incorrect, while majority voting over multiple judge calls further decreases selection error. Experimental validation on three controlled extraction tasks shows exact matches to theoretical predictions.

## Method Summary
The approach involves repeated independent executions of a specific task with fixed inputs, followed by selection of the correct answer using an LLM-as-a-judge. The authors prove that pipeline failure probability decreases exponentially with the number of executions N. When the judge is imperfect, they introduce majority voting over K independent judge calls, showing that ensemble error rates decrease exponentially in K. The method provides explicit probabilistic guarantees for driving hallucination probabilities arbitrarily low without requiring model modifications or prompt engineering.

## Key Results
- Pipeline failure probability decreases exponentially with repetition count N
- Hallucination-selection error decreases exponentially with ensemble size K
- Experimental results on three controlled tasks match theoretical predictions exactly
- Provides explicit probabilistic guarantees for reducing contextual hallucinations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits the statistical independence of multiple LLM executions. When outputs are correct with probability p > 0, the chance that all N independent outputs are wrong decreases as (1-p)^N, approaching zero exponentially. Similarly, judge error can be reduced through majority voting, as the probability of incorrect majority decisions decreases exponentially with the number of independent judge calls.

## Foundational Learning

**Specific Tasks**: Fixed-input scenarios with deterministic outputs - needed to establish well-defined ground truth for correctness evaluation
Quick check: Verify task has unique correct answer given inputs

**Independent Executions**: Multiple LLM runs with same prompt but different sampling - needed to create statistically independent outputs for probability analysis
Quick check: Confirm different outputs across executions through sampling variation

**LLM-as-a-Judge**: Using LLM to evaluate output correctness - needed for automated selection among multiple outputs
Quick check: Verify judge accuracy on known examples before deployment

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Task Prompt -> LLM Execution (repeated N times) -> Judge Prompt -> LLM-as-a-Judge (K times) -> Majority Vote -> Selected Output

**Critical Path**: Task input → LLM executions → judge evaluations → majority voting → final output selection

**Design Tradeoffs**: Multiple executions increase computational cost but provide exponential error reduction; judge accuracy affects required K; task definition determines applicability

**Failure Signatures**: 
- High variance in LLM outputs suggests task may not be "specific"
- Judge consistently selects incorrect outputs indicates poor judge quality
- Majority vote fails despite high N suggests judge accuracy below threshold

**First Experiments**:
1. Test single-task execution with varying N to observe exponential decay
2. Evaluate judge accuracy on synthetic examples to establish q++ and q-+
3. Compare majority voting performance against random selection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Requires multiple independent executions, increasing computational cost
- Effectiveness depends on having a reasonably accurate judge
- No evaluation on truly open-ended generation tasks
- Assumes independent outputs across executions, which may not hold in practice

## Confidence

**Theoretical Framework**: High confidence - mathematically sound proofs for defined task class
**Experimental Validation**: Medium confidence - synthetic judges provide controlled but potentially unrealistic conditions
**Generalizability**: Low confidence - approach untested on open-ended tasks and real-world judges

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on open-ended generation tasks where ground truth is not available
2. Evaluate performance when using different models for execution versus judging
3. Measure computational overhead and cost-effectiveness compared to alternative hallucination mitigation strategies
