# ToC: Tree-of-Claims Search with Multi-Agent Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.16972
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16972
- **Reference count:** 18
- **Primary result:** Novel framework using MCTS and multi-agent LLMs to optimize patent claims, achieving 8-9% improvement in novelty over standard LLMs.

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces Tree of Claims (ToC), a novel framework for patent claim optimization that treats claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system consisting of an EditorAgent, which proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent, which simulates structured patent examiner critiques through chain-of-thought analyses. This architecture enables systematic, stepwise claim revisions guided by a multi-objective reward function that jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8%, and up to 9% in certain cases. The framework's transparent, interpretable, and controllable approach effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning with strategic MCTS planning, producing legally robust and technically sound patent claim revisions.

## Method Summary
ToC redefines patent claim editing as a sequential decision process using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system. The framework employs an EditorAgent to propose contextually grounded edits and an ExaminerAgent to simulate patent examiner critiques via chain-of-thought analyses. The system navigates a search tree where nodes represent claim states and edges represent atomic edit operations, balancing exploration and exploitation through UCT selection. A multi-objective reward function optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence, while epistemic uncertainty gating prunes unreliable paths. The approach enables systematic, stepwise revisions that significantly outperform standard LLM-based methods.

## Key Results
- ToC achieves an average composite score improvement of 8% over standard LLMs in patent claim optimization.
- In certain cases, ToC demonstrates up to 9% improvement in novelty metrics.
- The framework's ablation study confirms the value of uncertainty gating and adversarial feedback mechanisms.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sequential Decision-Making via Search-Space Decomposition
- **Claim:** If patent claim editing is modeled as a sequential decision process rather than a single-shot generation task, the system can navigate the complex trade-off between novelty and scope more effectively.
- **Mechanism:** The architecture decomposes the editing process into a search tree where nodes represent claim states and edges represent atomic edit operations (e.g., `AddNovelFeature`, `ReplaceSynonym`). By utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a Upper Confidence Bound (UCT) selection policy, the system balances exploring new edit paths and exploiting high-reward modifications.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes that the optimal claim can be reached via a finite sequence of discrete, atomic operations and that the reward landscape is smooth enough for search heuristics to navigate.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)... redefines claim editing as a guided search problem."
  - [Page 3, Section 3.1]: "The action space $\mathcal{A}$ includes ten atomic operations... The goal is to find an optimal sequence $A^*$."
  - [Corpus]: Neighbor papers (e.g., "Can AI Examine Novelty of Patents?") focus on assessment, but do not explicitly validate the MCTS-based generative search approach, making this a specific contribution of the paper.
- **Break condition:** If edits have complex inter-dependencies where a later edit invalidates the reasoning of an earlier edit not captured by the local reward function, the search path may become inconsistent.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Agent Adversarial Simulation
- **Claim:** Decoupling the generation of edits from the evaluation of edits into two specialized agents improves legal robustness compared to a single model trying to self-correct.
- **Mechanism:** An **EditorAgent** proposes modifications to maximize novelty, while an **ExaminerAgent** simulates a patent office rejection by analyzing prior art via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This creates a feedback loop where the "Examiner" provides grounded critiques (evidence text, reasoning) that the "Editor" must specifically address, mimicking the real-world prosecution loop.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes the underlying LLM has sufficient domain knowledge to act as a credible patent examiner and that adversarial prompting effectively surface prior art conflicts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 1]: "An LLM-based EditorAgent proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent... mimics patent examiner critiques."
  - [Page 4, Table 2]: Shows the strict prompt separation where the Examiner outputs "Disclosed/NotDisclosed" and the Editor must avoid "trivial paraphrasing."
- **Break condition:** If the ExaminerAgent hallucinates prior art matches or misses valid prior art, the EditorAgent will optimize against incorrect constraints, leading to "Unsupported Novelty" errors (Table 6).

### Mechanism 3: Uncertainty-Gated Pruning
- **Claim:** Filtering search branches based on epistemic uncertainty prevents the system from committing to legally ambiguous or hallucinated edits.
- **Mechanism:** The system uses a $\sigma$-gating mechanism. During the MCTS Selection phase, if the ExaminerAgent's epistemic uncertainty ($\sigma_{epi}$) exceeds a threshold (0.2), the node is pruned or flagged. This forces the search to prioritize edits where the model is confident in the legal reasoning.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes that high epistemic uncertainty in the LLM correlates strongly with legal invalidity or error, and that pruning these paths improves the final aggregate score.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 3, Section 3.2]: "Paths with $\sigma_{epi}(n) > \sigma^{max}_{epi} = 0.2$ are pruned or flagged for human review."
  - [Page 7, Figure 3]: Ablation study showing performance drops when uncertainty control is disabled.
- **Break condition:** If the uncertainty threshold is set too low, the system may reject valid but complex novel edits; if too high, it may hallucinate features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**
  - **Why needed here:** To manage the combinatorial explosion of possible text edits. Standard LLM generation is linear; MCTS allows the system to "look ahead" and evaluate the cumulative reward of edit sequences.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the UCT formula balance visiting promising nodes vs. unexplored nodes in the claim tree?

- **Concept: Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty**
  - **Why needed here:** The framework specifically uses epistemic uncertainty (model doubt) to prune edits, distinguishing it from aleatoric uncertainty (data noise). Understanding this decomposition is required to tune the $\sigma$-gating threshold.
  - **Quick check question:** In the context of the ExaminerAgent, does high aleatoric uncertainty indicate a confusing prior art document or a lack of model knowledge?

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for the ExaminerAgent to generate the "reasoning chains" (status, evidence, rationale) that the EditorAgent uses to fix the claim. Without CoT, the feedback is a binary label, insufficient for targeted editing.
  - **Quick check question:** Why must the ExaminerAgent output strict JSON containing "reasoning" before providing a status?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (Initial Claim $C_0$ + Prior Art $P$) -> Controller (MCTS Loop: Selection -> Expansion -> Simulation -> Backprop) -> Agents (ExaminerAgent: Evaluator, EditorAgent: Generator) -> Constraints (Progressive Widening + Uncertainty Gate)

- **Critical path:**
  1. **ExaminerAgent Analysis:** This is the bottleneck for quality. If the agent fails to map the claim to prior art evidence, the entire reward signal is noise.
  2. **Reward Calculation:** Equation (5) on Page 4 combines Scope, Novelty, and Consistency. Tuning weights $(w_1, ..., w_5)$ is the primary lever for system behavior.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Atomic vs. Complex Edits:** The system restricts actions to 10 atomic types (Table 1). This improves interpretability and control but may require deeper trees to achieve complex semantic shifts that a single "rewrite" prompt could do (albeit less controllably).
  - **Search Budget:** $T_{max} = 800$ iterations is computationally expensive compared to single-pass inference but necessary for the 8-9% gain.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **System Control Failures:** Excessive branching or zero-confidence decisions (Table 6).
  - **Hallucination:** "Unsupported Novelty" occurs if the EditorAgent adds features not grounded in the original disclosure.
  - **JSON Parsing Errors:** Agents occasionally fail to adhere to the strict schema, requiring robust retry logic.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Agent Ablation:** Run the system with only the EditorAgent (using a heuristic reward) vs. the full ExaminerAgent setup to measure the value of adversarial feedback.
  2. **Uncertainty Threshold Sweep:** Vary $\sigma_{epi}^{max}$ (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) to find the optimal balance between exploration and safety.
  3. **Progressive Widening Validation:** Test different $\alpha$ and $\delta$ values to ensure the tree doesn't explode (high compute cost) or starve (too narrow search).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Generalization to Other Domains:** Can the ToC framework and its atomic operations generalize effectively to other structured text domains without extensive re-engineering? The paper states intent to apply the framework to "other structured editing domains such as legal contracts, medical protocols, and scientific methods," but the current atomic operations are specifically tuned for patent claim syntax.

- **Reducing System Control Failures:** How can the framework reduce the incidence of "System Control Failures" and "Unsupported Novelty" without manual intervention? Table 6 reveals these errors account for significant proportions (12.2% and 9.9% respectively), suggesting the $\sigma$-gating mechanism fails to catch all invalid edits.

- **Multimodal Integration:** Does deep multimodal integration (vision-encoding) provide significant gains over text-only claim refinement for figure-heavy patents? The paper lists "incorporating multimodal reasoning for figure-grounded edits" as future work, despite current use of MLLMs.

- **Search Efficiency:** Can the search efficiency be improved to reduce the high iteration/time costs ($T_{max}=800, T_{search}=3600s$) while maintaining solution quality? Section 5 mentions "improving search efficiency through distributed computing" as a future direction.

## Limitations

- The framework's performance is tightly coupled to the quality of the ExaminerAgent's prior art matching and uncertainty estimation.
- The 800-iteration search budget, while yielding 8-9% gains, may not scale efficiently to longer claims or different technical domains.
- The strict JSON schema requirements for agent outputs introduce brittleness, as evidenced by occasional parsing failures in Table 4.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The core MCTS + multi-agent architecture is well-defined and the ablation study (Figure 3) directly supports the value of uncertainty gating and adversarial feedback.
- **Medium confidence:** The novelty improvement metrics are convincing, but the "legal robustness" claims depend on subjective legal interpretation of the generated claims not directly evaluated in the paper.
- **Low confidence:** The specific implementation details for claim decomposition and reward component calculation are underspecified, making exact replication challenging.

## Next Checks

1. **Reward Decomposition Validation:** Implement and test the three reward components (coverage, novelty, consistency) independently to verify they align with the claimed legal metrics before integrating them.
2. **Uncertainty Threshold Sensitivity:** Run controlled experiments varying $\sigma_{epi}^{max}$ (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) on a held-out validation set to find the optimal balance between exploration and pruning.
3. **Progressive Widening Parameter Sweep:** Test the $\alpha$ parameter across a wider range (0.1 to 2.0) to resolve the discrepancy between Section 3.4 ($\alpha=2.0$) and Section 4.4 ($\alpha=0.6$) and ensure robust performance.
