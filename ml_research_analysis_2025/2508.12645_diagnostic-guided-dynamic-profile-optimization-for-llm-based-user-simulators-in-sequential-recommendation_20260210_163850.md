# Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization for LLM-based User Simulators in Sequential Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.12645
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12645
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: DGDPO framework achieves 23.60-28.78% relative improvements in Precision over baselines by iteratively optimizing user profiles and enabling multi-round interactions

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses critical limitations in existing LLM-based user simulators for recommender systems, specifically static profile construction and unrealistic single-round interactions. The authors propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization), a framework that iteratively refines user profiles through a specialized diagnostic module and generalized treatment module. The framework achieves 92.20% accuracy in identifying profile defects and demonstrates significant performance improvements across three real-world datasets. Additionally, DGDPO integrates with sequential recommenders to enable realistic bidirectional evolution between user profiles and recommendation strategies.

## Method Summary
The DGDPO framework splits user interaction history into initial and optimization portions, creating an initial profile via single-step prompting. It then traverses the optimization history, collecting discrepancy cases where simulated behavior mismatches real user actions. A specialized diagnostic module (Qwen3-0.6B) identifies defect types (Inaccurate, Incomplete, or both), and a generalized treatment module (GPT-4o-mini) generates targeted refinements. The framework also integrates with sequential recommenders for multi-round interactions, enabling bidirectional evolution where both user profiles and recommendation strategies dynamically adapt based on feedback.

## Key Results
- DGDPO achieves 23.60%, 28.78%, and 19.17% relative improvements in Precision over baseline methods on ML-1M, Amazon Books, and Amazon Movies & TV datasets respectively
- Specialized diagnostic module reaches 92.20% accuracy in defect identification, significantly outperforming general-purpose LLMs (62.78%)
- Bidirectional evolution with sequential recommenders demonstrates realistic multi-round interactions where profiles and recommendation strategies co-evolve

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Specialized Diagnostic Module for Defect Identification
The framework employs a two-stage training strategy for a lightweight LLM (Qwen3-0.6B), first performing domain-adaptive pre-training on simulated user interactions, then defect-specific fine-tuning on synthetic data with artificially injected profile defects. This transforms the model into a specialized "expert" for diagnosing profile flaws, achieving 92.20% accuracy compared to 62.78% for general-purpose LLMs.

### Mechanism 2: Iterative Profile Refinement Guided by Diagnosed Discrepancies
By traversing user interaction history step-by-step and identifying discrepancies between simulated and real behavior, the framework enables dynamic profile refinement. When discrepancies occur, the diagnostic module identifies defect types, and the treatment module generates targeted corrections, creating an iterative loop that accumulates improvements over time.

### Mechanism 3: Bidirectional Evolution with Sequential Recommenders
Integrating the optimized user simulator with sequential recommenders creates a realistic multi-round interaction loop where user profiles and recommendation strategies evolve bidirectionally. This co-evolution captures the mutual influence missing in static evaluations, better reflecting real-world feedback systems.

## Foundational Learning

- **User Simulation in Recommender Systems** - Why needed: DGDPO aims to improve simulator fidelity for controllable, ethical evaluation; Quick check: Why are real users problematic for recommender system development and evaluation?
- **Sequential Recommendation** - Why needed: The paper integrates simulators with SRs for multi-round evolution; Quick check: How does sequential recommendation differ from static approaches in modeling user preferences?
- **Profile Defect: Inaccurate vs. Incomplete** - Why needed: Core to DGDPO's diagnostic mechanism; Quick check: If a profile says a user loves action movies but they rate a romantic comedy highly, is the profile more likely inaccurate or incomplete?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Data (D_u^(ini), D_u^(opt)) -> Initialization Module -> DGDPO Loop (Discrepancy Collector -> Specialized Diagnostic Module -> Generalized Treatment Module) -> Bidirectional Evolution Module -> Output (Optimized profile)
- **Critical path:** Success hinges on the Specialized Diagnostic Module's accuracy - misdiagnoses lead to incorrect refinements that propagate through the iterative loop
- **Design tradeoffs:** Uses small specialized model for diagnosis (higher accuracy on critical task) vs. large general model for treatment; split ratio α=0.6 balances initialization vs. optimization data; update strategies balance realism vs. performance stability
- **Failure signatures:** Profile drift/incoherence from contradictory refinements, synthetic data mismatch causing diagnostic failures, hallucinated treatment suggestions not grounded in interaction data
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Train diagnostic module on synthetic data and evaluate accuracy vs. GPT-4o-mini; 2) Ablate α split ratio to find stable operating range; 3) Implement bidirectional evolution loop with SASRec and compare update strategies over 5-10 rounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Practical dynamic updates without ground truth:** How can user simulators achieve robust profile updates when ground-truth interaction data is unavailable? The realistic "Update w/o GT" strategy depends heavily on the recommender ranking ground truth items highly, failing when the recommender is suboptimal.

2. **Optimal model size for specialized tasks:** Why does increasing parameter size of the diagnostic LLM degrade performance? The paper observes Qwen3-0.6B outperforms Qwen3-1.7B, suggesting task requirements should guide scaling rather than model size alone.

3. **Scalability to industrial sequences:** Can dynamic optimization maintain efficiency when applied to industrial-scale interaction sequences? The framework's step-by-step traversal cost on sequences >1000 items remains unanalyzed, with evaluation focusing only on fidelity metrics.

## Limitations

- Synthetic data generation for diagnostic training lacks independent validation showing real-world defect representation
- Profile coherence may degrade over many optimization iterations, potentially introducing contradictions
- LLM simulator decisions may not faithfully capture real user behavior complexity, limiting practical applicability

## Confidence

- Diagnostic module efficacy: Medium - Strong synthetic results but unproven on natural defects
- Iterative optimization improvement: Medium - Ablation studies show benefits but mechanism could fail with profile drift
- Bidirectional evolution benefits: Medium - Integration demonstrated but real-world dynamics unverified

## Next Checks

1. Validate diagnostic module on held-out real discrepancy cases where true defect types are known
2. Monitor profile coherence metrics during multi-round optimization to detect drift
3. Compare simulator behavior against actual user interaction patterns on the same datasets
