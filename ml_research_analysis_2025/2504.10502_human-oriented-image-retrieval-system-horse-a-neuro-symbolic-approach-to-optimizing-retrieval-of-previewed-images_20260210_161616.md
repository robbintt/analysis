# Human-Oriented Image Retrieval System (HORSE): A Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Optimizing Retrieval of Previewed Images

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.10502
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10502
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** HORSE integrates cognitive science with neuro-symbolic computing to retrieve images via natural language by indexing meaningful objects and their spatial relationships

## Executive Summary
HORSE presents a neuro-symbolic approach to human-oriented image retrieval that addresses the challenge of retrieving images based on natural language descriptions. The method integrates cognitive science insights with advanced computational techniques, combining neural networks for pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning for interpretability. HORSE extracts human cognitive retrieval patterns and translates them into neuro-symbolic meta-rules, enabling indexing based on meaningful objects, their properties, and spatial relationships. The system processes natural language queries through NLP modules and retrieves images by matching against the indexed database. This approach creates a more intuitive retrieval experience aligned with human memory and description capabilities, bridging the gap between human visual perception and computational systems while offering improved accessibility and efficiency compared to traditional image retrieval engines.

## Method Summary
HORSE employs a neuro-symbolic pipeline to optimize image retrieval based on human cognitive patterns. The method extracts human retrieval patterns (objects, spatial relations, properties) and translates them into neuro-symbolic meta-rules. Neural components (CNNs/ViTs) detect objects and properties, while symbolic components apply logical constraints and spatial reasoning over these detections. The system indexes images not by pixels but by their symbolic representation (Object A + Relation + Object B). An NLP module parses user queries to extract "query objects and relations" which are matched directly against the indexed database of "meaningful objects and relations," bypassing the semantic ambiguity of keyword matching.

## Key Results
- HORSE bridges the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level human concepts through neuro-symbolic meta-rules
- The system creates a more intuitive retrieval experience aligned with human memory and description capabilities
- HORSE offers improved accessibility and efficiency compared to traditional image retrieval engines by mimicking human cognitive encoding patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cognitive Alignment via Neuro-Symbolic Meta-Rules
The system posits that retrieval relevance increases if the indexing strategy mirrors human cognitive encoding patterns—specifically, how humans compress visual memory into semantic "gists" and spatial relations—rather than relying solely on pixel-level feature vectors. HORSE extracts "human retrieval patterns" (e.g., objects, relative size, spatial position) and translates them into explicit neuro-symbolic meta-rules. These rules structure the index, prioritizing semantic objects and their relationships over raw texture or color histograms. The core assumption is that human visual memory operates primarily on object hierarchies and spatial relations, and computational systems that mimic this structure will retrieve results perceived as more relevant by users.

### Mechanism 2: Hybrid Reasoning (Neural Perception + Symbolic Constraint)
By decoupling perception (neural) from reasoning (symbolic), the system can handle complex natural language queries that require logical inference (e.g., "object A is left of object B") which pure neural embeddings often blur. Neural components detect objects and properties while symbolic components apply logical constraints and spatial reasoning over these detections. This allows the system to filter results based on explicit relational logic rather than just vector proximity. The core assumption is that object detection is sufficiently accurate to feed the symbolic layer, and logical constraints derived from language map cleanly to geometric spatial relations in 2D/3D space.

### Mechanism 3: Natural Language to Structured Query Mapping
Retrieval of "previewed images" via natural language description is optimized by parsing linguistic descriptions into the same symbolic object-relation schema used for indexing, creating a 1:1 mapping between query intent and index structure. An NLP module parses user queries to extract "query objects and relations" which are matched directly against the indexed database of "meaningful objects and relations," bypassing the semantic ambiguity of keyword matching. The core assumption is that users naturally describe images in terms of objects and spatial relations that the system has pre-defined in its meta-rules.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy)**
- Why needed here: This is the architectural core. You must understand how "sub-symbolic" learning (pattern matching in neural nets) differs from "symbolic" reasoning (logic, rules, knowledge graphs) and why combining them mitigates the "black box" problem.
- Quick check question: Can you distinguish between a system that recognizes a "red ball" via pixel patterns vs. one that identifies "red" and "ball" as distinct symbols and combines them?

**Concept: Scene Graphs & Spatial Relations**
- Why needed here: HORSE indexes images not as whole vectors but as structures of objects and their inter-relations (e.g., <car, on, road>). Understanding how to represent images as graphs rather than grids is essential.
- Quick check question: How would you represent the sentence "A cup is on a table near a window" as a structured data format for a database?

**Concept: Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) vs. Semantic Retrieval**
- Why needed here: The paper positions itself against traditional CBIR (color/texture histograms). You need to know the limitations of low-level features (the "semantic gap") to understand why HORSE uses high-level semantic objects.
- Quick check question: Why might two images with identical color histograms be perceived by a human as completely different subjects?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
1. **Perception Layer (Neural):** Object Detectors (OCR/CNNs) extract "Meaningful Objects" and properties (color, size)
2. **Cognitive/Rule Layer (Symbolic):** Translates detections into "Meta-Rules" (spatial relations, relative size)
3. **Indexing Layer:** Stores images not by pixels, but by their symbolic representation (Object A + Relation + Object B)
4. **Query Interface:** NLP Parser extracts entities/relations from text -> matches against Index

**Critical path:** The **Neural-to-Symbolic Translation** (Step 3.1-3.3). If the object detection is inaccurate or the spatial relation logic is rigid, the entire index contains garbage data ("Garbage In, Garbage Out" at the symbolic level).

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Interpretability vs. Flexibility:** The symbolic approach makes the search explainable ("I showed you this because it contains a car left of a tree") but brittle compared to fluid vector embeddings
- **Pre-processing vs. Query Speed:** High upfront cost to analyze and index relations vs. very fast logical querying

**Failure signatures:**
- **The "Empty Set" Failure:** Over-constrained symbolic rules (e.g., strict spatial definitions of "left") result in zero matches even when relevant images exist
- **The "Hallucinated Fact" Failure:** Misdetection (e.g., seeing a face in a cloud) leads to nonsensical symbolic indexing

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Unit Test the Perception-to-Symbol Pipeline:** Feed synthetic images with known object placements to verify if the spatial relation logic (e.g., "above," "left") is calculated correctly
2. **A/B Test against Vector Search:** Compare HORSE's retrieval success rate on spatially complex queries (e.g., "man holding a red apple") against a standard CLIP-based embedding search
3. **Stress Test the NLP Parser:** Input varied linguistic descriptions for the same image to see if the query parser consistently extracts the correct symbolic intent

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** How should personalized memory pattern mechanisms be designed to adapt HORSE to individual users' visual perception and recall differences?
- Basis in paper: "individual differences in visual perception and memory remain a challenge. Future iterations of HORSE could benefit from personalization mechanisms that learn individual users' recall patterns and adjust accordingly."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation uses generalized meta-rules derived from aggregate human cognitive patterns, without mechanisms to adapt to user-specific memory encoding styles.
- What evidence would resolve it: A user study comparing retrieval accuracy between personalized and generalized models, showing statistically significant improvements when individual recall patterns are incorporated.

**Open Question 2:** How can HORSE's neuro-symbolic framework be extended to handle temporal relationships and motion patterns for video retrieval?
- Basis in paper: "the current implementation primarily focuses on static images. Extending the framework to video retrieval would require additional considerations for temporal relationships and motion patterns, which are crucial aspects of human memory for dynamic visual content."
- Why unresolved: The existing meta-rules address spatial relationships, object properties, and static semantic meaning, but temporal dynamics introduce additional complexity in both indexing and query interpretation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of temporal meta-rules and a benchmark comparison against existing video retrieval systems on natural language video queries.

**Open Question 3:** Do the extracted human cognitive meta-rules generalize across culturally diverse populations, or are they biased toward specific cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: "Cross-Cultural Validation: Testing the system across diverse cultural contexts to ensure that the extracted meta-rules generalize across different user populations."
- Why unresolved: The meta-rules are derived from cognitive science research that may not fully represent cross-cultural variation in how humans perceive, encode, and describe visual information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-cultural user studies demonstrating comparable retrieval performance across populations from different cultural backgrounds using the same meta-rule set.

**Open Question 4:** How robust is HORSE's retrieval accuracy when upstream object detection errors propagate through the symbolic reasoning layer?
- Basis in paper: "the extraction of accurate spatial relationships depends on reliable object detection and scene understanding, which remain active research areas. Errors in object recognition can propagate through the system, potentially affecting retrieval accuracy."
- Why unresolved: No error analysis or sensitivity study is provided quantifying how detection failures at Step 3.1 impact final retrieval quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments injecting controlled object detection errors and measuring retrieval degradation, with analysis of failure modes in the neuro-symbolic pipeline.

## Limitations

- The neuro-symbolic meta-rules are described abstractly but lack precise mathematical formulation or implementation details
- The NLP query processing component is mentioned but not detailed, with no mechanism specified for handling linguistic variation or ambiguous spatial prepositions
- No empirical validation or quantitative performance metrics are provided to support claims about improved retrieval relevance and efficiency

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the general neuro-symbolic architecture combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning for interpretability
- **Medium confidence** in the proposed indexing strategy based on objects and spatial relationships, as this aligns with established cognitive science findings but lacks empirical validation in this specific implementation
- **Low confidence** in the specific implementation details of the NLP query parser and the exact formulation of neuro-symbolic meta-rules

## Next Checks

1. **Unit Test the Perception-to-Symbol Pipeline:** Feed synthetic images with known object placements to verify if the spatial relation logic (e.g., "above," "left") is calculated correctly and consistently

2. **A/B Test against Vector Search:** Compare HORSE's retrieval success rate on spatially complex queries (e.g., "man holding a red apple") against a standard CLIP-based embedding search to quantify the claimed performance benefits

3. **Stress Test the NLP Parser:** Input varied linguistic descriptions for the same image to assess how consistently the query parser extracts the correct symbolic intent, particularly with synonyms, ambiguous language, and complex metaphors
