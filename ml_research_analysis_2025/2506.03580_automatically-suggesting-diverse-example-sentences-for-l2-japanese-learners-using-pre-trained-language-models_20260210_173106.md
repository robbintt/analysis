# Automatically Suggesting Diverse Example Sentences for L2 Japanese Learners Using Pre-Trained Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03580
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03580
- Authors: Enrico Benedetti; Akiko Aizawa; Florian Boudin
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Retrieval-based PLM approach outperforms generative baselines for L2 Japanese example sentences

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the use of pre-trained language models for generating and retrieving example sentences for L2 Japanese learners, focusing on difficulty, diversity, and naturalness. The research compares a retrieval system using multiple PLM-based quality scores against two PLM generation baselines (LLM-jp and GPT-3.5). Human raters and GPT-4 evaluated the outputs across different proficiency levels. The retrieval approach demonstrated superior performance overall, particularly for beginner and advanced learners, while generative methods produced lower scores due to repetitive and unnatural outputs.

## Method Summary
The research employed a mixed-methods approach comparing retrieval and generation techniques for L2 Japanese example sentence suggestion. A retrieval system combining multiple PLM-based quality scores was developed and compared with two PLM generation baselines. Human evaluation involved both learners and native speakers assessing outputs across proficiency levels, supplemented by GPT-4 evaluations. The study measured inter-rater agreement and analyzed output quality across different learner levels, with particular attention to difficulty matching, diversity, and naturalness of generated or retrieved sentences.

## Key Results
- Retrieval-based PLM approach was preferred overall by human raters and GPT-4 evaluations
- Generative methods (LLM-jp and GPT-3.5) received lower scores due to repetitive and unnatural outputs
- Retrieval approach showed particular effectiveness for beginner and advanced proficiency levels
- Moderate inter-rater agreement was observed except for difficulty assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The retrieval approach leverages pre-trained language models to identify and score existing example sentences that match learner proficiency levels, ensuring higher quality and more natural outputs compared to generation methods. By combining multiple PLM-based quality scores, the system can better assess sentence appropriateness across difficulty, diversity, and naturalness dimensions simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning
- PLM-based scoring systems (why needed: to evaluate sentence quality across multiple dimensions; quick check: verify scoring consistency across raters)
- Japanese language proficiency assessment (why needed: to match sentences to appropriate learner levels; quick check: validate difficulty level categorization)
- Human evaluation methodology in NLP (why needed: to gather reliable feedback on language learning materials; quick check: ensure inter-rater agreement thresholds)
- GPT-4 as evaluation tool (why needed: to provide consistent automated assessment; quick check: compare GPT-4 scores with human ratings)

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Quality Scorer -> Difficulty Matcher -> Diversity Filter -> Output Selector
**Critical Path**: Input query → Quality scoring → Difficulty matching → Diversity filtering → Final output selection
**Design Tradeoffs**: Retrieval provides higher quality but limited variety vs generation offers unlimited variety but inconsistent quality
**Failure Signatures**: Repetitive outputs in generation, mismatched difficulty levels in retrieval, low diversity scores
**First Experiments**:
1. Test quality scoring consistency across different PLM models
2. Validate difficulty matching accuracy for beginner level sentences
3. Measure diversity metrics for retrieved vs generated outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Moderate inter-rater agreement for difficulty assessment suggests potential subjectivity in learner-level matching
- Reliance on GPT-4 as both evaluation tool and comparative standard introduces circularity concerns
- Dataset focuses on general proficiency levels without considering specific learning contexts or grammatical points

## Confidence
- Retrieval approach superiority: High
- Quality issues in generative outputs: Medium
- PLM suitability for L2 applications: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct large-scale human evaluation with diverse learner populations across multiple proficiency levels to validate difficulty assessment reliability
2. Implement A/B testing comparing retrieval and generation approaches in actual learning contexts to measure impact on vocabulary acquisition
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability of the retrieval system under realistic usage patterns
