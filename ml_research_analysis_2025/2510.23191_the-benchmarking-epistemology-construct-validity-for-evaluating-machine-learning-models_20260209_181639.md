# The Benchmarking Epistemology: Construct Validity for Evaluating Machine Learning Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.23191
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23191
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** The paper develops a framework for assessing when predictive benchmark scores can support substantive scientific inferences by adapting construct validity theory from psychology.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a framework for evaluating when predictive benchmark scores support substantive scientific inferences in machine learning. Drawing from construct validity theory in psychometrics, the authors introduce four validity conditions—internal, external, content, and consequential—organized around an argument-based account of validity. Through three case studies (ImageNet, WeatherBench, and the Fragile Families Challenge), they demonstrate how validity conditions constrain the scope of inference and clarify that stronger theoretical claims require progressively stronger validity evidence. The framework provides a shared language for evaluating predictive benchmarks and their scientific meaning.

## Method Summary
The paper adapts construct validity theory from psychology to develop a framework for evaluating predictive benchmarks in machine learning. The core method treats benchmarking as a logical inference problem: $M(F) \land A \to I$, where measurements $M(F)$ are linked to scientific inferences $I$ through validity assumptions $A$. The framework introduces four validity conditions organized around an argument-based account of validity. Through case studies, the authors demonstrate how to apply this framework by examining ImageNet (model rankings vs. absolute performance), WeatherBench (deployment readiness), and the Fragile Families Challenge (inherent unpredictability claims). The method provides a systematic approach to audit whether benchmark scores can support intended scientific inferences.

## Key Results
- Predictive benchmarks require explicit validity conditions to support scientific inferences beyond basic error estimation
- Model rankings are more robust to distribution shifts than absolute performance scores
- Stronger theoretical inferences require progressively stronger validity evidence across internal, external, content, and consequential conditions
- The Fragile Families Challenge results do not justify claims about life's inherent unpredictability without additional auxiliary validity assumptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Benchmark scores function as valid scientific measurements only when explicit validity conditions bridge the gap between empirical error rates and theoretical constructs. The framework adopts an argument-based account of validity, treating benchmarking as a logical inference problem: $M(F) \land A \to I$. Here, $M(F)$ represents empirical measurements, $A$ represents validity conditions, and $I$ is the intended scientific inference. If validity conditions fail, the inference is logically invalid regardless of score precision. This shifts the focus from whether a benchmark is "valid" to whether the reasoning connecting score to claim is valid.

### Mechanism 2
The validity requirements scale with the "theoretical distance" between measurement and intended inference. The paper establishes a gradient of validity types: internal validity supports basic statistical estimation, external and content validity map performance to theoretical tasks, and consequential and auxiliary validity are required for high-stakes deployment or theoretical discoveries. As claims become more theoretical, the evidentiary burden shifts from statistical to conceptual. Validity is not binary but gradual—a benchmark can be valid for rankings but invalid for measuring absolute progress.

### Mechanism 3
Model rankings (ordinal relationships) are more robust to distribution shifts and validity threats than absolute error rates. In the ImageNet case study, while absolute performance drops significantly under distribution shift, the relative ordering of models often remains stable. This suggests benchmarks are more reliable as tools for measuring relative engineering progress than absolute task competence. Systematic biases affecting models similarly preserve ordinal rank even if absolute scores are inflated or deflated.

## Foundational Learning

### Construct Validity (Argument-Based)
- **Why needed:** This is the central theoretical machinery. Unlike a "property" view (where a test is valid), the argument-based view treats validity as the logical soundness of the chain from score to claim.
- **Quick check:** Can you explicitly write down the "Intended Inference" and the "Validity Assumptions" required to make your latest benchmark result meaningful?

### Operationalization (Intensional vs. Extensional)
- **Why needed:** The paper distinguishes between the theoretical task (intensional, e.g., "image classification") and the dataset instantiation (extensional, e.g., ImageNet). Content validity depends on the quality of this mapping.
- **Quick check:** Is your benchmark measuring the theoretical construct you care about, or is it measuring the ability to recognize specific idiosyncrasies of your dataset?

### Auxiliary Hypotheses in Science
- **Why needed:** In the FFC case study, the inference "life is unpredictable" relies on auxiliary assumptions that the dataset contains enough signal and that models are sufficiently expressive. If these fail, the theoretical inference is invalid.
- **Quick check:** If your model fails to predict an outcome, can you distinguish between "the phenomenon is random" and "we just haven't measured the right variables"?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Measurement Target (theoretical construct) -> Operationalization (Dataset + Metric) -> Validity Layer (Internal, External, Content, Consequential) -> Inference Engine (logical step from score to claim)

### Critical path
1. Define Intended Inference: Explicitly state what the score is supposed to mean
2. Audit Validity Conditions: Check Internal (leakage?), Content (right task?), and Consequential (metric reflects utility?)
3. Constrain the Claim: If validity evidence is weak, downgrade the claim (e.g., from "safe for deployment" to "promising prototype")

### Design tradeoffs
- **General vs. Specific:** A generic benchmark (ImageNet) supports general progress tracking (rankings) but fails specific deployment inferences (consequential validity). A custom benchmark supports specific claims but lacks external generalizability.
- **Metric Complexity:** Simple metrics (Accuracy) are easy to interpret but may lack consequential validity (utility). Complex metrics (custom utility functions) are harder to optimize but better aligned with real-world value.

### Failure signatures
- **"Thinning the world":** Over-relying on a single metric reduces the rich concept of a task (e.g., "vision") to a narrow proxy (e.g., "top-5 accuracy on ImageNet")
- **The Benchmark Lottery:** Selecting benchmarks post-hoc that flatter a specific model, rather than testing the intended construct
- **Adaptivity/Overfitting:** The "Ladder" effect where models overfit to the static test set, destroying internal validity

### First 3 experiments
1. **Internal Validity Check (Fresh Holdout):** Create a new test set using the exact same data collection pipeline but different samples. If scores drop significantly relative to the leaderboard, internal validity is compromised by overfitting.
2. **Content Validity Check (Concept Audit):** Map the dataset classes to the theoretical construct. If 12% of your "object recognition" dataset is dog breeds, is it measuring object recognition or dog breeding?
3. **Consequential Validity Check (Proxy Correlation):** For high-stakes domains, correlate the benchmark metric with a ground-truth utility metric. If correlation is low, the benchmark cannot support deployment decisions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can convergent and discriminant validity be rigorously operationalized to assess complex, interconnected capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs)?
- **Basis:** Section 7.1 highlights the difficulty of measuring constructs like morality or theory of mind and suggests verifying correlations with related constructs (convergent) and lack thereof with unrelated ones (discriminant).
- **Why unresolved:** Theoretical grounding for these complex constructs is currently weak, making it hard to avoid construct underrepresentation or irrelevance.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies demonstrating that LLM benchmarks correlate strongly with theoretically similar tasks but not with unrelated ones.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How do power dynamics and the "Benchmark Lottery" influence the validity and direction of scientific progress in machine learning?
- **Basis:** Section 7.2 asks "Who holds the power to establish benchmarks within a community?" and cites the "Benchmark Lottery" as a factor that shapes research practices.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper focuses on the epistemic validity of individual scores rather than the social epistemology or community-level effects of benchmark dominance.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal studies tracking methodological diversity and research outcomes in fields dominated by single benchmarks versus pluralistic evaluation landscapes.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What are the theoretical boundaries where predictive benchmarks cease to be valid measurement tools and instead risk "thinning the world"?
- **Basis:** Section 7.3 asks "what can, and what cannot, be meaningfully measured" by benchmarks, noting the risk of emphasizing metrics at the expense of unquantifiable aspects.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper identifies the risk but does not offer a formal criterion or method to delineate the limits of quantification for complex constructs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Case studies where high benchmark performance fails to align with real-world efficacy due to the exclusion of resistant-to-quantification variables.

## Limitations
- The framework's applicability depends critically on the availability of ground truth for validity assessment, which may not exist for novel domains
- Content validity assessment is inherently subjective, requiring domain expertise to judge whether operationalizations capture theoretical constructs
- The consequential validity condition is particularly challenging to verify in practice, as it requires establishing a clear link between benchmark performance and real-world utility

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The argument-based framework for validity and the four-condition structure (Internal, External, Content, Consequential) are well-supported by existing literature in psychometrics and measurement theory
- **Medium confidence:** The case studies demonstrate the framework's practical utility, though they rely on published results rather than primary data collection
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that ordinal relationships are more robust than absolute scores requires further empirical validation across diverse distribution shifts

## Next Checks
1. **External Validity Quantification:** Calculate Spearman rank correlation coefficients between ImageNet leaderboard scores and performance on alternative image datasets (ImageNet-V2, CIFAR-10, ObjectNet) to quantify the strength of generalization claims.
2. **Content Validity Audit:** For a domain-specific benchmark (e.g., medical diagnosis), map dataset classes and evaluation metrics to the intended theoretical construct. Calculate the proportion of dataset content that directly measures the target capability versus ancillary skills.
3. **Consequential Validity Calibration:** For a deployed ML system (e.g., weather forecasting), correlate benchmark metrics (RMSE) with actual deployment utility (energy grid efficiency, economic impact) to establish whether the benchmark score supports consequential inferences.
