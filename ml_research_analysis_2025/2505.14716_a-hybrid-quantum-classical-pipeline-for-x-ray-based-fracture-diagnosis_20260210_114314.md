# A Hybrid Quantum Classical Pipeline for X Ray Based Fracture Diagnosis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.14716
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14716
- Reference count: 40
- A hybrid quantum-classical pipeline achieves 99% accuracy in fracture diagnosis using X-ray images

## Executive Summary
This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical pipeline that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a 4-qubit quantum amplitude encoding circuit for X-ray-based fracture diagnosis. The approach addresses limitations of traditional and deep learning methods by reducing computational complexity while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. By fusing classical and quantum-derived features into a 16-dimensional vector, the system achieves 99% accuracy in classifying fractures using various machine learning models, matching state-of-the-art transfer learning performance while reducing feature extraction time by 82%.

## Method Summary
The pipeline integrates classical PCA for initial dimensionality reduction with a quantum amplitude encoding circuit for feature enrichment. X-ray images are first processed through PCA to extract eight principal components, then encoded into a 4-qubit quantum circuit using amplitude encoding techniques. The quantum circuit processes these features to generate eight additional quantum-enhanced features. These 16 features (8 classical + 8 quantum) are then fed into various classical machine learning classifiers including logistic regression, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors for fracture classification. The hybrid approach aims to leverage quantum computing's potential for handling high-dimensional data while maintaining the reliability of classical machine learning algorithms.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99% accuracy in classifying fractures using hybrid quantum-classical features
- Matched state-of-the-art transfer learning model performance while reducing feature extraction time by 82%
- Successfully integrated 8 PCA-derived features with 8 quantum-enhanced features into a 16-dimensional classification vector

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach works by combining the strengths of classical and quantum computing paradigms. PCA provides efficient dimensionality reduction of X-ray images, extracting the most relevant features while reducing noise. The quantum amplitude encoding circuit then processes these features in a high-dimensional quantum state space, potentially capturing complex patterns and correlations that classical methods might miss. By fusing these classical and quantum features, the system creates a rich representation that maintains computational efficiency while enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

Quantum Amplitude Encoding
- Why needed: Allows efficient representation of classical data in quantum states, enabling quantum algorithms to process high-dimensional feature spaces
- Quick check: Verify that the 4-qubit circuit can properly encode 8 classical features through appropriate amplitude distribution

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Why needed: Reduces dimensionality of X-ray images while preserving most variance, addressing the curse of dimensionality
- Quick check: Confirm that 8 principal components capture sufficient variance (typically >95%) from the original image data

Feature Fusion Techniques
- Why needed: Combines complementary information from classical and quantum feature sets to create more discriminative representations
- Quick check: Validate that the 16-dimensional fused feature vector provides better classification performance than either source alone

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Raw X-ray images -> PCA dimensionality reduction -> Quantum amplitude encoding circuit -> Feature fusion -> Classical ML classifiers -> Fracture diagnosis

Critical Path:
Image preprocessing → PCA feature extraction → Quantum circuit processing → Feature fusion → Classification

Design Tradeoffs:
- Uses 4-qubit quantum circuit to balance quantum advantage with current hardware limitations
- Combines 8 classical + 8 quantum features to optimize information content vs. computational complexity
- Selects multiple classical ML models to ensure robustness across different fracture types

Failure Signatures:
- Poor PCA performance if images have inconsistent preprocessing or normalization
- Quantum circuit may underperform if amplitude encoding doesn't capture relevant patterns
- Classification accuracy drops if feature fusion doesn't properly weight classical and quantum contributions

First 3 Experiments:
1. Test PCA alone on fracture detection to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate quantum circuit with random features to assess baseline quantum contribution
3. Compare hybrid approach against transfer learning models on the same dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations

- The 1,200-image dataset may not be representative of diverse clinical populations, raising generalization concerns
- The 4-qubit quantum architecture may not scale effectively for more complex diagnostic tasks or larger feature spaces
- Lack of comparison with alternative classical feature extraction methods beyond baseline PCA

## Confidence

- High confidence: The hybrid pipeline architecture and integration methodology are well-defined and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The claimed accuracy improvements over traditional methods, given the small dataset size and potential overfitting concerns
- Low confidence: The scalability of the 4-qubit quantum approach to more complex diagnostic scenarios and larger clinical datasets

## Next Checks

1. Validate the model's performance across multiple, larger, and more diverse X-ray datasets from different medical institutions to assess generalization capability
2. Compare the hybrid approach against other classical feature extraction methods (e.g., wavelet transforms, dictionary learning) to confirm the 82% time improvement is meaningful
3. Test the quantum circuit's performance with increased qubit counts and feature dimensions to evaluate scalability for more complex fracture patterns and additional diagnostic criteria
