# Exploring the Vertical-Domain Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.22443
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22443
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: LLMs show promise for accounting tasks but require significant improvements in domain knowledge integration, reasoning stability, and numerical accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study investigates accounting reasoning capabilities of large language models using two benchmarks: a Multi-Calculation Benchmark derived from GSM8K and an Accounting Reasoning Benchmark based on professional exam questions. Few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting improved performance by approximately 50%, with GPT-4 achieving highest accuracy on general reasoning (16.58%) while GLM-4 slightly outperformed on accounting-specific reasoning (21.78%). However, accuracy dropped significantly with increasing complexity, falling to around 40% for the most complex problems. Error analysis revealed that over 50% of failures stemmed from misunderstanding accounting principles and insufficient conceptual knowledge coverage.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates LLMs using Few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting across two benchmarks: a Multi-Calculation Benchmark (586 problems from filtered GSM8K requiring ≥3 computation steps) and an Accounting Reasoning Benchmark based on Chinese CPA exam questions. Models including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and GPT-4 are evaluated using automated correctness judgments from GLM-4. Error analysis classifies failures into six categories including principle misunderstanding, knowledge coverage gaps, and arithmetic inconsistencies. The methodology relies on GSM8K-style Few-shot-CoT templates with 3-shot examples.

## Key Results
- Few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting improved accounting reasoning accuracy by approximately 50% compared to Zero-shot approaches
- GPT-4 achieved highest accuracy on general reasoning tasks (16.58%) while GLM-4 slightly outperformed on accounting-specific reasoning (21.78%)
- Accuracy dropped significantly as reasoning complexity increased, falling to around 40% for the most complex problems
- Over 50% of failures stemmed from misunderstanding accounting principles and insufficient conceptual knowledge coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves accounting reasoning accuracy by approximately 50% compared to Zero-shot approaches.
- Mechanism: Providing explicit reasoning examples with intermediate steps guides the model to decompose multi-step accounting problems into sequential operations, reducing logical inconsistencies between reasoning chains and final answers.
- Core assumption: The improvement stems from learned reasoning patterns rather than surface-level pattern matching.
- Evidence anchors: Experimental statistics show that under Few-shot-CoT, model accuracy improves by approximately 50 percent.
- Break condition: If reasoning steps become inconsistent with final answers under Zero-shot conditions, Few-shot CoT may not fully address deeper reasoning gaps.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Accounting reasoning accuracy degrades non-linearly as reasoning complexity increases.
- Mechanism: Multi-step accounting problems require error propagation control across sequential operations; failures in intermediate steps compound, leading to incorrect final conclusions even when individual operations are simple.
- Core assumption: The degradation is due to reasoning chain instability rather than prompt design.
- Evidence anchors: Accuracy dropped significantly as reasoning complexity increased, falling to around 40% for the most complex problems.
- Break condition: If error analysis reveals failures are primarily due to misunderstanding rather than propagation, the mechanism may be misattributed.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Over 50% of accounting reasoning failures stem from principle-level misunderstanding and insufficient conceptual knowledge coverage.
- Mechanism: General-purpose LLMs lack deep integration of domain-specific accounting standards, leading to correct procedural reasoning applied to incorrect conceptual premises.
- Core assumption: This error distribution reflects fundamental knowledge gaps rather than prompt ambiguity.
- Evidence anchors: Error analysis revealed that over 50% of failures stemmed from misunderstanding accounting principles and insufficient conceptual knowledge coverage.
- Break condition: If prompts explicitly state relevant principles and error rates remain unchanged, knowledge integration may not be the primary bottleneck.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The evaluation framework relies on Few-shot CoT prompting; understanding how to structure intermediate reasoning steps is essential for both evaluation and future optimization.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why separating reasoning steps from final answers improves evaluation consistency in multi-step arithmetic tasks?

- Concept: **Multi-Step Error Propagation**
  - Why needed here: Accounting tasks frequently require sequential calculations where intermediate errors compound; recognizing this failure mode is critical for designing robust accounting AI systems.
  - Quick check question: In a 5-step depreciation calculation, what happens if step 2 produces an incorrect intermediate value?

- Concept: **Vertical-Domain Knowledge Integration**
  - Why needed here: The paper identifies domain knowledge gaps as a primary failure source; understanding how to inject or ground accounting standards into LLMs is a key optimization direction.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a model that has "seen" accounting text and a model that can correctly apply accounting principles to novel scenarios?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Accounting problem text -> Few-shot CoT template construction -> Model backbone (GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, GPT-4) -> Automated evaluation via GLM-4 -> Error categorization

- Critical path: Benchmark selection -> Prompt template design -> Model inference with explicit reasoning chain output -> Automated evaluation via model-as-judge -> Error categorization and frequency analysis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Evaluation automation vs. accuracy: Using GLM-4 as evaluator enables scalability but may introduce evaluation bias
  - Benchmark realism vs. isolability: CPA exam questions better reflect real-world complexity but conflate reasoning failure with comprehension failure
  - Model scale vs. deployment feasibility: GLM-130B achieves ~60% accuracy but is impractical for most enterprise deployments

- Failure signatures:
  - Principle-level errors: Correct calculation applied to wrong accounting treatment
  - Knowledge coverage gaps: Missing or incomplete application of domain constraints
  - Multi-branch reasoning collapse: Failure to track dependencies when multiple accounting procedures interact
  - Arithmetic inconsistencies: Correct reasoning structure with numerical errors in execution
  - Conceptual ambiguity: Coherent reasoning steps built on flawed underlying assumptions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline replication: Run Few-shot CoT evaluation on Multi-Calculation Benchmark with GPT-4 and GLM-4; verify accuracy degradation pattern as step count increases
  2. Error type validation: Manually annotate a subset of failures (e.g., 50 errors) to confirm automated error categorization aligns with human judgment
  3. Principle-explicit prompting: Augment prompts with relevant accounting principles explicitly stated; measure whether principle-level errors decrease without affecting other error types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can domain knowledge integration be systematically improved to reduce accounting principle-level misunderstandings that account for over 50% of model failures?
- Basis in paper: Error analysis revealed that "over 50% of failures stemmed from misunderstanding accounting principles and insufficient conceptual knowledge coverage."
- Why unresolved: Current approaches rely on prompt engineering and general-purpose training, which do not fundamentally address domain-adaptive reasoning or deep conceptual grounding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrated reduction in principle-level errors through domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation with authoritative accounting standards, or hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures evaluated on the Accounting Reasoning Benchmark.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What techniques can mitigate error propagation and accuracy degradation in multi-step accounting reasoning as computational complexity increases?
- Basis in paper: The paper reports that "accuracy dropped significantly as reasoning complexity increased, falling to around 40% for the most complex problems" and that "error propagation across intermediate steps remains a major challenge."
- Why unresolved: Current LLMs struggle to maintain consistency across extended reasoning chains; no validated solutions for sustained numerical accuracy in accounting contexts exist.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and benchmarking of mechanisms (e.g., intermediate verification, structured state tracking) that maintain accuracy above professional thresholds (>90%) on the Multi-Calculation Benchmark.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can broader, more diverse benchmarks and model architectures generalize accounting reasoning capabilities beyond the limited set of evaluated GLM-series and GPT-4 models?
- Basis in paper: The Limitations section states that "only a limited number of representative LLMs are evaluated, and the results may not generalize to models trained with different architectures or domain-specific data."
- Why unresolved: The current study is restricted in model scope and task diversity; generalizability to other architectures and real-world accounting scenarios remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-architecture evaluation on expanded accounting reasoning benchmarks, including models with specialized domain pretraining, demonstrating consistent performance patterns.

## Limitations
- The evaluation framework relies heavily on automated assessment using GLM-4 as a model-as-judge, which may introduce evaluation bias without independent validation
- The Accounting Reasoning Benchmark sources (Chinese CPA exam questions) are not publicly available, making independent replication difficult
- The error analysis methodology combines automated classification with human annotation for verification, but the sample size for human validation is not specified

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The finding that Few-shot CoT improves accuracy by approximately 50% is well-supported by experimental statistics
- Medium Confidence: The claim that over 50% of failures stem from principle-level misunderstanding is supported by error analysis but relies on automated classification
- Low Confidence: The specific error type distribution percentages and the exact contribution of each failure mode to overall performance degradation would benefit from independent validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent human evaluation on a subset of model responses (e.g., 100 samples) to validate GLM-4's automated correctness judgments and identify potential systematic evaluation biases
2. Test whether explicitly stating relevant accounting principles in prompts reduces principle-level errors by at least 30% while maintaining or improving overall accuracy
3. Run the same benchmark suite through multiple independent evaluators (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to assess consistency in accuracy measurements and error type classifications
