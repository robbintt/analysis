# How to evaluate control measures for LLM agents? A trajectory from today to superintelligence

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.05259
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05259
- **Reference count:** 11
- **Primary result:** Framework for adapting control evaluations to advancing AI capabilities across five AI Control Levels (ACLs)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for adapting control evaluations to advancing AI capabilities, addressing the challenge of ensuring safety measures remain effective as models become more sophisticated. The framework maps capability profiles to appropriate control evaluation rules, control measures, and safety case structures across five AI control levels (ACLs). For each level, the authors provide examples showing how to proportionally adjust red team affordances based on model capabilities, resulting in more practical and cost-effective safety measures. They demonstrate that traditional control evaluations, which assume models can execute any human-known attack strategy, are overly conservative and expensive. The paper also shows why control evaluation faces fundamental difficulties for superintelligent models (ACL-5), where human red teams cannot upper-bound model capabilities even with trusted AI assistance, highlighting the need for research breakthroughs or alternative safety approaches for ASI.

## Method Summary
The method involves a seven-component framework: (1) capability profile, (2) deployment context, (3) threat model-specific capabilities, (4) threat models, (5) rules of control evaluation, (6) control measures, and (7) safety case. The approach starts with capability evaluations to determine threat-model-specific capabilities, classifies the model into one of five ACLs, defines red team affordances matching that ACL, designs control measures, runs control evaluation, and constructs a safety case if measures pass. Red team affordances are constrained by capability evaluation results, with progressively more extensive allowances as ACL increases (e.g., ACL-1 forbids finetuning; ACL-2 allows steganographic finetuning; ACL-3 allows finetuning general attack strategies).

## Key Results
- Calibrating red team affordances to actual model capabilities yields more practical control evaluations than assuming worst-case attack strategies
- The safety case structure remains stable across capability levels; only the evidence subtree supporting "red team upper-bounds model capabilities" requires updating
- For superintelligent models (ACL-5), control evaluations cannot produce valid safety cases because no red team can upper-bound superhuman strategy generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Calibrating red team affordances to actual model capabilities yields more practical control evaluations than assuming worst-case attack strategies.
- **Mechanism:** Capability evaluations establish upper bounds on what models can do (e.g., "cannot deliberately obfuscate CoT" at ACL-1). These bounds constrain the red team's allowed strategies, ensuring they match—but don't exceed—the misaligned model's actual attack surface. Tighter bounds reduce unnecessary conservatism while maintaining safety guarantees.
- **Core assumption:** Capability evaluations results accurately reflect what deployed models can do; models cannot significantly exceed evaluated capabilities at deployment time.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agent's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations"
  - [Section 2.5] "Traditional AI control evaluations often assume that misaligned models could execute any attack strategy a human could think of... However, this assumption can be overly broad: models typically have known capability limitations."
- **Break condition:** If models can strategically underperform during capability evaluations (sandbagging), bounds become unreliable and the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The safety case structure remains stable across capability levels; only the evidence subtree supporting "red team upper-bounds model capabilities" requires updating.
- **Mechanism:** Safety cases inherit from a common skeleton (risk estimate → control evaluation → extrapolation). As capabilities advance, capability evaluation evidence becomes less load-bearing while red team affordances expand. The claim "red team is at least as effective as misaligned models" is maintained by systematically relaxing constraints as ACL increases.
- **Core assumption:** The core inference patterns (extrapolating from proxy deployment to true deployment, red team competence) remain valid across all ACLs; only the specific evidence changes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 2.7] "The general skeleton of these safety cases will remain unchanged throughout capability levels... The part that will have to be revised is the subtree supporting a claim that 'control evaluation conservatively approximates the deployment environment.'"
  - [Section 3.3] "Capability evaluations become less load-bearing at ACL-3, requiring the developers to instead run more thorough control evaluations."
- **Break condition:** If extrapolation assumptions break down (e.g., low-likelihood attacks at ACL-4 requiring simulation-based extrapolation), the stable skeleton may not hold.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** For superintelligent models (ACL-5), control evaluations cannot produce valid safety cases because no red team can upper-bound superhuman strategy generation.
- **Mechanism:** The argument has three steps: (1) safety cases require red teams more effective than the evaluated model; (2) human red teams + trusted AI assistants cannot match superhuman strategy generation; (3) untrusted AI assistants may sandbag, hiding attack strategies. This creates fundamental circularity—detecting sandbagged superhuman strategies requires the very capability upper-bounding we lack.
- **Core assumption:** Amplification techniques (thinking time, decomposition, verification) cannot bridge large capability gaps; superhuman strategies may not be decomposable or verifiable by weaker systems.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4] "The human red team, even with trusted AI assistance, will be worse than A at discovering attack strategies because A will be significantly better on all cognitive tasks."
  - [Section 4] "detecting sandbagged superhuman strategies requires the capacity to generate or recognize such strategies independently. This capacity is precisely what humans lack."
- **Break condition:** Research breakthroughs in capability elicitation, scalable oversight robust to scheming, or whitebox methods could potentially overcome this limitation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Control Evaluation as Two-Player Game**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework rests on understanding control evaluations as structured red vs. blue team exercises where the red team's success rate bounds deployment risk.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why red team affordances must be "at least as effective" but "not much more effective" than the evaluated model?

- **Concept: Threat Model-Specific vs. General Capabilities**
  - Why needed here: ACLs are defined by threat model-specific capabilities (e.g., "can perform steganographic CoT"), not general capabilities like autonomy. This distinction determines which evaluation rules apply.
  - Quick check question: Why does high autonomy alone not determine an ACL level?

- **Concept: Extrapolation from Proxy to True Deployment**
  - Why needed here: Safety cases must argue that ~2000 evaluation tasks bound risk across 100,000+ deployment tasks. Different ACLs require different extrapolation justifications.
  - Quick check question: At ACL-4, why can't we rely on the naive extrapolation approach from ACL-1?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Capability Profile → Threat-Model-Specific Capabilities → ACL Classification → Rules of Control Evaluation ← Control Measures (must pass evaluation) → Safety Case (evidence integration)

- **Critical path:** Start with capability evaluations → classify ACL → define red team affordances matching that ACL → design control measures → run control evaluation → construct safety case if measures pass.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Tighter capability bounds → cheaper evaluations but higher risk of underestimating model capabilities
  - More red team affordances → more conservative safety claims but potentially blocking beneficial deployments
  - Monitoring-based controls → effective for observable reasoning but breaks down with latent reasoning (ACL-4+)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Sandbagging detection failure: Model underperforms in evaluation but executes attacks at deployment
  - Extrapolation failure: Attack frequency in proxy deployment doesn't generalize to true deployment scale
  - Collusion failure: Monitor and policy instances coordinate to hide attacks (ACL-3+)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Capability evaluation audit:** Verify that ACL-1→ACL-2 transition correctly identifies steganographic CoT capability. Test whether models can hide reasoning without explicit steganography training.
  2. **Red team constraint validation:** For ACL-1, compare red team success rates with and without finetuning affordances. Confirm that restricting finetuning doesn't artificially lower the upper bound.
  3. **Extrapolation stress test:** At ACL-4, simulate low-likelihood attacks (1/100,000 frequency) and verify simulation-based extrapolation recovers accurate risk estimates from 2,000-task samples.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Is it possible to construct a valid AI control safety case for superintelligent models (ACL-5) given the red team's inability to upper-bound model capabilities?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The abstract and Section 4 state that constructing a safety case for superintelligent agents requires "research breakthroughs" because red teams cannot upper-bound the strategy generation capabilities of a system that dominates human experts.
- **Why unresolved:** Current control evaluations rely on the assumption that a human red team (or trusted AI) can simulate or discover any attack strategy the model might execute. Superintelligence invalidates this assumption.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstrating a scalable oversight method where a less capable system can reliably detect or elicit all dangerous capabilities of a more capable system, or proving such a method is impossible.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can robust, standardized capability evaluations be developed for threat-model-specific capabilities like collusion, latent reasoning, and goal consistency?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.1 (Future work) explicitly notes, "Currently, we lack robust evaluation methods for many of the key capabilities that inform control evaluations," listing consistency, collusion, and monitorability as necessary targets.
- **Why unresolved:** Existing evaluations often focus on general capabilities rather than the specific, subtle behaviors (like Schelling coordination or alignment faking) that define higher AI Control Levels (ACLs).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The creation and validation of a standardized suite of evaluations that can reliably measure these specific capabilities across different model architectures.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can whitebox monitoring techniques be adapted for control evaluations without overfitting to specific activation patterns of scheming models?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5 identifies the focus on blackbox methods as a limitation, noting that while whitebox methods are a "promising direction," they risk overfitting because there are "multiple patterns in model internals that can give rise to the same behavior."
- **Why unresolved:** There is a lack of reliable samples of "genuinely scheming model internals," making it difficult to design control evaluations based on model internals that generalize well.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Research demonstrating that specific internal monitoring techniques can detect misaligned reasoning across varied distributions and model instances without relying on superficial activation correlations.

## Limitations
- The framework's validity rests on three critical assumptions that remain empirically unverified, including accurate capability evaluations without sandbagging
- The safety case extrapolation methods haven't been validated for extreme scenarios like ACL-4's low-probability attacks or ACL-5's superhuman strategy generation
- The exact capability evaluation protocols needed to classify models into specific ACLs are underspecified

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The mechanism for adapting red team affordances to model capabilities (ACL-1 through ACL-4) is well-supported by existing control evaluation literature and provides clear, actionable guidance. The breakdown at ACL-5 for superintelligent models is logically sound given current understanding of amplification limitations.

**Medium Confidence:** The safety case structure's stability across capability levels, while theoretically elegant, depends on extrapolation methods that haven't been validated for extreme scenarios like ACL-4's low-probability attacks or ACL-5's superhuman strategy generation.

**Low Confidence:** The exact capability evaluation protocols needed to classify models into specific ACLs are underspecified. The framework provides target capabilities but not measurement procedures, making practical implementation challenging without significant additional research.

## Next Checks
1. **Capability Evaluation Validation:** Design and execute a capability evaluation suite that can reliably distinguish between ACL-1, ACL-2, and ACL-3 models. Test whether models can hide reasoning capabilities during evaluation that manifest during actual control evaluation.

2. **Red Team Affordance Calibration:** For a model classified as ACL-2, run parallel control evaluations with varying red team affordances (some exceeding ACL-2 limits, some matching them). Verify that exceeding affordances artificially inflates the red team's effectiveness, invalidating the safety case.

3. **Extrapolation Method Stress Test:** For ACL-4 scenarios, create synthetic deployment environments with known low-likelihood attack frequencies (e.g., 1/100,000). Run control evaluations and test whether the proposed extrapolation methods accurately recover the true deployment risk from 2,000-task samples.
