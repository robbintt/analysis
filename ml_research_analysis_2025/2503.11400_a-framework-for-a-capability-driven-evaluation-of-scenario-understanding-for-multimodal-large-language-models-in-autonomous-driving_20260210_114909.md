# A Framework for a Capability-driven Evaluation of Scenario Understanding for Multimodal Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.11400
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11400
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: A capability-driven framework for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in autonomous driving scenario understanding, organizing evaluation across semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical dimensions

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a capability-driven framework for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in autonomous driving scenario understanding. The framework structures scenario understanding along four core capability dimensions: semantic (what), spatial (where), temporal (when), and physical (how), derived from autonomous driving requirements, human driver cognition, and language-based reasoning. It organizes the domain into context layers, processing modalities, and downstream tasks such as language-based interaction and decision-making. The framework is demonstrated through two exemplary traffic scenarios, showing how MLLMs must identify object classes and affordances (semantic), localize objects and estimate relations (spatial), predict motion patterns (temporal), and assess object dynamics (physical) to enable safe autonomous driving. By enabling structured evaluation of MLLMs' scenario understanding capabilities, the framework provides a foundation for developing comprehensive benchmarks and improving model architectures for autonomous driving applications.

## Method Summary
The framework organizes scenario understanding capabilities into four core dimensions: semantic (what), spatial (where), temporal (when), and physical (how), derived from autonomous driving requirements, human driver cognition, and language-based reasoning. It structures the domain into context layers, processing modalities, and downstream tasks such as language-based interaction and decision-making. The framework is demonstrated through two exemplary traffic scenarios, showing how MLLMs must identify object classes and affordances (semantic), localize objects and estimate relations (spatial), predict motion patterns (temporal), and assess object dynamics (physical) to enable safe autonomous driving. The framework is demonstrated through two exemplary traffic scenarios, showing how MLLMs must identify object classes and affordances (semantic), localize objects and estimate relations (spatial), predict motion patterns (temporal), and assess object dynamics (physical) to enable safe autonomous driving.

## Key Results
- Framework structures scenario understanding along four core capability dimensions: semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical
- Framework is demonstrated through two exemplary traffic scenarios showing required capabilities
- Provides foundation for developing comprehensive benchmarks and improving model architectures for autonomous driving applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing scenario understanding into four fundamental capability dimensions that align with both autonomous driving requirements and human cognitive processes. By organizing these dimensions systematically, the framework enables structured evaluation of MLLMs' ability to understand and reason about complex driving scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic understanding (what)**: Why needed - to identify objects, their classes, and affordances in the driving scene. Quick check - Can the model correctly classify vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs?
- **Spatial understanding (where)**: Why needed - to localize objects and estimate spatial relations between them. Quick check - Can the model determine relative positions and distances between objects?
- **Temporal understanding (when)**: Why needed - to predict motion patterns and understand temporal sequences. Quick check - Can the model predict future trajectories and understand cause-effect relationships?
- **Physical understanding (how)**: Why needed - to assess object dynamics and physical interactions. Quick check - Can the model understand collision risks and motion constraints?
- **Context layers**: Why needed - to provide hierarchical understanding from low-level perception to high-level reasoning. Quick check - Does the framework properly integrate sensor data, scene understanding, and decision-making?
- **Processing modalities**: Why needed - to handle multimodal inputs (visual, textual, sensor data). Quick check - Can the framework accommodate different input types and processing approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Sensor inputs → Feature extraction → Capability dimension processing (semantic/spatial/temporal/physical) → Decision-making → Action outputs

**Critical path**: Real-time scenario understanding → Capability assessment → Safe decision-making → Action execution

**Design tradeoffs**: Comprehensive evaluation vs. computational efficiency, theoretical completeness vs. practical implementability, general framework vs. domain-specific adaptations

**Failure signatures**: Incomplete object detection (semantic), incorrect spatial relations (spatial), failed motion prediction (temporal), misunderstood physical constraints (physical)

**Three first experiments**:
1. Evaluate semantic understanding by testing object classification and attribute recognition in varied traffic scenarios
2. Test spatial understanding through relative positioning and distance estimation tasks
3. Assess temporal understanding by predicting object trajectories and motion patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Framework remains largely theoretical without empirical validation on actual MLLM implementations
- Proposed capability dimensions have not been validated for completeness or optimal partitioning
- Practical feasibility of implementing such comprehensive evaluations in real-world autonomous driving systems remains unproven

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the framework's conceptual soundness and its alignment with established autonomous driving requirements and cognitive science principles
- **Medium confidence** in the practical applicability of the framework for real-world MLLM evaluation, pending empirical validation
- **Low confidence** in the framework's completeness and optimality as an evaluation structure, given the lack of comparative analysis with alternative frameworks

## Next Checks
1. Implement a pilot study applying the framework to evaluate at least three different MLLM architectures on standardized driving scenarios, measuring performance across all four capability dimensions
2. Conduct expert review sessions with autonomous driving practitioners to validate the framework's coverage and identify potential capability gaps or redundancies
3. Develop and test specific evaluation metrics for each capability dimension, ensuring they are measurable, reproducible, and correlated with real-world driving safety outcomes
