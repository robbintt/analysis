## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of implicit bias in large language models (LLMs), extending psychological concepts and methods like the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to the context of LLMs. It categorizes detection methods into three primary approaches: word association, task-oriented text generation, and decision-making. Evaluation metrics are classified into single-value-based and comparison-value-based metrics, and datasets are divided into sentences with masked tokens and complete sentences. While research on mitigation methods is limited, the paper summarizes existing efforts and offers insights into future challenges. The survey aims to serve as a guide for researchers and inspire innovative ideas to advance exploration in this field.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic literature review of implicit bias research in LLMs, organizing findings around detection methods (word association, task-oriented generation, decision-making), evaluation metrics (sentiment/toxicity scores, demographic parity, odds ratio), and datasets (Winogender, WinoBias, StereoSet, BUG, CORGI-PM). The survey methodology involves identifying relevant papers through academic databases, extracting methodological details, and synthesizing findings into a coherent framework for understanding how implicit bias manifests in LLMs and how it can be measured.

## Key Results
- Detection methods are categorized into three approaches: word association (prompt-based), task-oriented text generation (character description analysis), and decision-making (HR/healthcare scenarios)
- Evaluation metrics are classified as single-value-based (sentiment, toxicity scores) and comparison-value-based (demographic parity, odds ratio, JSD)
- Datasets are divided into masked token sentences (Winogender, WinoBias) and complete sentences (BUG, CORGI-PM)
- Current mitigation methods are limited and show disappointing results, particularly for implicit bias despite effectiveness against explicit bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Statistical Association Transfer
Implicit bias in LLMs arises from the internalization of statistical co-occurrence patterns present in human-generated training data. During pre-training, the model optimizes for next-token prediction, capturing high-probability associations between concepts (e.g., "engineer" → "male") as vector proximity in the embedding space. These learned associations function as "mental heuristics," mirroring the categorization mechanisms in human cognition described by evolutionary psychology.

### Mechanism 2: Guardrail Divergence (Dual Attitudes)
Explicit safety alignment (guardrails) functions as a surface-level filter that suppresses overt bias outputs but fails to alter underlying implicit associations, creating a disconnect between the model's "stated beliefs" and its "behavior." Alignment techniques like RLHF train the model to reject explicitly biased prompts, but this operates on the output layer, leaving the internal embedding space largely intact.

### Mechanism 3: Contextual Attribute Inference
Implicit bias manifests in decision-making tasks when the model infers sensitive demographic attributes from proxy signals (e.g., names, dialects) rather than explicit labels. Even when explicit demographic terms are excluded from a prompt, the model detects proxy features (e.g., African American English patterns or distinct names) and activates associated stereotypical "knowledge" from its pre-training.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Implicit Association Test (IAT) & WEAT (Word Embedding Association Test)
  - **Why needed here:** This is the foundational framework the paper uses to define and measure implicit bias. Without understanding IAT (human reaction time) and WEAT (vector cosine similarity), the detection metrics described in Section 4 are unintelligible.
  - **Quick check question:** How does WEAT translate the "reaction time" of human psychology into a computational metric for LLMs?

- **Concept:** Embedding Space & Vector Proximity
  - **Why needed here:** The paper posits that bias is stored in the relationships between words (vectors). Understanding that "closer" vectors imply stronger semantic association is critical for grasping the "Word Association" detection method.
  - **Quick check question:** In the context of LLM bias, does a high cosine similarity between "Doctor" and "Male" imply a logical necessity or a statistical bias?

- **Concept:** Demographic Parity vs. Equality of Opportunity
  - **Why needed here:** Section 4.2 introduces these fairness metrics. Distinguishing between "equal outcomes" (Demographic Parity) and "equal error rates" (Equality of Opportunity) is necessary to interpret the "Comparison-Value-based" evaluation results.
  - **Quick check question:** Which metric checks if the model's *predictions* are independent of the sensitive attribute, regardless of the actual ground truth?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer (Prompt Interface) -> Latent Layer (Embeddings/Weights) -> Processing Layer (Contextual Reasoning) -> Output Layer (Guardrails) -> Evaluation Module (Metrics)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Attribute Masking: Ensure prompts do not explicitly mention sensitive groups
  2. Proxy Injection: Introduce subtle cues (e.g., dialect, names) to trigger inference
  3. Behavioral Observation: Measure disparity in outputs (e.g., text sentiment, hiring rank) rather than asking the model if it is biased

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Explicit Safety vs. Implicit Risk: Strengthening guardrails reduces toxic output visibility but may obscure deep-seated implicit bias, making it harder to detect and mitigate ("safety washing")
  - Static vs. Dynamic Evaluation: Static datasets are easier to benchmark but less representative of "in-the-wild" decision-making than dynamic prompt interactions

- **Failure signatures:**
  - The "Refusal" Trap: Model correctly refuses "Are women bad at math?" but recommends a male candidate 80% of the time for a math role when gender is only implied by name
  - Homogeneity Loop: Repeatedly generating the same stereotypical descriptors (e.g., "passionate" for Latinas) even when prompted for diverse profiles

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Resume Audit: Submit identical resumes to the LLM, varying only the first name (e.g., "Brad" vs. "Tremayne") for a high-status job description, and measure the Odds Ratio (OR) of recommendation
  2. Ambiguous Pronoun Resolution: Use the WinoBias dataset to test if the model defaults to gender stereotypes when resolving references (e.g., "The nurse notified the patient that [her/his] shift...")
  3. Dialect Sensitivity: Prompt the model with identical requests written in Standard English vs. African American English (AAE) and measure the "Regard Score" or "Toxicity Score" of the generated responses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can mitigation methods designed for explicit bias (e.g., RLHF, DPO) be effectively adapted to address implicit bias, or are entirely novel methodologies required?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors explicitly ask in Section 8 if current mitigating methods "can also mitigate implicit bias in LLMs," noting the lack of solutions specifically designed for implicit bias.
- **Why unresolved:** Section 6 notes that alignment techniques like RLHF are "disappointingly limited" in impacting implicit bias, and some reasoning methods (CoT) may paradoxically increase harmful content in sensitive contexts.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical benchmarks demonstrating that a specific adaptation of an explicit bias mitigation technique results in a statistically significant reduction of implicit bias scores (e.g., IAT effect size) without degrading task performance.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can multi-agent frameworks be integrated into detection pipelines to identify latent biases that remain hidden in single-model evaluations?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 8 proposes "exploring the integration of multi-agent frameworks into bias detection pipelines" to uncover latent biases through collaborative and competitive interactions.
- **Why unresolved:** Current detection relies primarily on single-model probing (word association) or direct observation of decision-making, which may miss biases that only emerge during complex, interactive dynamics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study demonstrating that a multi-agent simulation reveals distinct biased behaviors (e.g., discriminatory negotiation outcomes) that do not appear in standard single-agent text generation tests for the same model.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Are there implicit bias phenomena in LLMs that do not map to existing psychological definitions (such as the IAT) and remain undetected?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 8 explicitly asks, "Beyond the implicit bias phenomena... discussed in this paper, are there other phenomena that can be defined as implicit bias that have yet to be detected?"
- **Why unresolved:** Current taxonomies rely heavily on extending human psychological frameworks (like the IAT) to LLMs, potentially overlooking machine-specific biases that do not manifest as human-like word associations or stereotypes.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The identification and categorization of a novel bias pattern (e.g., non-semantic structural preferences) that systematically disadvantages specific inputs but cannot be explained by current social-psychological frameworks.

## Limitations

- The survey identifies a significant gap between sophisticated detection methods and primitive mitigation techniques, with current methods showing disappointing results for implicit bias
- The computational assumptions linking vector similarity to psychological association (WEAT methodology) remain largely unvalidated empirically
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture nuanced manifestations of implicit bias, particularly in decision-making contexts where multiple attributes interact

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The categorization of detection methods and evaluation metrics is well-supported by the literature review and provides a clear organizational framework
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism explanations connecting statistical co-occurrence to implicit bias are plausible but rely on contested assumptions about the equivalence between vector space geometry and human cognition
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim about guardrail divergence creating a disconnect between explicit and implicit bias is supported by recent studies but requires more longitudinal research to confirm persistence across model versions and alignment techniques

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Validation of WEAT:** Conduct controlled experiments comparing WEAT scores with human IAT results on identical concept pairs to establish the validity of vector similarity as a bias proxy
2. **Cross-Model Consistency:** Test whether implicit bias patterns identified in the survey persist across different model architectures (transformer variants) and training regimes to determine if findings are model-agnostic
3. **Mitigation Efficacy Study:** Design a controlled experiment comparing existing mitigation techniques (data debiasing, adversarial training, knowledge editing) on the same implicit bias tasks to establish relative effectiveness and identify which methods show promise for future development
