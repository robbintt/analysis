core_contribution: This study investigates the use of statistical relationships between
  physiological signal pairs (EEG, EMG, ECG, EOG) for automated fatigue detection.
  Instead of analyzing single modalities, the approach extracts pairwise statistical
  descriptors such as correlation, cross-correlation, and covariance to capture inter-signal

# Exploring the Relationships Between Physiological Signals During Automated Fatigue Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.21794
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21794
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** 88.81% accuracy and 0.975 AUC using EMG|EEG signal fusion with XGBoost for fatigue detection

## Executive Summary
This study investigates automated fatigue detection by analyzing statistical relationships between physiological signal pairs (EEG, EMG, ECG, EOG) rather than single modalities. The approach extracts pairwise descriptors like correlation, cross-correlation, and covariance to capture inter-signal dynamics during fatigue states. Using the DROZY dataset and supervised classifiers, the EMG|EEG combination achieved the best performance with XGBoost (88.81% accuracy, 0.975 AUC). SHAP analysis revealed that EEG-EEG correlations were key features and provided interpretability. Multi-signal fusion consistently outperformed single-signal models, validating that inter-signal statistical relationships enhance robustness and accuracy in fatigue detection systems.

## Method Summary
The method extracts pairwise statistical descriptors (correlation, covariance, max cross-correlation within ±500 ms lag) between physiological signal channels to capture inter-signal dynamics during fatigue. Signals are filtered (0.5-45 Hz), segmented into 20-second windows, and normalized using Z-score. Features are computed for all channel pairs within signal combinations (EEG|EEG, EMG|EEG, etc.), flattened into vectors, and used to train supervised classifiers (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) with 70/30 train/test splits. The DROZY dataset provides EEG (C3, C4, Cz, Fz, Pz), EMG, ECG, and EOG signals with Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) labels mapped to three classes (Alert, Normal, Fatigued).

## Key Results
- Best performance achieved with EMG|EEG combination: 88.81% accuracy and 0.975 AUC using XGBoost
- Multi-signal fusion consistently outperformed single-signal models across all classifiers
- SHAP analysis identified EEG-EEG correlations as key features and enabled interpretability of model decisions
- Random Forest with 1000 estimators achieved 88.24% accuracy on EMG|EEG combination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach captures temporal and statistical dependencies between physiological signals that reflect the complex physiological changes during fatigue. By computing pairwise statistical relationships rather than analyzing single modalities, the method leverages complementary information from different signal sources. Cross-correlation reveals lagged relationships between signals, covariance captures joint variability, and correlation measures linear dependencies. These inter-signal dynamics provide richer representations of the fatigue state than individual signal analysis alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS):** Standardized subjective sleepiness rating (1-9) used to label fatigue states; needed to create ground truth labels for supervised learning.
- **Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) Cross-Validation:** Ensures subject-independent generalization by testing on completely unseen subjects; critical check for avoiding subject-specific leakage.
- **Cross-Correlation Analysis:** Measures similarity between signals as a function of lag; captures temporal relationships between physiological signals during fatigue transitions.
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Game-theoretic method for interpreting ML model predictions; explains which features drive individual classifications.
- **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Combines information from multiple signal types; leverages complementary physiological information for improved detection.
- **Pairwise Statistical Descriptors:** Correlation, covariance, and cross-correlation capture different aspects of signal relationships; provide rich feature representations beyond single-signal metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
DROZY Dataset -> Signal Preprocessing (filter, segment, normalize) -> Pairwise Feature Extraction -> Flattened Feature Vectors -> Supervised Classifier (XGBoost/RF/LR/DT) -> Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, AUC) -> SHAP Interpretability

**Critical Path:**
Signal preprocessing → Feature extraction (pairwise statistics) → Classifier training → Performance evaluation → Interpretability analysis

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- 20-second windows balance temporal resolution with sufficient data for statistical analysis
- Pairwise features increase dimensionality but capture richer inter-signal dynamics
- Subject-wise splitting ensures generalization but may reduce training data per fold

**Failure Signatures:**
- Accuracy >90% with random splitting but drops significantly with LOSO suggests subject-specific leakage
- Extremely high feature dimensionality (>1000 features) indicates incorrect cross-correlation lag handling
- Poor performance with single modalities but good with fusion confirms complementary information benefit

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Implement LOSO cross-validation to verify subject-independent generalization
2. Compare performance of correlation-only features vs full feature set to validate feature importance
3. Test XGBoost with varying max_depth parameters to find optimal complexity for this dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Subject-wise stratified splitting strategy is ambiguously described, creating uncertainty about whether subject-specific data leakage occurred
- Specific XGBoost hyperparameters (learning rate, max depth, subsample) were not reported, preventing exact replication
- The study uses a single dataset (DROZY), limiting generalizability to other populations or conditions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The methodology (pairwise statistical features, multi-modal fusion advantage, SHAP interpretability) is sound and well-documented
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific performance metrics (88.81% accuracy, 0.975 AUC) are likely achievable with correct implementation
- **Low Confidence:** The claim of "subject-wise stratified" splitting without clear implementation details introduces uncertainty about true generalization capability

## Next Checks
1. Implement Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation to verify subject-independent generalization and identify potential data leakage
2. Test multiple XGBoost hyperparameter configurations (learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=6, subsample=0.8) to establish performance sensitivity
3. Compare full 117-feature vector performance against ablations removing specific feature types to validate SHAP importance claims
