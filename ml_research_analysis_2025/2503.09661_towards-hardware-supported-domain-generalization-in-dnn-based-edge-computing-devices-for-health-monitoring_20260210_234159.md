# Towards Hardware Supported Domain Generalization in DNN-Based Edge Computing Devices for Health Monitoring

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.09661
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09661
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Correction layers enable domain generalization on edge devices with >20% F1 score improvement and 2.5x reduction in computational complexity compared to full DNN fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) for health monitoring on resource-constrained edge devices when faced with domain shift. The authors propose correction layers (CLs) - trainable components inserted into pre-trained DNNs that enable adaptation to unknown domains while keeping the rest of the network frozen. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity compared to conventional fine-tuning of entire models. The method is demonstrated on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring applications, showing substantial performance improvements on generalized target domains while maintaining minimal hardware overhead during inference.

## Method Summary
The authors propose inserting a single trainable correction layer into a pre-trained DNN model to enable domain generalization capabilities on edge devices. The correction layer is trained on target domain data while the rest of the DNN remains frozen, significantly reducing computational complexity compared to full fine-tuning. The approach is implemented on an ultra-low power ECG DNN inference engine using FPGA, demonstrating minimal hardware overhead during inference. The correction layer architecture allows the model to adapt to unknown domains without requiring complete retraining of the entire network.

## Key Results
- Achieved >20% increase in F1 score on generalized target domain
- Reduced DNN model-dependent computational complexity by >2.5x compared to full fine-tuning
- Demonstrated successful integration of correction layers into ultra-low power ECG DNN inference engine with minimal hardware overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The correction layer approach works by learning to map features from the source domain to the target domain without modifying the underlying feature extraction capabilities of the pre-trained DNN. By freezing the base network and only training the correction layer, the method exploits the existing knowledge captured in the pre-trained model while adapting it to new domain characteristics. This selective adaptation reduces computational requirements significantly while maintaining or improving classification performance on the target domain.

## Foundational Learning
- Domain Generalization: Why needed - to handle distribution shifts between training and deployment environments; Quick check - measure performance degradation when applying model to unseen domains
- Edge Computing Constraints: Why needed - to operate within limited power, memory, and computational resources; Quick check - verify power consumption stays below specified thresholds
- Transfer Learning: Why needed - to leverage pre-trained models and reduce training requirements; Quick check - compare performance with models trained from scratch
- Hardware-Software Co-design: Why needed - to optimize DNN architectures for specific hardware platforms; Quick check - measure inference latency and resource utilization on target hardware
- Model Compression: Why needed - to fit DNNs within memory and computational constraints of edge devices; Quick check - verify model size fits within available memory
- Domain Adaptation vs Generalization: Why needed - to understand different approaches for handling domain shift; Quick check - compare performance between adaptation and generalization techniques

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Pre-trained DNN -> Correction Layer -> Output

Critical Path:
Input signal -> Pre-trained feature extractor -> Correction layer transformation -> Classification output

Design Tradeoffs:
- Freezing base network reduces training complexity but limits adaptation capability
- Single correction layer minimizes overhead but may not capture complex domain shifts
- FPGA implementation balances performance and power efficiency but may not generalize to all edge platforms

Failure Signatures:
- Performance degradation when source and target domains have fundamentally different characteristics
- Memory overflow if correction layer parameters exceed device capacity
- Increased inference latency if hardware implementation is not optimized

First Experiments:
1. Test correction layer performance across multiple ECG datasets with varying characteristics
2. Measure computational complexity and memory usage on different edge computing platforms
3. Evaluate performance degradation when source and target domain distributions differ significantly

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several implications arise from the limitations section regarding generalization to other medical domains and non-health monitoring applications.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to ECG monitoring applications without demonstration on other medical or non-health domains
- Computational complexity reduction claims are hardware-dependent and may vary across different edge platforms
- Potential impact on overall model size and memory footprint from additional correction layer parameters not thoroughly explored

## Confidence

| Claim Cluster | Confidence Level |
|---------------|------------------|
| Domain Generalization Performance | High |
| Computational Complexity Reduction | Medium |
| Hardware Integration Feasibility | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the correction layer approach on diverse health monitoring domains (e.g., PPG, EEG) and non-health monitoring applications to assess generalization capabilities beyond ECG
2. Conduct experiments on ultra-low power microcontroller platforms to verify memory and computational constraints are met in practice
3. Test the approach with cross-domain datasets where source and target distributions differ significantly to assess robustness limits
