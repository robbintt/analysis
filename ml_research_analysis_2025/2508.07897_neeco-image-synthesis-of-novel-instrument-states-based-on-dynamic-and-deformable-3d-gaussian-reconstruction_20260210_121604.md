# NeeCo: Image Synthesis of Novel Instrument States Based on Dynamic and Deformable 3D Gaussian Reconstruction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.07897
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07897
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves PSNR of 29.87 for synthesized surgical instrument images

## Executive Summary
NeeCo addresses the challenge of generating high-quality, labeled surgical image datasets for deep learning applications by using dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting to synthesize novel instrument states with automatic annotations. The framework learns instrument motion from unordered images with 7-DoF kinematic data and generates realistic images with accurate segmentation masks and bounding boxes. Experiments demonstrate that NeeCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves downstream model performance by approximately 15% compared to standard data augmentation techniques.

## Method Summary
NeeCo employs dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting with a canonical MLP (depth 12, width 256) that predicts per-Gaussian attributes (δμ, δr, δs) from positional-encoded pose inputs. The method uses a two-phase training strategy with dynamic density control, where Phase 1 applies uniform motion rendering and camera pose compensation, and Phase 2 refines the reconstruction. Novel poses are synthesized by querying the MLP with target poses, while automatic annotations are generated by thresholding Gaussian attribute changes to isolate instrument Gaussians, rendering instrument-only views, and extracting bounding boxes from contours. The system requires synchronized monocular video with 7-DoF kinematic tracking and COLMAP SfM initialization.

## Key Results
- Achieves PSNR of 29.87 for image quality on ex-vivo porcine model dataset
- Automatic annotation accuracy of IoU 88.21% for segmentation masks
- Improves downstream model performance by approximately 15% compared to standard augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting's ability to represent deformable objects through canonical Gaussian primitives that are dynamically transformed based on kinematic inputs. By learning the mapping from pose to Gaussian attributes, the system can generate realistic deformations of surgical instruments in novel configurations. The two-phase training with dynamic density control ensures stable convergence even with poor initial pose estimates, while the automatic annotation generation exploits the explicit control over Gaussian attributes to create precise segmentation masks without manual labeling.

## Foundational Learning
- **3D Gaussian Splatting**: Efficient representation of 3D scenes using anisotropic Gaussian primitives with learned colors and opacities; needed for real-time rendering and dynamic deformation synthesis; quick check: verify Gaussian attribute prediction accuracy on known poses
- **Dynamic 3DGS**: Extension of static 3DGS to handle time-varying scenes by conditioning Gaussian attributes on temporal/pose inputs; needed to model instrument articulation; quick check: ensure temporal consistency across rendered frames
- **Automatic Annotation Generation**: Creating ground-truth labels by leveraging explicit scene representation; needed to eliminate manual annotation burden; quick check: verify mask IoU against ground truth on validation poses
- **Two-Phase Training Strategy**: Initial coarse reconstruction followed by fine-tuning with dynamic density control; needed for stability with poor pose initialization; quick check: monitor PSNR progression through training phases
- **Uniform Motion Rendering**: Sorting points by pose during Phase 1 training to handle pose compensation; needed to improve convergence with inaccurate initial poses; quick check: validate reconstruction quality improvement with pose compensation enabled

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: COLMAP SfM -> 3DGS Initialization -> MLP Decoder Training -> Novel Pose Synthesis -> Annotation Generation
**Critical Path**: Motion data capture → SfM initialization → MLP training with dynamic density control → Pose-conditioned rendering → Automatic mask/box generation
**Design Tradeoffs**: External EM tracking provides precise kinematics but limits deployment scenarios versus visual pose estimation that may be less accurate; two-phase training adds complexity but improves robustness to poor initialization
**Failure Signatures**: Training divergence with PSNR <15-18 indicates poor SfM quality; blurred jaw rendering suggests insufficient pose coverage in training data
**First Experiments**: 1) Test COLMAP initialization quality and pose coverage range, 2) Validate MLP convergence with dynamic density control, 3) Verify annotation mask quality across multiple threshold values

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the framework be extended to predict soft tissue deformations from unordered inputs? The current model assumes static tissue background and does not model tool-tissue interaction or resulting tissue dynamics.
- Can the method operate effectively without external 7-DoF kinematic tracking systems? The pipeline currently depends on precise ground-truth kinematics to train the New Pose Synthesis (NPS) weights for instrument deformation.
- How can reconstruction robustness be improved when the training data has a limited range of observed poses? The method relies on unordered discrete images; insufficient coverage of the instrument's motion space results in overfitting and inability to render unseen views.

## Limitations
- Requires precise 7-DoF kinematic tracking hardware (EM systems), limiting deployment scenarios
- Sensitive to training pose coverage; limited motion range causes incomplete 3D representation and structural instability
- Specific MLP architecture details and annotation threshold values are unspecified, requiring empirical tuning

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core methodology of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting with pose-conditioned MLP, two-phase training strategy, and PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS evaluation metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: Reported downstream model improvement (~15%) and annotation accuracy (IoU 88.21%), as these depend on unspecified implementation details
- **Low Confidence**: Specific hyperparameter choices and annotation threshold values critical for faithful reproduction

## Next Checks
1. Validate COLMAP SfM quality and pose coverage before 3DGS training; ensure training poses span full instrument articulation range
2. Test Phase 1 dynamic density control triggers and transition conditions to prevent training divergence
3. Evaluate annotation mask quality using multiple threshold combinations to verify robustness of instrument segmentation
