# EnvBench: A Benchmark for Automated Environment Setup

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.14443
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14443
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Benchmark evaluates automated environment setup across 329 Python and 665 JVM repositories; best approach (Bash Agent with GPT-4o) achieves 29.47% success for JVM and 6.69% for Python

## Executive Summary
EnvBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating automated environment setup methods for software development projects. The benchmark focuses on Python and JVM repositories that present genuine configuration challenges beyond simple deterministic scripts. Using static analysis for Python (pyright) and compilation checks for JVM (gradle build or mvn compile) as verification methods, EnvBench provides standardized metrics including pass@1 rates and average errors. The authors evaluate three approaches - a zero-shot baseline, an Installamatic agent, and a Bash agent - using GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini as backbones, finding that environment setup remains challenging with current methods.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates automated environment setup by generating shell scripts to configure development environments for GitHub repositories. It uses 329 Python and 665 JVM repositories filtered to exclude monorepos and Docker-based projects, requiring single dependency managers (pip/Poetry or Gradle/Maven) in root directories. Success is measured by running pyright for Python (counting reportMissingImports errors) and gradle build or mvn compile for JVM (checking exit codes/errors). Three baselines are evaluated: Zero-shot LLM with repo context, Installamatic Agent (search + build stages), and Bash Agent (ReAct with execute-bash tool, max 30 iterations, 360s per command timeout), tested with GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

## Key Results
- Bash Agent with GPT-4o achieves highest success rates: 29.47% for JVM and 6.69% for Python repositories
- Zero-shot baseline and Installamatic Agent show significantly lower performance than Bash Agent
- Environment setup remains challenging for current automated approaches, even with advanced LLMs
- Python repositories show substantially lower success rates than JVM repositories across all methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by providing standardized, reproducible evaluation of environment setup methods through deterministic verification metrics. For Python, pyright static analysis counts missing import errors, while for JVM, build tools verify successful compilation. The exclusion of Docker-based projects and monorepos ensures focus on repositories with genuine configuration challenges that require understanding of dependencies and build systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Static analysis (pyright)**: Verifies Python dependencies by checking for missing imports; needed to automatically validate environment setup without manual testing; quick check: run pyright --no-error --reportMissingImports:2 on target repository
- **Build verification (gradle build/mvn compile)**: Confirms JVM environment setup through compilation success; needed to ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved and configured; quick check: execute build command and verify zero exit code and no errors
- **ReAct architecture**: Combines reasoning and action for Bash Agent through iterative tool use; needed to handle complex setup tasks requiring multiple steps and error recovery; quick check: trace agent's tool calls and reasoning steps during evaluation
- **LLM context management**: Incorporates repository information into prompts for environment setup generation; needed to provide sufficient information for correct script generation; quick check: verify prompt includes relevant dependency files and repository context

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: LLM (GPT-4o/mini) -> Agent (Zero-shot/Installamatic/Bash) -> Docker container -> Verification (pyright/build) -> Metrics

**Critical path**: Repository cloning → Script generation → Execution in container → Verification → Success/failure determination

**Design tradeoffs**: The benchmark prioritizes realistic environment setup challenges over ease of evaluation by excluding Docker projects, but this limits applicability to containerized workflows. The choice of pyright for Python provides precise dependency verification but may miss runtime issues, while build verification for JVM ensures complete environment setup but requires full compilation.

**Failure signatures**: Python failures typically show non-zero pyright error counts indicating missing imports; JVM failures show non-zero exit codes or compilation errors. Common causes include version mismatches, missing system packages, and incorrect dependency resolution.

**First experiments**: 1) Run evaluation on a single repository with each agent to verify setup and metric calculation; 2) Test the Docker containers with sample setup scripts to ensure environment configuration is correct; 3) Compare results on repositories with known simple vs complex setup requirements to validate benchmark discrimination.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark excludes Docker-based projects and monorepos, limiting applicability to real-world development environments
- Success rates remain low (6.69-29.47%) indicating significant challenges for automated environment setup
- Results depend on external LLM API calls and may vary with different models or versions

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Benchmark design and metric definitions (pyright errors, build exit codes) are deterministic and verifiable
**Medium confidence**: Reported success rates may vary due to unspecified prompt templates and LLM hyperparameters
**Low confidence**: Findings may not generalize to Docker-based projects and monorepos excluded from the benchmark

## Next Checks
1. Re-run the benchmark with provided Docker images and evaluation suite to verify success rate reproducibility
2. Test additional repositories not in the benchmark (e.g., Docker-based or monorepos) to assess external validity
3. Vary LLM hyperparameters (temperature, top_p) and prompt templates to measure sensitivity of success rates
