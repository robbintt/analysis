# Investigating the Impact of Rationales for LLMs on Natural Language Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16686
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16686
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Rationale-augmented training (Align method) improves NLU generalization and interpretability, but CoT inference only benefits larger models.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether incorporating rationales into large language models (LLMs) improves natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. While rationales are known to enhance reasoning tasks, their impact on NLU—where understanding key input is often sufficient—remains unclear. The authors construct NLURC, a high-quality NLU dataset with 252,506 rationales, and test various rationale-augmented training and inference methods. They find that chain-of-thought inference benefits NLU performance only as model size increases, as smaller models tend to over-analyze and make more understanding errors. Most rationale-augmented training methods underperform label-only training, except one that balances label and rationale loss. Training with rationales improves generalization on unseen NLU tasks, matching models ten times larger in size while also enhancing interpretability.

## Method Summary
The authors create NLURC, a dataset of 252,506 rationales for 34 Chinese NLU tasks. They train Qwen1.5-Chat models (0.5B-32B) using five methods: Label-Only, Reason (rationale→label), Explain (label→rationale), Mix, and Align (separate label/rationale losses). They evaluate performance using direct inference and CoT inference, testing both seen and unseen tasks. The Align method computes separate losses for labels and rationales, balancing them to avoid dilution of label learning. They use LoRA for efficient training and evaluate with human scoring for rationale quality across four dimensions plus diversity.

## Key Results
- CoT inference shifts from hindering to helping NLU performance as model size increases, with 7B+ models benefiting
- Most rationale-augmented training methods underperform label-only training except the Align method (balanced separate losses)
- Rationale-trained models achieve significant gains on unseen NLU tasks, matching 72B models in rationale quality
- CoT inference causes understanding errors in smaller models due to over-analysis of full texts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Model Size–Dependent CoT Inference Benefit
- Claim: Chain-of-thought (CoT) inference helps NLU only above a model-size threshold; below it, CoT hurts performance.
- Mechanism: Smaller models have limited capacity to analyze full texts during step-by-step reasoning, leading to over-analysis and more understanding errors. Larger models can integrate comprehensive analysis without sacrificing key-input comprehension.
- Core assumption: NLU tasks often require identifying and analyzing key input regions; exhaustive analysis is not always necessary and can introduce errors for models with weaker understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive correlation."
  - [section 5.1, RQ1]: "For the original model, the absolute difference... for the 0.5B and 1.8B models is -0.05... the difference for the 7B and 32B models being +1.2 and +1.84, respectively."

### Mechanism 2: Aligned Separate Loss Balancing for NLU Training
- Claim: Computing separate losses for labels and rationales (Align) and balancing them improves NLU performance over naive concatenation or mixing.
- Mechanism: Concatenating or averaging token losses lets long rationales dominate training, under-weighting label learning critical for NLU. Separate loss computation ensures label learning is preserved while still capturing rationale information.
- Core assumption: Label learning is central to NLU; rationales provide complementary context but should not dilute label-focused optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Most rationale-augmented training methods underperform label-only training, except one that balances label and rationale loss."
  - [section 4, Methods]: "Align binds f(xi)→yi and f(xi)→ri... computes losses individually then sums."

### Mechanism 3: Rationale Diversity for Generalization and Interpretability
- Claim: Training on diverse rationales across multiple NLU tasks improves generalization to unseen tasks and enhances model interpretability.
- Mechanism: Diverse rationales expose the model to varied reasoning styles, linguistic expressions, and perspectives, improving abstraction and transfer. This yields stronger performance on held-out tasks and better-quality generated rationales.
- Core assumption: Instruction tuning benefits from diversity; rationales encode task-agnostic reasoning patterns that transfer across NLU domains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance gains on unseen NLU tasks... while delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs."
  - [section 5.3, RQ3]: "7B-Unseen model produces rationales of comparable quality to Hunyuan-Original... and even outperforms the 72B-Original."

## Foundational Learning

- **Instruction Tuning for LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on instruction tuning to improve generalization; understanding how diverse instructions shape behavior is crucial.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why diverse instruction data improves zero-shot generalization across tasks?

- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The core intervention is CoT rationales in inference and training; knowing how CoT works in reasoning tasks sets the baseline.
  - Quick check question: Describe how CoT prompting changes model behavior on multi-step reasoning problems.

- **NLU Task Taxonomy and Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The paper spans 11 NLU task types; familiarity with task types (sentiment, NLI, QA, etc.) and evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1) is necessary.
  - Quick check question: List three major NLU task categories and one common metric for each.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: NLU dataset collection → cleaning → clustering → rationale generation (via proprietary LLM) → filtering → human review → training (five methods) → evaluation (task performance + rationale quality)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Ensure high label accuracy (LLM-as-judge + human review)
  2. Generate rationales with zero-shot prompts + golden labels
  3. Train with Align (separate label/rationale losses, coefficient 0.5 each)
  4. For generalization, use multi-task training on NLURC excluding target task
  5. Evaluate with Direct inference for performance; Rationalize inference for interpretability

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Rationale length vs. diversity: Longer rationales may be comprehensive but reduce diversity; balance via prompt design and filtering
  - Label coefficient: 0.5 performs best in experiments; higher values over-emphasize labels, lower values over-emphasize rationales
  - Training scope: Single-task training for seen-task optimization; multi-task training for generalization at cost of per-task tuning

- **Failure signatures**:
  - CoT inference hurt on small models (high understanding error rate in error analysis)
  - Reason/Explain underperforming Label-Only (label loss diluted)
  - Poor rationale quality (low conciseness, logical coherence) when using few-shot exemplars or wrong labels

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate size-dependent CoT effect: Train 0.5B, 1.8B, 7B models with Label-Only and compare Direct vs. CoT inference on a short-rationale task (e.g., sentiment)
  2. Compare training methods: On a mid-sized task (e.g., topic classification), train Label-Only, Reason, Mix, Align and evaluate with Direct inference; verify Align outperforms
  3. Test generalization: Multi-task train a 7B model on NLURC excluding one task (e.g., stance detection); evaluate on held-out task and compare with 72B baseline and human rationale quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do advanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) variants, such as hierarchical or graph-based frameworks, improve NLU performance, or does NLU's reliance on key input identification make complex reasoning structures redundant or detrimental?
- Basis: [explicit] Section 2.1 states the authors limit their scope to standard CoT, leaving "more advanced CoT methods for future work."
- Why: It is currently unknown if the negative impact of "over-analysis" observed in smaller models using standard CoT applies to or is exacerbated by more complex reasoning structures.
- Evidence: Experimental results applying advanced reasoning frameworks (e.g., Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts) to the NLURC dataset to compare against standard CoT.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do the observed benefits of rationale-augmented training (specifically the "Align" method) and the negative effects of CoT inference on small models generalize to non-Chinese languages?
- Basis: [inferred] Section 3 notes the dataset construction was limited to Chinese "Due to limitations in available annotators with domain expertise."
- Why: Linguistic structures and reasoning styles differ across languages; the effectiveness of separating label and rationale losses ("Align") may be sensitive to the specific syntactic properties of Chinese.
- Evidence: Replicating the training and inference experiments on an English-centric version of the NLU Rationale Collection (NLURC).

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the precise parameter scale threshold where Chain-of-Thought inference shifts from being detrimental to beneficial for NLU tasks?
- Basis: [explicit] Section 5.1 notes a positive correlation with size but states "Due to computational limits, we train models up to 32B," leaving the exact crossover point unidentified.
- Why: While the trend suggests large models eventually benefit, the specific model capacity required to overcome the "over-analysis" error tendency in NLU remains undefined.
- Evidence: A scaling law analysis evaluating a denser range of model sizes (e.g., between 7B and 70B parameters) on the NLURC benchmark using CoT inference.

## Limitations

- Dataset construction quality: Relies on proprietary LLM for rationale generation and limited human review, potentially introducing biases tied to specific model's reasoning patterns
- Size scaling claims: Analysis spans only four discrete model sizes (0.5B to 32B), with the exact threshold where CoT becomes beneficial not precisely characterized
- Generalization claims: Evaluation covers only five held-out tasks; claims about matching 72B models rely on limited comparisons and subjective human evaluation

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The finding that Align method (separate loss balancing) outperforms other rationale-augmented training methods is well-supported by controlled experiments across multiple model sizes and tasks
- **Medium confidence**: The size-dependent CoT inference benefit shows consistent patterns across experiments, but the underlying mechanism remains speculative
- **Low confidence**: Claims about matching 72B models in performance and achieving "comparable interpretability" rely on limited comparisons and subjective human evaluation

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset replication study**: Reconstruct NLURC using an open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA-3) for rationale generation and conduct detailed inter-annotator agreement analysis. Compare performance when training with rationales generated by different models to test robustness to generation method.

2. **Size threshold characterization**: Conduct finer-grained experiments across 1B increments between 1B-10B to precisely locate the CoT inflection point. Include controlled ablation studies where models are trained to explicitly focus on key input regions versus full-text analysis to test the over-analysis hypothesis.

3. **Cross-lingual generalization test**: Apply the best rationale-augmented training method to English NLU datasets (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE) and evaluate zero-shot performance on held-out tasks. This would test whether the observed benefits generalize beyond Chinese and the specific tasks in NLURC.
