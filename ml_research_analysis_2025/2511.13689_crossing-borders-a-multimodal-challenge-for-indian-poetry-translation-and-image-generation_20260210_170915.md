core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of translating and visually
  representing morphologically rich Indian language poetry, which is often inaccessible
  to non-native speakers due to its linguistic complexity and cultural nuances. The
  authors propose a two-step Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework that
  first translates Indian poetry into English using an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment
  Algorithm (ORPO) to preserve poetic essence, and then generates contextually meaningful
  images using a semantic graph-based approach that captures metaphors and visual

- Proposes a two-step Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework for Indian poetry

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of translating and visually representing morphologically rich Indian language poetry, which often contains complex linguistic structures and cultural nuances that make it inaccessible to non-native speakers. The authors introduce a two-step Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework that first translates Indian poetry into English using an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm (ORPO) to preserve poetic essence, then generates contextually meaningful images using a semantic graph-based approach that captures metaphors and visual elements. They introduce the MorphoVerse dataset containing 1,570 poems across 21 Indian languages and conduct extensive evaluations with both human and quantitative assessments.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework addresses the multimodal challenge of translating morphologically rich Indian poetry while preserving its cultural and poetic essence, followed by generating contextually relevant images. The approach consists of two main stages: translation using an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm (ORPO) to maintain poetic quality, and image generation using a semantic graph-based approach that captures metaphors and visual elements from the translated text. The framework is evaluated on the newly introduced MorphoVerse dataset containing 1,570 poems across 21 Indian languages, with performance assessed using both automated metrics (BLEU, METEOR, Long-CLIP, BLIP scores) and human evaluations.

## Key Results
- BLEU scores up to 0.5589 and METEOR scores up to 0.5693, outperforming strong baselines
- Long-CLIP scores up to 0.2436 and BLIP scores up to 0.4613 for image generation quality
- Framework demonstrates superior performance in both translation and image generation tasks for Indian poetry

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by first addressing the linguistic complexity of Indian poetry through ORPO, which aligns translation preferences while preserving poetic elements. The semantic graph-based approach then captures the metaphorical and visual aspects of the translated poetry, creating a structured representation that guides image generation. This two-stage process ensures that both linguistic fidelity and visual relevance are maintained throughout the pipeline.

## Foundational Learning
- **Morphologically Rich Languages**: Indian languages have complex morphological structures that affect translation quality; understanding these structures is essential for accurate poetry translation.
- **Semantic Graph Representation**: Capturing relationships between concepts in poetry requires structured representations that can encode metaphorical meanings and visual elements.
- **Multimodal Alignment**: The translation and image generation processes must be aligned to maintain semantic coherence between text and visual outputs.
- **Cultural Nuance Preservation**: Poetry translation requires maintaining cultural references and emotional resonance beyond literal meaning.
- **Quick Check**: Verify that the framework can handle languages with different morphological complexity levels and maintain consistent performance across them.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: ORPO Translator -> Semantic Graph Builder -> Image Generator

**Critical Path**: The pipeline follows a sequential flow where translation must complete before image generation can begin. The semantic graph acts as an intermediate representation that bridges the two modalities.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes poetic essence preservation over literal accuracy, which may sacrifice some translation precision for cultural and emotional fidelity. The semantic graph approach adds computational overhead but enables better metaphor capture compared to direct text-to-image approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Translation failures manifest as loss of poetic devices (rhyme, meter, metaphors)
- Image generation failures appear as irrelevant or semantically disconnected visual outputs
- Both stages may struggle with highly abstract or culturally specific content

**First Experiments to Run**:
1. Evaluate translation quality with and without ORPO on a subset of poems to measure its specific contribution
2. Test image generation quality using different semantic graph configurations to find optimal representation
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the semantic graph layer to assess its impact on visual output quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges that evaluating poetry translation and image generation poses unique challenges that automated metrics may not fully capture. It calls for more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that can assess the preservation of poetic essence, cultural nuances, and aesthetic quality in both translation and visual outputs.

## Limitations
- Dataset size is relatively small with only 1,570 poems across 21 languages (approximately 75 poems per language)
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture the nuanced nature of poetic translation and generation tasks
- The framework's performance on highly abstract or culturally specific content remains uncertain

## Confidence
- Translation quality metrics: **Medium** - BLEU and METEOR show improvement but may not capture poetic essence preservation
- Image generation evaluation: **Medium** - Automated metrics may not fully capture semantic relevance and aesthetic quality
- Dataset size: **Low** - Small sample size (1,570 poems across 21 languages) may limit generalizability

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive human evaluation studies focusing on both translation quality (preservation of poetic devices, cultural references) and image relevance, using expert poets and native speakers as evaluators.

2. Expand the MorphoVerse dataset significantly, particularly for underrepresented languages, and test the framework's performance across varying dataset sizes to establish robustness.

3. Implement ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm and semantic graph-based approach, comparing performance against simpler translation and image generation pipelines.
