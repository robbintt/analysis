# Semantic Superiority vs. Forensic Efficiency: A Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning and Psycholinguistics for Business Email Compromise Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20944
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20944
- Reference count: 36
- DistilBERT achieved near-perfect detection (AUC 1.0, F1 0.998) with acceptable latency when GPU resources are available, while CatBoost offers strong performance at 8.4x lower latency and minimal resource use.

## Executive Summary
This paper compares two approaches to detect Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks: a forensic psycholinguistic model (CatBoost) and a deep learning model (DistilBERT). BEC exploits human trust, costing billions annually, and modern AI-powered attacks evade traditional defenses. The authors address the high cost of false negatives and the trade-off between detection accuracy and computational efficiency. They evaluate both models on a hybrid dataset of legitimate and synthetic BEC emails, testing robustness against adversarial tactics like homoglyphs.

DistilBERT achieves near-perfect detection (AUC 1.0, F1 0.998) with acceptable latency (7.4 ms) when GPU resources are available, while CatBoost offers strong performance (AUC 0.991, F1 0.949) at 8.4x lower latency (0.8 ms) and minimal resource use. Both models exceed 99.96% accuracy and remain effective under adversarial attacks. The choice depends on infrastructure: DistilBERT for GPU-equipped systems, CatBoost for edge or CPU-only deployments.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates two distinct approaches for BEC detection using a hybrid dataset of 7,990 emails (4,003 legitimate from Enron corpus + 3,987 synthetic BEC emails). CatBoost uses 35 engineered psycholinguistic features including the "Smiling Assassin Score" ψ(x) that captures politeness-urgency interactions, while DistilBERT employs transformer self-attention on normalized text with homoglyph detection. Both models are trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%, with adversarial robustness tested by injecting homoglyphs and zero-width spaces into 30% of fraud samples.

## Key Results
- DistilBERT achieved near-perfect detection (AUC 1.0, F1 0.998) with 7.4 ms latency on GPU
- CatBoost achieved competitive performance (AUC 0.991, F1 0.949) at 8.4x lower latency (0.8 ms)
- Both models exceeded 99.96% accuracy and remained effective under adversarial attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Contextual Semantic Detection via Transformer Self-Attention
DistilBERT's self-attention mechanism captures subtle semantic patterns in BEC attacks that feature-based approaches may miss. The O(N²) self-attention operation processes token relationships across the entire email context, identifying deception patterns through learned attention weights on financial keywords and urgency cues. Core assumption: BEC attacks contain distinguishable semantic patterns that persist across varied linguistic formulations.

### Mechanism 2: Psycholinguistic Feature Engineering with Gricean Pragmatics
Engineered linguistic features capturing urgency-authority-politeness interactions provide discriminative signals for BEC detection with high interpretability. The "Smiling Assassin Score" ψ(x) = σ(α·Spos(x)·ln(1 + β·Ufreq(x))) operationalizes the politeness-urgency interaction; 35 numerical features feed into gradient boosting. Core assumption: BEC attacks systematically violate Grice's Maxim of Quality while maintaining Maxim of Manner, creating measurable linguistic signatures.

### Mechanism 3: Adversarial Hardening via Unicode Normalization
Preprocessing normalization prevents homoglyph-based tokenizer evasion by mapping confusable characters to canonical forms. Algorithm 1 iterates through raw text, substituting known homoglyphs (e.g., Cyrillic 'а' → Latin 'a') and removing invisible characters (U+200B) before tokenization. Core assumption: Attackers exploit Unicode visual equivalence to bypass tokenizers while maintaining human readability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer Self-Attention Complexity
  - Why needed here: Understanding the O(N²) computational cost explains DistilBERT's 7.4ms latency and GPU requirement.
  - Quick check question: Why does a 200-word email require approximately 4x more attention computations than a 100-word email?

- Concept: Cost-Sensitive Learning Thresholds
  - Why needed here: The 5,480:1 false negative to false positive cost ratio fundamentally changes optimal decision thresholds.
  - Quick check question: If a false negative costs $137,000 and a false positive costs $25, should your classification threshold be higher or lower than 0.5?

- Concept: Unicode Homoglyph Attacks
  - Why needed here: Understanding why "Bank" (Latin 'a') and "Bank" (Cyrillic 'а') tokenize differently explains both the attack vector and the hardening solution.
  - Quick check question: How many visually identical but computationally distinct characters exist for the Latin letter 'a'?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Stream A (Forensic): Raw text → Feature extraction (35 features) → CatBoost classifier → Probability score
  - Stream B (Semantic): Raw text → Homoglyph normalization → DistilBERT tokenizer → Transformer encoder → Classification head
  - Decision layer: Probability threshold comparison → Auto-allow / Grey zone (manual review) / Auto-block
  - Shared infrastructure: Cost-weighted loss function, Tesla T4 GPU (DistilBERT) or CPU-only (CatBoost)

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocessing: Apply Algorithm 1 normalization (critical for adversarial robustness)
  2. Inference: Route to appropriate model based on infrastructure availability
  3. Decision: Apply cost-optimized threshold (τL ≈ 0 per Figure 11) with length-based safeguard for <15 word messages

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. latency: DistilBERT (+0.9% F1) vs. CatBoost (8.4x faster)
  - Interpretability vs. performance: SHAP feature attribution (CatBoost) vs. attention visualization (DistilBERT)
  - Infrastructure: GPU requirement (DistilBERT) vs. CPU-only operation (CatBoost)

- Failure signatures:
  - Ultra-short messages (<15 words): Insufficient linguistic signal → route to manual review
  - Novel homoglyphs: Characters not in normalization map → tokenizer errors → misclassification
  - Temporal drift: Enron-era training data (2001-2002) may not capture 2025 communication patterns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline benchmark: Run both models on held-out test set (N=1,586), capture AUC, F1, recall, and P95 latency metrics
  2. Adversarial stress test: Inject 30% homoglyph poisoning into test set, measure recall degradation for each model
  3. Threshold optimization sweep: Vary τL from 0.0 to 0.5, calculate expected financial loss using Equation 2, identify optimal operating point

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the detection performance and cost-effectiveness of DistilBERT and CatBoost generalize to real-world operational email streams over extended deployment periods?
- Basis in paper: "Future work must validate performance on longitudinal operational data to address synthetic bias and temporal drift."
- Why unresolved: The study relied on a hybrid dataset with 52.7% synthetic (GPT-4-generated) BEC emails and legitimate emails from the 2001–2002 Enron corpus, which may not reflect contemporary threat actor tactics or modern business communication patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal deployment study measuring detection metrics, false positive/negative rates, and ROI on live organizational email traffic over 6–12 months.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do the engineered psycholinguistic features, particularly the "Smiling Assassin Score" (ψ), possess validated psycholinguistic construct validity for detecting deception?
- Basis in paper: "Psycholinguistic feature constructs require empirical validation through controlled deception studies" and "this metric requires empirical validation against annotated deception corpora to establish psycholinguistic validity."
- Why unresolved: The features were derived theoretically from Grice's Maxims but not empirically validated against ground-truth deception data, leaving uncertainty about whether they capture genuine deceptive intent or merely proxy signals.
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analysis between psycholinguistic feature scores and human-annotated deception labels on a curated corpus of confirmed BEC and legitimate emails.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the optimal decision threshold (τ) shift under real-world analyst workload constraints and alert fatigue dynamics?
- Basis in paper: "Operational deployment introduces analyst workload constraints and alert fatigue risks not captured in this model."
- Why unresolved: The paper's economic optimization assumes fixed review costs and infinite analyst capacity, but high-volume environments (100K+ emails/day) may require higher thresholds to maintain sustainable review queues, trading detection for feasibility.
- What evidence would resolve it: A simulation or field study modeling alert volume, analyst throughput, and detection degradation across varying threshold settings in production environments.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can hybrid ensemble architectures combining DistilBERT's semantic embeddings with CatBoost's psycholinguistic features achieve Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and interpretability?
- Basis in paper: The paper compares two separate streams but does not explore whether their complementary strengths (contextual understanding vs. interpretability) could be unified.
- Why unresolved: The study evaluates each paradigm in isolation; it remains unknown whether a combined model could retain DistilBERT's near-perfect detection while leveraging CatBoost's efficiency for edge cases or explainability requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental comparison of ensemble methods (e.g., stacking, cascading) against standalone models on the same benchmark, measuring AUC, F1, latency, and interpretability metrics.

## Limitations
- Dataset Temporal Gap: Uses Enron corpus (2001-2002) for legitimate examples, which may not represent current business communication patterns
- Feature Implementation Gaps: Complete implementation details for all 35 psycholinguistic features are not specified
- Computational Resource Assumptions: DistilBERT's 7.4ms latency assumes Tesla T4 GPU availability

## Confidence
- High Confidence: AUC and F1 scores, homoglyph normalization mechanism, cost-sensitive threshold optimization
- Medium Confidence: Dataset composition and temporal relevance, 35-feature implementation details, synthetic BEC generation process
- Low Confidence: Real-world deployment performance, false positive handling in production, performance degradation over time

## Next Checks
1. **Temporal Validation Test**: Replicate the experiment using a modern business email corpus (2020-2025) for legitimate examples. Compare performance degradation against the original Enron-based results to quantify temporal drift impact.

2. **Feature Implementation Audit**: Implement all 35 psycholinguistic features based on available descriptions and standard NLP toolkits. Verify that the CatBoost implementation can reproduce the reported AUC=0.991 using the specified hyperparameters.

3. **Edge Infrastructure Benchmark**: Test both models on CPU-only and consumer GPU environments. Measure latency degradation for DistilBERT and performance changes for CatBoost to validate the infrastructure recommendations.
