# EMFusion: Conditional Diffusion Framework for Trustworthy Frequency Selective EMF Forecasting in Wireless Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15067
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15067
- Reference count: 40
- The proposed EMFusion framework outperforms best baseline by 23.85% in CRPS and 13.93% in normalized RMSE for frequency-selective EMF forecasting

## Executive Summary
The rapid proliferation of wireless communication technologies has increased the need for accurate forecasting of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure levels to ensure regulatory compliance and support network planning. Existing studies rely on univariate forecasting of wideband aggregate EMF data, but frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture inter-operator and inter-frequency variations essential for proactive network planning. This paper introduces EMFusion, a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors (e.g., time of day, season, and holidays) while providing explicit uncertainty estimates.

## Method Summary
EMFusion introduces a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors while providing explicit uncertainty estimates. The proposed architecture features a residual U-Net backbone enhanced by a cross-attention mechanism that dynamically integrates external conditions to guide the generation process. Furthermore, EMFusion integrates an imputation-based sampling strategy that treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task, ensuring temporal coherence even with irregular measurements. Unlike standard point forecasters, EMFusion generates calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals directly from the learned conditional distribution, providing explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making.

## Key Results
- EMFusion outperforms the best baseline by 23.85% in continuous ranked probability score (CRPS)
- EMFusion achieves 13.93% improvement in normalized root mean square error
- Prediction CRPS error is reduced by 22.47% compared to baseline models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to model frequency-selective multivariate EMF patterns while incorporating contextual information. The conditional diffusion approach allows the model to learn the joint distribution of EMF measurements across frequencies and operators, conditioned on temporal and environmental factors. The cross-attention mechanism enables dynamic integration of contextual features, while the residual U-Net architecture captures spatial and temporal dependencies in the frequency domain. The imputation-based sampling strategy ensures robustness to irregular measurements by treating forecasting as a structural completion task.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conditional Diffusion Models**: Generative models that learn to reverse a noising process conditioned on external inputs; needed for probabilistic forecasting with uncertainty quantification
- **Cross-Attention Mechanism**: Allows models to selectively focus on relevant parts of input features when processing contextual information; essential for integrating time-varying contextual factors
- **Residual U-Net Architecture**: Encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that preserves spatial information; crucial for capturing hierarchical features in EMF frequency data
- **Imputation-Based Sampling**: Treats missing or irregular data as a completion problem; necessary for handling real-world measurement irregularities
- **Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)**: Proper scoring rule for evaluating probabilistic forecasts; required for assessing both accuracy and calibration of prediction intervals

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Data -> Imputation Layer -> Residual U-Net Backbone -> Cross-Attention Module -> Diffusion Process -> Probabilistic Output

**Critical Path**: The forward pass through the residual U-Net extracts hierarchical features, which are then modulated by the cross-attention mechanism using contextual conditions before being processed through the diffusion reverse process to generate probabilistic predictions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for improved forecasting accuracy and uncertainty quantification. The diffusion-based approach requires multiple sampling steps but provides calibrated prediction intervals, unlike deterministic point forecasts.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when contextual conditions are missing or when EMF patterns significantly deviate from training distribution. The model may also struggle with extreme outliers or sensor malfunctions that produce unrealistic measurements.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate the model's ability to generate calibrated prediction intervals on synthetic EMF data with known ground truth distributions
2. Test the cross-attention mechanism's effectiveness by comparing performance with and without contextual conditioning
3. Evaluate the imputation strategy's impact by introducing varying levels of measurement irregularity and assessing forecasting accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on synthetic or simulated EMF datasets rather than real-world operational network data
- Computational complexity characterization is incomplete, particularly for the imputation-based sampling strategy
- Lacks extensive ablation studies isolating the contribution of individual architectural components

## Confidence
High: The core methodology and experimental results demonstrating performance improvements over baseline models are well-documented and reproducible.

Medium: The claimed superiority of EMFusion over existing approaches is supported by numerical experiments, but the extent of improvement may vary depending on the specific characteristics of real-world EMF measurement data.

Low: The practical applicability of EMFusion in operational wireless networks remains uncertain due to the lack of field deployment validation and real-time performance metrics.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct field trials using actual EMF measurement data from operational wireless networks to validate the framework's performance under real-world conditions, including varying measurement quality and environmental factors.
2. Perform comprehensive computational complexity analysis comparing EMFusion with existing forecasting methods, including memory usage, inference time, and scalability to different network sizes and measurement frequencies.
3. Execute systematic ablation studies isolating the contributions of the residual U-Net architecture, cross-attention mechanism, and imputation-based sampling strategy to quantify the relative importance of each component in achieving forecasting accuracy.
