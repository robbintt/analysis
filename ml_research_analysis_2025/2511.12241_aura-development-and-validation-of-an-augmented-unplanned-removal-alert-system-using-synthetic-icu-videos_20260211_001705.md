- AURA detects two high-risk behaviors for unplanned extubation in ICU patients: collision (hand near airway tubes) and agitation (quantified via keypoint velocity).

## Executive Summary
This paper presents AURA, a vision-based risk detection system for unplanned extubation (UE) in intensive care units (ICUs). AURA was developed and validated using a fully synthetic ICU video dataset generated via text-to-video diffusion models, avoiding the privacy and ethical challenges of real ICU surveillance data. The system uses pose estimation to detect two high-risk behaviors: collision (hand entry near airway tubes) and agitation (measured via keypoint velocity). Nine ICU nurses evaluated 63 synthetic videos, providing expert assessments of video realism and alarm appropriateness. Collision detection achieved near-perfect performance (F1 = 0.98, recall = 1.00), while agitation detection showed moderate accuracy (F1 = 0.78, recall = 0.70). The synthetic dataset was rated highly realistic (mean Likert ≥4.3 across all dimensions), and inter-rater reliability for alarm appropriateness was excellent (ICC > 0.95). Robustness analyses confirmed stable performance under scale, resolution, and parameter variations. AURA demonstrates that privacy-preserving synthetic data can support clinically reliable development of real-time patient safety monitoring systems.

## Method Summary
AURA was developed using 75 synthetic ICU videos (6 sec, 25 fps, 1280×720) generated via Hailuo AI T2V-01-Director with structured prompts for patient appearance, behavior, staff presence, and camera angle. The system uses MediaPipe BlazePose for keypoint extraction, detecting collision via 2D overlap + 3D proximity scoring with persistence filtering, and agitation via per-frame keypoint velocity aggregated over 5-frame windows. Thresholds were fixed by clinical expert on a 12-video tuning set. The 63-video test set was evaluated by 9 ICU nurses using Likert scales and categorical labels for alarm appropriateness. Performance metrics include collision (F1=0.98, Recall=1.00) and agitation (F1=0.78, Recall=0.70), with synthetic realism rated ≥4.3/5 and alarm appropriateness ICC >0.95.

## Key Results
- Collision detection achieved near-perfect performance (F1 = 0.98, recall = 1.00) on synthetic test set.
- Agitation detection showed moderate accuracy (F1 = 0.78, recall = 0.70) on synthetic test set.
- Synthetic ICU videos rated highly realistic by ICU nurses (mean Likert ≥4.3 across all dimensions).
- Inter-rater reliability for alarm appropriateness was excellent (ICC > 0.95).

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hand proximity to airway zones predicts imminent unplanned extubation risk with high detectability.
- Mechanism: Pose estimation extracts hand and mouth keypoints; a combined 2D overlap score and 3D proximity score (weighted α=0.7, β=0.3) is thresholded (τscore=0.3) with persistence filtering (τduration=0.3s) to reduce anchor instability noise.
- Core assumption: Keypoint localizations remain accurate across diverse camera angles and body orientations, and the defined spatial zones capture clinically relevant risk.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "collision, defined as hand entry into spatial zones near airway tubes... achieved near-perfect performance (F1 = 0.98, recall = 1.00)"
  - [section] Collision detection integrates 2D overlap analysis and 3D proximity with persistence-based confirmation (Page 4).
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; neighbor papers focus on nursing skills assessment and clinical decision support, not UE-specific vision systems.
- Break condition: Multi-person scenes, occlusions, or extreme camera angles cause keypoint mislocalization; MediaPipe lacks temporal smoothing and multi-person tracking.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Elevated keypoint velocity quantifies agitation, a precursor state to extubation behavior.
- Mechanism: Computes per-keypoint 3D velocity per frame; aggregates mean, peak, and cumulative velocity over a 5-frame window; triggers if any exceed τspeed=0.18; low-visibility keypoints (τvalid<0.7) are excluded.
- Core assumption: Velocity thresholds calibrated on synthetic agitation behaviors transfer to real ICU patient motion patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "agitation, measured via keypoint velocity... showed moderate accuracy (F1 = 0.78, recall = 0.70)"
  - [section] Agitation detection thresholds were fixed by clinical expert on 12-video tuning set; agitation is inherently more abstract and variable (Page 3-4).
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for velocity-based agitation in ICU; related work (Chen et al. 2024) used hand-crafted spatio-temporal features for UE tendency, achieving 0.85 accuracy.
- Break condition: Subtle restlessness or low-amplitude high-frequency movements fall below velocity thresholds; agitation taxonomy is under-specified.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Synthetic ICU videos generated via text-to-video diffusion enable privacy-preserving, reproducible system development and expert validation.
- Mechanism: Structured prompts (patient appearance, behavior, staff presence, camera angle) drive Hailuo AI T2V-01-Director generation; heuristic quality control filters cinematic shots and implausible movements; expert Likert ratings confirm realism (≥4.3/5).
- Core assumption: Synthetic realism scores and expert alarm appropriateness judgments predict real-world clinical utility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "developed and validated entirely on a fully synthetic video dataset... avoiding the privacy and ethical challenges of real ICU surveillance data"
  - [section] Nine ICU nurses evaluated 63 videos; ICC(3,k)>0.95 for alarm appropriateness; synthetic dataset rated highly realistic (Page 5-6).
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers do not validate synthetic video for ICU monitoring; corpus lacks comparable synthetic-to-real transfer studies.
- Break condition: Rare postures, extreme agitation, or uncommon device configurations absent from synthetic distribution; overlays visible during evaluation may bias realism ratings.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pose estimation with MediaPipe
  - Why needed here: AURA relies on anatomical keypoint extraction (hands, mouth) for both collision and agitation detection; MediaPipe provides cross-platform, low-latency inference suitable for real-time deployment.
  - Quick check question: Given a single RGB frame, can you identify which MediaPipe landmarks correspond to left hand, right hand, and mouth, and explain how visibility confidence scores filter noisy detections?

- Concept: Text-to-video diffusion generation
  - Why needed here: Synthetic video creation replaces real ICU surveillance, requiring understanding of prompt engineering, quality control filtering, and limitations of generative models.
  - Quick check question: What types of physical implausibilities might a text-to-video model introduce in a static ICU scene, and how would heuristic evaluation detect them?

- Concept: Temporal signal processing for motion analysis
  - Why needed here: Agitation detection aggregates velocity statistics over sliding windows; understanding window size, threshold selection, and persistence filtering is critical.
  - Quick check question: For a 5-frame window at 25 fps, how does the cumulative velocity threshold relate to individual peak velocity threshold, and what tradeoff does each capture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input layer: Synthetic or real video frames (1280×720, 25 fps)
  - Pose estimation backend: MediaPipe BlazePose (keypoint extraction, 3D coordinates, visibility scores)
  - Collision module: 2D overlap + 3D proximity scoring → weighted combination → threshold + persistence filter
  - Agitation module: Per-frame keypoint velocity → 5-frame window aggregation (mean/peak/cumulative) → multi-condition threshold
  - Visualization layer: Aura overlays (green/red circles on hands and mouth)
  - Evaluation layer: Expert annotation interface (Likert scales, alarm appropriateness categories)

- Critical path:
  Video frame → MediaPipe inference → Keypoint visibility check (τvalid≥0.7) → parallel collision scoring and velocity aggregation → threshold comparison → alarm trigger → overlay rendering

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed vs. relative aura radii: Fixed pixels simpler but scale-sensitive; relative (normalized to head/hand size) improves robustness at cost of added computation.
  - 2D overlap vs. 3D proximity: 2D more stable under camera angle variability; 3D provides depth but noisier; weighted combination (α=0.7, β=0.3) favors 2D.
  - Persistence duration (τduration): Longer reduces false positives from anchor jumps but may delay true positive detection.

- Failure signatures:
  - Anchor instability: Momentary keypoint jumps near collision zones trigger false alarms (observed in expert feedback).
  - Staff interference: Multi-person scenes cause misidentified limb movements; MediaPipe lacks multi-person tracking.
  - Resolution degradation: Agitation detection drops to F1=0.65 at 854×480; collision remains robust (F1=0.92).
  - Subtle agitation: Low-amplitude movements fall below velocity thresholds, causing missed alarms.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce collision detection on the 63-video test set using provided code and thresholds (Table 2); verify F1≈0.98 and identify any false positives from anchor instability.
  2. Ablate the 2D/3D weighting (α,β) to quantify sensitivity: test α∈{0.5,0.7,0.9} and measure collision F1 change.
  3. Extend to relative aura scaling (λ=2.0) on down-scaled videos (854×480) to confirm robustness claims; document any calibration drift in agitation thresholds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can advanced temporal modeling and expanded behavior taxonomies improve the accuracy of the currently moderate agitation detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion states: "Future work should focus on improving quantification and categorization of agitation using advanced temporal modeling and expanded behavior taxonomies."
- Why unresolved: The current velocity-based heuristic is too simplistic to capture the broad variability and subtlety of agitation behaviors, resulting in a lower F1-score (0.78) compared to collision detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Improved recall and F1-scores for agitation on the test set using models like LSTMs or Transformers trained on a richer set of annotated motion patterns.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can temporal filtering and multi-person tracking effectively mitigate false alarms caused by anchor instability and medical staff interference?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that false alarms arise from "anchor jumps" and "staff interference," and suggest "Incorporating temporal filtering and gating mechanisms... may reduce false positives."
- Why unresolved: The current backend (MediaPipe) lacks temporal smoothing and multi-person detection, causing the system to misidentify staff limbs as patient movements.
- What evidence would resolve it: A measurable reduction in false positive rates in scenarios containing medical staff interactions after implementing temporal stabilization and multi-person ID tracking.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the system's performance on synthetic data generalize to real-world ICU environments with natural lighting and resolution constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The limitations section notes the synthetic dataset "may lack rare postures... limiting generalizability," and the discussion calls for "real-time evaluation in actual ICU workflows."
- Why unresolved: The study was conducted entirely on synthetic videos; expert evaluators rated realism, but algorithmic performance on real surveillance footage (privacy concerns aside) remains unproven.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validation of the collision and agitation modules on a held-out dataset of real, de-identified ICU CCTV footage showing comparable F1-scores.

## Limitations

- Synthetic dataset may lack rare postures, extreme agitation behaviors, or uncommon device configurations present in real ICU settings.
- Collision detection relies on MediaPipe's keypoint accuracy, which lacks temporal smoothing and multi-person tracking, making it vulnerable to anchor instability and staff interference.
- Agitation detection uses fixed velocity thresholds calibrated on synthetic data, raising questions about transfer to real patient motion patterns, particularly for subtle restlessness or low-amplitude high-frequency movements.

## Confidence

- High confidence: Collision detection performance (F1=0.98, recall=1.00) - directly measured on test set with clear metrics and reproducible methodology.
- Medium confidence: Synthetic data realism and expert validation - based on expert Likert ratings and ICC scores, but limited by small sample size (9 nurses, 63 videos) and potential bias from visible overlays during evaluation.
- Medium confidence: Agitation detection performance (F1=0.78, recall=0.70) - demonstrated on synthetic data but thresholds calibrated on limited tuning set; transfer to real-world scenarios uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-modal transfer validation**: Test AURA's collision and agitation detection on a small set of real ICU video clips (with appropriate privacy safeguards) to assess performance degradation and identify failure modes not present in synthetic data.

2. **Temporal smoothing integration**: Implement MediaPipe temporal smoothing or switch to a model with built-in temporal consistency (e.g., temporal pose networks) and measure impact on collision false positive rates due to anchor instability.

3. **Multi-person scenario evaluation**: Generate synthetic videos with multiple staff members interacting with the patient and measure collision detection accuracy when hand movements from non-patient individuals occur near the mouth zone.
