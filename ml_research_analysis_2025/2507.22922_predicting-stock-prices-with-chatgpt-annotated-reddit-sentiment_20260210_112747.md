core_contribution: This paper investigates whether social media sentiment can predict
  stock prices, focusing on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyzing sentiment for
  GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). The study employs two existing sentiment
  analysis methods (TextBlob and Financial-RoBERTa) and introduces a new fine-tuned
  RoBERTa model enhanced with ChatGPT-annotated data to better handle informal language
  and emojis.

# Predicting stock prices with ChatGPT-annotated Reddit sentiment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.22922
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22922
- **Reference count:** 27
- **Primary result:** Social media sentiment shows weak correlation with stock prices; comment volume and Google Trends are stronger predictors

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether Reddit sentiment from r/wallstreetbets can predict stock prices, focusing on GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) during January 2021. The researchers compare two existing sentiment analysis methods with a new fine-tuned RoBERTa model enhanced by ChatGPT-annotated data to better handle informal Reddit language. The findings reveal that traditional sentiment analysis has limited predictive power for these stocks, while simpler metrics like comment volume and Google search trends demonstrate stronger correlations with price movements.

## Method Summary
The research employed a multi-method approach to sentiment analysis, comparing TextBlob and Financial-RoBERTa against a newly developed fine-tuned RoBERTa model enhanced with ChatGPT-annotated data specifically trained to handle Reddit's informal language and emojis. The study analyzed Reddit data from r/wallstreetbets, focusing on GameStop and AMC during January 2021, and measured correlations with stock prices. The researchers also examined bidirectional Granger causality between stock prices and various metrics after applying stationarity adjustments.

## Key Results
- Social media sentiment shows only weak correlation with stock prices for GME and AMC
- Comment volume demonstrates stronger predictive signals (0.52 correlation for GME, 0.38 for AMC)
- Google Trends exhibits significant correlations (0.43 for GME, 0.48 for AMC) and bidirectional Granger causality with stock prices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's findings suggest that retail investor behavior on Reddit, particularly for meme stocks like GME and AMC, is driven more by volume of discussion and search interest than by the emotional sentiment of individual posts. The bidirectional Granger causality indicates that stock price movements influence discussion volume and search trends, which in turn affect subsequent price movements. This creates a feedback loop where observable metrics like comment counts and search volume serve as better leading indicators than the nuanced sentiment analysis of individual posts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reddit sentiment analysis** - Why needed: To capture retail investor emotions and opinions that may influence stock prices
- **Quick check: How informal language and emojis affect sentiment classification accuracy in financial contexts
- **Granger causality testing** - Why needed: To determine whether one time series can predict future values of another
- **Quick check: Stationarity requirements and appropriate lag selection for financial time series
- **Correlation analysis** - Why needed: To quantify the strength of relationships between social media metrics and stock prices
- **Quick check: Pearson vs Spearman correlation for non-linear relationships in financial data

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Reddit data collection -> Sentiment analysis (TextBlob, Financial-RoBERTa, fine-tuned RoBERTa) -> Correlation analysis -> Granger causality testing
- **Critical path:** Data collection → Sentiment analysis → Statistical correlation → Causality analysis
- **Design tradeoffs:** ChatGPT-annotated training data vs. existing sentiment models; two-stock focus vs. broader market coverage
- **Failure signatures:** Weak sentiment-stock correlations; stronger relationships with volume metrics; stationarity issues requiring adjustment
- **First experiments:** 1) Compare sentiment analysis accuracy on Reddit data with and without ChatGPT annotations, 2) Test correlation strength between different sentiment methods and stock prices, 3) Validate Granger causality results with alternative time series models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses only on two stocks (GME and AMC) during a specific period, limiting generalizability
- May not capture all market-moving factors including institutional activity and broader market trends
- ChatGPT-enhanced sentiment analysis may still not fully capture the complexity of retail investor discourse

## Confidence
- **Medium:** Simple metrics like comment volume and Google Trends outperform sentiment analysis in predicting stock prices
- **Low:** General claims about ineffectiveness of sentiment analysis in financial markets due to narrow scope

## Next Checks
1. Replicate analysis with larger and more diverse set of stocks across different sectors and time periods
2. Compare predictive power of Reddit sentiment with other social media platforms (e.g., Twitter)
3. Incorporate additional market indicators (institutional trading data, macroeconomic factors) to isolate retail investor sentiment contribution
