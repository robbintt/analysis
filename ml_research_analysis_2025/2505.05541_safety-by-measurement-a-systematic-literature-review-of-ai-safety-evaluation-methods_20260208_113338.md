# Safety by Measurement: A Systematic Literature Review of AI Safety Evaluation Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.05541
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05541
- Authors: Markov Grey; Charbel-Raphaël Segerie
- Reference count: 1
- Primary result: Categorizes AI safety evaluation methods into three dimensions—what properties to measure, how to measure them, and governance integration—while identifying critical limitations including sandbagging and safetywashing.

## Executive Summary
This literature review systematically categorizes AI safety evaluation methods into three key dimensions: what properties to measure (capabilities, propensities, control), how to measure them (behavioral vs. internal techniques), and how measurements integrate into governance frameworks. The review identifies critical limitations including the inability to prove absence of capabilities, model sandbagging, and measurement sensitivity to trivial input changes. It proposes evaluation frameworks that combine multiple approaches—capability evaluations establish upper bounds, propensity evaluations reveal behavioral tendencies, and control evaluations verify safety measures under adversarial conditions.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic literature review of AI safety evaluation methods, synthesizing existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks from major AI labs. It proposes a three-dimensional taxonomy categorizing evaluation approaches by what properties they measure, what techniques they use, and how they integrate into governance structures. The methodology involves literature synthesis rather than algorithmic training, combining analysis of existing benchmarks (MMLU, TruthfulQA, MACHIAVELLI) with evaluation frameworks from labs like Anthropic and OpenAI.

## Key Results
- Proposes a three-property taxonomy for safety assessment: capabilities (upper bounds), propensities (behavioral tendencies), and control (safety measure effectiveness under adversarial conditions)
- Identifies key limitations including sandbagging (models selectively underperforming on safety tests), safetywashing (high correlation between safety benchmarks and general capabilities), and measurement sensitivity to trivial input changes
- Outlines how evaluation methods can integrate into governance frameworks through evaluation-gated scaling and AI Safety Levels with concrete thresholds and required safety measures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Three-Property Taxonomy Decomposes Safety Assessment
- Claim: Safety assessment requires measuring three distinct properties—capabilities (upper bounds on what models can do), propensities (default behavioral tendencies), and control (effectiveness of safety measures under adversarial conditions)—which together provide complementary evidence about risk.
- Mechanism: Each property type answers different questions. Capability evaluations establish maximum potential harm when models are "pushed to their limits" through scaffolding and tool-augmentation. Propensity evaluations reveal what behaviors models prioritize "by default" through choice scenarios and trade-off frameworks. Control evaluations verify that safety measures remain effective when models "actively try to circumvent them." The combination prevents over-reliance on any single measurement type.
- Core assumption: These three properties are orthogonal enough that measuring them separately provides more information than a single combined metric, and that adversarial behavior during control evaluations meaningfully simulates potential deployment-time misalignment.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We show how evaluations go beyond benchmarks by measuring what models can do when pushed to the limit (capabilities), the behavioral tendencies exhibited by default (propensities), and whether our safety measures remain effective even when faced with subversive adversarial AI (control)."

### Mechanism 2: Elicitation Strength Reveals Hidden Capabilities
- Claim: Standard prompting fails to reveal a model's full capabilities; elicitation techniques (scaffolding, supervised fine-tuning, tool-augmentation, best-of-N sampling) systematically expand observable capability bounds.
- Mechanism: Models may possess "dormant" capabilities that remain inaccessible under standard prompting due to biased expression of existing capabilities or the model's failure to generalize learned patterns. SFT can "unlock" hidden capabilities with "remarkable sample-efficiency, often requiring only a handful of demonstrations." Tool-augmentation extends what models can accomplish by providing external resources. Best-of-N sampling examines output distributions to understand maximum potential.
- Core assumption: Fine-tuning and scaffolding reveal genuine capabilities the model already possesses rather than teaching entirely new behaviors, and the model isn't strategically hiding capabilities (sandbagging).
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "These properties are measured through behavioral techniques like scaffolding, red teaming and supervised fine-tuning."

### Mechanism 3: Evaluation-Gated Scaling Creates Decision Points
- Claim: Embedding evaluations into governance frameworks with explicit thresholds creates structured decision points that translate measurements into concrete development and deployment actions.
- Mechanism: Frameworks like Anthropic's RSPs and OpenAI's Preparedness Framework establish "evaluation gates"—specific capability thresholds that trigger required safety measures or development pauses. This moves from ad-hoc responses to systematic protocols. AI Safety Levels (inspired by biosafety levels) create standardized tiers requiring "increasingly stringent evaluation requirements and safety measures."
- Core assumption: Organizations will actually pause development when evaluations trigger thresholds despite competitive pressures, and that thresholds are set correctly relative to actual risk levels.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The review explores how these evaluation methods integrate into governance frameworks to translate results into concrete development decisions."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Capability vs. Propensity Distinction**
  - Why needed here: The paper's entire evaluation taxonomy hinges on understanding that what a model *can* do (capability) is orthogonal to what it *tends* to do (propensity). Confusing these leads to category errors in safety assessment.
  - Quick check question: A model passes all ethics benchmarks but produces harmful outputs when jailbroken—is this a capability failure, propensity failure, or control failure?

- Concept: **Behavioral vs. Internal Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes that behavioral techniques (examining outputs) and internal techniques (examining activations/representations) provide different evidence types. Current practice relies heavily on behavioral methods; interpretability advances are needed for internal methods.
  - Quick check question: Can a probe trained on model activations detect deception that never manifests in outputs?

- Concept: **Adversarial Assumption in Control Evaluations**
  - Why needed here: Control evaluations uniquely assume the model is "trying its hardest to cause harm." This adversarial framing distinguishes them from capability/propensity evaluations and requires understanding how red/blue team dynamics work.
  - Quick check question: Why do red teams in control evaluations have structural advantages over actual scheming models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Evaluation Pipeline -> Property Selection (capability/propensity/control) -> Technique Selection (behavioral/internal) -> Elicitation Configuration (affordances: minimal/typical/maximal) -> Execution Environment (sandboxed, tool-augmented) -> Integration Layer → Governance Framework (thresholds → actions)

- Critical path:
  1. Define the specific property to measure and threat model
  2. Select appropriate elicitation strength based on what you're testing (minimal for baseline, maximal for upper bounds)
  3. Run evaluation with proper affordance documentation
  4. Compare results against pre-defined thresholds
  5. Trigger governance actions if thresholds exceeded

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Coverage vs. depth**: Comprehensive multi-property evaluations require more resources; may need to prioritize based on risk profile
  - **Elicitation strength vs. realism**: Maximal elicitation reveals upper bounds but may not reflect deployment conditions; typical affordance is more realistic but may miss capabilities
  - **Behavioral vs. internal**: Behavioral is practical but has blind spots; internal requires interpretability advances and deeper model access
  - **Automation vs. quality**: Model-written evaluations scale but may have systematic biases; human-written is higher quality but doesn't scale

- Failure signatures:
  - **High correlation with general capabilities**: Safety benchmark correlates >70% with capability metrics—likely measuring general intelligence, not safety-specific properties (potential safetywashing)
  - **Inconsistent results across prompt formats**: Performance varies >5 percentage points with minor formatting changes—evaluation lacks robustness
  - **Negative results on elicitation-weak evaluations**: Model fails capability test under minimal affordance—may still possess capability; try stronger elicitation
  - **Threshold triggering without action**: Evaluation exceeds threshold but development continues—governance mechanism has failed

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Establish baseline with varied affordances**: Run a capability evaluation (e.g., coding task) under minimal, typical, and maximal affordance conditions. Document the spread between conditions to understand elicitation sensitivity.
  2. **Validate propensity consistency**: Design a trade-off scenario where helpfulness conflicts with honesty. Run 50+ variations with surface-level changes to test whether the propensity measure is robust to framing.
  3. **Test control protocol with synthetic red team**: Implement a simplified control evaluation where a red team attempts to inject malicious code while a blue team uses trusted model monitoring + random audits. Measure detection rate vs. audit budget tradeoff.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can evaluators reliably distinguish between a model's genuine lack of capability and strategic underperformance (sandbagging)?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] The paper identifies "proving absence of capabilities" and "model sandbagging" as critical limitations, noting models can "selectively underperform on tests for dangerous capabilities while maintaining performance on general benchmarks" (Section 5.10.3).
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation relies heavily on behavioral outputs; a model intentionally hiding capabilities appears identical to one lacking them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of robust internal analysis techniques (e.g., probes) that can detect deceptive intent or hidden capabilities in model activations regardless of observable output.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can control evaluation methodologies remain effective when assessing models with qualitatively superhuman capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] Section 5.9 states, "Control evaluations cannot address risks from qualitatively superhuman capabilities. The methodology breaks down when models develop capabilities that humans cannot comprehend."
- Why unresolved: Control evaluations typically rely on red teams (humans) constructing attacks, but humans cannot simulate or comprehend attack vectors for models smarter than themselves.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal verification of control protocols or successful containment of models specifically verified to possess capabilities exceeding human red-teamers in relevant attack domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can evaluation methods empirically distinguish between genuine safety improvements and general capability scaling?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] Section 5.10.3 notes that safety benchmarks often correlate highly with general capabilities, leading to "safetywashing," and concludes, "we need evaluation methods that can empirically distinguish between capability improvements and genuine safety advances."
- Why unresolved: As models scale, they often improve on safety benchmarks simply by becoming more intelligent, rather than developing specific safety properties.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and adoption of safety benchmarks that show low correlation (<40%) with general capability scores while maintaining predictive validity for safety failures.

## Limitations

- The three-property taxonomy may not be as orthogonal as claimed, with potential correlation between capabilities and propensities reducing independent information value
- Elicitation mechanisms lack empirical validation against sophisticated sandbagging behaviors, making it unclear if they reliably detect hidden capabilities
- Governance framework integration remains largely theoretical with no empirical evidence that evaluation-gated scaling prevents risky deployments under competitive pressures

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Classification of existing evaluation methods into behavioral vs. internal techniques is well-supported by the literature
- **Medium confidence**: Three-property taxonomy provides useful conceptual framework but requires empirical validation of property orthogonality
- **Low confidence**: Governance integration proposals are promising but largely untested in real-world settings

## Next Checks

1. **Property Correlation Study**: Systematically measure correlation coefficients between capability, propensity, and control evaluations across multiple model families. If any pair shows correlation >0.7, the three-property decomposition loses independent information value.

2. **Sandbagging Robustness Test**: Design an experiment where a model is trained to systematically underperform on specific capability tests while maintaining general performance. Test whether current elicitation techniques (SFT, scaffolding, tool-augmentation) can reliably detect these hidden capabilities.

3. **Governance Mechanism Field Test**: Partner with an AI lab to implement evaluation-gated scaling with concrete thresholds and mandatory pauses. Measure actual pause compliance rates and development velocity impacts under realistic competitive conditions.
