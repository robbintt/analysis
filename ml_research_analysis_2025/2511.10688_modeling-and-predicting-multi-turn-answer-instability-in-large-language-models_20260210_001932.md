# Modeling and Predicting Multi-Turn Answer Instability in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10688
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10688

- One-line primary result: LLM accuracy degrades significantly under repeated questioning without new evidence, modeled effectively by Markov chains and predictable via early-layer hidden state probes.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how large language model (LLM) accuracy changes when subjected to multiple rounds of questioning without new evidence, using simple follow-up prompts like "Think again" and "You are wrong." The authors demonstrate that accuracy drops significantly—up to ~10% for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns—and that this degradation can be modeled as a Markov chain with predictable stationary accuracy. Additionally, linear probes of hidden states can predict answer changes, with strongest signals appearing in early layers, revealing that the decision to change an answer is encoded in the model's representations. These findings highlight LLM fragility under repeated questioning and suggest robustness improvements are needed for high-stakes interactive applications.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate LLM robustness by subjecting models to initial questions followed by nine repeated follow-up prompts (Think Again, Are You Sure, or You Are Wrong) without providing new evidence. Accuracy is tracked across turns to quantify degradation. A two-state Markov chain models accuracy dynamics, estimating transition probabilities between correct and incorrect states to predict long-run stationary accuracy. Linear probes (ridge regression) are trained on hidden state representations at each layer to predict whether an answer will change on the next turn. The methodology is tested across multiple datasets (MMLU, MathQA, Humanity's Last Exam, GlobalOpinionsQA) and models (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemma 3 4B).

## Key Results
- Accuracy drops significantly under repeated questioning: ~10% for Gemini 1.5 Flash over 9 turns with "Think again," and 7.5% for Claude 3.5 Haiku when combined with reworded questions.
- Markov chains accurately model multi-turn accuracy, predicting a stationary accuracy 8% lower than first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash.
- Linear probes of hidden states can predict answer changes, with strongest signals in early layers (accuracy rising from 0.50 to 0.89 by layer 3 for "Think again").

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Markovian State Transitions for Accuracy Dynamics
- Claim: Multi-turn answer accuracy can be modeled as a two-state Markov process, enabling prediction of stationary accuracy degradation from transition probabilities.
- Mechanism: Each turn's answer (correct/incorrect) is a discrete state. Transition probabilities ($p_{TF}$ for correct→incorrect, $p_{FT}$ for incorrect→correct) are empirically estimated from observed sequences. These define a transition matrix whose repeated application converges to a stationary distribution $Acc_{\infty} = \frac{p_{FT}}{p_{TF} + p_{FT}}$, representing long-run accuracy under repeated prompting.
- Core assumption: Answer transitions are history-independent given the current state (first-order Markov property) and transition probabilities are stationary across turns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling prediction of accuracy probabilities over time."
  - [section 5.2] Details the two-state model, 80/20 train/validation split for estimating $p_{TF}$ and $p_{FT}$, and the recursive simulation equation.
  - [corpus] Weak direct validation; "Shallow Robustness, Deep Vulnerabilities" (arXiv:2510.12255) discusses multi-turn evaluation but not Markov modeling.
- Break condition: If transitions depend on turn index (non-stationarity) or longer history (e.g., sequence of past 3 states), the first-order Markov assumption fails.

### Mechanism 2: Linear Probing of Early-Layer Hidden States for Instability Prediction
- Claim: Information predictive of an impending answer change is linearly accessible in the model's hidden states, with strongest signals in early layers.
- Mechanism: A linear probe (ridge regression) is trained on last-token hidden state vectors at each layer to predict a binary label: "answer changes on next turn" vs. "no change." High probe accuracy indicates the hidden state linearly encodes this future behavior.
- Core assumption: The decision to change an answer is (at least partially) encoded in a linearly separable subspace of the hidden state representation at the current prompt.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "linear probes of hidden states can predict answer changes, with early layers showing strongest signals."
  - [section 6.3] Figure 7 shows probe predicted probability rising sharply in early layers (0.50 to 0.89 by layer 3) under "Think again," stabilizing thereafter.
  - [corpus] "I May Not Have Articulated Myself Clearly" (arXiv:2602.02863) supports feasibility of internal-state diagnostics for reasoning instability but does not confirm this specific linear probe mechanism.
- Break condition: If probe accuracy drops to chance (~0.5) or exhibits high variance across questions, the linear separability assumption is invalid.

### Mechanism 3: Prompt Pressure Induces State Drift Toward Lower-Accuracy Equilibrium
- Claim: Adversarial or repetitive follow-up prompts shift transition probabilities toward incorrect states, observable as cumulative accuracy degradation toward a lower stationary equilibrium.
- Mechanism: The follow-up prompt (e.g., "You are wrong") acts as a forcing function on the Markov transition matrix, increasing $p_{TF}$ (correct→incorrect). Over multiple turns, this bias accumulates, shifting the stationary distribution.
- Core assumption: The "pressure" effect of prompts is sufficiently consistent to be modeled as a modification to underlying state transition probabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a simple 'Think again' prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop... 'You are wrong'... caused a 7.5% drop..."
  - [section 4.1] URW prompt produced largest drop (12.4% for GPT, 11.9% for Gemini). Control experiment with repeated questions (no prompt) showed deviation of only 0.2%–2.8%, indicating prompt pressure is causal.
  - [corpus] "Time-To-Inconsistency" (arXiv:2510.02712) conceptually supports cumulative pressure models for robustness degradation in multi-turn dialogues.
- Break condition: If accuracy degradation is inconsistent or reverses across turns without prompt changes, the assumption of a consistent pressure effect fails.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Markov Chain Stationary Distribution**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core metric—stationary accuracy—is derived from a two-state Markov model. Understanding how repeated application of a transition matrix converges to a stable distribution is essential to interpret this metric.
  - Quick check question: If $p_{TF}=0.3$ and $p_{FT}=0.1$, what is the stationary accuracy? (Answer: $0.1/(0.3+0.1)=0.25$)

- **Concept: Linear Probes for Feature Localization**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses linear probes to claim answer-change information is encoded in hidden states. Evaluating this claim requires understanding what linear probes can/cannot detect.
  - Quick check question: If a probe achieves 85% accuracy on layer 3 but 52% on layer 20, where is the relevant information most accessible?

- **Concept: Sycophancy in LLMs**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames instability in terms of sycophantic behavior—conforming to user pressure. This helps explain why adversarial prompts like "You are wrong" induce larger accuracy drops.
  - Quick check question: How might sycophantic tendencies explain the difference in degradation between neutral ("Think again") and adversarial ("You are wrong") prompts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Multi-Turn Prompting Engine -> Markov Transition Estimator -> Accuracy Simulator -> (Optional) Hidden State Probe Trainer -> Probe Evaluator

- **Critical path:** (1) Generate multi-turn answers for dataset with specific prompt, (2) Estimate Markov transitions from training subset, (3) Simulate and compare against validation accuracy, (4) (Optional) Extract hidden states, train/evaluate probes.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Probe complexity:** Linear probes are interpretable and less prone to overfitting; non-linear probes might capture more but reduce interpretability.
  - **Prompt selection:** Three fixed prompts enable controlled comparison but may not generalize to diverse real-world follow-ups.
  - **Markov order:** First-order model is parsimonious; higher-order models could improve fit but require more data and complicate analysis.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Markov divergence:** Simulated accuracy deviates >5% from true accuracy at late turns (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Flash on some prompts in Figure 4).
  - **Probe non-predictiveness:** Probe accuracy near 50% across all layers indicates hidden states lack linearly accessible signal.
  - **Inconsistent degradation:** Accuracy fluctuates without clear trend, rendering stationary accuracy uninterpretable.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline replication: Run 10-turn protocol with "Think again" on GPT-4o/MMLU subset; verify degradation trend matches reported patterns.
  2. Markov assumption test: Compare first-order Markov simulation vs. constant-accuracy baseline; quantify MSE reduction to justify model complexity.
  3. Probe layer sweep: For Gemma 3 4B, train linear probes per layer on "Think again" data; plot accuracy vs. layer depth to confirm early-layer signal concentration.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can non-linear probes significantly outperform linear probes in predicting answer changes, particularly under adversarial follow-up prompts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6.3 states that linear probes showed fluctuating results under the adversarial "You are wrong" prompt and suggests that "training non-linear probes... may reveal stronger and more robust evidence."
- Why unresolved: The authors limited their methodology to linear classifiers (ridge regression), which struggled to interpret signals induced by adversarial pressure compared to simple prompts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing non-linear probe performance (e.g., MLPs) on the same hidden states, specifically evaluating AUC-ROC on turns following adversarial prompts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the observed accuracy degradation and stationary accuracy drop generalize to natural, informal user interactions where disagreement is expressed indirectly?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 notes that the "prompts do not fully reflect how users naturally interact with language models," differing from the "informal and indirect ways users typically express uncertainty."
- Why unresolved: The study relied on explicit, constructed prompts like "Think again" or "You are wrong," leaving the dynamics of implicit user pressure unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using datasets of authentic multi-turn human-model dialogues where user intent is annotated as "challenging" but phrased naturally (e.g., "Are you sure that's right?").

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do more capable or frontier-class models exhibit the same magnitude of stationary accuracy loss (approx. 8-15%) observed in the tested models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 lists the limitation that the authors "could not include other potentially more capable models due to budget constraints."
- Why unresolved: The study primarily evaluated GPT-4.1-nano, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Haiku, leaving it unclear if scaling laws mitigate or exacerbate this specific form of multi-turn instability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the Markov chain transition analysis on larger models (e.g., GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to compare the gap between first-turn and stationary accuracy.

## Limitations

- The study uses three fixed, explicit follow-up prompts that do not reflect natural, informal user interactions where uncertainty or disagreement is expressed indirectly.
- The Markov chain model assumes stationary transition probabilities, which may not hold across all prompt types or model families, potentially limiting the accuracy of long-run predictions.
- The analysis is limited to specific model families (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemma 3 4B) due to budget constraints, leaving uncertainty about whether more capable models exhibit similar degradation patterns.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The observed accuracy degradation under repeated questioning is well-established across multiple models and datasets. The methodology for collecting multi-turn answer sequences is clearly specified.
- **Medium Confidence:** The Markov chain modeling provides a reasonable approximation of accuracy dynamics, though the assumption of stationary transition probabilities may not hold across all prompt types or model families.
- **Medium Confidence:** The linear probe findings showing early-layer signals are methodologically sound, but the linear separability assumption and its implications for understanding the underlying mechanism remain somewhat speculative.

## Next Checks

1. **Stationarity Test:** For each model/prompt combination, test whether transition probabilities change significantly across turn bins (early/mid/late). If non-stationary, compare first-order Markov simulation against higher-order or non-stationary alternatives.
2. **Probe Non-linearity Check:** Train non-linear probes (MLP, small transformer) on the same hidden state features and compare accuracy to linear probes. If non-linear probes show substantial improvement, the linear separability claim is weakened.
3. **Prompt Generalization:** Apply the multi-turn protocol with 3-5 diverse, naturally occurring follow-up prompts (e.g., "Can you elaborate?", "What if we consider X?") to assess whether the observed degradation patterns generalize beyond the three fixed adversarial/neutral prompts.
