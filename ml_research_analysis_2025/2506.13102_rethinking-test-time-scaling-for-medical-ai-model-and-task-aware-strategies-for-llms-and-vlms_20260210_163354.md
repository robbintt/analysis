# Rethinking Test-Time Scaling for Medical AI: Model and Task-Aware Strategies for LLMs and VLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.13102
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13102
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Test-time scaling improves performance primarily for reasoning models on complex tasks, with optimal strategy depending on task difficulty and model type.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates test-time scaling strategies for large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in medical applications. The authors evaluate how increasing token budgets, sequential scaling, and parallel scaling affect model performance across various medical benchmark datasets, considering factors such as model size, task complexity, and robustness to user-driven factors like misleading prompts. The results show that test-time scaling improves performance primarily for reasoning models on complex tasks, with parallel scaling being more effective for simpler tasks and sequential scaling benefiting more challenging ones. Medical models underperform on calculation tasks compared to general models, likely due to fine-tuning bias. For VLMs, scaling effects are limited except for models specifically designed for reasoning.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates test-time scaling strategies through inference-only experiments on medical LLMs and VLMs. Three scaling strategies are tested: token budget scaling (varying max sequence length), sequential scaling (iterative revision with "Wait." token), and parallel scaling (multiple simultaneous samples with shortest majority vote). Five text datasets (PubMedQA, MedQA, MedBullets, MedXpertQA-Text, MedCalc-Bench) and two vision-text datasets (OmniMedVQA, MedXpertQA-MM) are used. Models tested include Llama 3, Qwen2.5, DeepSeek-R1-Distill, HuatuoGPT-o1, m1, MedGemma, and QoQ-Med. Performance is measured via accuracy, coverage, and reasoning token utilization across different scaling configurations.

## Key Results
- Test-time scaling improves performance primarily for reasoning models on complex tasks
- Parallel scaling is more effective for simpler tasks, while sequential scaling benefits challenging ones
- Medical models underperform on calculation tasks compared to general models due to fine-tuning bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Test-time scaling improves performance for reasoning-optimized models on complex tasks by enabling extended chain-of-thought generation.
- Mechanism: Increasing the token budget allows models trained on CoT-annotated data to produce more detailed intermediate reasoning steps, exploring solution paths more thoroughly before committing to an answer.
- Core assumption: The model has been explicitly trained to utilize additional tokens for reasoning rather than simply padding output; this typically requires SFT on CoT data or RL with reasoning objectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "test-time scaling improves performance primarily for reasoning models on complex tasks"
  - [section] "For reasoning models, most show minimal or no improvement in performance on the easier task (PubMedQA) as the token budget increases. However, as the task difficulty increases... reasoning models tend to use more reasoning tokens."
  - [corpus] Related paper "Limits and Gains of Test-Time Scaling in Vision-Language Reasoning" systematically explores TTS boundaries in multimodal systems.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Optimal scaling strategy depends on task difficulty—parallel scaling suits simpler tasks while sequential scaling benefits complex reasoning.
- Mechanism: Parallel scaling generates diverse solution paths simultaneously (effective when answers are easily verifiable), while sequential scaling enables iterative self-correction through "Wait" token injection (effective for multi-step reasoning where early mistakes compound).
- Core assumption: Task complexity can be characterized and mapped to appropriate scaling strategy; models can recognize and correct errors during sequential revision.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "parallel scaling being more effective for simpler tasks and sequential scaling benefiting more challenging ones"
  - [section] "On PubMedQA, the easiest QA task, both models show a decline in accuracy as the number of sequential sampling steps increases. Moreover, the accuracy achieved with parallel scaling is higher."
  - [corpus] "Efficient Test-Time Scaling for Small Vision-Language Models" addresses computational tradeoffs in scaling strategy selection.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Medical-domain fine-tuning creates specialization bias that impairs numerical reasoning capabilities.
- Mechanism: Medical models trained primarily on textual medical knowledge experience degradation of general calculation abilities during fine-tuning—a form of catastrophic forgetting where numerical reasoning patterns are overwritten.
- Core assumption: Fine-tuning on domain-specific data causes loss of general reasoning capabilities not represented in the fine-tuning corpus.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Medical models underperform on calculation tasks compared to general models, likely due to fine-tuning bias"
  - [section] "medical models are primarily fine-tuned on medical datasets, which often lack numerical reasoning tasks. This fine-tuning process may impair the models' calculation abilities."
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus evidence on calculation-specific degradation; related papers focus on VLM scaling rather than numerical reasoning preservation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
  - Why needed here: Test-time scaling fundamentally relies on the model's ability to decompose problems into intermediate reasoning steps; without intrinsic CoT capability, additional tokens provide no benefit.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why appending "Let's think step by step" to prompts encourages non-reasoning models to generate intermediate steps, and why this differs from native reasoning capability?

- Concept: Token Budget Allocation Strategies
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between expanding single-generation token limits, parallel sampling, and sequential revision—each represents different compute allocation philosophies with distinct failure modes.
  - Quick check question: Given a fixed compute budget of 8192 total tokens, what factors determine whether you should allocate it to (a) one long generation, (b) 16 parallel samples of 512 tokens, or (c) 8 sequential revisions of 512 tokens?

- Concept: Model Training Paradigms (SFT vs RL for Reasoning)
  - Why needed here: The paper shows reasoning models trained via RL (DeepSeek-R1) or SFT on CoT data (m1, HuatuoGPT-o1) respond differently to scaling; understanding training methodology predicts scaling behavior.
  - Quick check question: Why might a distilled model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill trained only via SFT on synthetic data) underperform compared to the original RL-trained model, particularly in smaller parameter counts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Token Budget Controller: Configures max_sequence_length per generation request
  - Sequential Scaler: Implements iterative revision loop; appends "Wait." token to trigger continuation
  - Parallel Scaler: Dispatches N simultaneous requests; aggregates via shortest majority vote
  - Hybrid Coordinator: Partitions total budget between sequential steps and parallel branches
  - Answer Extractor: Parses `\boxed{}` syntax to isolate final answers from reasoning traces
  - Coverage Tracker: Monitors whether correct answer appears in any intermediate output (vs. final selection accuracy)

- Critical path:
  1. Classify model type: reasoning vs. non-reasoning, medical vs. general domain
  2. Assess task difficulty using dataset characteristics (choice count, reasoning depth required)
  3. Map model-task combination to recommended scaling strategy (see Tables III-IV)
  4. Deploy strategy and monitor token utilization ratio (actual tokens used / budget allocated)
  5. If utilization <30% for reasoning model, consider alternative strategies

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Parallel scaling: Lower latency (embarrassingly parallel), better for verifiable answers, but no self-correction capability
  - Sequential scaling: Enables error recovery, but compounds mistakes on simple tasks and increases latency linearly
  - Token budget expansion: Only effective for reasoning-capable models; wastes compute on non-reasoning architectures
  - Medical-specialized models: Superior domain knowledge (~10-15% higher on MedQA) but inferior calculation performance

- Failure signatures:
  - Non-reasoning model using <600 tokens despite 8192 budget → switch to parallel scaling or different model
  - Accuracy decreasing with more sequential steps on easy tasks → over-revision occurring; use parallel instead
  - Medical model failing MedCalc-Bench while general model succeeds → fine-tuning bias; route calculations to general models
  - VLM generating "I can't see the image" or misinterpreting prompts as visual content → QVQ-specific failure mode on simple VQA

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Token utilization profiling: Run m1-7B and HuatuoGPT-o1-7B on MedXpertQA with budgets [512, 2048, 8192]; plot actual tokens used vs. accuracy to verify which model utilizes additional compute. Expect m1 to show scaling, HuatuoGPT to saturate early.
  2. Scaling strategy ablation on intermediate difficulty: Test MedQA with three conditions—(a) 8192 single generation, (b) 16×512 parallel majority vote, (c) 4 sequential × 4 parallel hybrid. Measure accuracy and coverage to identify optimal allocation for models with different token usage patterns.
  3. Robustness degradation quantification: Apply misleading expert-definitive prompts to MedXpertQA across three scaling strategies (default 512, budget 8192, optimal seq-para). Calculate accuracy delta from clean baseline to determine which strategy best recovers performance under adversarial user input.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: Can employing trained verifiers to select accurate responses yield greater performance or efficiency than current parallel or sequential scaling strategies in medical reasoning tasks?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors list "employing trained verifiers to select the most accurate response among candidates" as a promising strategy that was not explored, contrasting it with the token budget and parallel/sequential methods evaluated.
  - **Why unresolved**: The current study restricted its scope to budget forcing, iterative self-revision, and parallel sampling, leaving the potential utility of external verification mechanisms untested.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative experiments integrating trained verifiers into the test-time pipeline to measure accuracy and computational cost against the sequential and parallel scaling baselines established in the paper.

- **Question**: Can advanced or hybrid test-time scaling techniques fully restore model performance when facing misleading user-driven factors, overcoming the partial recovery observed in this study?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors conclude that while test-time scaling improved robustness, it "was not sufficient to fully restore performance to baseline levels," explicitly calling for "more advanced or hybrid test-time scaling techniques" to address this.
  - **Why unresolved**: The paper demonstrates that existing scaling methods only partially mitigate the negative impact of misleading prompts (user-driven factors), failing to close the performance gap completely.
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Developing hybrid scaling methods and evaluating them on the misleading prompt datasets (MedQA, MedBullets) to see if they can achieve accuracy levels statistically indistinguishable from the unperturbed baseline.

- **Question**: Do proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) exhibit similar test-time scaling behaviors and trade-offs compared to the open-source LLMs evaluated in this study?
  - **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors acknowledge their experiments were "limited to open-source LLMs" and identify "extending test-time scaling evaluations to these models" as an "important direction for future research."
  - **Why unresolved**: The findings regarding token budget saturation and the efficacy of sequential vs. parallel scaling are currently generalized only to open-source architectures (Llama, Qwen, etc.).
  - **What evidence would resolve it**: Replicating the paper's experimental protocols (varying token budgets and scaling strategies) on proprietary models using the same medical benchmarks to compare scaling efficacy.

## Limitations

- The proposed scaling strategies cannot be universally applied across all model families due to their dependence on reasoning capabilities trained via RL or SFT on CoT data
- The paper identifies medical fine-tuning bias causing calculation performance degradation but does not provide a solution or mitigation strategy
- Limited effectiveness of test-time scaling for VLMs, particularly on simple tasks, suggests fundamental architectural constraints

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core finding that test-time scaling effectiveness depends on model type (reasoning vs. non-reasoning) and task complexity (simple vs. complex) is well-supported by experimental data
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim about medical fine-tuning causing calculation performance degradation is supported by comparative experiments, but the mechanism remains speculative without ablation studies
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of VLM findings is limited by small number of models tested and uncertainty whether this represents temporary state or fundamental constraint

## Next Checks

1. Apply the identified optimal scaling strategies (parallel for simple, sequential for complex) to a broader set of medical tasks beyond QA, including clinical decision support and medical image interpretation tasks. Measure whether the same model-task mapping holds or if additional dimensions better predict scaling effectiveness.

2. Test whether fine-tuning medical models on numerical reasoning datasets can recover calculation performance without sacrificing medical domain knowledge. Use parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to preserve medical capabilities while adding numerical reasoning skills.

3. Compare test-time scaling effectiveness across VLMs with different architectural designs (e.g., QVQ vs. CoT-VQA vs. VLMs with built-in reasoning capabilities). Test whether architectural modifications that explicitly support iterative reasoning can improve scaling performance on both simple and complex visual tasks.
