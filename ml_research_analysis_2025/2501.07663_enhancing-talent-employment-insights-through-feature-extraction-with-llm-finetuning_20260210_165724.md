# Enhancing Talent Employment Insights Through Feature Extraction with LLM Finetuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.07663
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07663
- Reference count: 7
- Developed pipeline using LLMs to extract job features from unstructured postings

## Executive Summary
This study developed a pipeline leveraging large language models to extract nuanced job features from unstructured postings. Using a 1.2 million record dataset, semantic chunking, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuned DistilBERT models were employed to classify remote work type, remuneration, experience, and education requirements. While initial Gemini-based labeling showed promise, fine-tuned models achieved moderate performance with F1 scores ranging from 0.59-0.78 across features. Accuracy varied by sub-variable, with remuneration and education-level predictions performing better than experience-level and education-requirement classifications. The approach demonstrated LLMs' potential for labor market analytics despite data inconsistencies and computational constraints, providing a foundation for future refinement of feature extraction methods.

## Method Summary
The pipeline processes raw job postings through HTML parsing and cleanup, then applies semantic chunking with TokenTextSplitter followed by JINA embeddings and FAISS retrieval. Gemini 1.5 Flash zero-shot labels ~10,000 records using variable-specific prompts, which serve as synthetic ground truth for fine-tuning four separate DistilBERT models. The models classify remote work type, remuneration details, experience requirements, and education requirements, with outputs formatted as JSON dictionaries containing predictions and confidence scores.

## Key Results
- F1 scores across features: Remote (0.78), Remuneration (0.68), Experience (0.59), Education (0.66)
- Sub-variable performance varied significantly, with commission detection at 96.4% accuracy but experience-level classification at 0.59 F1
- Separate fine-tuned models outperformed unified multi-task architectures
- Remuneration and education-level predictions showed better accuracy than experience-level and education-requirement classifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large LLM-generated labels can serve as synthetic ground truth for fine-tuning smaller, deployable models.
- Mechanism: Gemini 1.5 Flash zero-shot labels ~10,000 records → DistilBERT fine-tuned on those labels → smaller model approximates larger model's classification logic at lower inference cost.
- Core assumption: The teacher LLM's labels are sufficiently accurate that errors don't propagate catastrophically to the student model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "fine-tuned DistilBERT models were employed to classify remote work type, remuneration, experience, and education requirements"
  - [section 2.2] "Using these labels as ground truth, we planned to fine-tune a pipeline of smaller open-source LLMs"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related papers use LLMs for extraction but don't validate teacher-student distillation specifically.
- Break condition: If teacher labels contain systematic biases (e.g., misclassifying negation patterns), student models will inherit and amplify those errors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Semantic chunking with RAG reduces irrelevant context and improves extraction precision on long documents.
- Mechanism: TokenTextSplitter segments job postings → JINA embeddings + FAISS retrieval → only similarity-ranked chunks passed to LLM prompt, reducing token load while preserving relevant signals.
- Core assumption: Relevant information for each variable clusters in semantically coherent chunks retrievable via query similarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "semantic chunking, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuned DistilBERT models were employed"
  - [section 2.2] "Given a job posting, we semantically chunk the text and impart vector embeddings... the vector storage is leveraged to only return the chunks that are most similar to the prompt"
  - [corpus] No direct validation of chunking efficacy; corpus papers focus on extraction architectures, not retrieval mechanisms.
- Break condition: If key signals (e.g., salary mentions) are scattered across non-adjacent chunks, retrieval may miss critical context.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Task-specific fine-tuning outperforms unified multi-task models for heterogeneous extraction targets.
- Mechanism: Four separate DistilBERT models trained per variable category (remote, remuneration, experience, education) → outperformed attempted weight-merged unified model.
- Core assumption: Feature extraction tasks have insufficient shared structure for positive transfer in a single model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "the performance of the merged model was found to be subpar compared to the use of separate fine-tuned models"
  - [section 2.2] "We found that using a separate prompt and LLM for each of our four variables of interest yielded the most precise results"
  - [corpus] Indirect support from task-specific extraction in related papers, but no direct comparison of unified vs. separate architectures.
- Break condition: If tasks share deeper linguistic patterns, separate models forfeit potential regularization and knowledge transfer benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Distillation (Teacher-Student Training)
  - Why needed here: The pipeline depends on transferring Gemini's labeling capability to DistilBERT without human annotation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a smaller model might fail to replicate teacher behavior if label noise is high?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: Core input processing step—must understand how vector similarity retrieves relevant chunks from long job postings.
  - Quick check question: What happens to retrieval quality if the embedding model is poorly matched to the domain vocabulary?

- Concept: Multi-Task Learning vs. Task-Specific Fine-Tuning
  - Why needed here: The weight-merging experiment failed; understanding why requires grasping task interference and negative transfer.
  - Quick check question: Why might sharing a classifier head across education and remuneration extraction hurt performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Raw job posting text -> HTML parsing and cleanup -> TokenTextSplitter chunking -> JINA embeddings -> FAISS vector store -> Query-based retrieval -> Gemini labeling (training only) -> Fine-tune 4x DistilBERT models -> JSON output with predictions and confidence scores

- Critical path:
  1. Data quality (HTML parsing failures, NULL handling) directly impacts training set integrity.
  2. Chunking granularity and retrieval recall determine what signals reach the model.
  3. Teacher label quality bounds student model ceiling—no human ground truth was used.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. accuracy: DistilBERT chosen for efficiency; larger models may improve F1 but increase latency.
  - Single vs. separate models: Separate models performed better but increase maintenance overhead.
  - RAG vs. regex preprocessing: RAG flexible but computationally heavier; regex proposed as future optimization.

- Failure signatures:
  - Negation mishandling: "you do not need a Bachelor's degree" → model predicts degree required.
  - Class imbalance artifacts: Commission detection (96.4% accuracy) likely reflects majority-class guessing.
  - Inconsistent output formats: "onsite" vs. "on_site" vs. "in_person" required manual mapping.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate teacher labels on a held-out human-annotated sample (e.g., 100-200 records) to quantify synthetic ground truth error rate.
  2. A/B test regex-based keyword extraction vs. semantic chunking for retrieval—measure recall of known signal sentences.
  3. Train single-variable models for each of the 9 sub-variables instead of 4 grouped models; compare F1 per sub-variable.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study relies entirely on synthetic ground truth labels from Gemini 1.5 Flash without human validation, creating an unknown upper bound on achievable performance.
- Chunking and RAG retrieval quality directly impact what signals reach the models, yet retrieval recall and chunking granularity remain unspecified.
- The reported F1 scores (0.59-0.78) show moderate performance with high variance across sub-variables, suggesting significant room for improvement in extraction precision.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The overall pipeline architecture (chunking → RAG → fine-tuning) is technically sound and correctly implemented. The decision to use separate models per variable category over unified approaches is well-supported by empirical results.
- **Medium confidence**: The synthetic labeling approach using Gemini 1.5 Flash is reasonable but unproven without human ground truth validation. Performance metrics are reliable but may overestimate real-world accuracy due to label noise.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of results beyond the AdeptID dataset, and the exact impact of chunking parameters and retrieval configuration on final performance, remain unclear without specification or ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. Validate Gemini-generated labels against human-annotated ground truth on a held-out sample (100-200 records) to quantify synthetic label error rates and identify systematic biases.
2. A/B test semantic chunking + RAG retrieval against regex-based keyword extraction to measure recall of known signal sentences and assess computational tradeoffs.
3. Train single-variable models for each of the 9 sub-variables instead of 4 grouped models to compare F1 scores per sub-variable and identify optimal model granularity.
