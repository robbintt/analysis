# Speech Quality Assessment Model Based on Mixture of Experts: System-Level Performance Enhancement and Utterance-Level Challenge Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06116
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06116
- Authors: Xintong Hu; Yixuan Chen; Rui Yang; Wenxiang Guo; Changhao Pan
- Reference count: 6
- One-line primary result: Novel MoE architecture with multi-task learning significantly improves system-level MOS prediction (MSE=0.056, LCC=0.978) but shows limited utterance-level generalization due to rater distribution mismatch.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of automatic speech quality assessment by proposing a novel framework combining self-supervised learning with Mixture of Experts (MoE) classification and multi-task learning. The system uses wav2vec2 backbone with MoE classification head and incorporates data augmentation from multiple commercial TTS models. Results show significant improvements in system-level MOS prediction while highlighting the persistent challenge of utterance-level quality assessment due to rater distribution differences between training and test sets.

## Method Summary
The proposed model uses wav2vec2 as a frozen backbone for SSL feature extraction, followed by a MoE classification head with multiple expert networks and a gating network that computes softmax weights. Multi-task learning combines MOS regression with synthetic model classification as an auxiliary task. Training follows a three-stage progressive protocol: pre-training the auxiliary task, joint pre-training with adaptive weighting, and MOS fine-tuning. Data augmentation includes 400 synthetic samples from four additional commercial TTS models, expanding the dataset to 800 samples across 12 models.

## Key Results
- System-level MOS prediction: MSE reduced to 0.056, LCC improved to 0.978
- Utterance-level MOS prediction: Performance remains limited with MSE >0.27
- MoE architecture effectively improves absolute prediction accuracy for system-level evaluation
- Rater distribution mismatch (train raters 0-9 vs test raters 10-19) identified as key challenge for utterance-level generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Mixture of Experts (MoE) classification head improves system-level MOS prediction by routing heterogeneous audio inputs to specialized expert networks.
- **Mechanism:** A gating network computes softmax weights over N experts based on input features. Each expert learns specialized representations for particular audio characteristics (speech type, quality level, generation technology). Final prediction is a weighted combination: y = Σᵢ gᵢ(x) · Eᵢ(x).
- **Core assumption:** Different speech synthesis systems produce distinguishable acoustic patterns that can be captured by specialized experts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "designing a specialized MoE architecture to address different types of speech quality assessment tasks"
  - [section III.B] "This design enables the model to adaptively select the most appropriate processing path based on the characteristics of different audio signals"
  - [corpus] "Beyond Hard Sharing" paper confirms MoE reduces task interference in multi-task speech modeling (FMR=0.63, weak direct citation linkage)

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Multi-task learning with synthetic model classification as auxiliary task improves MOS prediction through transferable feature representations.
- **Mechanism:** Joint optimization of MOS regression (L_MOS) and model classification (L_classification) with adaptive weighting. Classification task forces learning of synthesis "fingerprint" features that correlate with quality.
- **Core assumption:** Different synthesis technologies leave characteristic artifacts that predict both system identity and quality level.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "utilizing synthetic data from multiple commercial generation models for data augmentation"
  - [section III.C] "learning to recognize these features helps the model gain a deeper understanding of the technical characteristics and quality differences"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific auxiliary task design; related MoE-Health paper shows multi-task benefits in multimodal prediction (FMR=0.53, indirect support)

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Three-stage progressive training with task weight annealing stabilizes multi-task learning and prevents catastrophic forgetting.
- **Mechanism:** Stage 1 (classification pre-training, lr=1e-4) → Stage 2 (joint training, α:β from 0.3:0.7 to 0.7:0.3) → Stage 3 (MOS fine-tuning, α:β=0.9:0.1, lr=1e-5). Cosine annealing + gradient clipping at 1.0.
- **Core assumption:** Basic feature representations should be learned before specialization on the target MOS task.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section III.E] Detailed three-stage protocol with specific hyperparameters
  - [section IV] "MOE effectively enhances system-level prediction scores"
  - [corpus] Omni-Router paper discusses MoE training dynamics in speech (FMR=0.0, no direct evidence for staged training)

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Mixture of Experts (MoE) Gating**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how soft routing decisions determine which expert processes each input is essential for debugging prediction failures.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the gating network uses softmax instead of a hard argmax selection?

- **Concept: Multi-task Learning with Auxiliary Tasks**
  - **Why needed here:** The classification auxiliary task is critical to this architecture; understanding task interference helps diagnose when joint training helps vs. hurts.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might learning to classify TTS models improve MOS prediction, even though MOS scores are never provided for the classification task?

- **Concept: Utterance-level vs. System-level Evaluation**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's central finding is that these granularities have fundamentally different characteristics; system-level aggregates away rater variance while utterance-level exposes it.
  - **Quick check question:** If training raters 0-9 have systematically different scoring ranges than test raters 10-19, which evaluation level would be more affected?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Audio Input → wav2vec2 Backbone (frozen SSL features) → Feature Fusion Module → MoE Classification Head [N experts + gating network] → Multi-task Output Layer [MOS head + Classification head]

- **Critical path:** Gating network weights → expert selection → weighted prediction aggregation. The regularization terms (L_diversity, L_sparsity) prevent expert collapse.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - More experts → finer specialization but higher overfitting risk with limited data
  - Higher auxiliary task weight → better feature learning but potential task interference
  - Smooth L1 loss for MOS → robust to outliers but may underfit extreme scores

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Utterance-level MSE stuck >0.27 despite system-level MSE <0.06: indicates rater distribution shift
  - Correlation metrics (LCC, SRCC) improving less than MSE: model learning absolute accuracy but not relative rankings
  - Expert activation concentrated on 1-2 experts: gating collapsed, diversity regularization insufficient

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline reproduction:** Train with single expert (N=1), no auxiliary task, on original 400 samples. Measure system-level MSE and utterance-level MSE to establish gap.
  2. **Ablation by expert count:** Train with N∈{2, 4, 8} experts, monitoring expert activation distribution. Verify diversity regularization (λ₁) is preventing collapse.
  3. **Rater distribution analysis:** On validation set, compute per-rater mean and variance of MOS scores. If raters 10-19 differ significantly from 0-9, implement rater ID embeddings as suggested in Section IV.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can rater-specific modeling (e.g., rater ID embeddings or bias correction) bridge the generalization gap between training and test raters in utterance-level MOS prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors state "training data was labeled by raters 0–9, while the test set was evaluated by raters 10–19, leading to poor generalization" and suggest "Rater Adaptation: Incorporate rater-specific modeling" as a potential solution.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies rater mismatch as a key failure mode but does not implement or test any rater adaptation techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing baseline utterance-level predictions against models augmented with rater ID embeddings or bias correction layers, evaluated on held-out rater groups.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal auxiliary task for multi-task learning in MOS prediction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses synthetic model classification as the auxiliary task, but does not compare against other auxiliary tasks (e.g., phoneme recognition, prosody prediction) or analyze whether model classification is optimal.
- Why unresolved: No ablation study or comparison of alternative auxiliary tasks is provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled study comparing MOS prediction performance with different auxiliary tasks while keeping architecture and data constant.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can acoustic-prosodic features (pitch, energy, duration) combined with linguistic embeddings substantially improve utterance-level MOS prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors propose "Fine-Grained Feature Extraction: Leverage acoustic-prosodic features and linguistic embeddings to better capture utterance-level nuances" as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current model relies on self-supervised representations (wav2vec2) without explicit acoustic-prosodic or linguistic feature integration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments adding handcrafted acoustic-prosodic features and/or linguistic embeddings to the current framework, with utterance-level MOS prediction benchmarks.

## Limitations

- Limited dataset size (800 samples from 12 TTS models) constrains generalizability and proper validation of utterance-level predictions
- Rater distribution mismatch between training (raters 0-9) and test (raters 10-19) raters creates inherent evaluation challenge
- Specific MoE hyperparameters (number of experts, regularization weights, learning rate schedules) not fully specified

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** System-level MOS prediction improvements (MSE=0.056, LCC=0.978) - well-supported by experimental results and clear performance gap to baselines
- **Medium confidence:** Multi-task learning benefits - supported by architecture but lacks direct corpus evidence for this specific auxiliary task design
- **Medium confidence:** MoE architecture effectiveness - supported by results but expert collapse risk not fully characterized
- **Low confidence:** Utterance-level prediction capabilities - severely limited by rater distribution mismatch and small sample size

## Next Checks

1. **Rater distribution analysis:** Compute per-rater mean and variance statistics on validation set to confirm systematic differences between training (raters 0-9) and test (raters 10-19) raters. Implement rater ID embeddings if significant mismatch exists.

2. **Expert activation diversity validation:** Monitor gating network activation distributions during training to verify that multiple experts are being utilized (not collapsed to 1-2 experts). Test sensitivity to diversity regularization weight (λ₁) tuning.

3. **Synthetic data contribution isolation:** Conduct ablation study removing synthetic data augmentation to quantify its specific contribution to system-level improvements versus potential utterance-level degradation.
