# Planner and Executor: Collaboration between Discrete Diffusion And Autoregressive Models in Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15244
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15244
- Reference count: 13
- Discrete diffusion and autoregressive models collaborating in reasoning tasks show substantial accuracy gains when using latent-space communication

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a planner-executor framework that enables collaboration between autoregressive language models (ARMs) and discrete diffusion language models (DDLMs) for reasoning tasks. The study systematically compares two communication channels: text-space, where the planner emits a textual plan, and latent-space, where a learned projector maps DDLM latents into the ARM's embedding space. The key finding is that shifting from text-space to latent-space communication yields substantial accuracy improvements while dramatically reducing token usage. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning benchmarks while using significantly fewer computational resources than traditional approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a two-stage architecture where a DDLM planner generates intermediate representations that guide an ARM executor in solving reasoning tasks. The system explores two communication paradigms: text-space, where the planner produces explicit textual plans, and latent-space, where the planner's outputs are projected into the ARM's embedding space through a learned mapping function. This projection enables more efficient information transfer by operating in the continuous latent space rather than requiring verbose textual explanations. The planner and executor are trained separately and then fine-tuned together to optimize their collaborative performance. The approach leverages the strengths of both model types - DDLMs' ability to generate diverse, structured representations and ARMs' superior reasoning and generation capabilities.

## Key Results
- Accuracy on DART-5 increases from 27.0% to 54.0% when shifting from text-space to latent-space communication
- AIME24 performance improves from 0.0% to 14.0% using latent-space collaboration
- The latent-space pipeline (64 planning tokens + ~5 execution tokens) outperforms Qwen3.1-7B using 44× fewer tokens
- Latent-space communication primarily benefits the planner component while maintaining efficient execution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The collaboration succeeds because latent-space communication provides a more efficient and semantically rich channel between the planner and executor. Unlike text-space communication, which requires verbose explanations and suffers from information loss during generation, latent-space mapping preserves the full semantic content of the planner's representations. The learned projector effectively translates the discrete diffusion model's structured latent representations into a form that the autoregressive model can directly utilize for reasoning. This eliminates the need for intermediate textual encoding/decoding, reducing token consumption while maintaining or improving accuracy. The approach capitalizes on DDLMs' strength in generating diverse, structured latent representations while leveraging ARMs' superior reasoning capabilities in their native embedding space.

## Foundational Learning

Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DDLMs):
- Why needed: DDLMs excel at generating diverse, structured representations that can capture complex reasoning patterns
- Quick check: Can generate multiple valid solutions for the same problem through stochastic sampling

Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs):
- Why needed: ARMs provide superior reasoning and generation capabilities in their native embedding space
- Quick check: Can perform step-by-step reasoning with strong contextual understanding

Latent Space Communication:
- Why needed: Enables efficient transfer of semantic information without the overhead of textual encoding
- Quick check: Preserves full semantic content while reducing token usage by 44×

Learned Projector:
- Why needed: Bridges the gap between DDLM latent representations and ARM embedding space
- Quick check: Maps structured DDLM outputs into ARM-compatible semantic space

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: DDLM Planner -> Learned Projector -> ARM Executor

Critical Path: The planner generates latent representations → projector maps to ARM space → executor performs reasoning and generates final answer

Design Tradeoffs: Text-space communication provides interpretability but requires more tokens and suffers from information loss; latent-space communication is more efficient but requires learning a projection function and sacrifices some interpretability

Failure Signatures: Poor projector training leads to degraded executor performance; domain mismatch between planner and executor capabilities causes reasoning failures; over-reliance on planner output can make executor brittle to input variations

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline performance with text-space communication on DART-5
2. Train and test learned projector with frozen DDLM and ARM components
3. Compare token efficiency between text-space and latent-space approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study focuses exclusively on planner improvements, with no investigation of executor performance gains from latent-space collaboration
- The evaluation is limited to two reasoning benchmarks (DART-5 and AIME24), restricting generalizability
- No exploration of potential distribution shifts between planning and execution phases

## Confidence
- DART-5 results: High confidence (substantial accuracy gains with clear numerical evidence)
- AIME24 results: Medium confidence (small sample size of 5 problems, 0.0% to 14.0% absolute gain)
- Token efficiency claims: High confidence (clear numerical comparisons provided)

## Next Checks
1. Test the planner-executor framework across at least 5-7 additional reasoning benchmarks to assess generalizability beyond DART-5 and AIME24
2. Evaluate executor performance improvements when trained with latent-space collaboration, not just planner improvements
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the learned projector to quantify its specific contribution versus the baseline text-space collaboration
