## Executive Summary
This study introduces the Moralization Corpus, a novel multi-genre German dataset for analyzing how moral values are strategically used in argumentative discourse. The authors develop a frame-based annotation scheme capturing moral values, demands, and discourse protagonists, and apply it to diverse text genres including political debates, news articles, and online discussions. The dataset enables fine-grained analysis of moralizing language across communicative formats and domains. When evaluating large language models for moralization detection and component extraction, results show that detailed prompt instructions have a greater effect than few-shot or explanation-based prompting. The study finds that moralization remains a highly subjective and context-sensitive task, with no single model or configuration consistently outperforming others across all metrics.

## Method Summary
The study develops a frame-based annotation scheme for moralizing speech acts, decomposing them into three components: moral values (mapped to six Moral Foundations Theory pairs), demands (explicit or implicit prescriptive statements), and discourse protagonists (demander, addressee, beneficiary, maleficiary). German texts from seven genres were retrieved using the DIMI dictionary (3,000 morality-indicating words) and annotated through a multi-stage process distinguishing neutral value-referring instances from actual moralizations. Five LLMs were evaluated across seven prompting configurations varying in detail level and reasoning requirements, using binary classification, component extraction, and demand generation tasks.

## Key Results
- Detailed prompt instructions improve moralization detection more than few-shot or explanation-based prompting
- Models perform well on explicit moral values and demands but struggle with implicit components (BERTScore drops from 82 to 75)
- Human annotation agreement reaches 0.71 Cohen's Kappa, but moralization rates vary significantly (23-24% students vs. 38% experts)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Frame-Based Decomposition Enables Pragmatic Capture
Decomposing moralization into three interrelated layers (moral values, demands, protagonists) may enable systematic analysis that single-label moral classification approaches miss. The frame structure forces attention to the argumentative link between moral vocabulary and prescriptive claims, distinguishing strategic moralization from neutral value-referencing instances (NVIs). Core assumption: Moralization is fundamentally a pragmatic speech act requiring multiple components, not merely lexical presence. Evidence: High agreement (0.71 Kappa) on NVI vs. moralization distinction. Break condition: If annotators cannot reliably distinguish moralizations from NVIs even with explicit criteria.

### Mechanism 2: Detailed Prompt Instructions Align Model Reasoning
Detailed task definitions in prompts appear to improve moralization detection more reliably than few-shot examples or explanation requirements. Structured prompts explicitly define the three-criterion test (moral value + demand + argumentative link), guiding sequential reasoning rather than pattern matching. Core assumption: Models can follow explicit procedural definitions better than they can generalize from examples for this task. Evidence: Detailed prompts yield most consistent gains above basic version. Break condition: When tasks require pragmatic inference beyond surface instruction following.

### Mechanism 3: Expertise Modulates Detection Thresholds
Familiarity with operational definitions systematically broadens moralization detection scope. Training calibrates annotators to a broader conception than everyday moral intuition, reducing under-detection of subtle cases. Core assumption: Expert annotators have internalized an operational definition that extends beyond folk concepts of morality. Evidence: Moralization rates rose with project familiarity: Students labeled 23-24% as moralizations, while Experts averaged 38%. Break condition: If task remains inherently subjective regardless of training.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Moral Foundations Theory (MFT)**
  - Why needed here: The annotation scheme maps moral phrases to six foundation pairs (CARE/HARM, FAIRNESS/CHEATING, LOYALTY/BETRAYAL, AUTHORITY/SUBVERSION, PURITY/DEGRADATION, LIBERTY/OPPRESSION)
  - Quick check question: Which foundation does "We must protect children from harm" primarily invoke?

- Concept: **Pragmatic Speech Acts**
  - Why needed here: Moralizations are defined as persuasive strategies with intent, not merely texts containing moral vocabulary
  - Quick check question: Why is "The study examined child poverty rates" likely an NVI rather than a moralization?

- Concept: **Frame Semantics**
  - Why needed here: The approach structures moralizations as frames with slots (demander, addressee, beneficiary, maleficiary) that may be implicit
  - Quick check question: In "We need stricter laws to prevent violence," who is the implicit beneficiary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - DIMI dictionary (3,000 entries) → 5-sentence snippet retrieval
  - Binary annotation layer → NVI vs. moralization (κ = 0.71)
  - Frame annotation layer → Values + demands + protagonists
  - LLM evaluation layer → 5 models × 7 prompt configurations

- Critical path:
  1. Dictionary retrieval produces candidate passages (many NVIs)
  2. Binary filtering identifies moralizations
  3. Frame components annotated (review + adjudication)
  4. LLM prompting experiments on test set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dictionary breadth: high recall retrieval vs. high NVI filtering burden
  - Prompt detail: ↑precision / ↓recall (detailed) vs. ↑recall / ↓precision (example-enriched)
  - Annotation depth: rich frame structure vs. time-intensive multi-stage annotation

- Failure signatures:
  - High moral-word density triggers false positives (models rely on surface cues)
  - Implicit demands cause false negatives (primary FN source in error analysis)
  - Quotations/historical reporting misclassified as moralization (context insensitivity)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Binary moralization detection across prompt configurations (baseline vs. chain-of-thought vs. manual-instruction)
  2. Component span extraction using SemEval-2013 NER-style evaluation (strict/partial match)
  3. Demand generation quality via BLEU/ROUGE/BERTScore plus manual Likert rating (semantic correctness)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How well does the frame-based annotation scheme transfer to languages other than German, and do cross-linguistic patterns emerge in moralizing speech acts? Future work will extend the annotation framework to English, French, and Italian.
- Can fine-tuned models substantially improve detection and classification of moralizations compared to prompting-based approaches? Since the annotation scheme introduces new task-specific concepts, fine-tuned models might substantially improve detection.
- How does explanation quality in model outputs correlate with prediction accuracy and human interpretability? No systematic analysis has yet been conducted on explanation content, coherence, or validity.
- How does expanding context beyond five-sentence snippets affect moralization detection and frame completeness? Current snippets may not always capture the full discursive context in which moralizations unfold.

## Limitations

- Subjectivity in moralization detection remains high, with human agreement at 0.71 Cohen's Kappa and significant variance between annotator expertise levels
- Models struggle with implicit components, achieving only 75 BERTScore for implicit demands versus 82 for explicit
- Corpus relies on dictionary retrieval, potentially biasing toward texts with explicit moral vocabulary and missing moral arguments without triggering matches

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Frame-based annotation scheme design and its theoretical grounding in moral foundations theory and pragmatics
- **Medium Confidence**: Prompt instruction effects (detailed prompts > few-shot), as results show consistent but not dramatic improvements
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about which models perform best overall, given high variance and no consistent winner across metrics

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce annotation variance: Replicate the student vs. expert annotation comparison using the same operational definitions to quantify how training affects detection rates.

2. Test implicit demand detection: Conduct targeted evaluation on implicit vs. explicit demand instances to confirm the 75 vs. 82 BERTScore gap and identify specific failure patterns.

3. Cross-lingual transfer: Apply the frame-based annotation scheme to English texts to test whether the German-specific operational definitions generalize across languages.
