# VeRecycle: Reclaiming Guarantees from Probabilistic Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems after Change

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.14001
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14001
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: VeRecycle reduces computational costs by up to three orders of magnitude compared to complete re-certification while maintaining competitive probabilistic guarantees.

## Executive Summary
VeRecycle addresses the challenge of maintaining probabilistic reach-avoid guarantees for neural-controlled stochastic dynamical systems when localized changes occur in the environment. The framework enables formal reclamation of these guarantees without requiring complete re-certification of the entire system. By exploiting a theoretical connection between the maximum reclaimable probability threshold and the infimum of the original certificate over the changed state subset, VeRecycle provides sound probability thresholds by analyzing only the affected states rather than re-certifying the entire system. Experimental evaluation on the Stochastic Nine Rooms benchmark demonstrates significant computational savings while maintaining competitive guarantees.

## Method Summary
VeRecycle takes as input a pre-trained neural policy, a neural reach-avoid certificate with threshold ρ, and a changed state subset X?. The method computes a reclaimable threshold ρ̃ = min(ρ, 1 - 1/inf{C(X?)}) using Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) to approximate the infimum of the certificate over the changed region. The state space X? is partitioned into a mesh of cells, and IBP is applied to each cell to bound the certificate values. For compositional control settings, VeRecycle updates graph edge weights as -log(ρ̃_e) and applies a shortest-path algorithm to find the optimal policy that avoids heavily degraded components.

## Key Results
- Reduces computational costs by up to three orders of magnitude compared to complete re-certification
- Maintains competitive probabilistic guarantees after localized changes
- Identifies affected components in compositional control and enables reuse of unaffected policies
- Achieves global thresholds of 0.33 or higher even after changes to multiple rooms in the system

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Infimum-Based Probability Reclamation
The framework establishes that the maximum reclaimable probability threshold is strictly determined by the infimum of the original certificate over the changed state subset. If the original certificate maintains a value of at least 1.0 within the changed region, a valid probability threshold can be reclaimed without knowing the new dynamics. This works because high certificate values in the changed region statistically bound the risk of transitioning to or remaining in that region.

### Mechanism 2: Sound Approximation via Interval Bound Propagation
Since finding the exact infimum for neural networks is difficult, VeRecycle uses Interval Bound Propagation to compute bounds I⁻ and I⁺ such that I⁻ ≤ inf{C(X?)} ≤ I⁺. Theorem 2 proves that substituting I⁻ into the threshold formula yields a sound guarantee. This converts an intractable optimization problem into a fast forward pass operation, enabling efficient computation.

### Mechanism 3: Compositional Policy Re-weighting
In modular control systems, local changes can be isolated to specific graph edges, allowing the global system to adapt by finding a new path rather than re-training controllers. VeRecycle calculates the "cost" of an edge as -log(ρ̃_e) and runs a shortest-path algorithm on these updated weights, automatically identifying the path with the highest cumulative probability of success.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reach-Avoid Certificates (Lyapunov-like functions)**
  - Why needed here: This is the mathematical object being "recycled." You must understand that a certificate C(x) acts like a potential energy function that must decrease over time and remain high near unsafe states to prove safety.
  - Quick check question: If a certificate C(x) does not strictly decrease in a state x, what must be true about C(x) relative to the safety threshold 1/(1-ρ) for the guarantee to hold? (Answer: It must be ≥ the threshold).

- **Concept: Interval Bound Propagation (IBP)**
  - Why needed here: This is the scalability engine of the paper. You need to grasp that IBP allows bounding the output range of a neural network for a given input range efficiently, avoiding exhaustive search.
  - Quick check question: Why is IBP used here instead of formal optimization solvers like SMT? (Answer: Speed/Scalability—Section 6 notes a 3-order-of-magnitude speedup).

- **Concept: Stochastic Dynamical Systems**
  - Why needed here: The guarantees are probabilistic (ρ) because the environment is noisy (w_t ~ μ). Understanding that the certificate constrains the expectation of the system's evolution is key.
  - Quick check question: Does VeRecycle require the new dynamics in the changed region to be stochastic? (Answer: No, Section 3/4 assumes "unknown" dynamics, which includes deterministic or absorbing worst-case scenarios).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Interface -> Mesh Generator -> IBP Engine -> Threshold Calculator -> Compositional Planner (Optional)
- **Critical path:** The accuracy of the IBP Engine on the generated Mesh. If the mesh is too coarse, I⁻ is too low, and the reclaimed threshold ρ̃ becomes uselessly conservative. If the mesh is too fine, computational cost rises.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Precision vs. Speed: A finer mesh for X? yields tighter bounds (higher ρ̃) but requires more IBP passes.
  - Optimism vs. Soundness: The paper prioritizes soundness; the reclaimed threshold ρ̃ is a guaranteed lower bound.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Output ρ̃ = 0: Indicates inf{C(X?)} is likely < 1 or very close to 1. The change has invalidated the certificate for that region.
  - High variance in Compositional Path: If different random seeds produce vastly different paths, the certificate quality may be "loose" (low precision), causing small threshold changes to flip edge preferences.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Unit Test IBP Bounds: Take a known quadratic function (e.g., x²) and verify that the IBP implementation correctly bounds the infimum over a test region.
  2. Static Region Reclamation: Implement the core VeRecycle logic on a pre-trained certificate for a simple 2D point robot. Introduce a small obstacle region X? and confirm the reclaimed threshold drops but remains non-zero.
  3. Nine-Rooms Replication: Set up the grid-world environment from Section 6. Train policies via PPO, generate certificates, and then apply Algorithm 1 to measure the speedup vs. full re-certification (Baseline B-III).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the theoretical foundations of VeRecycle be extended to support probabilistic neural certificates for continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems? The current formulation relies on discrete-time definitions and a decrease condition defined over single time steps, which do not directly translate to continuous dynamics without modifying the underlying supermartingale certificate theory.

### Open Question 2
How can the neural certificate learning process be optimized to specifically maximize the probability thresholds that VeRecycle can reclaim after a change? Current learning objectives minimize violations to satisfy a fixed threshold ρ, often resulting in "loose" certificates that do not maximize the infimum of the certificate over potential change regions X?, thereby lowering the reclaimable threshold ρ̃.

### Open Question 3
Can VeRecycle be integrated with learning-enabled certification to actively pinpoint which states within X? require new dynamics to be learned to restore guarantees? VeRecycle currently treats the changed dynamics in X? as unknown to provide general thresholds; it does not currently isolate specific states where learning the actual dynamics would improve the threshold above ρ̃.

### Open Question 4
Can the computational efficiency of compositional control be improved by using a shortest-path solver that invokes VeRecycle on-demand rather than pre-calculating it for all graph edges? Algorithm 1 calculates reclaimed thresholds for every edge regardless of whether the edge is part of the optimal path, potentially wasting computational resources on irrelevant sub-tasks.

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of VeRecycle is fundamentally limited by the quality of the original certificate; it cannot improve certificate precision, only recycle existing guarantees.
- The theoretical framework assumes a single, localized change; overlapping or interacting changes that could create complex global effects are not addressed.
- There is no adaptive mesh refinement strategy discussed, potentially limiting practical applicability for high-dimensional state spaces.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core theoretical result (Theorem 1) linking reclaimable probability to the infimum of the certificate over the changed region is sound and well-supported.
- **Medium Confidence:** The experimental results demonstrating the three-orders-of-magnitude speedup are specific to the Stochastic Nine Rooms benchmark and may not generalize to all dynamical systems.
- **Medium Confidence:** The compositional control approach assumes the task graph structure and that alternative paths exist with acceptable probability thresholds.

## Next Checks
1. **Certificate Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary the looseness of the original certificate and measure how this affects the reclaimed threshold ρ̃ across different mesh granularities to quantify the dependency on certificate quality.
2. **Multi-Change Stress Test:** Extend the Stochastic Nine Rooms benchmark to introduce simultaneous changes in multiple rooms and evaluate whether the compositional path planning strategy maintains acceptable global thresholds or if cascading effects emerge.
3. **Cross-Architecture Generalization:** Implement VeRecycle with different certificate architectures (e.g., smaller networks, different activation functions) and training regimes to assess robustness beyond the specific learner-verifier framework used in the paper.
