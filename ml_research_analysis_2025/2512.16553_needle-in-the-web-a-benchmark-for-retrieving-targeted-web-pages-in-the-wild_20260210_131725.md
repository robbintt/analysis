# Needle in the Web: A Benchmark for Retrieving Targeted Web Pages in the Wild

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.16553
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16553
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems evaluated on 663 queries achieved below 35% accuracy, revealing a significant gap in current retrieval capabilities for real-world exploratory search.

## Executive Summary
Needle in the Web introduces a benchmark targeting Fuzzy Exploratory Search, where queries are ambiguous and multifaceted rather than structured factoid questions. The benchmark consists of 663 queries across seven domains, generated from real web articles by extracting factual claims, masking central elements to create vague criteria, and selecting claims of varying difficulty to control semantic relevance. Automated validation ensures each query maps uniquely to a single correct webpage. Three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems were evaluated, with most achieving below 35% accuracy and no single agent dominating across domains or difficulty levels. Open-source agents struggled with web content retrieval and search tool interaction, while closed-source models were more efficient but still fell short. The results reveal a significant gap between current retrieval capabilities and the requirements of real-world exploratory search, highlighting the need for uncertainty-aware, semantically robust agents.

## Method Summary
The benchmark uses a pipeline to generate 663 queries from 7 domains (ArXiv, OLH, Wikipedia, CNN, Petapixel, Pitchfork, Lonelyplanet). Real web articles are scraped, factual claims are extracted via LLM, and claims are ranked by semantic similarity to the article using text embeddings. Three claims are selected per difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) based on their relevance ranking. Central entities in claims are masked with generic placeholders (e.g., "someone," "something"). Automated validation ensures each query uniquely identifies a single target webpage. Evaluation uses an LLM-as-a-judge to verify if retrieved webpages semantically entail the query criteria.

## Key Results
- All evaluated agents (3 LLMs, 3 search agents) achieved below 35% accuracy on the benchmark.
- No single agent dominated across all domains or difficulty levels.
- Open-source agents struggled with web scraping and search tool interaction, while closed-source models were more efficient but still underperformed.
- Performance degraded significantly on "Hard" queries requiring semantic reasoning over tangential content.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The benchmark creates a unique target by intersecting multiple vague constraints.
- **Mechanism:** Individual masked criteria are broad but their conjunction narrows the search to a single unique webpage, mimicking human memory's intersection property.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes that while individual facts may be common, the specific combination of three distinct facts within a single document is unique on the open web.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 3.1] states that satisfying all constraints simultaneously is typically extremely small—even unique. [Abstract] confirms automated validation ensures unique mapping.
- **Break condition:** If the web corpus has significant duplicate content or criteria are too generic, the intersection may yield multiple valid targets.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Difficulty is controlled by the semantic distance between query criteria and the document's main topic.
- **Mechanism:** Claims are ranked by embedding similarity to the article. "Easy" queries use central claims (high similarity), while "Hard" queries use tangential claims (low similarity).
- **Core assumption:** Assumes retrieval is inherently harder when query content is semantically distant from the document's primary subject vector.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 3.2] specifies using top three most relevant claims for easy and bottom three for hard. [Figure 4] illustrates the difficulty control pipeline.
- **Break condition:** If the embedding model fails to capture "aboutness" accurately, or if a tangential claim appears prominently in a summary, the difficulty stratification fails.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Entity masking forces semantic reasoning over keyword matching.
- **Mechanism:** Replacing specific entities with generic placeholders prevents agents from solving via simple keyword search, requiring understanding of predicate and context.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes agents cannot easily "unmask" entities via simple inference or that the masked description itself is specific enough to filter results.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section 3.1] describes the masking function replacing entity-specific content with placeholders. [Section 4.3] notes agents often misunderstand semantic matching.
- **Break condition:** If remaining context words in the masked claim are unique enough to serve as effective keywords, the masking mechanism is circumvented.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Textual Entailment**
  - **Why needed here:** The evaluation relies on an LLM judge determining if a document "mentions" a criterion, defined as textual entailment.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why "Bob bought a red car" entails "Bob bought a vehicle" but not "Bob bought a Ford"?

- **Concept: Semantic Search vs. Keyword Search**
  - **Why needed here:** The benchmark explicitly breaks keyword search strategies via masking. Understanding vector space models and semantic similarity is required to interpret why "Hard" queries are harder.
  - **Quick check question:** If a user searches for "fruit," why might a semantic search engine return "apple" while a keyword engine fails unless "fruit" is explicitly in the text?

- **Concept: Exploratory Search Paradigm**
  - **Why needed here:** This benchmark distinguishes "Fuzzy Exploratory Search" (vague, multi-faceted, seeking a source) from "Complex Reasoning Search" (factoid, multi-hop).
  - **Quick check question:** In a search for "papers about neural networks," how does the user intent differ from a search for "Who wrote the paper 'Attention Is All You Need'"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Scraper -> Claim Extractor -> Ranker -> Masker -> Validator
- **Critical path:** The **Validation** step is the bottleneck. If masking distorts meaning, the query becomes unsolvable or ambiguous.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Single-Page Constraint:** Requires answer to be a single webpage to avoid cross-source hallucination, trading realism for evaluability.
  - **3-Claim Structure:** Uses exactly 3 claims to balance fuzziness with specificity; fewer claims make query too broad, more make it too brittle.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - False positives in evaluation due to LLM judge hallucination
  - Web scraping errors leading to empty responses
  - Keyword misinterpretation treating masked terms as literal search terms
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run benchmark on closed-source vs. open-source agent using static cached webpages to isolate retrieval capability from web scraping capability
  2. Sample 50 queries and manually check if Google/Bing retrieves target URL in top 10 results using exact masked query string
  3. Ablation study varying number of claims (1, 3, 5) to test accuracy degradation and context window limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can agent architectures be modified to autonomously resolve "insufficient context" issues by determining when to explore further versus when to stop searching in fuzzy retrieval tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Discussion states current agents lack "the ability to explore more information when the context is insufficient."
- **Why unresolved:** Current agents cannot reliably judge information sufficiency for vague, multi-faceted queries.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An agent architecture demonstrating statistically significant accuracy increase on "Medium" and "Hard" query sets by successfully navigating context gaps without manual intervention.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent do "toolchain limitations" (e.g., web scraping errors, incomplete page rendering) account for the performance gap between open-source and closed-source agents on this benchmark?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 states "some performance disparities stem from toolchain limitations... rather than reasoning ability."
- **Why unresolved:** Current evaluations conflate reasoning failure with tool failure.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study where all agents use a standardized, high-reliability browsing tool to isolate performance differences caused purely by the model's reasoning capabilities.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can benchmark validity be maintained as the static web corpus becomes outdated relative to the live web?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 notes the benchmark relies on a fixed corpus capturing the web's state at a particular time.
- **Why unresolved:** As the web changes, ground truth URLs may disappear or content may shift.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A dynamic updating mechanism or longitudinal study showing correlation between benchmark performance on static queries versus success on dynamically refreshed query sets over time.

## Limitations
- The single-page constraint creates an artificial boundary that doesn't reflect real-world exploratory search where users often synthesize information across multiple sources.
- The masking mechanism may sometimes produce overly broad or ambiguous criteria that could lead to false negatives in evaluation.
- Automated LLM-based validation introduces potential brittleness - semantic entailment judgments may not perfectly align with human judgment, particularly for nuanced or context-dependent claims.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Benchmark design and generation methodology are well-documented and reproducible. The observation that all evaluated agents performed below 35% accuracy is robust.
- **Medium Confidence:** Difficulty stratification based on embedding similarity is methodologically sound but assumes the embedding model captures semantic relevance accurately.
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that the intersection property uniquely identifies webpages relies on assumptions about web corpus uniqueness that weren't empirically validated across the entire internet.

## Next Checks
1. Run the same 50 sampled queries through multiple LLM judges (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, Gemini-1.5) to measure inter-annotator agreement and identify systematic biases in the evaluation process.
2. Recruit 5 human subjects to solve 100 random queries and compare their accuracy and time-on-task against the top-performing AI agents to establish a performance ceiling.
3. Re-run the benchmark after 3 months to measure query stability as web content changes, particularly for "Hard" queries that rely on less central content that may be more volatile.
