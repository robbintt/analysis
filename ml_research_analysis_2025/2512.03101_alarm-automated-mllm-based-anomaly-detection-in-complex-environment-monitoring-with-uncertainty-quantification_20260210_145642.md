# ALARM: Automated MLLM-Based Anomaly Detection in Complex-EnviRonment Monitoring with Uncertainty Quantification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03101
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03101
- Authors: Congjing Zhang; Feng Lin; Xinyi Zhao; Pei Guo; Wei Li; Lin Chen; Chaoyue Zhao; Shuai Huang
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: ALARM achieves up to 91.72% accuracy in wound classification and 84.34% in smart-home VAD with uncertainty-guided selective classification

## Executive Summary
ALARM introduces a UQ-enabled MLLM framework for video anomaly detection in complex environments like smart homes and healthcare. The framework integrates uncertainty quantification across three stages—data comprehension, analytical thinking, and reflection—using multiple MLLMs to generate and refine hypotheses. By optimally combining stage-wise uncertainty scores, ALARM enables selective classification that defers uncertain cases to human experts. Experiments on smart-home and wound classification datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over non-UQ methods, with UQ scores effectively identifying ambiguous or misclassified cases.

## Method Summary
ALARM employs a three-stage MLLM pipeline with uncertainty quantification for anomaly detection in complex environments. The framework processes visual data through sequential MLLM reasoning stages: initial data comprehension, hypothesis generation and analysis, and reflective refinement. Each stage generates uncertainty estimates that are combined to guide selective classification decisions. When uncertainty exceeds predefined thresholds, cases are deferred to human experts rather than producing automated classifications. The system is evaluated on smart-home video anomaly detection and wound classification tasks, demonstrating improved accuracy and reliability through uncertainty-aware decision-making.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 91.72% accuracy in wound classification and 84.34% in smart-home VAD
- UQ scores improve recall and accuracy by 2.72–9.65% over non-UQ methods
- Optimal weight smoothing and MLLM ensemble size (M≥3) enhance robustness
- Effective identification of ambiguous or misclassified cases through uncertainty quantification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ALARM's effectiveness stems from integrating uncertainty quantification throughout the MLLM reasoning pipeline. By capturing uncertainty at each stage of the analytical process, the framework can identify when automated decisions are unreliable and defer to human expertise. The three-stage architecture allows progressive refinement of hypotheses while maintaining uncertainty awareness, preventing overconfident errors in complex scenarios where anomalies may be subtle or ambiguous.

## Foundational Learning
**Uncertainty quantification (UQ)**: Measurement of confidence in model predictions
- Why needed: Critical for safety-critical applications where wrong decisions have high consequences
- Quick check: Compare UQ scores against actual error rates to verify calibration

**Multi-stage reasoning**: Sequential processing through comprehension, analysis, and reflection
- Why needed: Complex anomalies require progressive refinement rather than single-pass classification
- Quick check: Validate that each stage adds distinct value to final predictions

**Selective classification**: Deferring uncertain cases to human experts
- Why needed: Balances automation efficiency with accuracy in high-stakes domains
- Quick check: Measure trade-off between deferral rate and overall system performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data -> Comprehension MLLM -> Analysis MLLM -> Reflection MLLM -> Uncertainty Aggregation -> Classification/Deferral

**Critical path**: Visual data ingestion → Multi-stage MLLM processing → Stage-wise uncertainty estimation → Weighted uncertainty combination → Selective classification decision

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational cost (multiple MLLM calls) for improved reliability through uncertainty-aware deferral. API dependency and latency are balanced against the safety benefits of human oversight for uncertain cases.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance when MLLMs consistently misclassify certain anomaly types, uncertainty estimates become miscalibrated, or the weight smoothing parameters are suboptimal for the specific dataset characteristics.

**First experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison without UQ on smart-home VAD dataset, 2) Ablation study removing reflection stage, 3) Sensitivity analysis of uncertainty threshold parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation limited to two specific domains (smart-home VAD and wound classification)
- Heavy dependency on MLLM API availability, cost, and latency
- Uncertainty estimates not independently verified for proper probabilistic calibration
- Optimal weight parameters appear tuned to evaluation datasets, raising generalizability concerns

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Technical soundness of three-stage MLLM architecture and uncertainty integration, rigorous experimental methodology within tested domains
**Medium confidence**: Claims about framework generality across domains and data types, performance improvements over baselines
**Low confidence**: Assertions about applicability to non-visual data and robustness to different MLLM providers

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain validation: Test ALARM on industrial equipment monitoring and security surveillance using same configuration
2. MLLM independence test: Implement using multiple MLLM providers (GPT-4V, Claude) to assess performance variance
3. Uncertainty calibration verification: Conduct reliability diagrams and expected calibration error analysis on UQ scores across all stages
