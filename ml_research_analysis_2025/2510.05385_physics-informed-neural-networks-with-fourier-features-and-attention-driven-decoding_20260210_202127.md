# Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Fourier Features and Attention-Driven Decoding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05385
- Reference count: 26
- This paper presents the Spectral PINNsformer (S-Pformer), a streamlined transformer-based architecture for physics-informed neural networks that addresses spectral bias and parameter redundancy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Spectral PINNsformer (S-Pformer), a decoder-only transformer architecture for physics-informed neural networks that eliminates spectral bias through Fourier feature embeddings while reducing parameter count by 18.6% compared to the original PINNsformer. The authors demonstrate that the encoder layer can be removed when relying solely on self-attention for capturing spatiotemporal correlations, resulting in a more efficient architecture. The S-Pformer outperforms encoder-decoder PINNsformers on all benchmark PDEs (Convection, 1D-Reaction, 1D-Wave, and 2D Navier-Stokes) while using significantly fewer parameters. The Fourier feature embeddings explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling better capture of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain.

## Method Summary
The S-Pformer replaces the encoder-decoder structure of traditional PINNsformers with a decoder-only architecture that uses Fourier feature embeddings to handle spatiotemporal inputs. The model processes spatiotemporal coordinates through input normalization to [0,1], followed by Fourier embedding using random projection matrices sampled from N(0,I), then passes through a decoder with multi-head self-attention and 3-layer feed-forward networks. A wavelet activation function (ω₁sin(z)+ω₂cos(z)) is employed, and NTK-based dynamic loss weighting recomputes every 50 L-BFGS iterations. The architecture uses a pseudo-sequence generator to create temporal sequences from single points, enabling the transformer to capture temporal dependencies despite being decoder-only.

## Key Results
- 18.6% parameter reduction compared to original PINNsformer while achieving superior performance
- Outperforms encoder-decoder PINNsformers on convection, 1D-reaction, 1D-wave, and 2D Navier-Stokes problems
- 30% error reduction in high-frequency regimes compared to decoder-only PINNsformer without Fourier features
- Achieves or outperforms MLP performance when optimized, using significantly fewer parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The S-Pformer addresses spectral bias by explicitly incorporating Fourier feature embeddings that project inputs into a higher-dimensional space where both low and high-frequency components are represented more equally. This projection mitigates the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency functions first and struggle with high-frequency components. The decoder-only architecture with self-attention efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations without the parameter overhead of an encoder layer, while the pseudo-sequence generator enables temporal dependency learning despite the absence of recurrent structures.

## Foundational Learning
**Fourier Feature Embeddings**: Random projections into Fourier space to combat spectral bias
- Why needed: Neural networks naturally struggle with high-frequency components due to spectral bias
- Quick check: Verify that projection matrix B is correctly sampled from N(0,I) and applied before sin/cos

**Self-Attention Mechanisms**: Multi-head attention for spatiotemporal correlation capture
- Why needed: Enables efficient modeling of long-range dependencies without recurrent structures
- Quick check: Ensure attention receives properly shaped sequential input (batch, seq_len, demb)

**NTK-Based Loss Weighting**: Dynamic weighting using neural tangent kernel traces
- Why needed: Balances multiple loss components (residual, boundary, initial conditions) during training
- Quick check: Verify NTK traces computed correctly via Jacobians and weights update every 50 iterations

**Wavelet Activation Functions**: ω₁sin(z)+ω₂cos(z) for improved feature representation
- Why needed: Provides better frequency separation than standard activations
- Quick check: Confirm both sine and cosine components are properly weighted and combined

**Pseudo-Sequence Generation**: Temporal sequences from single points for decoder-only processing
- Why needed: Enables temporal dependency capture without recurrent layers
- Quick check: Verify that pseudo-sequences hold spatial coordinates constant while varying temporal dimension

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Normalization → Fourier Embedding → Positional Embedding → Decoder (Attention + FFN) → Output MLP

**Critical Path**: Fourier feature projection → self-attention layers → frequency-aware output generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The decoder-only approach reduces parameters but requires careful sequence generation; Fourier features combat spectral bias but add computational overhead

**Failure Signatures**: Spectral bias on high-frequency problems indicates incorrect Fourier projection; training divergence suggests NTK weighting issues; poor temporal capture indicates pseudo-sequence problems

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test Fourier feature effectiveness by comparing high-frequency error profiles (f > 0.7fₙ) between S-Pformer and DO-Pformer
2. Verify parameter count reduction by direct comparison with PINNsformer architecture
3. Validate pseudo-sequence generator by varying sequence parameters and measuring temporal dependency capture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: Can adaptive frequency selection mechanisms improve the S-Pformer's ability to capture multiscale behaviors?
- Basis: Authors explicitly state future work should investigate adaptive frequency selection mechanisms
- Why unresolved: Current architecture uses static random projection matrix rather than learning optimal frequencies adaptively
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study showing modified S-Pformer with learnable frequency bands outperforming static random projection baseline

**Open Question 2**: How can transformer and MLP architectures be effectively combined to handle both physics-based and data-driven loss components?
- Basis: Authors note marginal underperformance compared to MLPs on data-driven components
- Why unresolved: S-Pformer excels at automatic-differentiation-based losses but less effective than MLPs for data-driven aspects
- What evidence would resolve it: Hybrid architecture achieving lower error rates than pure MLPs on Navier-Stokes while maintaining S-Pformer efficiency

**Open Question 3**: What is the performance sensitivity of the S-Pformer regarding the number of attention heads?
- Basis: Authors state future work should explore sensitivity to attention head count
- Why unresolved: Current setup assumes nheads=2 provides good tradeoff without rigorous ablation study
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation varying attention heads and reporting parameter counts, training times, and rMAE errors

## Limitations
- Pseudo-sequence generation approach may have limited generalizability beyond tested PDEs
- Absence of encoder layers fundamentally changes model's ability to capture spatial correlations
- L-BFGS optimizer choice may not reflect practical deployment scenarios with stochastic optimization

## Confidence
High confidence in core architectural claims (Fourier embeddings, decoder-only design, parameter reduction)
Medium confidence in performance claims (depends on resolving unspecified hyperparameters for exact reproduction)
Low confidence in generalizability claims (limited to specific PDE benchmarks)

## Next Checks
1. Verify Fourier feature effectiveness by comparing high-frequency error profiles (f > 0.7fₙ) between S-Pformer and DO-Pformer across all test PDEs
2. Replicate parameter count calculation to confirm 18.6% reduction compared to encoder-decoder PINNsformer
3. Test pseudo-sequence generator's robustness by varying k and Δt parameters to determine impact on temporal dependency capture
