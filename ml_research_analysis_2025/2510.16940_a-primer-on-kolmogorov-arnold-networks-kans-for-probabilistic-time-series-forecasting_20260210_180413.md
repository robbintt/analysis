# A Primer on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16940
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16940
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: P-KANs achieve superior probabilistic forecasting on satellite traffic data using fewer parameters than MLP baselines.

## Executive Summary
Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (P-KANs) introduce a novel architecture for uncertainty-aware time series forecasting by replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions. This approach delivers expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics in satellite traffic data. The framework demonstrates consistent improvements over MLP baselines in accuracy, calibration, and efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters.

## Method Summary
P-KANs employ B-spline parameterized edges (φ(x) = w_b·b(x) + s·Σ c_r·B_k,r(x)) in place of fixed scalar weights, enabling flexible univariate function composition. Distribution parameters (μ, σ, and optionally ν) are predicted through dedicated KAN layers rather than linear heads, improving calibration. The model supports both Gaussian and Student-t likelihoods, with the latter providing heavier tails through learned degrees of freedom. Training uses maximum likelihood estimation with negative log-likelihood loss, while inference generates quantiles for dynamic thresholding applications in resource allocation.

## Key Results
- P-KANs consistently outperform P-MLP baselines across MSE, CRPS, and calibration metrics on satellite traffic data
- Gaussian variant provides conservative, well-calibrated forecasts suitable for safety-critical scenarios
- Student-t variant achieves sharper predictions and higher efficiency under stable demand conditions
- Parameter efficiency: P-KANs achieve superior performance with significantly fewer parameters than MLP counterparts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spline-Based Functional Connections
Each edge computes φ(x) = w_b·b(x) + s·Σ c_r·B_k,r(x), where B_k,r are B-spline basis functions. This replaces fixed linear scaling with flexible univariate function composition, enabling greater expressiveness per parameter.

### Mechanism 2: Direct Distribution Parameterization via KAN Heads
P-KAN predicts distribution parameters through dedicated KAN layers (μ_t = f_KAN^μ(z_t), σ_t = softplus(f_KAN^σ(z_t))) rather than linear readouts, providing flexibility to model complex parameter dependencies.

### Mechanism 3: Likelihood Choice Controls Robustness–Efficiency Trade-off
Gaussian likelihood yields conservative calibration with lighter tails, while Student-t adds learned degrees-of-freedom ν_t for heavier tails, enabling adaptive robustness versus efficiency optimization.

## Foundational Learning

### Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem
Why needed: Provides theoretical basis for replacing fixed-weight layers with compositions of learnable univariate functions.
Quick check: Can you explain why univariate function composition might be more parameter-efficient than a single dense matrix for certain mappings?

### Probabilistic Forecasting via Maximum Likelihood
Why needed: Training minimizes negative log-likelihood; understanding NLL is essential for grasping calibration vs sharpness trade-offs.
Quick check: Why does minimizing NLL encourage both accurate means and appropriate uncertainty?

### B-Splines as Basis Function Expansions
Why needed: Functional edges use B-spline bases; knowing how splines provide local plasticity helps interpret KAN behavior.
Quick check: What is the effect of increasing the number of spline knots on flexibility and overfitting risk?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Input (context window) → KAN encoder layers → Hidden representation z_t → KAN distribution heads → Predictive distribution parameters

### Critical path
1. Implement spline-based φ(x) with configurable order k and basis count R
2. Build KAN encoder layer(s) and KAN-based output heads
3. Instantiate Gaussian and Student-t likelihoods with softplus-constrained parameters
4. Train with Adam, lr=1e-3, monitor NLL, CRPS, and coverage metrics

### Design tradeoffs
- Gaussian vs Student-t: Conservative calibration vs sharper efficiency
- Spline order and basis count: More bases → higher expressiveness but more parameters and potential overfit
- Single vs multi-layer KAN: Deeper may capture richer structure but complicates training stability

### Failure signatures
- Persistent overconfidence: Coverage significantly below nominal suggests under-estimated σ
- Underfitting: High MSE/MAE with flat splines indicates insufficient basis capacity
- Training instability: Exploding/vanishing gradients if spline coefficients poorly initialized

### First 3 experiments
1. Replicate P-KAN (Gaussian) on single beam with c=168, h=24; report MSE, CRPS, FIC vs P-MLP baseline
2. Ablate output heads: Compare KAN heads vs linear heads on same encoder; isolate calibration impact
3. Sweep likelihood: Train P-KAN with Gaussian and Student-t; plot PRB savings vs underprovisioning to validate trade-off

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Do P-KANs generalize to LEO satellite systems with higher mobility and distinct traffic dynamics?
The paper expects generalization but only validates on GEO satellite broadband traffic, which involves different propagation delays and handover frequencies than LEO constellations.

### Open Question 2
Can P-KANs achieve better calibration for sparse or discrete resource allocation by utilizing non-Gaussian likelihoods?
While the framework accommodates any parametric distribution, validation is restricted to continuous Gaussian and Student-t distributions, potentially misrepresenting uncertainty in low-traffic regimes.

### Open Question 3
How does P-KAN's accuracy and efficiency trade-off compare against state-of-the-art Transformers?
The paper only benchmarks against Probabilistic MLPs despite acknowledging Transformers achieve strong performance but are parameter-heavy, leaving the accuracy gap relative to parameter savings unexplored.

## Limitations
- Empirical evaluation limited to single satellite traffic dataset with fixed context/horizon parameters
- Implementation details including B-spline grid configuration and initialization schemes remain unspecified
- Theoretical assumption of univariate function decomposition may not hold for all time series patterns with strong multivariate dependencies

## Confidence

- Spline-based functional connections providing parameter efficiency: Medium confidence
- Direct distribution parameterization improving calibration: Low-Medium confidence  
- Likelihood choice controlling robustness-efficiency trade-off: Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1. Cross-domain validation: Apply P-KAN to at least two additional time series datasets (energy demand, financial data) with varying volatility profiles to test generalization.

2. Head architecture ablation: Systematically compare KAN-based distribution heads against linear heads and against KAN encoder + linear heads on the same architecture to isolate calibration benefits.

3. B-spline sensitivity analysis: Conduct systematic sweep of B-spline parameters (order, knot count, grid range) to quantify impact on performance and parameter efficiency.
