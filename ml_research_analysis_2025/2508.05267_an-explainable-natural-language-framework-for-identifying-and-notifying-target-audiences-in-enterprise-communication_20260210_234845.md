# An Explainable Natural Language Framework for Identifying and Notifying Target Audiences In Enterprise Communication

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.05267
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05267
- Reference count: 5
- The paper presents a framework for identifying and notifying target audiences in enterprise communication, addressing the challenge of efficiently reaching subject matter experts in large-scale maintenance organizations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework that addresses the challenge of efficiently identifying and notifying target audiences in large-scale enterprise maintenance organizations. The system combines RDF graph databases with large language models (LLMs) to process natural language queries for precise audience targeting while providing transparent reasoning through a planning-orchestration architecture. The framework includes a Named Entity Recognition (NER) workflow for identifying key terms and aligning them with existing entities, and a Formal Query Formulation (FQF) workflow for establishing relationships among these entities.

## Method Summary
The framework processes natural language queries through a planning-orchestration architecture that coordinates two specialized LLM workflows. The NER workflow extracts key terms using constrained search space and consistent markers, matches them to Knowledge Base entities via full-text search, then passes entity-augmented input to the FQF workflow which generates Boolean expressions with Chain-of-Thought reasoning. The system translates natural language queries into formal expressions executable against an RDF knowledge base, with explainability features that enable users to validate the system's reasoning process and ensure accurate audience targeting.

## Key Results
- The framework demonstrates the ability to translate natural language queries into formal expressions that can be executed against the knowledge base
- Explainability features enable users to validate the system's reasoning process and ensure accurate audience targeting
- The system shows potential for precise audience retrieval through combining RDF graph databases with LLM capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual LLM Workflow Separation (NER + FQF)
Separating entity recognition from query formulation improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations in natural language to query translation. The NER workflow extracts key terms using constrained search space and consistent markers, matches them to Knowledge Base entities via full-text search, then passes entity-augmented input to the FQF workflow which generates Boolean expressions with Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Decomposing NL-to-query into sequential stages allows independent optimization and reduces compound errors.

### Mechanism 2: Planning-Orchestration Architecture
A centralized orchestration layer enables transparent reasoning by coordinating workflow execution and aggregating intermediate outputs. The orchestrator evaluates user query intent, establishes an execution plan, coordinates NER and FQF agents, and combines step descriptions with outputs to generate explanations. Users require visibility into system reasoning to validate results in high-stakes enterprise communications.

### Mechanism 3: Explainability via Multi-Step Reasoning Aggregation
Combining execution plan steps, descriptions, and intermediate outputs produces structured explanations enabling user validation of entity mapping and query logic. The system records each workflow step's description and output; explainer component aggregates these into structured breakdowns showing entity interpretation, KB mapping, and logical relationship construction. Users can effectively validate AI reasoning when presented with structured step-by-step breakdowns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: RDF Graph Databases and SPARQL**
  - Why needed here: The framework queries Amazon Neptune (RDF store) using SPARQL; understanding triples, ontologies, and graph patterns is essential for debugging query formulation and ontology design.
  - Quick check question: Can you write a SPARQL query that retrieves all entities of class `JobTitle` located in a specific `Region`?

- **Concept: Named Entity Recognition with LLM Prompting**
  - Why needed here: The NER workflow uses prompt-based extraction with few-shot examples and tag markers; understanding prompt engineering and hallucination risks is critical for tuning.
  - Quick check question: Given "technicians working with Vendor X in LATAM," which terms should be tagged as entities vs. ignored as structural language?

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
  - Why needed here: The FQF workflow uses CoT-inspired reasoning breakdown to improve Boolean formulation accuracy; understanding CoT helps optimize prompt design for structured outputs.
  - Quick check question: How would you structure a prompt that requires an LLM to explain reasoning steps before outputting a Boolean expression?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Customer UI (query input, visualization, explanation display) -> AI Engines (Amazon Bedrock: Nova Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) -> Framework Core (Planning-Orchestration Layer -> NER Workflow -> FQF Workflow) -> Knowledge Base (Amazon Neptune RDF + Amazon OpenSearch full-text index)

- **Critical path**: User submits NL query -> Orchestrator creates execution plan -> NER extracts/matches entities via OpenSearch -> FQF generates Boolean expression with CoT -> Convert to SPARQL (execution) and jVQL (visualization) -> Return results with step-by-step explanation

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Single model (Nova Pro) for both workflows vs. specialized models: optimizes for consistency, may sacrifice task-specific performance
  - Regex parsing of marked terms vs. structured JSON: simpler parsing, less robust to format variations
  - Full-text search for entity matching vs. semantic embeddings: faster, may miss semantically similar but lexically different entities
  - Assumption: Tradeoffs prioritize reliability and explainability over maximum accuracy

- **Failure signatures**:
  - NER hallucination: Model generates entities not in KB (check if constrained search space is enforced)
  - Entity mismatch: Top-ranked entity doesn't match user intent (validate via explanation UI)
  - Boolean logic errors: FQF misinterprets AND/OR relationships (compare CoT reasoning against ground truth)
  - Orchestration failure: Unparseable query intent or circular workflow dependencies (check execution plan logs)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Entity matching accuracy test**: Feed 50 sample queries with known ground-truth entities through NER; measure precision/recall; analyze mismatch patterns (ambiguous terms, ontology gaps)
  2. **Boolean formulation validation**: Manually verify FQF outputs for 30 queries; run ablation with/without CoT to quantify reasoning breakdown contribution
  3. **End-to-end latency profiling**: Measure time per stage (NER, FQF, KB query, explanation generation); identify bottlenecks (likely LLM inference); establish optimization baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the framework effectively generalize to other enterprise domains with distinct ontological structures without extensive manual reconfiguration?
- Basis in paper: The Conclusion explicitly suggests future work should "extend this approach to other domains."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation is specialized for RME using a "purpose-built maintenance ontology" and domain-specific few-shot examples.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking results (e.g., precision/recall) from deploying the NER and FQF workflows in a disparate domain, such as HR or Legal, using their specific ontologies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Which specific explainability techniques could further enhance user validation beyond the current multi-step reasoning approach?
- Basis in paper: The Conclusion identifies the need to "explore additional explainability techniques" as a direction for future research.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates a single explainability method (reasoning breakdown) but does not analyze the utility or necessity of other interpretability methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative user study measuring query refinement efficiency and trust levels between the current method and alternative techniques like confidence scores or counterfactual explanations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the regex-based entity extraction mechanism against LLM output inconsistencies when processing complex or ambiguous queries?
- Basis in paper: The NER workflow relies on parsing LLM output via regex, based on the assumption that "consistent markers ensures output reliability."
- Why unresolved: As LLMs are non-deterministic, relying on strict formatting for regex parsing introduces a potential point of failure not quantified in the text.
- What evidence would resolve it: An error analysis of the parsing stage across a dataset of syntactically complex queries to determine the failure rate of the extraction logic.

## Limitations
- Performance claims lack quantitative validation—no precision/recall metrics for entity matching, no ablation studies for workflow separation
- The framework relies on foundation models without task-specific fine-tuning, making performance sensitive to model quality and prompt engineering
- The paper does not validate whether users can effectively interpret or act on the provided explanations

## Confidence

**High**: The dual-workflow architecture design (NER + FQF) is well-specified and follows established principles of explainable AI. The planning-orchestration coordination mechanism is clearly articulated.

**Medium**: The explainability aggregation approach is theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation of user comprehension or trust-building.

**Low**: Performance claims lack quantitative validation—no precision/recall metrics for entity matching, no ablation studies for workflow separation, and no user studies for explanation effectiveness.

## Next Checks

1. **Entity Matching Accuracy Validation**: Run 100 diverse queries through the NER workflow and measure entity matching precision/recall against ground truth. Analyze error patterns to identify ontology gaps or ambiguous term handling.

2. **User Comprehension Study**: Recruit 20 enterprise users to interact with the system using realistic queries. Measure their ability to correctly interpret step-by-step explanations and identify when the system makes errors.

3. **End-to-End Performance Benchmarking**: Execute 50 queries through the complete pipeline (NL → NER → FQF → SPARQL → results + explanation). Measure latency, accuracy of results, and user trust scores to establish baseline performance metrics.
