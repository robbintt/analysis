- Key outcome: ME-EQL framework reduces parameter recovery error from ABM simulations compared to traditional approaches

## Executive Summary
This work develops Multi-Experiment Equation Learning (ME-EQL) to derive generalizable continuum models from agent-based models (ABMs) across parameter space. Two methods are introduced: OAT ME-EQL, which learns individual models for each parameter set and interpolates coefficients, and ES ME-EQL, which builds a unified model library across parameters. The methods are demonstrated on a birth-death-migration ABM and a mean-field model. Results show both methods significantly reduce parameter recovery error from ABM simulations compared to traditional approaches, with OAT ME-EQL providing better generalizability across parameter space. The framework enables accurate parameter inference from sparse population data while maintaining interpretability.

## Method Summary
The ME-EQL framework combines sparse regression with parameter interpolation to learn generalizable models from ABM simulations. OAT ME-EQL learns separate sparse models at discrete parameter values, identifies the most common structure via majority voting, and interpolates coefficients across parameter space. ES ME-EQL embeds the parameter directly into the candidate function library, forcing a single unified model structure across all parameter values. Both methods use LASSO regression with AIC-based hyperparameter selection, applied to smoothed derivative data from ABM simulations. The framework bridges high-resolution ABMs and low-resolution continuum models, enabling parameter inference and model discovery from sparse population data.

## Key Results
- Both OAT and ES ME-EQL significantly reduce parameter recovery error compared to traditional SINDy approaches
- OAT ME-EQL provides better generalizability across parameter space through coefficient interpolation
- Information content of initial conditions critically affects model identifiability - lower initial densities yield more reliable structure recovery
- ES ME-EQL enforces structural consistency across parameters but requires accurate library construction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Coefficient Interpolation for Generalization
Interpolating learned coefficients across parameter values enables generalization to unobserved simulations. The OAT method learns distinct sparse models at discrete parameter intervals and identifies the most frequently occurring model structure. It then interpolates the coefficients of that structure (e.g., using splines) to create a continuous function that predicts dynamics for parameters not explicitly simulated. This works under the assumption that the relationship between model coefficients and system parameters is smooth and continuous, with no abrupt changes between sampled parameters.

### Mechanism 2: Parameter Embedding for Structural Consistency
Embedding parameters directly into the candidate function library enforces structural consistency across the parameter space. The ES method augments the library by pre-multiplying candidate terms by the parameter, forcing the sparse regression to select a single set of active terms that explains dynamics across all parameter values. This prevents overfitting to specific local noise and ensures a unified model structure. This approach works when the correct governing terms scale predictably with the parameter of interest.

### Mechanism 3: Information Content Determines Identifiability
Information content, determined by initial conditions and noise, limits the identifiability of the correct model structure. The paper demonstrates that lower initial densities provide richer dynamic data, allowing the sparse regression to correctly identify terms. When information content is low, the method becomes unstable, switching between different candidate terms. This occurs because the observed trajectory must sufficiently excite the system's nonlinearities for the regression to distinguish between candidate terms.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)**
  - Why needed here: This is the base algorithm used to find differential equations from data, relying on the assumption that most physical systems have few active terms.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why we use an $\ell_1$ (LASSO) penalty instead of $\ell_2$ (Ridge) when trying to find a parsimonious equation?

- **Concept: Agent-Based Models (ABMs) vs. Mean-Field Models**
  - Why needed here: The paper bridges these two approaches - ABMs are high-resolution/stochastic while Mean-Field models are low-resolution/deterministic. The goal is to learn the latter from the former.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper argue that traditional analytical Mean-Field derivations fail for the ABM in certain parameter regimes (hint: spatial correlations)?

- **Concept: Derivative Approximation from Noisy Data**
  - Why needed here: The input is population density $C(t)$, but the regression target is $dC/dt$. Noise is amplified in derivatives.
  - Quick check question: How does the "information content" of the initial condition affect the stability of calculating this derivative?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Generator -> Preprocessor -> Library Builder -> Optimizer -> Post-Processor
- **Critical path:** The choice of library ($\Theta$) and hyperparameter ($\lambda$). If $\lambda$ is too low, the model overfits (too many terms); if too high, it underfits. The ES method is particularly sensitive to library construction.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - OAT ME-EQL: Better for flexibility and local accuracy; worse for extrapolation stability (relies on interpolation)
  - ES ME-EQL: Better for global structural consistency; worse if parameter dependence is complex or unknown (library must be "guessed" correctly)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - OAT at low $R_p$: High MSE due to interpolation sensitivity (small absolute errors in $R_p$ cause large relative errors)
  - ES with bad Library: Inclusion of small, non-physical spurious terms to compensate for missing parameter coupling
  - General: High variance in selected model structures across train-test splits indicates insufficient data or low information content
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Run OAT/ES on Mean-Field Model (MFM) data with 0% noise to confirm exact analytical equation recovery
  2. Sensitivity Analysis: Generate ABM data with IC=0.25 vs. IC=0.05 to observe model structure degradation with higher IC (lower information)
  3. Extrapolation Test: Train on $R_p \in [0.5, 4.0]$ and test predictions on $R_p = 0.1$ to verify low-parameter interpolation warnings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does using generalized least squares or relative error weighting during the interpolation phase of OAT ME-EQL improve accuracy for low proliferation rates? The current interpolation method results in poor performance at low proliferation rates because small absolute interpolation errors cause large dynamical deviations in this regime.

- **Open Question 2:** Can ME-EQL generalize across different initial conditions if the library includes occupancy correlation terms? Current learned models did not generalize across altered initial conditions, and authors suggest including "occupancy correlation terms" might be necessary.

- **Open Question 3:** Can weak SINDy formulations be integrated into the Embedded Structure (ES) ME-EQL framework to mitigate noise amplification in derivative calculations? The authors identify the need for improved derivative calculation from noisy data and suggest weak SINDy as a solution, but note it is "not straightforward" to incorporate into ES ME-EQL.

## Limitations
- OAT ME-EQL's coefficient interpolation assumes smooth, continuous relationships that may break down in systems with phase transitions or bifurcations
- ES ME-EQL requires accurate prior knowledge of how parameters couple to governing terms, which may not be available in complex systems
- Both methods are sensitive to derivative approximation quality, with noise amplification potentially leading to spurious term selection

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of using sparse regression for equation discovery (SINDy) is well-established
- **Medium Confidence:** Generalizability claims are supported by specific test cases but would benefit from testing on more diverse systems
- **Low Confidence:** Extrapolation capabilities beyond trained parameter range are only briefly discussed, with warnings about interpolation sensitivity at low parameter values

## Next Checks
1. Cross-system validation: Apply ME-EQL to a different ABM class (e.g., predator-prey or epidemic models) to test generalizability beyond the birth-death-migration framework
2. Phase transition testing: Introduce parameter regimes where underlying dynamics change qualitatively (e.g., from stable to oscillatory behavior) to evaluate OAT ME-EQL's interpolation assumptions
3. Derivative approximation sensitivity: Systematically vary smoothing parameters and compare impact on model recovery accuracy across both OAT and ES methods to quantify robustness to noise
