# Rectified Noise: A Generative Model Using Positive-incentive Noise

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.07911
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07911
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** Reduces FID by up to 1.11 on ImageNet, 1.89 on AFHQ, and 3.52 on CelebA-HQ with only 0.39% extra parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Rectified Noise (RN), a method that enhances pre-trained Rectified Flow (RF) generative models by injecting learned Positive-incentive Noise (π-noise) into the velocity field. The authors formulate task entropy for RF models using an auxiliary Gaussian distribution tied to the RF loss, then optimize a π-noise generator to maximize mutual information between the task and noise. Experiments across ImageNet, AFHQ, and CelebA-HQ show consistent performance gains: RN reduces FID by up to 1.11 on ImageNet, 1.89 on AFHQ, and 3.52 on CelebA-HQ, while adding only 0.39% extra parameters. The approach is computationally efficient and integrates seamlessly with existing RF models via fine-tuning. Gaussian noise proved most effective among tested distributions. The method demonstrates that structured noise injection can meaningfully improve generative performance without architectural changes.

## Method Summary
Rectified Noise enhances pre-trained RF models by learning a noise generator that predicts a noise component which is added to the base RF model's velocity prediction. A π-noise generator is fine-tuned on top of a frozen pre-trained RF model, taking the base model's intermediate features as input. The training objective encourages the noise to improve the final outcome, as measured by a modified loss function. The method explores different noise distributions and finds Gaussian to be most effective. The approach requires minimal architectural changes (0.39% extra parameters) and can be applied to various pre-trained RF models.

## Key Results
- Reduces FID by up to 1.11 on ImageNet, 1.89 on AFHQ, and 3.52 on CelebA-HQ
- Adds only 0.39% extra parameters to pre-trained RF models
- Gaussian noise distribution outperforms Uniform and Gumbel alternatives
- Fine-tuning strategy is more stable than simultaneous optimization
- Computational overhead during sampling is minimal

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Injecting learned "positive-incentive noise" (π-noise) into the velocity field improves the performance of pre-trained Rectified Flow (RF) models.
- Mechanism: Rectified Noise (RN) formulates task entropy for RF using an auxiliary Gaussian distribution tied to the RF loss. It then optimizes a π-noise generator to maximize mutual information between the task and this noise. Theoretically, this maximization is shown to be equivalent to maximizing an objective function involving the injected noise, which drives the learning of a structured, beneficial noise component.
- Core assumption: Noise can be beneficial for the generation task if its mutual information with the task is maximized. The task entropy can be meaningfully represented via the RF loss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "inspired by Positive-incentive Noise (π-noise)... improves the generative performance by injecting π-noise into the velocity field"
  - [section 4.1 & 4.2] "...introduce an auxiliary random variable... information entropy... reflects the difficulty for the corresponding generative model" and "maximizing mutual information can be achieved by minimizing conditional entropy... equivalent to injecting noise into the velocity field."
  - [corpus] Neighbors like "Learn Beneficial Noise as Graph Augmentation" support the general π-noise framework, showing FMR relevance. The core mechanism is specific to this paper's application to RF.
- Break condition: If the assumption that task entropy is well-captured by the RF loss fails, or if the noise distribution cannot be effectively modeled by the chosen parametric distribution (Gaussian, etc.).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning a lightweight noise generator on top of a frozen pre-trained RF model is a computationally efficient strategy to inject beneficial noise.
- Mechanism: A π-noise generator is trained by fine-tuning on top of a frozen pre-trained RF model. The generator predicts a noise component which is added to the base RF model's velocity prediction. The training objective encourages the noise to improve the final outcome, as measured by the modified loss.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained RF model has captured a good base representation of the data distribution, and a lightweight adapter/generator can effectively learn the corrective or beneficial noise pattern.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...injecting π-noise into the velocity field of pre-trained RF models... reduces FID... while adding only 0.39% extra parameters."
  - [section 4.3.2] "fine-tune the pre-trained RF model using the strategy... extract the pre-trained RF model's features... use them as input for the π-noise generator."
  - [corpus] The corpus lacks direct evidence for this specific "fine-tuning a noise generator" mechanism in RF, though other works explore related RF concepts.
- Break condition: If the frozen backbone lacks the capacity to support the noise generator's required features, or if the fine-tuning objective leads to mode collapse or divergence.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Modeling the π-noise with a Gaussian distribution is more effective than Uniform or Gumbel distributions for this task.
- Mechanism: The paper explores three reparameterizable distributions (Gaussian, Gumbel, Uniform) for the π-noise. The experimental results show that the Gaussian assumption yields the best performance on the ImageNet dataset.
- Core assumption: The optimal structure of the beneficial noise is best captured by the properties of a Gaussian distribution in this specific application context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3] "We explored three different noise assumptions... Gaussian distribution is the most effective to enhance model performance." (FID 9.05 for Gaussian vs 10.02 for Uniform).
  - [corpus] No specific corpus evidence contradicts or supports this finding; it's an internal experimental result.
- Break condition: If the optimal noise distribution varies significantly for different datasets or model architectures, which is not extensively tested beyond ImageNet in this specific comparison.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Rectified Flow (RF) and Velocity Fields
  - Why needed here: The core generative model being enhanced is Rectified Flow. Understanding that RF learns a time-dependent velocity field to transport noise to data is essential to grasp where and why π-noise is injected.
  - Quick check question: In the context of Rectified Flow, what does the velocity field represent, and how is it used during sampling?

- Concept: Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) in Generative Models
  - Why needed here: The paper is inspired by the success of reverse-time SDEs (which introduce noise) over probability flow ODEs (which are deterministic) for sampling in RF. The proposed method is a learned way to inject noise.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between sampling with a probability flow ODE and sampling with a reverse-time SDE in terms of stochasticity?

- Concept: Mutual Information (MI) as an Optimization Objective
  - Why needed here: The π-noise framework is theoretically grounded in maximizing the mutual information between the "task" and the "noise". Understanding this high-level goal is necessary to understand the paper's motivation.
  - Quick check question: According to the π-noise framework, what is the primary information-theoretic objective used to guide the learning of the beneficial noise?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Pre-trained RF Model -> Feature Extractor -> π-noise Generator -> Velocity Field -> Loss Function

- Critical path: The critical path for implementation is the fine-tuning pipeline: (1) Load pre-trained RF and freeze it. (2) Initialize the π-noise generator (e.g., 0 extra SiT blocks, just a linear layer). Ensure the final linear layer of the generator is zero-initialized so the initial prediction is just the base model's output. (3) Train only the generator using the derived loss function on the same dataset.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Simultaneous vs. Sequential Training:** The paper concludes that the fine-tuning (sequential) strategy is more stable and effective. Simultaneous training can lead to instability.
  - **Generator Size:** Experiments show that adding extra SiT blocks to the generator provides limited gains over just the minimal linear layer (0.39% extra params). A simpler generator is more parameter-efficient.
  - **Noise Distribution:** The design choice of assuming a Gaussian distribution for the π-noise is empirically shown to be superior to Uniform or Gumbel alternatives.

- Failure signatures: 1) **Training Instability:** If attempting simultaneous training of the RF backbone and noise generator, expect unstable FID curves and difficulty converging. 2) **No Performance Gain:** If the π-noise generator is not initialized correctly (e.g., non-zero final layer), it may disrupt the strong pre-trained features, leading to worse performance. 3) **Overfitting:** If the generator is too large (many extra SiT blocks), it may overfit without providing additional benefit over the smaller model.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Run the pre-trained SiT model on ImageNet to establish baseline FID, IS, sFID, Precision, and Recall.
  2. **Minimal RN Implementation:** Fine-tune a SiT model using the Rectified Noise framework with the *minimal* configuration (0 extra SiT blocks, Gaussian noise assumption, frozen backbone) on a subset of ImageNet (e.g., 100k steps) and compare FID to the baseline.
  3. **Noise Distribution Ablation:** Repeat experiment #2 but change the assumed distribution for the π-noise generator to Gumbel and Uniform, comparing the resulting FIDs to confirm that Gaussian is indeed the most effective.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can a stabilization mechanism be developed to enable the simultaneous optimization of the Rectified Noise generator ($\theta$) and the base Rectified Flow model ($\psi$) without convergence issues?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors note in Section 5.4 that simultaneous optimization "leads to instability and difficulty converging," forcing a preference for fine-tuning, though they initially present simultaneous training as a valid strategy in Section 4.3.1.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates the failure mode of simultaneous training but does not propose a solution to make this theoretically valid strategy practically viable.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified loss landscape or regularization term that allows $\theta$ and $\psi$ to converge jointly with stable FID scores comparable to the fine-tuning approach.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do non-parametric or heavy-tailed noise distributions (e.g., mixture models) offer further performance gains over the Gaussian distribution found most effective in this study?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.3 explicitly compares Gaussian, Uniform, and Gumbel distributions, concluding that Gaussian is most effective, but leaves the exploration of the broader space of noise distributions as an open avenue.
- **Why unresolved:** The analysis is limited to three standard reparameterizable distributions; the theoretical upper bound of performance for the $\pi$-noise distribution remains unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking Rectified Noise using a flexible, learned noise distribution kernel (e.g., normalizing flows for the noise) against the fixed Gaussian baseline.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the performance improvement derived from Rectified Noise consistent across different ODE-based generative backbones, such as standard Diffusion models or Consistency Models?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The experimental scope is restricted to Rectified Flow models (specifically SiT architectures) as stated in Section 5.1, despite the general formulation of the velocity injection method.
- **Why unresolved:** While the theory is general, the empirical validation is narrow; it is unclear if the $\pi$-noise benefits are specific to the straight-line trajectories of RF or universal to generative ODEs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Application of the Rectified Noise pipeline to non-RF generative architectures (e.g., DDIM or Stable Diffusion) showing similar FID reductions.

## Limitations
- Fine-tuning learning rate for the noise generator is not explicitly specified, which could significantly impact results
- Gaussian noise superiority is based on limited ablation studies (only ImageNet)
- Method's behavior on out-of-distribution data and robustness to different initialization strategies are not thoroughly explored
- Computational overhead during sampling (100 SDE steps) is higher than deterministic ODE approaches

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of injecting learned noise into the velocity field and the general trend of FID improvements are well-supported by experimental results across three datasets.
- **Medium Confidence:** The superiority of Gaussian noise over other distributions is demonstrated but only for ImageNet. The computational efficiency claim (0.39% parameter increase) is specific to the minimal configuration.
- **Low Confidence:** The theoretical equivalence between maximizing mutual information and the practical training objective is mathematically sound but the practical implications for real-world data distributions remain uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce Minimal Configuration:** Implement the fine-tuning pipeline with 0 extra SiT blocks and Gaussian noise on ImageNet to verify the 9.05 FID score reported in Table 1.

2. **Noise Distribution Robustness:** Test the same fine-tuning procedure with Uniform and Gumbel noise distributions on AFHQ and CelebA-HQ to determine if Gaussian remains optimal across datasets.

3. **Sampling Efficiency Trade-off:** Compare FID scores using ODE solvers versus SDE solvers with 100 steps to quantify the practical impact of the computational overhead on real-world applications.
