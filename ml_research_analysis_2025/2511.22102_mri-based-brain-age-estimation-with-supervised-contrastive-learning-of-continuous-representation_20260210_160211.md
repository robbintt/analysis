# MRI-Based Brain Age Estimation with Supervised Contrastive Learning of Continuous Representation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.22102
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22102
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: Proposed RNC loss improves MAE and R² for brain age regression on limited datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurately estimating brain age from T1-weighted MRI scans using deep learning, focusing on capturing continuous anatomical changes to improve feature representation and clinical applicability. The authors propose a novel approach that combines supervised contrastive learning with the Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to explicitly enforce continuous feature representation based on age ranking. This method is applied to 3D ResNet models for brain age regression. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed RNC method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an R² of 0.93 on a limited dataset, significantly outperforming conventional end-to-end trained ResNet models with the same backbone and performing comparably to state-of-the-art methods trained on much larger datasets. Furthermore, the use of Grad-RAM reveals more nuanced and anatomically relevant features related to age regression with the RNC loss compared to conventional training. The method is also applied to estimate brain age gaps in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients, revealing correlations with disease severity and demonstrating potential as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disorders.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a novel approach to brain age estimation using 3D ResNet models trained with a Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss function. This supervised contrastive learning method enforces continuous feature representation based on age ranking, rather than simply predicting discrete age values. The RNC loss operates by comparing feature representations of samples and their augmented views, pushing representations of similar ages closer together while maintaining separation between different age groups. The method is evaluated on T1-weighted MRI scans, with experiments demonstrating improved performance compared to standard ResNet baselines. The approach also includes interpretability analysis using Grad-RAM to visualize which brain regions contribute most to age predictions, revealing more anatomically relevant features when using the RNC loss compared to conventional training methods.

## Key Results
- RNC method achieves MAE of 4.27 years and R² of 0.93 on limited dataset
- Outperforms conventional end-to-end trained ResNet models with same backbone
- Performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods trained on much larger datasets
- Grad-RAM reveals more anatomically relevant features with RNC loss compared to conventional training
- Brain age gap correlates with disease severity in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RNC loss improves brain age estimation by enforcing continuous feature representation through age-based ranking. Traditional regression approaches treat age as a simple numerical target, but the RNC loss explicitly encourages the model to learn feature representations that reflect the continuous nature of brain aging. By comparing samples based on their relative age rankings rather than absolute values, the method captures subtle anatomical changes that occur gradually over time. This contrastive approach helps the model distinguish between similar ages more effectively while maintaining the continuous progression of features across the age spectrum. The supervised aspect ensures that the contrastive learning is guided by the actual age labels, preventing the model from learning arbitrary feature separations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Supervised Contrastive Learning**: A training paradigm that uses label information to guide contrastive learning, pulling together representations of similar classes while pushing apart dissimilar ones. Why needed: Standard contrastive learning lacks label guidance, making it less effective for supervised tasks like regression. Quick check: Does the method use positive pairs from same age group and negative pairs from different age groups?
- **Rank-N-Contrast Loss**: A specialized contrastive loss that enforces ranking-based similarity, where samples are compared based on their relative positions in the age distribution rather than absolute distances. Why needed: Age is inherently continuous and ordinal, requiring a loss function that captures relative rather than absolute differences. Quick check: Are samples compared based on age ranking rather than Euclidean distance in feature space?
- **3D ResNet Architecture**: Convolutional neural network designed to process volumetric medical images by extending standard 2D ResNet to three dimensions. Why needed: MRI scans are 3D volumes requiring spatial information across all three axes for accurate feature extraction. Quick check: Does the model process the full 3D volume rather than flattened 2D slices?
- **Grad-RAM Visualization**: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping technique for visualizing which regions of an input image contribute most to model predictions. Why needed: Provides interpretability by showing which brain regions the model uses for age estimation. Quick check: Are the visualization maps consistent with known age-related anatomical changes?
- **Brain Age Gap Analysis**: The difference between predicted and chronological age, used as a potential biomarker for neurodegenerative conditions. Why needed: Provides a quantitative measure of brain health that may indicate disease progression or accelerated aging. Quick check: Do brain age gaps correlate with clinical measures of disease severity?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: T1-weighted MRI scans -> 3D ResNet feature extractor -> RNC loss function -> Age regression output

**Critical Path**: Input MRI -> Data augmentation (random crops, intensity shifts) -> 3D ResNet backbone -> Feature embedding -> RNC loss computation -> Backpropagation -> Updated weights

**Design Tradeoffs**: The 3D ResNet backbone provides comprehensive spatial feature extraction but requires more computational resources compared to 2D approaches. The RNC loss enforces continuous representation but may be more sensitive to hyperparameter tuning than standard regression losses. The method achieves strong performance on limited data but may not scale as effectively to extremely large datasets where traditional methods have advantages.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on age groups with limited training data, failure to capture subtle age-related changes in certain brain regions, sensitivity to image quality and preprocessing variations, potential overfitting when training data is insufficient relative to model complexity.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare RNC loss performance against standard MSE regression on the same 3D ResNet backbone using identical training data and hyperparameters
2. Evaluate feature representation quality by measuring age prediction consistency across different data augmentations of the same sample
3. Test model performance across different age ranges to identify potential biases or failure modes in specific demographic groups

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Validation limited to relatively small cohorts, raising questions about robustness on larger and more diverse datasets
- Clinical interpretability of brain age gap findings in neurodegenerative diseases is correlational without longitudinal tracking to establish causality
- Performance comparisons to larger-scale models may overstate relative advantages due to dataset size and demographic biases

## Confidence

**High**: Supervised contrastive learning framework with RNC loss improves continuous feature representation for brain age regression.

**Medium**: RNC loss yields better MAE and R² compared to standard ResNet baselines on tested datasets.

**Medium**: Grad-RAM visualizations with RNC reveal more anatomically relevant features than conventional training.

**Low**: Brain age gap correlates with neurodegenerative disease severity are clinically actionable without longitudinal validation.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate RNC-based models on multi-site, demographically diverse MRI datasets (e.g., UK Biobank, ADNI expansion cohorts) to test generalizability.

2. Conduct longitudinal studies to determine if brain age gap changes precede or track with clinical progression in neurodegenerative disease.

3. Perform ablation studies comparing RNC loss against other continuous representation losses (e.g., NT-Xent, Barlow Twins) under identical data and model constraints.
