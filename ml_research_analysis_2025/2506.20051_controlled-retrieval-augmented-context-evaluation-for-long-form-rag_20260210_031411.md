- Primary result: CRUX framework reveals substantial gaps in current retrieval methods' ability to retrieve comprehensive information for long-form generation through controlled evaluation using human-written summaries

## Executive Summary
CRUX introduces a framework for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in long-form tasks by using human-written summaries to define a controlled scope of relevant knowledge. The framework measures retrieval completeness and redundancy through question-based evaluation, introducing coverage and density metrics that assess how well retrieved passages answer diverse sub-questions. Experiments show CRUX provides more reflective evaluation than traditional relevance metrics and demonstrates strong alignment with human perception of retrieval quality.

## Method Summary
CRUX establishes oracle bounds using human-written multi-document summaries paired with source documents, then generates diverse sub-questions from summaries. For each retrieved passage, LLM judges answerability on a 0-5 scale, computing coverage as the ratio of answerable questions. The framework evaluates both retrieval context Z and final generation y using the same sub-question coverage metric, allowing intermediate evaluation. CRUX balances scalability with reliability by integrating LLM judgments with human-annotated data, demonstrating strong correlation (0.68-0.84) between intermediate retrieval scores and final generation quality.

## Key Results
- CRUX reveals substantial gaps in current retrieval methods' ability to retrieve comprehensive information for long-form generation
- Coverage and density metrics show strong alignment (ρ≥0.8) with human perception of retrieval quality
- Strong correlation (0.68-0.84) between retrieval context quality and final RAG output quality, outperforming traditional metrics
- Even state-of-the-art re-rankers show large gaps compared to oracle retrieval in achieving comprehensive coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Human-written summaries establish a controlled scope for measuring retrieval completeness. Multi-document summarization datasets provide paired documents and human-written summaries, where the summary defines relevant information (oracle result y*) while source documents define oracle retrieval context Z*. This creates explicit relevance boundaries that traditional metrics lack.

### Mechanism 2
Sub-question answerability provides fine-grained retrieval context evaluation beyond relevance ranking. Generate diverse sub-questions Q from oracle summary. For each retrieved passage, LLM judges answerability on 0-5 scale (threshold η=3 for binary). Coverage = (answerable questions) / (total questions). This directly measures whether retrieval context contains necessary information.

### Mechanism 3
Retrieval context quality strongly predicts final RAG result quality, enabling intermediate evaluation. Both retrieval context Z and final generation y are evaluated via the same sub-question coverage metric. Rank correlation (Kendall's τ) between intermediate Cov(Z) and final Cov(y) is 0.68-0.84, higher than traditional metrics (MAP: 0.56-0.57, nDCG: 0.56-0.76). This allows diagnosing retrieval problems without running generation.

## Foundational Learning

Concept: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline
- Why needed here: CRUX evaluates the retrieval module specifically, treating it as a bottleneck. Understanding the retrieval context → generation dependency is essential.
- Quick check question: What happens to final output quality when retrieval context has 50% coverage vs 80% coverage?

Concept: Multi-document summarization datasets
- Why needed here: CRUX relies on existing summarization benchmarks (Multi-News, DUC) that pair human summaries with source documents, providing oracle ground truth.
- Quick check question: Why can source documents be treated as "relevant" and all others as "irrelevant" in this setup?

Concept: Question-based / nugget-based evaluation
- Why needed here: CRUX operationalizes information completeness through sub-question answerability rather than lexical overlap or relevance scores.
- Quick check question: How does question-based evaluation differ from nDCG or recall metrics for ranking evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Human summary → LLM generates queries, sub-questions, decontextualized passages → LLM pre-judges passage-question answerability matrix → Retrieval system returns Z → LLM judges answerability against Z → Compute Cov(Z), α-nDCG, Den(Z) → Generate final y → Compute Cov(y) to validate correlation

Critical path: 1) Establish oracle bounds using human summaries and required passage subset 2) Run retrieval pipeline to get empirical Z 3) Judge sub-question answerability against Z 4) Compare Cov(Z), α-nDCG, Den(Z) against oracles 5) Optionally: generate final y and compute Cov(y) to validate correlation

Design tradeoffs: LLM judgment vs human annotation: Paper shows ρ≥0.8 correlation but LLM tends to be conservative (recall=0.4 for answerable cases); trade scalability for precision. Answerability threshold η: η=3 more discriminative (larger variance) than η=5; paper chooses η=3. Retrieval context size: Controlled experiments use |Z*| tokens; varying top-k shows correlation fluctuates with larger contexts.

Failure signatures: Low Cov(Z) + high Cov(y): Generator hallucinating beyond retrieval (check factual accuracy). High Cov(Z) + low Cov(y): Generator not utilizing context effectively (check prompt/position bias). Low density Den(Z): Too much redundant context, efficiency problem. High α-nDCG but low coverage: Ranking captures diversity but misses completeness.

First 3 experiments: 1) Reproduce baseline table: Run BM25, SPLADE-v3, and one re-ranker (e.g., monoT5) on CRUX-DUC, compute all metrics. Verify oracle bounds (Cov(Z*) ≈100%, Cov(y*) ≈95%). 2) Threshold sensitivity analysis: Vary η (3, 4, 5) and observe impact on Cov(Z), Cov(y), and Kendall τ correlation. 3) Retrieval context size ablation: Compare fixed k=10, k=20 vs adaptive |Z*|. Report how correlation with Cov(y) changes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

Open Question 1: How can retrieval evaluation frameworks effectively mitigate position bias and lack of controllability when diagnosing retrieval performance across larger context sizes (e.g., top-20 passages)? The authors state correlations fluctuate with top-20 contexts due to "position biases and a lack of controllability."

Open Question 2: How can the generation of sub-questions be optimized to be more discriminative and better aligned with human perception of answerability? The authors note LLMs under-estimate answerable content (recall 0.4) compared to human annotators.

Open Question 3: Can coverage-based evaluation frameworks be extended to explicitly assess factual correctness (hallucination detection) in addition to information completeness? The authors recognize limitations in assessing factual correctness, highlighting the limitation of answerability.

Open Question 4: How can retrieval and re-ranking models be explicitly optimized for coverage and density metrics rather than just relevance? Results show even state-of-the-art re-rankers have large gaps compared to oracle retrieval, implying existing models aren't optimized for coverage.

## Limitations

- Framework's reliability hinges on quality of human-written summaries as ground truth, which may not perfectly represent user information needs
- 0.4 recall rate for answerable questions indicates LLM judge systematically under-recognizes answerable content
- Framework assumes oracle retrieval context size |Z*| is known and fixed, introducing artificial constraints
- Controlled setup using existing summarization datasets may not generalize to open-domain retrieval tasks

## Confidence

High Confidence (ρ≥0.8 correlation with human judgments):
- Coverage and density metrics provide meaningful measures of retrieval completeness and redundancy
- CRUX reveals substantial gaps in current retrieval methods' ability to retrieve comprehensive information
- Strong correlation (0.68-0.84) between retrieval context quality and final RAG output quality

Medium Confidence (ρ≥0.6 correlation, moderate agreement):
- LLM answerability judgments reliably proxy human perception of information sufficiency
- Sub-question generation captures diverse aspects of information needs
- Framework balances scalability with reliability through LLM-human integration

Low Confidence (ρ<0.6 or insufficient validation):
- Human summaries perfectly represent optimal long-form output for evaluation
- The controlled scope adequately captures all relevant knowledge for complex queries
- Threshold η=3 is universally optimal across different retrieval scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test:** Apply CRUX to open-domain datasets like Natural Questions or MS MARCO to assess whether coverage metrics maintain strong correlation (ρ≥0.7) with human judgments outside the controlled summarization domain.

2. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary the answerability threshold η (2, 3, 4, 5) across different passage lengths and retrieval contexts to determine optimal thresholds for different use cases and validate the paper's choice of η=3.

3. **Hallucination Impact Study:** Measure Cov(y) and Cov(Z) for cases where retrieval context has high coverage but generated output hallucinates information not present in context, to quantify the framework's ability to detect this critical RAG failure mode.
