# Fast and Geometrically Grounded Lorentz Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21529
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21529
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Resolves logarithmic norm scaling pathology in Lorentz neural networks through geometrically grounded linear layer

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in current Lorentz model neural networks where the hyperbolic norm of outputs scales logarithmically rather than linearly with gradient descent steps. This pathology prevents efficient hierarchical embedding, nullifying the key advantage of hyperbolic geometry for representing hierarchical structures. The authors propose a geometrically grounded Lorentz linear layer based on the distance-to-hyperplane formulation from Poincaré models, proving it achieves linear scaling of hyperbolic norms with gradient steps. Combined with Lorentzian activation functions and a caching strategy for inference, the Fast and Geometrically Grounded Lorentz Neural Networks (FGG-LNN) achieve significantly faster training and inference speeds while maintaining comparable accuracy on CIFAR benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors identify that current Lorentz linear layers cause hyperbolic norms to grow logarithmically with training steps, which prevents efficient hierarchical embedding. They propose a geometrically grounded Lorentz linear layer that uses the distance-to-hyperplane formulation from Poincaré models, achieving linear norm scaling. This is combined with Lorentzian activation functions and a caching strategy for inference acceleration. The new architecture, FGG-LNN, trains 3.5× faster than state-of-the-art Lorentz networks and 7.5× faster than Poincaré networks, while inference is accelerated by 2.9× compared to Lorentz models and 8.3× compared to Poincaré models.

## Key Results
- FGG-LNN trains 3.5× faster than state-of-the-art Lorentz networks and 7.5× faster than Poincaré networks
- Inference acceleration of 2.9× compared to Lorentz models and 8.3× compared to Poincaré models
- Achieves comparable accuracy to existing models on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper proves that current Lorentz linear layer formulations cause hyperbolic norms to scale logarithmically with gradient descent steps, which nullifies the key advantage of hyperbolic geometry for hierarchical structures. The proposed geometrically grounded Lorentz linear layer uses the distance-to-hyperplane formulation from Poincaré models, which achieves linear scaling of hyperbolic norms with gradient steps. This linear scaling preserves the geometric properties needed for hierarchical representation learning, enabling efficient training and inference while maintaining the benefits of hyperbolic geometry.

## Foundational Learning

**Hyperbolic Geometry**: Non-Euclidean geometry with constant negative curvature, ideal for representing hierarchical data where distances grow exponentially with depth.
*Why needed*: Provides the mathematical foundation for hierarchical representation learning.
*Quick check*: Verify that distances between points at different hierarchical levels grow exponentially in hyperbolic space.

**Lorentz Model**: A model of hyperbolic geometry represented in Minkowski space using Lorentzian inner products.
*Why needed*: Enables efficient computation of hyperbolic operations using linear algebra.
*Quick check*: Confirm that Lorentzian inner products satisfy the required hyperbolic properties.

**Poincaré Ball Model**: Another model of hyperbolic geometry where points lie within a unit ball.
*Why needed*: Provides alternative formulation for hyperbolic operations, particularly useful for distance-to-hyperplane calculations.
*Quick check*: Verify that distance-to-hyperplane formulation works correctly in Poincaré coordinates.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Geometrically Grounded Lorentz Linear Layer -> Lorentzian Activation -> Output

**Critical Path**: The geometrically grounded Lorentz linear layer is the critical innovation, replacing standard Lorentz linear layers to achieve linear norm scaling. This is combined with Lorentzian activation functions and a caching strategy for inference acceleration.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The distance-to-hyperplane formulation provides geometric grounding but may introduce numerical instability in high-dimensional spaces. The caching strategy improves inference speed but requires additional memory overhead. The linear norm scaling preserves hierarchical properties but may limit expressiveness for non-hierarchical data.

**Failure Signatures**: Numerical instability when embedding dimensions exceed 100, poor performance on non-hierarchical datasets, gradient vanishing/exploding during training if learning rates are not properly tuned.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify linear norm scaling during training on synthetic hierarchical data
2. Compare hierarchical representation quality on WordNet or DBLP datasets
3. Stress test numerical stability with increasing embedding dimensions (d > 100)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper acknowledges that the theoretical proof of logarithmic versus linear scaling, while mathematically sound, may not fully capture practical training dynamics. The claim that current Lorentz models cannot efficiently learn hierarchical structures due to this scaling issue needs empirical validation across diverse hierarchical datasets beyond CIFAR benchmarks. The distance-to-hyperplane formulation, though promising, may introduce numerical instability in high-dimensional spaces or when dealing with complex hierarchical structures that don't map cleanly to hyperplane separations.

## Limitations

- Limited validation on truly hierarchical datasets beyond standard image classification benchmarks
- Potential numerical instability in high-dimensional spaces with the distance-to-hyperplane formulation
- Unclear generalizability to other hyperbolic geometry applications like knowledge graphs or taxonomies

## Confidence

High confidence in the mathematical framework and identification of the logarithmic scaling pathology. Medium confidence in the proposed solution's effectiveness, as experiments focus on standard image classification rather than truly hierarchical tasks. Low confidence in generalizability to other hyperbolic geometry applications where different hierarchical patterns may emerge.

## Next Checks

1. **Hierarchical Benchmark Validation**: Test FGG-LNN on established hierarchical datasets like WordNet or DBLP to verify that linear norm scaling translates to improved hierarchical representation quality compared to existing Lorentz models.

2. **Numerical Stability Analysis**: Conduct stress tests on the distance-to-hyperplane formulation with increasing embedding dimensions (d > 100) and varying hyperbolic curvatures to identify potential numerical instability thresholds.

3. **Cross-Geometry Comparison**: Implement the caching strategy and FGG-LNN architecture on Poincaré models to determine whether improvements are specific to Lorentz geometry or represent a more general advancement in hyperbolic neural networks.
