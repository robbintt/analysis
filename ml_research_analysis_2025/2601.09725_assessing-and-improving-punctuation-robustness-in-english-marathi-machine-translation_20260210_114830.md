# Assessing and Improving Punctuation Robustness in English-Marathi Machine Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09725
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Virām benchmark shows punctuation errors significantly impact English-Marathi translation quality, with fine-tuning and pipeline approaches showing substantial improvements

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in machine translation evaluation by introducing Virām, the first diagnostic benchmark for punctuation robustness in English-to-Marathi translation. The authors demonstrate that punctuation ambiguity significantly impacts translation quality and propose two distinct approaches to mitigate this issue: pipeline-based punctuation restoration followed by translation, and direct fine-tuning on punctuation-varied data. Both strategies show substantial improvements over standard baselines, with fine-tuned models achieving the highest scores across multiple evaluation metrics. The study also reveals that current large language models lag behind specialized approaches in handling punctuation-ambiguous text, highlighting the need for continued research in this area.

## Method Summary
The authors created Virām, a benchmark of 54 manually curated punctuation-ambiguous English sentences, and evaluated translation quality using automatic metrics (BLEU, chrF++, semantic similarity). Two improvement strategies were tested: (1) a pipeline approach using a punctuation restoration model followed by translation, and (2) direct fine-tuning of translation models on punctuation-varied training data. The fine-tuning approach showed the most promising results, significantly outperforming both the baseline and pipeline methods on the Virām benchmark. The study also compared these specialized approaches against general-purpose large language models, finding that task-specific solutions remain superior for this particular challenge.

## Key Results
- Virām benchmark reveals significant degradation in translation quality for punctuation-ambiguous sentences
- Fine-tuned models achieved the highest BLEU, chrF++, and semantic similarity scores on Virām
- Pipeline-based approach also outperformed baseline but was less effective than direct fine-tuning
- Current LLMs show lower performance than specialized approaches for punctuation-robust translation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Punctuation ambiguity creates syntactic and semantic uncertainty that propagates through the translation pipeline, causing errors in both intermediate representations and final output. By explicitly modeling punctuation variations during training or through restoration steps, models learn to disambiguate these cases more effectively. Fine-tuning on punctuation-varied data allows the model to internalize these patterns directly, while pipeline approaches leverage specialized models for punctuation restoration before translation.

## Foundational Learning

1. **BLEU and chrF++ metrics** - Why needed: Standard evaluation metrics for translation quality; quick check: Compare scores across different models to verify relative performance

2. **Semantic similarity evaluation** - Why needed: Captures meaning preservation beyond surface-level n-gram overlap; quick check: Verify that improvements in semantic similarity correlate with qualitative improvements

3. **Punctuation restoration** - Why needed: Intermediate step to disambiguate input before translation; quick check: Measure restoration accuracy independently to identify potential error sources

4. **Fine-tuning methodology** - Why needed: Adapts pre-trained models to specific challenges; quick check: Monitor training loss and validation performance to avoid overfitting

5. **Cross-lingual syntactic transfer** - Why needed: Understanding how English punctuation patterns map to Marathi structure; quick check: Analyze error patterns for different punctuation types

6. **Diagnostic benchmarking** - Why needed: Targeted evaluation of specific linguistic phenomena; quick check: Ensure benchmark covers diverse ambiguity patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Text -> Punctuation Restoration (Pipeline) OR Direct Translation (Fine-tuned) -> Marathi Translation -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path:** Input sentences with ambiguous punctuation → Model processing → Marathi output → Metric computation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Pipeline approach adds complexity and potential error propagation but uses specialized models; fine-tuning is simpler but requires additional training data and computational resources

**Failure Signatures:** Incorrect punctuation interpretation leading to wrong clause boundaries, mistranslation of scope ambiguities, preservation of source punctuation errors in target language

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test baseline model on Virām benchmark to establish performance floor
2. Run fine-tuned model on Virām to verify improvement claims
3. Compare pipeline approach results with direct fine-tuned model on identical test cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Study focuses exclusively on English-to-Marathi translation, limiting generalizability to other language pairs
- Virām benchmark contains only 54 instances, potentially insufficient for capturing full diversity of punctuation ambiguity patterns
- Evaluation relies on automatic metrics without comprehensive human assessment of translation quality

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Punctuation ambiguity significantly impacts translation quality | High |
| Fine-tuning and pipeline approaches improve performance | Medium |
| LLMs lag behind task-specific approaches for this task | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Expand Virām benchmark size and diversity by including additional punctuation-ambiguous patterns and real-world user-generated content to better represent practical translation scenarios

2. Conduct comprehensive human evaluation studies with native Marathi speakers to assess translation quality beyond automatic metrics, particularly for cases where punctuation changes semantic meaning

3. Test the proposed approaches on additional language pairs, especially those with different punctuation conventions or syntactic structures, to evaluate cross-linguistic applicability
