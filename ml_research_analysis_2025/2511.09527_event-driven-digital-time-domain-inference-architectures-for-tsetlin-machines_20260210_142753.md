# Event-Driven Digital-Time-Domain Inference Architectures for Tsetlin Machines

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09527
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09527
- Authors: Tian Lan; Rishad Shafik; Alex Yakovlev
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Event-driven digital-time-domain architecture achieves 247% better energy efficiency and 82% higher throughput than synchronous digital baselines for Tsetlin machine inference

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing architecture for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference that replaces arithmetic operations with delay accumulation mechanisms and magnitude comparators with Winner-Takes-All schemes. The approach significantly reduces dynamic power consumption by minimizing voltage transitions in CMOS nodes while maintaining classification accuracy. The hybrid architecture integrates event-driven asynchronous logic with digital control, demonstrating orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput compared to conventional synchronous implementations.

## Method Summary
The methodology replaces conventional digital arithmetic sums in Tsetlin machine inference with pulse-delay accumulation mechanisms, where clause weights are encoded as discrete time delays rather than binary integers. Active clauses trigger pulses that traverse delay elements, with the total propagation time representing the summation. For multi-class classification, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented, while coalesced TMs use differential delay paths combined with leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression to manage binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation. The architecture employs asynchronous bundled-data protocols with Req/Ack handshakes to control the event-driven pipeline, and Winner-Takes-All arbiters replace conventional magnitude comparators for classification.

## Key Results
- Multi-class TM implementation achieves 247% better energy efficiency than synchronous digital baselines
- Coalesced TM implementation simultaneously improves throughput by 82% and energy efficiency by 146%
- The hybrid digital-time-domain architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput
- Event-driven asynchronous logic integration maintains classification accuracy while reducing arithmetic computation overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Delay-Accumulation-as-Arithmetic
Replacing digital arithmetic sums with pulse-delay accumulation reduces dynamic power consumption by minimizing voltage transitions in CMOS nodes. The architecture encodes clause weights as discrete time delays rather than binary integers, with active clauses triggering pulses that traverse delay elements where total propagation time represents the summation, bypassing the need for parallel adder trees and accumulator registers.

### Mechanism 2: Winner-Takes-All (WTA) Time-Domain Arbitration
Replacing digital magnitude comparators with asynchronous race arbiters improves throughput and energy efficiency by converting comparison logic into single-event detection. Instead of comparing N-bit registers for all classes simultaneously, the class with the longest accumulated delay produces a pulse that arrives first at the arbiter, which detects the "winner" and immediately grants the classification output.

### Mechanism 3: Logarithmic Delay Compression (LOD)
Leading-Ones-Detector compression prevents exponential growth of delay paths in Coalesced TMs, keeping hardware area feasible while maintaining resolution. For weighted sums, the LOD scheme detects the highest-order bit (coarse delay k) and normalizes lower bits (fine delay f), mapping a linear/exponential range into a logarithmic delay line configuration.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Tsetlin Machine (TM) Inference Fundamentals**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that TM inference relies on Boolean clause satisfaction and summation (rather than matrix multiplication) is required to see why delay accumulation is a valid substitute for MAC operations
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a Tsetlin Machine uses propositional logic (clauses) to vote for a class, distinguishing it from a Neural Network's weighted sum?

- **Concept: Asynchronous Bundled-Data (BD) Protocols**
  - Why needed here: The proposed system is event-driven, requiring understanding of "Req/Ack" handshake and "Click element" control to debug the pipeline flow where no global clock exists
  - Quick check question: In a bundled-data interface, what does the "Request" signal signify to the receiver, and how does the "Acknowledge" signal close the transaction loop?

- **Concept: Time-to-Digital Converters (TDC) and Vernier Delay Lines**
  - Why needed here: The CoTM architecture relies on precise time measurements to differentiate class sums
  - Quick check question: How does a Vernier TDC achieve higher precision than a simple delay chain inverter, and why is this necessary for the "fine delay" component?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Frontend (Digital): Feature Registers → Literal Generation → Clause Output → Binary Multiplication Matrix → LOD Block → Differential Delay Paths → Race Control → WTA Arbiter → Control: Asynchronous Controller (Click Elements)

- **Critical path:** The inference latency is determined by the longest delay path in the time-domain backend (maximum coarse delay kτ plus fine delay) plus the settling time of the WTA arbiter. In the digital domain, the Literal Generation must complete before the time-domain race begins.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Power vs. Precision: Longer delay lines improve dynamic range but increase leakage and area; LOD mitigates this but adds digital overhead. Throughput vs. Stability: High throughput requires fast pulse racing, but faster edges are more susceptible to noise and jitter in the time domain. Arbiter Topology: Tree-Based Arbiters (TBA) have lower latency (log m) vs Mesh-Like (m-1), but Mesh-Like may offer different fairness/stability characteristics.

- **Failure signatures:** Metastability Hang: The system stalls indefinitely; check Mutex grants in the WTA arbiter for simultaneous requests. PVT Drift Misclassification: The model works in simulation but fails on silicon; coarse delays are likely misaligned due to voltage droop or temperature shift. Handshake Deadlock: Pipeline moves once then stops; check the Click element phase registers or the four-to-two phase interface (TFF) conversion.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Unit Test the LOD: Input various integer weights into the LOD block and verify that the coarse (k) and fine (f) outputs correctly map to the expected physical delay on the test bench.
  2. Arbiter Stress Test: Fire multiple "Race" pulses simultaneously (or with minimal skew) at the WTA module to verify that metastability filters resolve the grant to a stable single winner within a defined time window.
  3. Full Inference Power Profiling: Run the Iris dataset on both the synchronous digital baseline and the proposed async time-domain implementation; measure energy per inference to validate the claimed ~247% efficiency gain.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the proposed hybrid architecture scale to Tsetlin Machine configurations with significantly larger clause counts (e.g., thousands) compared to the small dataset tested? The experimental verification utilizes the Iris dataset with only 12 clauses and 3 classes, despite the methodology emphasizing the need for Leading-Ones-Detector (LOD) compression to manage "exponential path delay growth" inherent in larger Coalesced TMs. While the LOD scheme theoretically mitigates exponential delay growth, the empirical data is limited to a trivial classification task, leaving the area and latency efficiency of the delay accumulation modules unproven for state-of-the-art model sizes.

### Open Question 2
What is the quantitative impact of process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations on the inference accuracy of the differential delay paths and Vernier TDCs? The paper identifies PVT robustness as a specific challenge for time-domain accumulation and claims that differential delay paths and compression help address it, but provides no corner-case simulation data or variability analysis. Time-domain computing relies on precise delay matching; without quantitative analysis across different PVT corners, the reliability of the "Winner-Takes-All" arbitration in non-ideal environments remains uncertain.

### Open Question 3
Can the proposed event-driven asynchronous logic be extended to support on-chip training, or is the architecture strictly limited to inference? The paper explicitly states the focus is on the "TM inference process" and describes the functional modules (literal generation, clause output) as fixed paths for feed-forward computation. The current architecture relies on delay accumulation and WTA arbitration for static class sums; the feedback loops required for updating Tsetlin Automata states (learning) introduce timing complexities that may conflict with the current event-driven handshake controllers.

## Limitations
- Performance heavily dependent on PVT stability with no explicit runtime calibration mechanism described
- LOD compression introduces quantization error that could affect classification accuracy for closely competing class scores
- Asynchronous design increases verification complexity and may face integration challenges in synchronous system-on-chip environments

## Confidence

- Energy efficiency claims (247% improvement): **Medium** - Based on post-implementation results but limited to specific datasets and hardware configurations
- Throughput improvements (82% gain): **Medium** - Validated for CoTM but may vary with clause complexity and class count
- Delay accumulation stability: **Low-Medium** - Theoretical mechanism well-explained but PVT sensitivity not fully characterized

## Next Checks

1. **PVT Sensitivity Analysis**: Characterize classification accuracy across temperature (0-85°C) and voltage (0.9V-1.1V) variations to determine required calibration overhead

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Validate energy/throughput claims on larger, more complex datasets (MNIST/CIFAR-10) beyond the Iris dataset to assess scalability limits

3. **Manufacturing Test Strategy**: Develop test patterns to detect delay line defects and arbiter metastability failures, quantifying yield impact and potential redundancy requirements
