# A Multiagent Path Search Algorithm for Large-Scale Coalition Structure Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.10226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10226
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SALDAE achieves 28% higher solution quality than CSG-UCT and 15% higher than PICS on small problems, with superior performance on large-scale coalition structure generation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SALDAE, a scalable algorithm for coalition structure generation that draws inspiration from multiagent pathfinding. SALDAE builds a search graph incrementally, using multiple search agents to explore the space of coalition structures through splitting and merging operations. The algorithm employs various strategies including bridging paths between solutions, memory management with three lists (OPEN, SUBSTITUTE, RESERVE), and conflict resolution among search agents. SALDAE is anytime and can handle large-scale problems with hundreds or thousands of agents.

Empirical evaluation shows SALDAE outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. On small problems (4-20 agents), SALDAE achieves up to 28% higher solution quality than CSG-UCT and 15% higher than PICS across nine value distributions, finding optimal solutions 65.86% of the time compared to 17.36% for PICS and 6.48% for CSG-UCT. On large-scale problems (30-2000 agents), SALDAE achieves superior gain rates on most distributions including Gamma, Exponential, Normal, Disaster Response, and Electric Vehicles Allocation, demonstrating its effectiveness for practical applications requiring rapid coalition formation.

## Method Summary
SALDAE operates on a coalition structure graph where nodes represent partitions of agents into disjoint coalitions, with edges connecting structures via single split or merge operations. The algorithm uses multiple search agents that traverse this graph, maintaining three memory lists: OPEN (high-value nodes), SUBSTITUTE (bridging path nodes), and RESERVE (lower-value nodes). When agents discover better solutions, SALDAE constructs bridging paths between consecutive incumbents using three strategies: SPLIT-THEN-MERGE, MERGE-THEN-SPLIT, or APPROACH-THEN-SWAP. Conflict resolution ensures each node is explored by at most one agent, while memory management maintains search diversity and efficiency.

## Key Results
- SALDAE achieves 28% higher solution quality than CSG-UCT and 15% higher than PICS on small problems (4-20 agents)
- On large-scale problems (30-2000 agents), SALDAE achieves superior gain rates on Gamma, Exponential, Normal, Disaster Response, and Electric Vehicles Allocation distributions
- SALDAE finds optimal solutions 65.86% of the time on small problems compared to 17.36% for PICS and 6.48% for CSG-UCT

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Split-Merge Graph Traversal with Value-Greedy Selection
- Claim: A best-first search over coalition structures, where child nodes are generated via coalition splits/merges and selected by descending coalition-structure value, progressively improves solution quality.
- Mechanism: The search graph is constructed iteratively. Each node represents a coalition structure; edges correspond to either (i) splitting one coalition into two disjoint subsets or (ii) merging two coalitions into their union. The algorithm selects the highest-valued child as the next start node (`SN = arg max_{CS in Child} V(CS)`), evaluates it against the incumbent, and repeats. This performs a form of best-first search in the coalition-structure graph originally defined by Sandholm et al. (1999).
- Core assumption: The value function exhibits sufficient local coherence—high-valued coalition structures tend to have high-valued neighbors reachable by single splits or merges—so greedy expansion is not purely random.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "operates on a graph of coalition structures... utilizes a variety of heuristics and strategies to perform the search and guide it"
  - [Page 3, Section 4]: "Each parent node in the search graph is connected to a number of child nodes that can be generated by either splitting a coalition or joining two coalitions... Step 2: Selection... SN = arg max_{CS in Child} V(CS)"
  - [corpus]: Related CSG methods (e.g., near-optimal DP/MILP approaches in "Near-Optimal Coalition Structures in Polynomial Time") also rely on structured search over the partition space; however, they do not use MAPF-inspired path-finding heuristics, limiting direct causal transfer claims.
- Break condition: If the value landscape is adversarially flat or deceptive (e.g., high-valued structures isolated with low-valued neighbors), greedy selection offers no systematic advantage over random sampling.

### Mechanism 2: Bridging Paths Between Incumbents to Escape Local Basins
- Claim: When a new best solution is discovered, constructing explicit transition paths between the prior incumbent and the new incumbent (via controlled sequences of splits, merges, or swaps) exposes intermediate structures that can yield further improvements.
- Mechanism: Upon detecting a better solution, SALDAE invokes `ExecutePathStrategy(CS*, N)` (Algorithm 1, Page 6). Three strategies are provided: (i) SPLIT-THEN-MERGE—ascend to the top node (all singletons) then descend; (ii) MERGE-THEN-SPLIT—descend to the bottom node (grand coalition) then ascend; (iii) APPROACH-THEN-SWAP—level-match then perform agent swaps. All intermediate structures along the path are evaluated. Theorem 2 (Page 12) guarantees the first two strategies yield paths of size at most n−1.
- Core assumption: High-valued solutions are correlated in their coalition compositions; paths between them traverse regions of elevated average quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 4, Section 4.1]: "each time a better solution is found, the algorithm creates a path of nodes between the previous best solution S_l and the new one S_n... explore the possibility of finding even better solutions along the path"
  - [Page 8, Section 6.2]: "the bridging path strategies allow it to search other areas of the solution space and find better solutions quicker"
  - [corpus]: Evidence is limited; related papers on CSG do not report analogous bridging-path mechanisms. Causal claims remain empirically grounded only in this paper's benchmarks.
- Break condition: If incumbents share no coalition overlap and the value function is uncorrelated across the path, intermediate nodes provide no signal; path exploration becomes pure overhead.

### Mechanism 3: Multiagent Conflict Resolution and Memory Partitioning for Coverage and Efficiency
- Claim: Parallel search agents with conflict-avoidance policies and tiered memory lists (OPEN/SUBSTITUTE/RESERVE) reduce redundant exploration and maintain search diversity, improving solution discovery rates.
- Mechanism: Each agent maintains its own `OPEN_i`, `RESERVE_i`, and `SUBSTITUTE_i` lists. Conflicts occur when multiple agents consider the same coalition structure; resolution is via either bypassing (first-come-first-served) or management (priority by scheduled expansion order). Nodes below threshold `ω × V(CS+)` are demoted to RESERVE; if OPEN empties, SUBSTITUTE or RESERVE are promoted. Properties P1 and P2 (Page 11) state: each node is stored/expanded by at most one agent.
- Core assumption: The overhead of conflict detection and list management is negligible relative to the gain from avoided duplicate work and broader coverage.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Page 6, Section 4.3]: "We say that two agents have a conflict iff they consider the same coalition structure for evaluation... si resolves the conflict by selecting the search agent that will keep the generated child node"
  - [Page 11, Property 1]: "P1 Limited redundancy in storage: Each node is stored by at most one search agent. P2 No redundancy in computation: Each node is expanded by one search agent."
  - [corpus]: Multiagent coordination for CSG is uncommon; the corpus does not provide corroborating or refuting evidence for this mechanism's causal role.
- Break condition: If coordination overhead dominates (e.g., extremely small problems, high communication latency), single-agent search may outperform multiagent variants.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Coalition Structure Generation (CSG)
  - Why needed here: SALDAE operates on a search graph whose nodes are coalition structures—partitions of agents into disjoint coalitions maximizing total value. Understanding this combinatorial space is prerequisite to interpreting the algorithm's moves (splits/merges) and objective.
  - Quick check question: Given agents A={a1,a2,a3} and value function v, enumerate all coalition structures and compute their values. Which structure maximizes sum v(C)?

- Concept: Coalition Structure Graph (Sandholm et al., 1999)
  - Why needed here: SALDAE's search space is explicitly this graph: nodes are coalition structures; edges connect structures at adjacent levels via one split or merge. The level of a node equals its number of coalitions.
  - Quick check question: For n=4, draw the coalition structure graph (levels 1 to 4). How many edges connect the level-2 node {{a1,a2},{a3,a4}} to its neighbors?

- Concept: Multiagent Path Finding (MAPF) and Conflict-Based Search (CBS)
  - Why needed here: SALDAE draws inspiration from MAPF, particularly the notion of multiple agents navigating a graph with conflict resolution. The adaptation is non-trivial: in CSG, "paths" are exploration trajectories, and "conflicts" are duplicate node considerations, not spatial collisions.
  - Quick check question: In standard MAPF, what constitutes a conflict? How does SALDAE's definition of conflict differ, and why does this matter for algorithm design?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Search Graph Builder: Incrementally constructs nodes/edges via split and merge operations from a start node (bottom, top, or random)
  - Node Selector: Maintains descending-value sorted OPEN list; pops highest-valued node for expansion
  - Child Generator: Produces candidate children by all legal splits and merges from the current node
  - Path Bridger: On incumbent improvement, constructs and evaluates intermediate paths using one of three strategies
  - Memory Manager: Partitions nodes into OPEN (above threshold), RESERVE (below threshold), SUBSTITUTE (path-visited nodes)
  - Multiagent Coordinator: Assigns start nodes to agents, detects/resolves conflicts, enforces P1/P2 properties

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize root node and global incumbent
  2. Distribute start nodes to m agents (bottom, top, random)
  3. Loop per agent: pop from OPEN → generate children → detect conflicts → distribute to OPEN/RESERVE → evaluate → if improved, bridge path and update incumbent → if OPEN empty, swap in SUBSTITUTE or RESERVE
  4. Return best incumbent on termination

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of search agents: More agents increase coverage but raise coordination overhead and memory fragmentation
  - Threshold ω: Higher values keep OPEN focused on high-quality regions but risk premature emptiness and increased RESERVE fallbacks
  - Child nodes per expansion (θ): Larger θ increases branching but raises per-iteration cost; smaller θ may miss promising descendants
  - Bridging strategy choice: SPLIT-THEN-MERGE and MERGE-THEN-SPLIT guarantee bounded paths (≤ n−1) but may traverse unpromising extremes; APPROACH-THEN-SWAP stays near the source level but can yield longer paths

- Failure signatures:
  - OPEN repeatedly empties with no incumbent improvement → threshold ω too aggressive or value distribution unfavorable
  - Excessive conflicts detected → too many agents targeting overlapping regions; consider fewer agents or diversified start nodes
  - Memory growth unbounded → child generation not throttled by θ; RESERVE not being pruned
  - Solution quality plateaus early → bridging paths not generating useful intermediates; consider strategy switch or parameter sweep

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Single-agent baseline on small n (4–10): Run SALDAE with m=1, ω=0.995, θ=2n, bottom-node start. Compare solution quality vs. ODP-IP optimal to validate correctness of split/merge logic and value computation
  2. Bridging-strategy ablation on medium n (20–50): For each strategy (SPLIT-THEN-MERGE, MERGE-THEN-SPLIT, APPROACH-THEN-SWAP, combined), measure iterations-to-incumbent-improvement and final quality on 50 instances per distribution. Identify which strategy dominates which distribution
  3. Multiagent scaling on large n (200–1000): Fix time budget (e.g., 60s), vary m ∈ {1, 5, 10, 20}, measure gain rate and conflict frequency. Determine coordination overhead regime and optimal agent count for each scale

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can meaningful goal nodes be defined for search agents in the CSG context beyond the single optimal solution node?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "Another potential avenue for applying MAPF in CSG involves using a different approach where search agents not only have access to start nodes, as in the current version, but also to goal nodes. Currently, we lack a clear definition of goal nodes beyond the one representing the optimal solution."
- Why unresolved: The optimal solution's position in the graph is unknown a priori, and defining intermediate goal nodes requires understanding structure in the coalition space that has not been characterized.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal definition of goal node criteria (e.g., based on coalition structure properties or value bounds) that demonstrably improves search efficiency when provided to agents.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can established MAPF algorithms like Conflict-Based Search (CBS) be adapted to solve CSG, and what theoretical guarantees would transfer?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "Future work could explore the adaptation and application of other MAPF algorithms to address this problem." The paper draws inspiration from MAPF but uses custom heuristics rather than adapting existing complete MAPF algorithms.
- Why unresolved: CBS guarantees optimality in standard MAPF, but CSG's state space and cost structure differ fundamentally; the conflict resolution mechanisms may not directly transfer.
- What evidence would resolve it: An adapted CBS variant for CSG with proven completeness or bounded suboptimality properties.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What theoretical approximation bounds can be established for SALDAE's solution quality given limited computation time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states "for large-scale problems, it is intractable to guarantee to find the optimal solution in a limited run time" and provides no formal approximation guarantees despite strong empirical results.
- Why unresolved: SALDAE combines multiple heuristics (bridging paths, memory management, multiagent search) whose theoretical properties are difficult to analyze jointly.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof establishing that SALDAE achieves solution quality within a provable factor of optimal under specific conditions (e.g., time bounds, graph properties).

### Open Question 4
- Question: How should the hyperparameters (θ, ω, number of search agents) be set optimally relative to problem characteristics like value distribution and agent count?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The appendix describes testing various combinations, selecting θ=2n, ω=99.5%, and 10 search agents based on empirical performance, but provides no theoretical justification for these choices.
- Why unresolved: Hyperparameter sensitivity varies across the nine tested distributions, suggesting optimal settings may be distribution-dependent.
- What evidence would resolve it: A principled framework relating hyperparameters to measurable problem properties (e.g., value variance, agent count) with empirical validation across diverse benchmarks.

## Limitations

- The paper's multiagent coordination claims rely heavily on simulation-based evidence, with limited theoretical guarantees beyond basic memory partitioning properties (P1/P2)
- Critical parameters (Na for child sampling, exact instance generation for Disaster Response/EV Allocation) remain underspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- Empirical validation is restricted to generated benchmark instances rather than real-world coalition formation scenarios

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Split-Merge Traversal): High confidence - core algorithmic structure is well-defined and logically sound
- Mechanism 2 (Bridging Paths): Medium confidence - theoretically bounded but empirical benefit varies by distribution
- Mechanism 3 (Multiagent Coordination): Medium confidence - properties proven but overhead-benefit tradeoff not systematically quantified

## Next Checks

1. Parameter sensitivity analysis: Systematically vary Na, ω, and m to identify robustness boundaries and identify when multiagent overhead outweighs benefits
2. Real-world validation: Apply SALDAE to established coalition formation benchmarks (e.g., international relations conflict resolution) to test transferability beyond synthetic distributions
3. Comparative overhead measurement: Instrument multiagent vs. single-agent variants to quantify conflict resolution costs and memory management overhead across different problem scales
