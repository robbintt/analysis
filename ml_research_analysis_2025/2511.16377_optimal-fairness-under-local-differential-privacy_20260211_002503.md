# Optimal Fairness under Local Differential Privacy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16377
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16377
- Reference count: 40
- This paper develops optimal LDP mechanisms to minimize data unfairness while preserving utility for classification tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of reducing data unfairness in classification tasks while preserving privacy through Local Differential Privacy (LDP). The authors develop optimal LDP mechanisms that minimize data unfairness (the statistical dependence between sensitive attributes and labels) while maintaining classification utility. For binary sensitive attributes, they derive a closed-form optimal solution, while for multi-valued attributes they formulate a tractable optimization problem. Theoretically, they prove that reducing data unfairness leads to lower classification unfairness for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers. Empirically, their optimal mechanism consistently outperforms existing LDP approaches in reducing unfairness across diverse datasets while maintaining accuracy close to non-private models.

## Method Summary
The method involves designing LDP mechanisms specifically optimized for fairness rather than just privacy. For binary sensitive attributes, the authors derive closed-form optimal perturbation parameters based on group statistics. For multi-valued attributes, they formulate a min-max linear fractional program to find the optimal perturbation matrix, solvable via branch-and-bound methods. The mechanism perturbs the sensitive attribute A to Z while preserving utility constraints. Classifiers (LightGBM or logistic regression) are then trained on the perturbed data. The approach requires accurate estimation of group marginals and conditional label probabilities from the training data to parameterize the optimal mechanism.

## Key Results
- Optimal LDP mechanism consistently outperforms standard RR and Subset Selection in reducing unfairness across multiple fairness metrics
- For binary attributes, asymmetric perturbation (p=1/2, q=(1-e^(-ε))/2) achieves better fairness-utility trade-offs than symmetric RR
- Theoretically proven that reducing data unfairness implies lower classification unfairness for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers
- Maintains accuracy close to non-private models while significantly improving fairness metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Applying LDP to sensitive attributes reduces data unfairness, which propagates to reduced classification unfairness for DA-optimal classifiers.
- **Mechanism:** LDP mechanisms perturb sensitive attribute A into Z, compressing conditional label probabilities toward the marginal. This reduces data unfairness metric Δ', which theoretically forces down classification unfairness for DA-optimal classifiers.
- **Core assumption:** The downstream classifier is DA-optimal, and training distribution reflects true underlying bias.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section IV-A, Lemma 1 proves GRR reduces data unfairness; Section IV-D, Theorem 3 establishes link for DA-optimal classifiers.
- **Break condition:** If downstream model is not DA-optimal, the link between data and classification unfairness may decouple.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Standard symmetric RR is suboptimal for fairness; asymmetric mechanism derived from data statistics yields superior trade-offs.
- **Mechanism:** Optimal mechanism perturbs one group heavily (probability 1/2) while preserving the other ((1-e^(-ε))/2), depending on which group has lower base rate. This asymmetry minimizes unfairness ratio more efficiently.
- **Core assumption:** Base rates and group marginals are known to select correct perturbation direction.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section IV-B, Theorem 2 provides closed-form solution; Section V-A, Figure 1 shows OPT outperforms RR on Adult dataset.
- **Break condition:** If distribution statistics are noisy or shift between train/test, optimal perturbation may increase unfairness.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Optimizing fairness for multi-valued attributes requires solving constrained optimization to find perturbation matrix Q.
- **Mechanism:** Constructs k×k row-stochastic matrix Q where q_ij represents probability of flipping attribute i to j, framed as min-max linear fractional program.
- **Core assumption:** Utility constraint ζ correctly balances trade-off, and min-max objective captures worst-case fairness violation.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section IV-C formulates optimization problem; Section V-A, Figures 3-5 demonstrate OPT outperforms GRR/SS for k>2 attributes.
- **Break condition:** Computational intractability for very high cardinality attributes (k > 50).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Data Unfairness (Δ, Δ') vs. Classification Unfairness (ΔSP)
  - **Why needed here:** The mechanism optimizes data-level bias as a proxy for model bias. Understanding this distinction is crucial for the theoretical contribution.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the paper prove that reducing data unfairness always reduces classification unfairness? (Answer: No, only for DA-optimal classifiers).

- **Concept:** Local Differential Privacy (LDP) vs. Central DP
  - **Why needed here:** The mechanism operates at user level without trusted curator, distinct from DP-SGD. This is why randomization is applied directly to input features.
  - **Quick check question:** In this architecture, who holds the raw sensitive attribute and who receives the perturbed version?

- **Concept:** Discrimination-Accuracy (DA) Optimality
  - **Why needed here:** This defines the theoretical "bridge" - a class of classifiers where accuracy and fairness are jointly optimized, allowing the guarantee that "fairer data = fairer model."
  - **Quick check question:** If a classifier achieves 90% accuracy but is very unfair, can it be DA-optimal?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input data -> Estimator (calculates p_a, p_{1|a}) -> Solver (Theorem 2 or Branch-and-Bound) -> Perturber (applies Q or (p,q)) -> Downstream classifier
- **Critical path:** Accurate estimation of statistics (p_a, p_{1|a}) from raw data before perturbation is essential. Wrong estimates lead to miscalibrated optimal perturbation.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - ε (Privacy) vs. Fairness: Lower ε allows higher randomization, improving fairness but dropping utility
  - ζ (Utility Constraint) vs. Fairness: Tight utility constraints restrict solution space, potentially preventing perfectly fair mechanism
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Utility Collapse: High ζ or low ε causes solver failure or trivial random mechanism, destroying accuracy
  - Fairness Inversion: Non-converged solver or infeasible problem causes default fallback (often GRR) that doesn't reduce unfairness
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement Theorem 2 for binary attribute on Adult dataset, compare against RR to verify asymmetric advantage
  2. Plot relationship between ε and Statistical Parity gap to confirm "stronger privacy = better fairness"
  3. Vary utility constraint ζ for multi-valued attribute and observe pareto frontier: does relaxing utility significantly improve fairness?

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can a closed-form optimal LDP mechanism be derived for multi-valued sensitive attributes, analogous to the binary case?
  - **Basis in paper:** Explicit - paper states non-binary case requires numerical optimization while binary has closed-form solution
  - **Why unresolved:** Optimization problem involves min-max linear fractional objective with multiple constraints that doesn't admit analytical solution for k > 2
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Derivation of closed-form expressions for optimal perturbation matrix Q, or proof of inherent complexity barriers

- **Open Question 2:** How does computational complexity scale with number of attribute values (k), and can efficient approximations be developed for large k?
  - **Basis in paper:** Inferred - experiments note increased computational cost for k=10 but no complexity analysis or approximation methods discussed
  - **Why unresolved:** Branch-and-bound approach may become prohibitive for large k (e.g., when privatizing combinations of multiple sensitive attributes)
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Formal complexity bounds as function of k, or development and evaluation of polynomial-time approximation algorithms with provable guarantees

- **Open Question 3:** Can the theoretical link between data unfairness and classification unfairness be extended beyond discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers?
  - **Basis in paper:** Explicit - paper states "Because classification unfairness depends on the specific classifier, it is difficult to make a universal claim"
  - **Why unresolved:** Real-world classifiers trained via standard empirical risk minimization don't generally satisfy DA-optimality conditions
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Theoretical results extending guarantee to broader hypothesis classes, or counterexamples demonstrating failure for non-DA-optimal classifiers

- **Open Question 4:** What is the asymptotic behavior of optimal mechanism as ε → ∞, and can it be modified to converge to non-private fair baseline?
  - **Basis in paper:** Explicit - paper notes OPT doesn't converge to non-private mechanism as ε → ∞ due to persistent perturbation
  - **Why unresolved:** Binary mechanism's structure creates persistent perturbation even without privacy constraints
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Analysis of limiting mechanism's properties, or modification of optimization objective to recover non-private fair classifier as ε → ∞

## Limitations

- Theoretical guarantee linking data and classification unfairness reduction is limited to DA-optimal classifiers, which may not encompass practical deep learning models
- Branch-and-bound optimization for multi-valued attributes requires significant computational resources with implementation details not fully specified
- Optimal mechanism relies on accurate estimation of group statistics, which may not hold in dynamic or non-stationary environments

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Empirical results showing optimal mechanism outperforms baselines; correctness of LDP mechanism design and closed-form solution for binary attributes
- **Medium Confidence:** Theoretical claims about DA-optimal classifiers; effectiveness of branch-and-bound approach for multi-valued attributes
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization to non-DA-optimal classifiers; performance with highly imbalanced or low-quality datasets

## Next Checks

1. **Classifier Generality Test:** Apply optimal LDP mechanism to a non-DA-optimal classifier (e.g., deep neural network with standard training) and verify whether data unfairness reduction still translates to classification fairness improvements

2. **Robustness to Estimation Error:** Intentionally inject noise into group statistics (p_a, p_{1|a}) used to parameterize optimal mechanism and measure degradation in both fairness and utility

3. **Computational Scalability Test:** Implement branch-and-bound optimization for dataset with k=20 attribute values and document computational time and memory requirements to assess practical feasibility
