# Data-driven Nonlinear Modal Analysis with Physics-constrained Deep Learning: Numerical and Experimental Study

## Quick Facts

- This paper presents a physics-constrained deep learning framework for data-driven nonlinear modal analysis that identifies nonlinear normal modes from response data without requiring governing equations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework that combines physics-informed deep learning with nonlinear modal analysis to identify nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) from response data. The approach embeds NNM constraints into a physics-informed deep autoencoder architecture, allowing it to capture nonlinear modal transformation functions directly from data without requiring knowledge of governing equations. The framework is validated through both numerical simulations and experimental studies on a nonlinear beam structure, demonstrating its ability to accurately decompose responses into isolated NNM modal coordinates and predict future states.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework integrates multiple loss terms into a deep autoencoder architecture to identify nonlinear modal transformation functions from response data. It combines reconstruction loss to ensure accurate data representation, independence loss between modal coordinates to isolate individual NNMs, dynamics loss in the latent space to capture temporal evolution, and prediction loss to ensure accurate future state forecasting. The physics constraints ensure that the learned modal coordinates satisfy the fundamental properties of NNMs, including energy dependence and orthogonality conditions. The architecture is trained on response data that excites the nonlinear modes across different energy levels, enabling it to capture the energy-dependent characteristics of nonlinear systems.

## Key Results
- Successfully isolates first and second NNMs across different energy levels in numerical simulations, capturing frequency increases and "twisted" configuration plots indicating nonlinearity
- Decomposes experimental free vibration measurements into isolated NNM modal coordinates while accurately reconstructing original responses
- Predicts future states of the nonlinear beam structure accurately, demonstrating capability to capture underlying nonlinear dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by embedding fundamental physical constraints of nonlinear normal modes directly into the deep learning architecture through carefully designed loss functions. By enforcing reconstruction accuracy, modal independence, and dynamics consistency in the latent space, the network learns transformation functions that map physical coordinates to nonlinear modal coordinates satisfying NNM properties. The physics-informed design ensures that the learned representation is not just data-driven but also physically meaningful, capturing the energy-dependent characteristics of nonlinear systems. The multiple loss terms work synergistically to ensure that the identified NNMs are both mathematically consistent and practically useful for prediction and analysis.

## Foundational Learning

**Nonlinear Normal Modes (NNMs)**: Special periodic solutions of nonlinear systems where all points reach maximum and minimum displacements simultaneously, with shapes that depend on energy levels. Needed because linear modal superposition fails for nonlinear systems. Quick check: Verify that identified modes show frequency-energy dependence and synchronized motion.

**Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**: Neural networks that incorporate physical laws and constraints directly into the loss function during training. Needed to ensure learned models respect fundamental physical principles. Quick check: Confirm that the learned dynamics satisfy energy conservation or other relevant physical laws.

**Autoencoder Architecture**: Neural network that learns compressed representations of data by encoding inputs to a lower-dimensional latent space and decoding back to original space. Needed to learn the nonlinear modal transformation functions. Quick check: Verify that reconstruction loss approaches zero and latent space captures essential dynamics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Response Data -> Encoder Network -> Latent Space (NNM Coordinates) -> Decoder Network -> Reconstructed Response, with Physics Constraints applied throughout training process

**Critical Path**: Encoder -> Latent Space Dynamics Loss -> Decoder -> Reconstruction Loss, where the latent space captures the NNM modal coordinates and the physics constraints ensure their validity

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity and data requirements for accuracy in capturing nonlinear dynamics, requiring sufficient training data across different energy levels but providing more accurate NNM identification than traditional methods

**Failure Signatures**: Poor separation of modal coordinates (high independence loss), inaccurate reconstruction of responses (high reconstruction loss), or failure to predict future states (high prediction loss) indicate issues with the learned modal transformation functions or insufficient training data

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test on a simple nonlinear oscillator with known analytical NNM solution to verify accuracy
2. Apply to a linear system to confirm framework reduces to linear modal analysis
3. Validate on synthetic data with controlled noise levels to assess robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational efficiency and scalability for high-dimensional systems with many degrees of freedom are not addressed
- Heavy reliance on having sufficient training data that adequately excites nonlinear modes across different energy levels
- Two-mode assumption in experimental validation may not generalize to complex structures with multiple interacting nonlinear modes
- Physical interpretability of learned latent space representation is not thoroughly examined

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on a system with more than two dominant nonlinear modes to evaluate scalability and mode interaction effects
2. Compare computational cost and data requirements against traditional nonlinear modal analysis methods on benchmark problems
3. Validate the framework on experimental data from a system with known analytical solution to quantitatively assess accuracy
