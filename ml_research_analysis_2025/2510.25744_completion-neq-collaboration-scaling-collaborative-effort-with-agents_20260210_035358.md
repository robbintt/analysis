# Completion $\neq$ Collaboration: Scaling Collaborative Effort with Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25744
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25745
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Current agent evaluation overemphasizes task completion; collaborative effort scaling reveals that agents often fail to effectively leverage user effort, with collaboration sometimes performing worse than fully autonomous baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that current agent evaluation is too focused on one-shot task completion and misses the iterative, collaborative nature of real-world problems. It introduces collaborative effort scaling, a framework that measures how well an agent's utility grows with increasing user involvement. The framework emphasizes two properties: interaction sustainability (value increases with user effort) and maximum usability (agents sustain engagement in complex tasks). The authors apply this framework to a simulated travel planning task and find that state-of-the-art agents often fail to effectively leverage user effort, with collaboration sometimes performing worse than fully autonomous baselines. Analysis shows agents get stuck in action loops and fail to develop coherent global plans for meaningful long-term interactions. The work demonstrates that current agents are mediocre collaborators and highlights the need for frameworks that evaluate the quality of human-agent interaction trajectories rather than just final outcomes.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize human-agent collaboration as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose a framework to evaluate collaborative effort scaling. They use a simulated travel planning task from the Collaborative-Gym environment where agents interact with a simulated user (GPT-4o) to create 5-day itineraries. The evaluation measures how utility (task performance) scales with user effort (rounds of interaction) for one-stage and two-stage planning agents. One-stage agents act immediately after each observation, while two-stage agents explicitly decide whether to collaborate, act, or wait before taking action. The framework tracks per-round performance scores and computes metrics including overall utility, refinement gain, and usability drop under a tolerance threshold τ.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art agents (GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B) often fail to effectively leverage user effort, with collaborative runs sometimes underperforming fully autonomous baselines
- Agents get stuck in action loops and fail to develop coherent global plans for meaningful long-term interactions
- Two-stage planning significantly improves performance for Claude-3.5-sonnet but has mixed effects on other models, highlighting the need for model-specific collaboration strategies
- There exists an optimal agent-to-user effort ratio for each model, with performance degrading when either agent or user contributions are disproportionately high or low

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Shifting evaluation from one-shot task completion to collaborative effort trajectories reveals agent limitations that outcome-based metrics miss.
- Mechanism: The collaborative effort scaling framework models human-agent interaction as a trajectory where user effort (e.g., rounds of interaction, cognitive load) maps to joint utility (e.g., task performance, knowledge gained). This exposes whether additional user effort yields diminishing returns—a failure mode invisible to final-output metrics.
- Core assumption: Agent effectiveness in underspecified, evolving tasks depends on the interaction process, not just the endpoint.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "assessed not only by the quality of their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort throughout the problem-solving process"
  - [section 4.2] "collaborating with the user does not lead to better performance compared to the fully autonomous baseline" for gpt-4o and llama-3.1-70b
  - [corpus] Collaborative Gym (Shao et al.) provides the simulation environment; corpus supports the broader need for human-agent collaboration frameworks but does not validate scaling dynamics directly.
- Break condition: If tasks are fully specified upfront with no goal evolution, collaborative effort scaling adds little diagnostic value over outcome metrics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-stage planning—explicitly deciding whether to collaborate, act, or wait before taking action—improves collaboration quality for some models by reducing reactive loops.
- Mechanism: A planning module reviews task state and chat history before each action, enabling strategic deferral (waiting for user input) rather than defaulting to immediate task actions. This reduces action loops and improves first-draft quality.
- Core assumption: Explicit planning creates better conditions for sustained, coherent multi-turn collaboration than reactive single-stage execution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] Two-stage planning "leads to a significant performance boost for claude-3.5-sonnet" with better first-update utility enabling stronger final performance
  - [section 4.2] For claude-4.0-sonnet, one-stage and two-stage achieve similar final utility, but two-stage has larger usability drop (-34.9% vs -20.6%)
  - [corpus] Mixed-Initiative Dialog work emphasizes flexible handoff between agents; supports but does not prove two-stage superiority.
- Break condition: For highly capable models, added planning overhead may not improve outcomes and can reduce efficiency (usability drop).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: An optimal agent-to-user effort ratio exists for each model; deviations in either direction degrade joint performance.
- Mechanism: Performance peaks when agent and user contributions are balanced. Low agent-to-user ratios indicate the agent underutilizes user input (prolonged interactions); high ratios indicate agent domination with insufficient user guidance.
- Core assumption: User effort is a resource to be efficiently converted into utility, not simply minimized.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "When either the user contributes disproportionately more effort (low agent-to-user ratio) or the agent dominates the interaction (high agent-to-user ratio), joint performance tends to degrade"
  - [section 4.3] Claude-4.0-sonnet maintains strong performance across broader effort ratios; gpt-4o and llama-3.1-70b degrade outside narrower optimal ranges
  - [corpus] Limited direct validation; related work on preference learning suggests adaptation matters, but effort-ratio optimization remains underexplored.
- Break condition: If user effort cannot be reliably measured (e.g., opaque cognitive load), the ratio proxy becomes noisy and less actionable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)
  - Why needed here: The paper formalizes human-agent collaboration as a POMDP to model sequential decisions under partial observability (user goals are underspecified and evolve).
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a collaboration process might be modeled as partially observable rather than fully observable?

- Concept: ReAct framework (Reasoning + Acting)
  - Why needed here: The baseline agent implementation uses ReAct-style interleaved reasoning and action traces; understanding this clarifies the comparison point for collaborative agents.
  - Quick check question: How does interleaving "Thought" and "Action" steps differ from a pure planning-then-execution pipeline?

- Concept: Scaling laws in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The paper draws analogy from compute-performance scaling to effort-utility scaling; the intuition is that returns should follow predictable curves.
  - Quick check question: What would a sublinear vs. superlinear utility-effort curve imply about collaboration quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - POMDP state tracker -> Round splitter -> Planning module (two-stage only) -> Action selector -> Utility estimator -> Effort estimator

- Critical path:
  1. Receive initial task description (initial request stage).
  2. Generate first substantial output (marks transition to refinement stage).
  3. Iterate through refinement rounds, alternating between user feedback and agent response.
  4. Terminate when task is marked complete or max rounds reached.
  5. Compute metrics: overall utility, refinement gain, usability drop.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - One-stage vs. two-stage planning: Two-stage adds coordination overhead but improves first-draft quality for less capable models; one-stage is more efficient but riskier for weaker models.
  - Token-based vs. cognitive-load-based effort proxies: Tokens are easy to measure but ignore difficulty; richer signals (timing, edit patterns) are harder to instrument.
  - Simulated vs. real users: Simulation enables controlled experiments but may miss nuanced human decision-making.

- Failure signatures:
  - Action loops: Agent repeats similar actions without progress (observed in gpt-4o, llama-3.1-70b collaborative runs).
  - Early termination: User disengages due to unproductive interactions (captured by usability drop metric).
  - Over-polished first outputs: Agent delivers complex outputs that are hard to digest, blocking meaningful user feedback (data analysis case study).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate travel-planning simulation using Collaborative-Gym with one-stage planning agents; measure utility vs. rounds curves for at least two different LLMs.
  2. Compare one-stage vs. two-stage planning on the same task; log usability drop and refinement gain to identify model-specific sweet spots.
  3. Introduce a richer effort proxy (e.g., combine round count with token entropy) and test whether it better predicts performance degradation than round count alone.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the trends of "interaction sustainability" and "usability drops" observed with LLM-simulated users hold when evaluated with real human participants in complex tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section states, "our experiments rely on simulated users... which may not fully reflect the nuanced decision-making processes, preferences, and interaction patterns from real users."
- Why unresolved: The authors relied entirely on GPT-4o to simulate user behavior and satisfaction ratings, which may not capture the frustration or cognitive load of actual humans.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the travel planning experiments with human subjects and comparing the resulting utility-effort trajectories against the simulated baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the finding that collaborative agents often underperform autonomous baselines generalize to other complex domains beyond travel planning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section notes the "experiment in a single domain... which may not capture the full spectrum of collaborative dynamics across different task types and complexity levels."
- Why unresolved: The observed "action loops" and failure to develop global plans might be specific to the logistical constraints of travel planning or the specific tools available in the Collaborative-Gym environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the collaborative effort scaling framework to distinct domains (e.g., software engineering or data analysis) and measuring the gap between collaborative and autonomous performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the utility-effort trajectory change when users possess private information or domain knowledge that the agent cannot access independently?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section suggests, "Future work should therefore explore richer simulation settings where users possess private information... better capturing the irreducible value of human involvement."
- Why unresolved: Current simulations likely use user "knowledge" derived from the same data available to the model, failing to test if agents can effectively extract unique, private constraints from a user.
- What evidence would resolve it: Designing tasks where the user holds specific constraints not available in the agent's context window and measuring the agent's ability to elicit this information to improve utility.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the two-stage planning strategies optimized for human-AI collaboration directly improve performance in agent-agent teams?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section states, "designing for collaboration may be beneficial not only for human-AI collaboration but also potentially for agent-agent collaboration."
- Why unresolved: While the authors suggest the transferability of these interaction patterns, they only tested human-proxy to agent interactions, leaving inter-agent dynamics unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing multi-agent systems using the two-stage planning prompt and evaluating task success rates compared to standard single-stage or fully autonomous agent baselines.

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies on simulated users rather than real human participants, which may not capture the full complexity of human decision-making and interaction patterns.
- The travel planning domain represents a specific class of structured tasks, and results may not generalize to more open-ended or creative domains.
- The effort proxies used (round count, token volume) are coarse and may not accurately reflect true cognitive load or engagement.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core argument that one-shot task completion metrics are insufficient for evaluating collaborative agents is well-supported by the observed failure modes (action loops, usability drops, underperformance vs. autonomous baselines).
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed two-stage planning improvement and effort ratio insights are plausible but model-specific; results for Claude-3.5-sonnet may not hold for other models or domains.
- **Medium confidence**: The framework's formalism (POMDP-based) is sound, but its practical utility depends heavily on the quality of the effort and utility estimators, which are simplified here.

## Next Checks
1. **Real-user pilot**: Deploy the collaborative effort scaling framework with 10–20 real human users on the same travel planning task. Compare simulated vs. real effort trajectories, usability drops, and refinement gains to assess simulation fidelity.

2. **Cross-domain replication**: Apply the framework to a non-travel domain (e.g., data analysis, creative writing) with the same set of models. Test whether the effort-utility curves and failure modes (action loops, usability drops) replicate or shift.

3. **Effort proxy validation**: Replace round count with a richer effort proxy (e.g., combining token volume, edit distance, and timing data). Re-run the main experiments and test whether the new proxy better predicts performance degradation and usability drop.
