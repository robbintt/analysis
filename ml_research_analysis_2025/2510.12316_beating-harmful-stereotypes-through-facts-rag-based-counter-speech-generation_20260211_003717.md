# Beating Harmful Stereotypes Through Facts: RAG-based Counter-speech Generation

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12316

- This paper introduces a knowledge-grounded framework for automatic counter-speech generation using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing consistent improvements across all hate speech target groups compared to standard LLM baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a knowledge-grounded framework for automatic counter-speech generation that addresses the challenge of producing trustworthy responses to hate speech. The approach combines advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines with authoritative institutional sources to ensure factual grounding. By leveraging a large knowledge base from the UN, EU, and FRA, the system generates concise, two-sentence counter-speeches tailored for social media platforms. Experiments on the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset demonstrate that the RAG-based approach outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive methods across automatic, LLM-based, and human evaluations, with GPT-4o-mini + BGE-M3 achieving the best results.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a three-stage RAG pipeline: (1) retrieval of relevant paragraphs from a knowledge base containing 32,792 documents from UN Digital Library, EUR-Lex, and FRA using BGE-M3, SBERT, or BM25; (2) summarization of retrieved paragraphs using an LLM (max 150 tokens); and (3) generation of two-sentence counter-speech based on the summaries using models like GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.1-8B, Command-R-7B, or Mistral-7B-Instruct. The knowledge base is segmented into paragraphs and embedded for semantic similarity search, with top-3 paragraphs retrieved per hate speech instance. The approach emphasizes factual grounding through institutional sources while maintaining social media-appropriate brevity.

## Key Results
- RAG-based approach outperforms standard LLM baselines across all evaluation metrics including automatic (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), LLM-based (JudgeLM), and human evaluations
- GPT-4o-mini + BGE-M3 achieves the best performance with 4,223 JudgeLM wins vs. 3,524 for BM25 in pairwise comparisons
- Human judges significantly preferred RAG-generated responses for relevance, factuality, cogency, and effectiveness across all eight hate speech target groups
- BGE-M3 semantic retrieval consistently outperforms lexical methods (BM25) and sentence transformers (SBERT)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Grounding counter-speech in authoritative institutional sources improves factuality and trustworthiness compared to pure LLM generation. The RAG pipeline retrieves evidence from a curated knowledge base (UN Digital Library, EUR-Lex, FRA) containing 32,792 official documents. Retrieved paragraphs are summarized and injected as context into the generation prompt, constraining the LLM to produce factually grounded responses rather than hallucinated or generic outputs.

### Mechanism 2
Dense semantic retrieval (BGE-M3) outperforms lexical matching (BM25) for counter-speech evidence retrieval because hate speech often uses implicit or coded language. BGE-M3 encodes queries and passages into dense embeddings optimized for semantic similarity, capturing relatedness even without exact term overlap. The top-3 retrieved paragraphs are then summarized and passed to the generator.

### Mechanism 3
Constraining outputs to two sentences improves real-world deployability and user engagement without sacrificing argumentative quality. The generation prompt enforces a maximum two-sentence length, aligning with social media communicative norms. This forces the model to prioritize the most salient facts and arguments rather than producing verbose responses that reduce engagement.

## Foundational Learning

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Understanding how external knowledge is integrated into LLM generation is essential for diagnosing failures and improving the pipeline. *Quick check*: Can you explain why RAG outputs might differ from pure LLM generation on the same hate speech input?

- **Sparse vs. Dense Retrieval**: The paper compares BM25 (sparse, lexical) with SBERT/BGE-M3 (dense, semantic)—knowing the tradeoffs helps select the right retriever for different hate speech types. *Quick check*: What type of hate speech might BM25 handle better than BGE-M3, and vice versa?

- **LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation**: Traditional metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) correlate poorly with human judgments for open-ended generation. JudgeLM provides multi-dimensional assessment (factuality, relevance, specificity) critical for counter-speech quality. *Quick check*: Why might BERTScore remain high (≈0.85) even when generated counter-speech differs substantially from reference text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Knowledge Base (32,792 documents) -> Paragraph Segmentation -> BGE-M3 Embedding -> FAISS Index -> Retrieval (top-3 paragraphs) -> Summarization -> Generation (2 sentences) -> Evaluation
- **Critical path**: KB construction -> paragraph embedding -> retrieval (BGE-M3) -> summarization -> generation -> evaluation (JudgeLM + human)
- **Design tradeoffs**: k=3 paragraphs balances context richness vs. LLM context window limits; two-sentence constraint improves social media suitability but may sacrifice nuance; paragraph-level retrieval improves efficiency but may fragment contextual information; institutional sources only reduce misinformation risk but may limit coverage
- **Failure signatures**: Low relevance scores indicate retrieval failures; high repetition rate without RAG shows generic responses; slightly lower safety scores with RAG suggest noisy retrieval; per-target performance variance reveals coverage gaps
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Retriever ablation: compare BM25, SBERT, and BGE-M3 on JudgeLM scores; 2) k-value sensitivity: test k=1, 3, 5 retrieval impact on factuality; 3) Length constraint analysis: compare 1-sentence, 2-sentence, and 3-sentence outputs on nuance vs. deployability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does varying the number of retrieved paragraphs (top-k) impact the balance between factual richness and conciseness in generated counter-speech? The authors note that while k=3 maintains conciseness, varying k could influence factual richness and diversity. This remains unexplored as the study fixed k=3 for social media brevity.

### Open Question 2
To what extent does the enforced two-sentence brevity constraint limit the model's ability to convey emotional depth or nuanced arguments? The paper acknowledges that the two-sentence limit can reduce nuance and emotional depth, but didn't compare against longer generation styles to quantify this loss.

### Open Question 3
How can the system maintain high performance for hate speech targets that are underrepresented in static, institutional knowledge bases? The authors acknowledge that gaps in external sources can propagate into responses, particularly for emerging or culturally specific hate topics, but the current KB may lag behind rapidly evolving online hate speech.

## Limitations
- KB coverage limitations for emerging hate speech topics and culturally specific narratives, with performance variance across target groups (e.g., JEWS at 50% vs Baseline 1)
- Two-sentence constraint may oversimplify complex counter-narratives and reduce persuasive depth for nuanced hate speech instances
- Reliance on Western institutional sources (UN, EU) may limit cultural adaptability and effectiveness in non-Western contexts

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: RAG framework's superior factuality and trustworthiness compared to pure LLM generation
- **Medium confidence**: Semantic retrieval (BGE-M3) consistently outperforming lexical methods across all hate speech types
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability beyond institutional hate speech contexts due to curated KB from specific sources

## Next Checks

1. **Coverage validation**: Test the framework on hate speech topics outside institutional scope to measure KB coverage limitations
2. **Length sensitivity analysis**: Generate counter-speeches with 1, 2, and 3 sentence constraints; measure effectiveness differences across simple vs. complex hate speech instances
3. **Retrieval failure diagnostics**: Systematically examine cases where RAG performs worse than pure LLM generation to identify specific KB gaps or retrieval failures per target group
