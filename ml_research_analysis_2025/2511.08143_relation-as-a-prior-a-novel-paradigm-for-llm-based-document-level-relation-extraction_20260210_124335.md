# Relation as a Prior: A Novel Paradigm for LLM-based Document-level Relation Extraction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.08143
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08143
- **Reference count:** 32
- **Primary result:** RelPrior achieves SOTA LLM performance with F1 scores up to 48.34% on DocRED test set

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of document-level relation extraction (DocRE) using large language models (LLMs). The authors identify two key issues: unrelated entity pairs introducing noise and strict predefined relation labels causing misjudgments. To tackle these, they propose a novel "Relation as a Prior" (RelPrior) paradigm that consists of two modules: Entity Pairs Filtering and Relation Matching. The EPF module filters out irrelevant entity pairs through binary classification, while the RM module uses predefined relations to match entities for triple extraction, avoiding arbitrary relation predictions. Experiments on DocRED and RE-DocRED datasets demonstrate that RelPrior achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing LLM-based methods with F1 scores of up to 48.34% on DocRED test set.

## Method Summary
RelPrior consists of two fine-tuned LLM modules. The Entity Pairs Filtering (EPF) module performs binary classification to determine if any relation exists between entity pairs, filtering out unrelated pairs before specific relation classification. The Relation Matching (RM) module uses predefined relation labels as fixed queries to extract subject and object entities, avoiding open-vocabulary relation generation. The final output fuses results from both modules, prioritizing EPF predictions while supplementing with RM findings to recover missed facts. The method is trained using LLaMA3-8B with LLaMA-Factory, fine-tuning on specially constructed datasets from DocRED.

## Key Results
- Achieves SOTA performance among LLM-based methods with 48.34% F1 on DocRED test set
- Outperforms zero-shot LLM approaches by significant margins (up to 14.67% F1 improvement)
- Demonstrates effectiveness of binary relation filtering, improving precision over direct classification approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Converting relation extraction into a preliminary binary classification task appears to reduce noise from unrelated entity pairs, improving precision.
- **Mechanism:** The Entity Pairs Filtering (EPF) module fine-tunes an LLM to discriminate whether *any* semantic relation exists between two entities (outputting 1 or 0). By pruning the combinatorial space of entity pairs before specific relation classification, the model focuses attention on a smaller, relevant subset.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: The LLM can robustly distinguish "relatedness" in a binary sense better than it can simultaneously identify the specific relation type amidst noise.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs."
  - [section 3.1]: "This processing method can not only enhance the model's understanding of the task objective, but also improve the model's focus on the relation presence or absence judgment task."
  - [corpus]: Neighbor paper "CDER" supports the general strategy of identifying relevant evidence/context to improve DocRE, though it uses evidence retrieval rather than binary filtering.
- **Break condition:** If the EPF module has low recall (aggressively filtering out actually related pairs), the downstream Relation Matching module will lack the necessary candidates to recover performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Inverting the generation task from "predict relation label" to "match entities to a known relation" likely mitigates errors caused by strict or syntactic label mismatches.
- **Mechanism:** The Relation Matching (RM) module uses predefined relation labels as fixed queries (priors) to prompt the LLM to extract subject and object entities. This constrains the output space to valid entities rather than open-vocabulary relation strings, avoiding penalties for semantically correct but syntactically different labels (e.g., predicting "country" when the label is "country of citizenship").
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: The LLM understands the semantic definition of the predefined relation labels well enough to identify valid subjects and objects without generating the label string itself.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling."
  - [section 3.2]: "...avoiding the arbitrary generation issues of LLM."
  - [corpus]: Corpus evidence for this specific "inverse matching" mechanism is limited in neighbors; most related works (e.g., "DocIE") focus on standard extraction or synthetic data.
- **Break condition:** If the LLM does not understand the specific definition of a relation label during the matching step, it will produce irrelevant entity pairs, lowering precision.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A fusion strategy combining binary-filtered pairs and relation-guided entity inference improves recall over single-stage extraction.
- **Mechanism:** The architecture merges results from the EPF module (which is high-precision but potentially low-recall) with results from the RM module (which infers pairs from the relation side). It prioritizes EPF results but supplements them with RM findings to cover facts missed by the initial strict filtering.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: There is a non-overlapping set of valid triples retrievable by relation-guided entity matching that are missed by direct entity-pair filtering.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.5 Answer 2]: "Although the EPF module significantly improves extraction accuracy, it may miss many valid triples... RM module predicts potential head-tail entity pairs... generating an additional 5,213 triples."
  - [section 3.2]: "During the fusion process, the triples from the entity pairs filtering module are prioritized... while high-quality supplementary triples from the relation matching module are incorporated."
  - [corpus]: Related work "Multi-Relation Extraction" notes shifting contexts, supporting the need for multiple views, but this specific fusion logic is unique to this architecture.
- **Break condition:** If the RM module generates excessive spurious entity pairs for a relation, the final fusion step may be overwhelmed by false positives, diluting the precision gained by EPF.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core task. Unlike sentence-level RE, DocRE requires reasoning across multiple sentences to find relations between entities that may never appear in the same sentence.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why "Will Weng" and "New York Times" might be flagged as related in a sentence-level model but unrelated in a document-level context (or vice versa)?

- **Concept: LLM Hallucination in Extraction**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly targets hallucination caused by unrelated entity pairs. Understanding that LLMs tend to force relations onto unrelated pairs is critical to grasping the motivation for the EPF module.
  - **Quick check question:** If you feed an LLM a list of random noun pairs and ask for relations, what typically happens?

- **Concept: Binary vs. Multi-class Classification**
  - **Why needed here:** The EPF module transforms the complex multi-class problem (is this A, B, or C?) into a simpler binary problem (is this related: yes/no?).
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a model perform better on "Is there a relation?" compared to "Which of the 96 relations is this?"

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1.  **Input:** Document + Entity Set + Relation Set.
  2.  **Module 1 (EPF):** Fine-tuned LLM (Binary). Input: Entity pairs. Output: Filtered list of related entity pairs (and preliminary triples).
  3.  **Module 2 (RM):** LLM Inference (Matching). Input: Specific Relations. Output: Head/Entity sets per relation.
  4.  **Fusion:** Merges Module 1 and Module 2 outputs, prioritizing Module 1 and filtering invalid triples.

- **Critical path:** The prompt engineering for the **EPF module**. If the binary discrimination prompt (Section 3.1) is not precise, the filtering will either be too aggressive (missing data) or too loose (failing to reduce noise).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Complexity vs. Accuracy:** Introducing a two-stage pipeline (EPF + RM + Fusion) increases inference latency and code complexity compared to a single-prompt zero-shot approach, but significantly boosts F1 scores.
  - **Recall vs. Precision:** EPF favors precision; RM attempts to recover recall. The threshold for filtering in EPF is a critical hyperparameter.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Low F1, High Ign F1:** Model may be memorizing training triples rather than generalizing.
  - **High Triple Count, Low F1:** RM module is likely generating spurious relations; check the fusion logic or RM prompt constraints.
  - **Drastic Drop in Dev Performance:** Check if the EPF module is filtering out >90% of pairs (over-filtering).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1.  **Sanity Check (EPF):** Run the EPF module on the dev set. Report the "Relatedness Accuracy"—how often does it correctly identify if a pair has *any* relation?
  2.  **Ablation (w/o RM):** Run the pipeline using *only* the EPF module's direct triple predictions. Compare F1 against the full pipeline to measure the contribution of the Relation Matching module.
  3.  **Baseline Comparison:** Compare the full RelPrior against a "Vanilla" LLaMA3-8B fine-tuned on the full multi-class task (no filtering, no matching) to validate the core paradigm shift.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the generalization capability of the RelPrior paradigm be enhanced for low-frequency and implicitly expressed relation types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 13 states that "the generalization performance of the current model on low-frequency relation types still requires significant improvement, particularly in terms of its ability to handle nuanced or less explicit relational expressions."
- Why unresolved: The current model relies heavily on clear statistical characteristics in the training data, causing it to struggle with relations that appear infrequently or lack explicit textual markers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating improved F1 scores on the worst-performing relation types (e.g., "lyrics by" or "instance of") in the DocRED development set without compromising performance on high-frequency relations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific architectural or training advancements are needed for LLM-based methods to consistently outperform traditional Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in document-level relation extraction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 10 notes that "methods using only LLMs still lag behind those based on traditional pre-trained models" and attributes this gap to limitations in handling vast classification tasks and hallucination issues.
- Why unresolved: While RelPrior achieves state-of-the-art performance among LLMs, it has not yet closed the performance gap with discriminative PLM baselines like EIDER_Bert-base.
- What evidence would resolve it: An LLM-based implementation achieving F1 scores higher than the 62.48 reported for EIDER_Bert-base on the DocRED development set.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the Entity Pairs Filtering (EPF) module be refined to minimize the false negative rate where valid triples are initially discarded?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Page 12 mentions that "the filtering of irrelevant entity pairs may lead to the absence of triplet facts," and "although the EPF module significantly improves extraction accuracy, it may miss many valid triples."
- Why unresolved: The paper relies on a second module (Relation Matching) to recover missed facts, suggesting the binary classification filter is prone to overlooking valid entity pairs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A reduction in the disparity between the number of triples identified in the EPF stage versus the final output, or an ablation study showing higher recall for the EPF module specifically.

## Limitations

- Performance gap remains with traditional PLM methods despite being SOTA for LLMs
- Relies on predefined relation labels, limiting discovery of novel relations
- Binary filtering in EPF module may cause false negatives, requiring supplementary RM module

## Confidence

- **Method Description:** High - Detailed architecture and training procedure described
- **Reproducibility:** Medium - Key hyperparameters and sampling strategies unspecified
- **Generalization Claims:** Medium - Strong performance on DocRED/RE-DocRED but limited cross-dataset validation
- **Technical Novelty:** High - Clear paradigm shift from direct classification to prior-guided extraction

## Next Checks

1. Verify EPF module's binary classification accuracy on development set before running full pipeline
2. Compare F1 scores when running EPF module alone versus full RelPrior pipeline
3. Check entity existence validation to ensure RM module doesn't generate hallucinated entities
