# Reflecting with Two Voices: A Co-Adaptive Dual-Strategy Framework for LLM-Based Agent Decision Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08366
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08366
- Reference count: 40
- DuSAR achieves 37.3% success rate on ALFWorld, outperforming non-demonstration baselines by 3–4× while reducing token consumption by 3–9× per step

## Executive Summary
DuSAR introduces a co-adaptive dual-strategy framework for LLM-based agent planning that eliminates reliance on external demonstrations and proprietary models. The system combines holistic planning for long-term coherence with local policy for context-grounded execution, integrated through a lightweight reflection mechanism with Strategy Fitness Score evaluation. On ALFWorld, DuSAR achieves 37.3% success rate with Llama3.1-70B, outperforming Synapse (13.0%) and TRAD (9.9%), while reducing per-step token consumption by 3–9×. The framework demonstrates that structured internal reasoning, rather than model scale or demonstrations, is key to robust planning.

## Method Summary
DuSAR addresses LLM planning challenges through a dual-strategy architecture that separates long-term planning from immediate action execution. The system employs holistic planning to maintain task coherence across extended sequences, while local policy ensures context-appropriate decisions at each step. These strategies are integrated via a reflection mechanism that evaluates strategy fitness using a lightweight scoring system, allowing dynamic adaptation without external supervision. The framework operates entirely on open-source models without requiring demonstrations, achieving significant performance gains while dramatically reducing computational overhead compared to demonstration-based approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves 37.3% success rate on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B), outperforming Synapse (13.0%) and TRAD (9.9%)
- Reduces per-step token consumption by 3–9× compared to demonstration-based baselines
- Achieves 4.00% task success rate on Mind2Web, more than doubling the best baseline
- Ablation studies confirm necessity of co-adaptive dual-strategy coordination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-strategy approach works by separating concerns: holistic planning maintains task coherence across long sequences while local policy ensures context-appropriate execution at each step. The reflection mechanism with Strategy Fitness Score evaluation enables dynamic strategy adaptation without external supervision. By eliminating dependence on demonstrations and proprietary models, DuSAR reduces computational overhead while maintaining or improving performance. The lightweight reflection process allows rapid strategy switching based on task context, preventing the planning drift that occurs when single strategies are used for extended periods.

## Foundational Learning
- **Strategy Fitness Score**: A lightweight evaluation metric that quantifies the effectiveness of each planning strategy in real-time, enabling dynamic adaptation without external supervision
  - Why needed: Without automated fitness evaluation, agents cannot adapt strategies to changing task contexts
  - Quick check: Verify that fitness scores correlate with actual task progress and success rates

- **Co-adaptive Dual-Strategy Coordination**: The systematic integration of holistic planning and local policy through reflection mechanisms
  - Why needed: Single-strategy approaches suffer from either poor long-term coherence or context-blind execution
  - Quick check: Test performance degradation when using only one strategy versus the dual system

- **Demonstration-Free Planning**: Elimination of external demonstration dependencies while maintaining competitive performance
  - Why needed: Demonstrations are expensive to create, domain-specific, and limit generalizability
  - Quick check: Compare token consumption and success rates with demonstration-based baselines

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Task Input -> Holistic Planner -> Local Policy -> Action Executor -> Environment Feedback -> Reflection Module -> Strategy Fitness Score -> Strategy Selection -> (back to Holistic Planner/Local Policy)

**Critical Path**: Task Input → Holistic Planner → Reflection Module → Strategy Selection → Action Executor → Environment → Feedback Loop

**Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritizes internal reasoning structure over model scale or demonstration data; accepts slightly higher implementation complexity for dramatic token consumption reduction and improved generalization

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Holistic planning failures manifest as task incoherence over long sequences
- Local policy failures appear as context-inappropriate immediate actions
- Reflection mechanism failures result in suboptimal strategy selection
- Integration failures cause planning drift or execution paralysis

**First Experiments**:
1. Run ablations comparing single-strategy performance against dual-strategy baseline
2. Measure token consumption per step against demonstration-based baselines
3. Test strategy fitness score correlation with actual task success rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to simulated environments (ALFWorld, Mind2Web); real-world generalization untested
- Binary task success metrics lack granularity for understanding partial progress or failure modes
- No comparison against proprietary models like GPT-4-based planning agents
- Controlled benchmark complexity may not reflect truly open-ended or dynamic domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core ablation results showing dual-strategy necessity and Strategy Fitness Score contribution are internally consistent and logically derived

**Medium Confidence**: Generalizability of dual-strategy design pattern to other planning tasks beyond evaluated domains

**Medium Confidence**: Claim that structured internal reasoning drives performance more than model scale, supported by ablation but not definitively proven without testing on larger models

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Transfer Test**: Apply DuSAR to non-simulation benchmarks (WebShop or real-world API navigation) to assess performance in less structured environments

2. **Failure Mode Analysis**: Conduct detailed qualitative analysis of failed trajectories in ALFWorld to identify breakdown points in holistic planning, local policy, or reflection

3. **Proprietary Model Comparison**: Benchmark DuSAR against GPT-4-based agent on same tasks to quantify performance gap between open-source and proprietary planning approaches
