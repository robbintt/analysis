# VLegal-Bench: Cognitively Grounded Benchmark for Vietnamese Legal Reasoning of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.14554
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14554
- **Reference count:** 38
- **Primary result:** First comprehensive, cognitively grounded benchmark for Vietnamese legal reasoning with 10,450 samples across 5 cognitive levels and 22 tasks

## Executive Summary
VLegal-Bench is the first comprehensive, cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating large language models on Vietnamese legal reasoning. It comprises 10,450 expert-verified samples spanning five cognitive levels—from basic legal recall to advanced ethical reasoning—and 22 tasks designed to reflect real-world legal assistant scenarios. The benchmark uniquely captures the hierarchical, codified nature of Vietnamese law, requiring models to navigate statutory structures, interpret amendments, and detect legal conflicts. Experiments with 24 models show that while models perform well on foundational tasks, they struggle significantly with advanced reasoning, conflict detection, and bias identification, highlighting the importance of domain-specific training.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates LLMs on Vietnamese legal reasoning using 10,450 expert-verified samples from 55,000 legal documents. Data is stored in two databases: a Legal Corpus DB (key-value format) and a Knowledge Graph DB (article-clause-point relations). Evaluation uses zero-shot and 1-shot settings with temperature=0, plus optional Chain-of-Thought prompting. Metrics include Accuracy for classification tasks, macro-F1 for extraction, Y-F1/N-F1 for conflict detection, and ROUGE-L for generation tasks. The benchmark covers five cognitive levels from Bloom's Taxonomy and 22 specific legal reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- General-purpose models achieve >80% accuracy on foundational tasks (Levels 1-2) but drop below 28% on advanced reasoning tasks (Levels 4-5)
- Conflict detection task (3.4) shows catastrophic failure with 16/23 models achieving 0.00 F1 on positive cases
- Domain-adapted models outperform general-purpose models on complex legal tasks, validating the benchmark's effectiveness
- Universal bottleneck in understanding temporal legal hierarchies (Task 1.5) where all models scored below 28%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its grounding in Bloom's Taxonomy, which creates a hierarchical structure that reveals performance cliffs between cognitive levels. The dual-database architecture (Knowledge Graph + Legal Corpus) enables both structured reasoning and document retrieval. The expert-verified annotation pipeline ensures high-quality labels (92.39% initial agreement), while the focus on Vietnamese civil law captures unique challenges like statutory conflict detection and legislative amendment tracking that common law-focused benchmarks miss.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bloom's Taxonomy (cognitive hierarchy)**: Understanding the five levels (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating) is essential to interpret the benchmark's structure and performance degradation. *Quick check:* Can you explain why a model might excel at "Remembering" a statute but fail at "Analyzing" a conflict between two statutes?
- **Civil Law vs. Common Law Systems**: Vietnam follows a civil law system with codified statutes as primary authority, unlike common law systems that rely on case precedents. This explains the benchmark's focus on statutory structures rather than case law. *Quick check:* What is the primary source of legal authority in a civil law system, and how does it differ from a common law system?
- **Knowledge Graphs for Structured Knowledge**: Understanding how entities (nodes) and relationships (edges) are stored and queried is necessary to comprehend how the benchmark creates multi-hop reasoning and conflict detection tasks. *Quick check:* If two legal articles have a "conflicts_with" edge in a knowledge graph, what kind of task could be generated from this relationship?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Data Collection Pipeline (Sources → Preprocessing → Postprocessing) → Dual Databases (Knowledge Graph DB, Legal Corpus DB) → Annotation System (Expert tools) → Evaluation Harness (Zero-shot/Few-shot, CoT, ReAct)
- **Critical Path:** Sample creation flows through data processing into databases, which feed annotation tools. Knowledge Graph DB quality is critical for advanced reasoning tasks (Levels 3-5).
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Highly specialized for Vietnamese civil law (powerful for that domain but not transferable to common law without rework) vs. complexity vs. scalability (expert-in-the-loop ensures quality but is costly).
- **Failure Signatures:** Conflict Detection Catastrophe (models defaulting to "no conflict"), Legal Schema Recall Bottleneck (<28% accuracy on amendment relationships), Cognitive Cliff (sharp performance drop between adjacent levels).
- **First 3 Experiments:** 1) Zero-Shot Baseline on all 22 tasks to reveal cognitive cliff, 2) Ablation on Annotation Quality to quantify impact of expert cross-verification, 3) Conflict Detection Probe to test if Knowledge Graph subgraph improves performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1:** Why does Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct outperform significantly larger models in legal conflict detection, and what specific architectural or training features enable this capability?
- **Open Question 2:** What cognitive or mechanistic factors cause the large performance gap between predicting court decisions (>90% accuracy) and predicting relevant legal articles (<44% accuracy)?
- **Open Question 3:** Can explicit legal-schema training data resolve the universal bottleneck in understanding temporal legal hierarchies (Task 1.5), where all models scored below 28%?

## Limitations
- Claims of capturing "advanced ethical reasoning" may be more procedural than genuinely open-ended
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, ROUGE-L) may not fully capture nuances of legal reasoning quality
- "Consultation" process for resolving annotation disagreements is not fully detailed

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Benchmark's structural design, grounding in Vietnamese civil law principles, and performance gap between general and domain-adapted models
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that benchmark is "cognitively grounded" and models struggle with advanced reasoning
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about benchmark's ability to assess "ethical alignment"

## Next Checks
1. **Qualitative Analysis of Level 5 Outputs:** Review model responses from Tasks 5.1, 5.3, and 5.4 to assess genuine evaluative/creative thinking versus pattern-matching
2. **Adversarial Bias Testing:** Design test cases probing for known LLM biases (demographic bias, over-reliance on certain interpretations) beyond statutory conflicts
3. **Cross-Jurisdictional Transferability Study:** Adapt benchmark tasks to German or French law to determine if performance degradation is due to Vietnamese-specific content or civil law paradigm itself
