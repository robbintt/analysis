# A Multi-Scale Isolation Forest Approach for Real-Time Detection and Filtering of FGSM Adversarial Attacks in Video Streams of Autonomous Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.16044
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16044
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** Detects FGSM adversarial attacks with 98.2% precision, 97.5% recall, and 120 images/second throughput on 8 cores

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a real-time detection and filtering system for FGSM adversarial attacks in video streams used by autonomous vehicles. The method combines statistical analysis with One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest algorithms to identify anomalous frames. Evaluated on 10,000 clean and 50,000 perturbed images across five perturbation levels, the approach achieves high detection performance while maintaining real-time processing capability through parallel execution.

## Method Summary
The approach processes video frames by first extracting individual frames and resizing them to 224×224. FGSM adversarial examples are generated using a pre-trained ResNet-50 model with cross-entropy loss, where perturbations are calculated as x + ε · sign(∇x J(θ, x, y)) and clipped to [0,1]. Detection uses a dual approach combining One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest from scikit-learn to identify anomalous frames. The implementation leverages Python's multiprocessing library to distribute frame-level detection across CPU cores, achieving 78% reduction in processing time and 120 images/second throughput on an 8-core system.

## Key Results
- **Detection performance:** Precision 98.2%, Recall 97.5%, F1-score 97.85%, Accuracy 98.7%
- **Real-time capability:** 78% reduction in processing time, achieving 120 images/second on 8-core system
- **Scalability:** Parallel processing enables efficient handling of video streams with minimal inter-process communication overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Isolation Forest detects FGSM adversarial images by identifying anomalous statistical patterns in pixel distributions that differ from clean images.
- **Mechanism:** The Isolation Forest algorithm isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and split value. Adversarial perturbations create images that are "few and different"—they require fewer splits to isolate because their perturbed pixel distributions deviate from natural image statistics. The algorithm measures anomaly scores based on average path length; shorter paths indicate anomalies.
- **Core assumption:** FGSM perturbations produce pixel-level statistical signatures distinguishable from natural image variation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "multi-scale isolation forest approach that combines statistical analysis with advanced anomaly detection"
  - [section 5.1.3] "Isolation Forest algorithm operates with a contamination factor that specifies the expected proportion of adversarial frames"
  - [corpus] "Deep learning models are vulnerable, but adversarial examples are even more vulnerable" (FMR 0.705) supports that adversarial examples exhibit distinguishable properties
- **Break condition:** If perturbation magnitude ε is extremely low (e.g., < 0.01), statistical differences may fall within natural image variance, reducing detection to chance levels.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Dual-approach detection using One-Class SVM alongside Isolation Forest improves robustness by capturing complementary anomaly characterizations.
- **Mechanism:** One-Class SVM learns a decision boundary around normal (clean) image feature distributions in a high-dimensional space. Isolation Forest uses tree-based partitioning. When combined, the ensemble reduces false positives because an image must exhibit anomalous characteristics under both paradigms to be flagged. This addresses different failure modes: boundary-based vs. isolation-based detection.
- **Core assumption:** Clean images form a coherent cluster in feature space that both algorithms can characterize; adversarial images fall outside this characterization.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "combines statistical analysis with advanced anomaly detection using One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest algorithms"
  - [section 5.1.3] "dual-pronged approach utilizing One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest for robust anomaly identification"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus evidence for dual-approach synergy; this mechanism is primarily paper-internal
- **Break condition:** If the feature space does not separate clean from adversarial samples (e.g., sophisticated adaptive attacks), both detectors may fail simultaneously.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Parallel processing enables real-time throughput by distributing frame-level detection across CPU cores with minimal inter-process communication overhead.
- **Mechanism:** Each frame's detection is independent (stateless), allowing embarrassingly parallel execution. Python's multiprocessing library spawns worker processes, each handling a subset of frames. Results are aggregated post-hoc. The 78% time reduction suggests near-optimal scaling (roughly 4.5× speedup on 8 cores), indicating low coordination overhead.
- **Core assumption:** Frame-level detection has no temporal dependencies; each image can be processed independently.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "78% reduction in processing time through parallel processing, processing 120 images per second on an 8-core system"
  - [section 5.1.4] "implementation uses Python's multiprocessing library, distributing the workload across available CPU cores"
  - [corpus] No corpus corroboration; mechanism is implementation-specific
- **Break condition:** If temporal coherence between frames is required (e.g., video-specific attacks), independent processing loses attack-context information.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how the attack works is prerequisite to understanding why statistical detection is plausible.
  - **Quick check question:** Given loss gradient ∇x J(θ, x, y), which direction does FGSM perturb the image, and why does the sign function matter?

- **Concept: Isolation Forest Anomaly Scoring**
  - **Why needed here:** Core detection algorithm; path length interpretation determines threshold selection.
  - **Quick check question:** If an image has an average path length of 3 splits vs. 15 splits in an Isolation Forest, which is more likely anomalous and why?

- **Concept: Precision-Recall Tradeoff in Detection**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper reports 98.2% precision and 97.5% recall; understanding this tradeoff is critical for deployment decisions.
  - **Quick check question:** In an autonomous vehicle context, would you prioritize higher precision or higher recall for adversarial detection, and what are the failure mode implications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video Input → Frame Extraction (OpenCV) → Preprocessing (resize/normalize to 224×224) → Feature Extraction → [Isolation Forest + One-Class SVM] → Anomaly Scores → Threshold Decision → Decorated Output → Parallel Worker Pool distributes frames across cores

- **Critical path:** Feature extraction quality determines detection performance. If features do not capture perturbation signatures, downstream classifiers cannot recover.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Contamination factor in Isolation Forest: Higher values catch more attacks but increase false positives
  - Single-detector vs. dual-detector: Dual approach adds ~2× inference overhead but improves F1 by reducing false positives
  - Frame independence vs. temporal smoothing: Current design processes frames independently; temporal smoothing could reduce flicker false positives but adds latency

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High false positive rate on low-contrast or noisy legitimate frames (e.g., fog, rain)
  - Detection degradation at ε < 0.01 where perturbations approach sensor noise floor
  - Memory bottleneck if frame buffer exceeds RAM during high-FPS video

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Perturbation sensitivity sweep:** Run detection on ε ∈ {0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3} to identify detection floor. Expect sharp dropoff below ε = 0.01.
  2. **False positive characterization:** Apply detector to 1,000 clean images with natural noise (ISO grain, compression artifacts) to measure baseline FP rate.
  3. **Throughput scaling test:** Benchmark images/sec on 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 cores to validate near-linear scaling claim and identify Amdahl's Law limit.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the detection performance of the multi-scale Isolation Forest approach vary when subjected to iterative adversarial attack methods (such as Projected Gradient Descent) or black-box attacks compared to the single-step FGSM?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion and Future Work section explicitly states an aim to "extend this method to handle more complex adversarial attacks, including those generated by iterative or black-box techniques."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study restricts its evaluation to FGSM, a single-step gradient-based attack, leaving the method's robustness against more computationally intensive or transfer-based attacks unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking results showing precision, recall, and F1-scores for the proposed method when applied to datasets perturbed by iterative attacks (e.g., PGD, C&W) and decision-based black-box attacks.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent does the frame-based detection method fail to identify adversarial attacks that exploit temporal dependencies across video frames rather than perturbing individual images?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors identify the need for "investigating the robustness of the method under adversarial attacks targeting video content rather than individual frames" in the Future Work section.
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation extracts frames and processes them using statistical analysis and Isolation Forest, which primarily analyzes spatial features of single frames rather than temporal inconsistencies across the video stream.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Performance metrics derived from testing the method against video-specific adversarial benchmarks where perturbations are applied to optical flow or temporal structures rather than static pixel values.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can advanced explainability techniques be integrated to interpret why the Isolation Forest flags specific frames as adversarial, and would this reveal reliance on specific frequency signatures?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion suggests "enhancing the interpretability of detection results through advanced explainability techniques could provide deeper insights into adversarial behavior."
- **Why unresolved:** While the method successfully detects anomalies, it currently operates as a "black box" regarding the specific statistical properties or artifacts (e.g., high-frequency noise vs. structural changes) that trigger a positive classification.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An extension of the framework that visualizes feature importance (e.g., using SHAP values) for the anomaly scores, correlating detected anomalies with specific perturbation characteristics.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does the detection accuracy fluctuate in real-time streams if the actual proportion of adversarial frames deviates significantly from the Isolation Forest's fixed "contamination factor" parameter?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The methodology relies on a "contamination factor that specifies the expected proportion of adversarial frames," implying a modeling assumption about attack frequency that may not hold in dynamic real-world autonomous vehicle environments.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper evaluates the method on a constructed dataset but does not test the sensitivity of the F1-score or false positive rate when the pre-set contamination hyperparameter is mismatched with the actual attack density.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A sensitivity analysis plotting performance metrics against varying ratios of adversarial-to-clean frames (e.g., 1% to 50% attacks) while keeping the model's contamination parameter fixed.

## Limitations

- **Unknown dataset source:** The 10,000 original images used for evaluation are not identified, preventing verification of generalizability across different image distributions.
- **Missing hyperparameters:** Isolation Forest contamination factor and OC-SVM parameters are not specified, yet these critically affect detection performance and false positive rates.
- **Unclear feature extraction:** The methodology does not specify whether raw pixels, statistical summaries, or deep embeddings are used for detection, making it impossible to assess the fundamental detection mechanism.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence (Mechanism 1 - Isolation Forest detection):** The statistical basis for detecting FGSM perturbations is well-established; adversarial noise creates distinguishable pixel-level signatures that Isolation Forest can isolate through path-length analysis.
- **Medium Confidence (Mechanism 2 - Dual approach robustness):** While combining classifiers often improves performance, the paper provides limited empirical evidence comparing dual vs. single approaches. The claimed F1 improvement may reflect hyperparameter tuning rather than fundamental complementarity.
- **Medium Confidence (Mechanism 3 - Real-time performance):** The 78% speedup claim is plausible for embarrassingly parallel tasks, but actual scaling depends on feature extraction bottlenecks and inter-process coordination overhead not detailed in the paper.

## Next Checks

1. **Perturbation sensitivity validation:** Systematically test detection performance across ε ∈ {0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3} to identify the detection floor and characterize performance degradation at low perturbation levels.

2. **False positive characterization:** Evaluate the detector on 1,000 clean images with natural noise sources (ISO grain, compression artifacts, weather effects) to establish baseline false positive rates and assess real-world deployability.

3. **Throughput scaling validation:** Benchmark processing speed on 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 CPU cores to verify near-linear scaling and identify Amdahl's Law limits, confirming the claimed 120 images/second throughput is achievable under various conditions.
