# Predicting Driver's Perceived Risk: a Model Based on Semi-Supervised Learning Strategy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.12665
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12665
- Reference count: 20
- This paper proposes DSPR model for assessing driver's perceived risk in automated driving scenarios with 87.91% prediction accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for assessing driver perceived risk in automated driving systems. The proposed DSPR (Driver's Subjective Perceived Risk) model integrates risk-trigger mechanisms, spatiotemporal decay, and anisotropic observation sensitivity to capture both objective risk factors and driver perception patterns. The framework employs a semi-supervised learning strategy with a CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA network to predict real-time subjective risk ratings from driver-in-the-loop experiments. The model demonstrates significant improvements over existing risk assessment methods, achieving 87.91% accuracy and outperforming supervised learning approaches by 20.12%.

## Method Summary
The methodology combines a novel risk assessment model with semi-supervised learning. The DSPR model incorporates three key components: a risk-trigger mechanism that identifies potential danger sources, spatiotemporal decay that models how risk perception changes over time and space, and anisotropic observation sensitivity that accounts for directional differences in risk perception. For prediction, the framework uses a CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA network architecture that processes driving data to predict subjective risk ratings. The semi-supervised approach leverages both labeled and unlabeled data, addressing the challenge of limited labeled risk perception data while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieves 87.91% prediction accuracy for real-time subjective risk ratings
- Outperforms three state-of-the-art risk models with significant margin
- Improves accuracy by 20.12% compared to traditional supervised learning approaches
- CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA network architecture achieves highest accuracy among four LSTM-based structures tested

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The DSPR model works by integrating multiple dimensions of risk perception. The risk-trigger mechanism identifies critical events that could lead to dangerous situations, while spatiotemporal decay captures how risk perception evolves as situations develop over time and distance. The anisotropic observation sensitivity accounts for the fact that drivers perceive risk differently based on the direction of potential threats. The semi-supervised learning strategy effectively utilizes limited labeled data by incorporating patterns from unlabeled data, addressing the common challenge of obtaining extensive labeled risk perception data in automated driving scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semi-supervised learning**: Why needed - addresses scarcity of labeled risk perception data; Quick check - model improves accuracy by incorporating unlabeled data patterns
- **Spatiotemporal modeling**: Why needed - risk perception changes dynamically over time and space; Quick check - decay functions capture temporal and spatial risk evolution
- **Anisotropic sensitivity**: Why needed - drivers respond differently to threats from different directions; Quick check - directional weighting improves risk prediction accuracy
- **CNN-Bi-LSTM architecture**: Why needed - combines spatial feature extraction with temporal sequence modeling; Quick check - outperforms other LSTM variants in risk prediction
- **Risk-trigger mechanisms**: Why needed - identifies critical events that influence driver perception; Quick check - improves detection of high-risk scenarios
- **Bi-directional LSTM**: Why needed - captures both past and future context in sequential data; Quick check - enhances temporal understanding of risk patterns

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Driving data -> CNN feature extraction -> Bi-LSTM temporal processing -> TPA risk assessment -> SRR prediction
**Critical Path**: CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA network processes sequential driving data to generate subjective risk ratings
**Design Tradeoffs**: Semi-supervised approach balances data efficiency with prediction accuracy; CNN-Bi-LSTM structure provides good temporal understanding but may be computationally intensive
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on edge cases, limited generalization to different driver populations, computational constraints in real-time deployment
**First Experiments**: 1) Test model performance on different automated driving scenarios, 2) Evaluate robustness across diverse driver demographics, 3) Assess real-time computational efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to 20 participants, restricting generalizability across diverse driver populations
- Experimental focus on specific automated driving scenarios may limit broader applicability
- Unclear how model handles edge cases or extreme risk scenarios
- No explicit discussion of real-world deployment challenges

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The reported 87.91% prediction accuracy and 20.12% improvement over supervised learning are well-supported by direct comparisons with state-of-the-art models. The methodological framework is clearly articulated and technically sound.

**Medium Confidence**: While the CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA architecture shows superior performance among tested LSTM structures, the comparison with only four variants may not represent the full spectrum of possible neural network configurations.

**Low Confidence**: The transferability of results to different automated driving systems, varying traffic conditions, and diverse driver demographics remains uncertain due to limited participant diversity and scenario variety.

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance across a larger and more diverse participant pool (minimum 100 drivers) representing different age groups, driving experience levels, and cultural backgrounds.

2. Validate the model's predictive accuracy in real-world automated driving conditions over extended periods, including edge cases and emergency scenarios not present in the original dataset.

3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the risk-trigger mechanism, spatiotemporal decay, and anisotropic observation sensitivity components to overall model performance.
