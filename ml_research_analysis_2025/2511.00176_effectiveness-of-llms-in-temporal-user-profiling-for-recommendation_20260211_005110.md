  creates separate short-term and long-term textual summaries of user interaction

# Effectiveness of LLMs in Temporal User Profiling for Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.00176
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00176
- Reference count: 28
- LLM-driven temporal profiling improves Recall@10 by 17% on Movies&TV dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create temporally-aware user profiles for recommendation systems. The approach generates separate short-term and long-term textual summaries of user interaction histories, encodes them with BERT, and fuses them using an attention mechanism. Evaluation on Amazon Movies&TV and Video Games datasets shows significant performance improvements in active domains, while also providing inherent interpretability through natural language profiles and attention weights.

## Method Summary
The proposed method generates two textual profiles per user using GPT-4o-mini: short-term (recent behaviors) and long-term (persistent preferences). These profiles are encoded using SBERT (MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim) and fused via learned attention weights. The fused user embedding is combined with item embeddings through an MLP to predict interactions. The model is trained with binary cross-entropy loss using temporal holdout validation (train precedes test). Evaluation uses Recall@K and NDCG@K metrics on Amazon datasets with 10K+ users each.

## Key Results
- 17% improvement in Recall@10 for Movies&TV dataset compared to baselines
- Significant gains in active domains where temporal dynamics matter
- Provides inherent interpretability through natural language profiles and attention weights
- Less pronounced benefits in sparser environments like Video Games

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by capturing both short-term interests from recent interactions and long-term preferences from historical behavior through separate textual summaries. LLMs can synthesize complex interaction patterns into coherent narratives that BERT can encode into meaningful representations. The attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically weigh recent versus persistent preferences based on context, while the natural language format provides transparency into what drives recommendations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal user profiling**: Separating short-term vs long-term preferences is crucial for capturing evolving interests; verify temporal splits maintain chronological integrity
- **LLM-generated textual summaries**: Converting interaction histories to narratives enables semantic understanding; check prompt quality and summary coherence
- **BERT/SBERT encoding**: Transforms natural language profiles into dense vector representations; validate embedding dimensions and model version consistency
- **Attention fusion mechanisms**: Dynamically weights different temporal perspectives; monitor attention weight distributions for meaningful patterns
- **Temporal holdout validation**: Ensures realistic evaluation by training on past interactions only; verify no temporal leakage between splits

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User interactions -> GPT-4o-mini profile generation -> SBERT encoding -> Attention fusion -> MLP prediction -> BCE loss

**Critical Path**: Profile generation → Encoding → Fusion → Prediction → Training. Each stage depends on the previous: poor profile generation propagates errors through the entire pipeline.

**Design Tradeoffs**: GPT-4o-mini provides rich semantic understanding but introduces API costs and rate limits versus traditional feature engineering. Separate temporal profiles add complexity but capture dynamics better than single representations. Natural language format enables interpretability but may miss fine-grained patterns that numerical features capture.

**Failure Signatures**: Empty or low-quality LLM summaries indicate prompt engineering issues or insufficient interaction history. Attention weights heavily skewed toward one temporal perspective suggest profile imbalance. Poor performance on sparse datasets indicates the approach requires sufficient interaction volume to generate meaningful profiles.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test profile generation quality by manually inspecting a sample of short-term vs long-term summaries for coherence and relevance
2. Verify temporal data integrity by checking that all training interactions precede validation/test interactions for every user
3. Run ablation study comparing single vs dual temporal profiles to quantify the benefit of temporal separation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- API costs and rate limiting from GPT-4o-mini usage at scale (~$10K+ for full generation)
- Limited evaluation to only two Amazon datasets with relatively small user bases
- Underspecified temporal split methodology for defining "recent" behavior
- SBERT encoding assumes consistently available and informative item descriptions

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core architectural design and evaluation methodology are well-specified and reproducible given codebase and API access.

**Medium confidence**: Performance improvements are methodologically sound but sensitive to implementation details around temporal splits, prompt engineering, and negative sampling.

**Low confidence**: Interpretability claims through attention weights and natural language profiles require more extensive qualitative validation.

## Next Checks

1. Verify temporal data integrity by implementing strict chronological splitting and testing for potential leakage between train/validation/test sets across all users.

2. Conduct ablation studies comparing different prompt formulations and temporal window definitions for profile generation to assess sensitivity to these design choices.

3. Replicate results on a larger-scale dataset (e.g., Amazon Beauty or Yelp) to validate generalization beyond the studied domains and evaluate cost-benefit trade-offs at scale.
