# One Model for All: Universal Pre-training for EEG based Emotion Recognition across Heterogeneous Datasets and Paradigms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08444
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08444
- Authors: Xiang Li; You Li; Yazhou Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: New SOTA on SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), DREAMER (93.93%) within-subject emotion recognition, with GAT module critical for noise handling (+22.19% over GCN on DEAP)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a "One Model for All" universal pre-training framework for EEG-based emotion recognition across heterogeneous datasets. The core innovation is a two-stage approach: univariate pre-training on individual channels via contrastive learning, followed by multivariate fine-tuning with a GAT-based architecture. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three major emotion recognition benchmarks (SEED, DEAP, DREAMER) and demonstrates strong cross-dataset transfer capabilities.

## Method Summary
The framework decouples learning into two stages: univariate pre-training on individual channels via contrastive self-supervised learning using a Unified Channel Schema (UCS), and multivariate fine-tuning with a novel ART-GAT architecture. The ART tokenizer handles variable sampling rates through adaptive pooling, while the GAT module captures spatio-temporal dependencies with dynamic attention. This design enables knowledge transfer across datasets with different channel configurations (62, 32, 14 channels) and sampling rates (200Hz, 128Hz) without information loss from channel intersection methods.

## Key Results
- New state-of-the-art within-subject performance: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), DREAMER (93.93%)
- Significant gains over training from scratch: +7.65% on DEAP, +3.55% on DREAMER
- SOTA cross-dataset transfer: 94.08% accuracy on unseen DREAMER dataset
- GAT module critical for noise handling: +22.19% gain over GCN on high-noise DEAP dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Decoupling temporal representation learning from spatial dependency modeling stabilizes training across heterogeneous datasets with varying channel counts. The framework separates optimization into Stage 1 (Univariate Pre-training) for generic temporal features from individual channels, and Stage 2 (Multivariate Fine-tuning) for spatial relationships. This prevents getting stuck in local minima caused by conflicting spatial topologies.

Core assumption: Temporal dynamics in EEG signals are more universal and transferable across datasets than spatial topologies, which are often hardware-dependent.

Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our core paradigm decouples learning into two stages..."; [Section III-A] "This paradigm... simplifies the learning process at each stage..."; [corpus] Related work emphasizes difficulty of task-general pre-training due to feature mismatches.

Break condition: If temporal features are not actually transferable (e.g., vastly different experimental paradigms or sampling rates not handled by the tokenizer), Stage 1 will learn noise, and decoupling will fail to aid Stage 2.

### Mechanism 2
The Unified Channel Schema (UCS) enables knowledge transfer without information loss common in channel intersection methods. Instead of discarding channels not present in all datasets, UCS creates a global vocabulary of all unique channels, treating channel identity as a discrete token (embedding). This allows the model to utilize all available data points, aggregating knowledge from any channel configuration into a shared latent space.

Core assumption: There is sufficient semantic overlap in neural signals recorded by different channel configurations to justify a shared encoder backbone.

Evidence anchors: [abstract] Mentions UCS "leverages the union of channels... to maximize data utilization"; [Section III-B3] "Unlike baseline methods that discard data by using only the intersection of channels, the UCS creates a canonical Channel Symbol Pool from the union..."; [corpus] The corpus lacks specific comparative evidence for "union vs. intersection" strategies in neighbors.

Break condition: If a new dataset uses a completely non-standard electrode placement or naming convention that cannot be mapped to the global vocabulary, the schema requires manual intervention or fails.

### Mechanism 3
Graph Attention Networks (GAT) provide robustness against high noise levels in EEG data by dynamically weighting channel importance, unlike static Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). GCNs typically use static adjacency matrices (fixed spatial weights). GAT computes attention coefficients based on input features, allowing the model to "attend" to informative channels and suppress noisy ones dynamically for each sample.

Core assumption: Noise in EEG datasets (like DEAP) is localized or variable enough that static spatial smoothing (GCN) degrades performance by averaging signal with noise.

Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Ablation studies... revealing that the GAT module is critical... yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset"; [Section IV-C2] "GAT's attention mechanism is the key to handling signal noise... whereas the GCN's static weights are insufficient"; [corpus] "A novel Fourier Adjacency Transformer" suggests Fourier/Spatial attention is a growing trend for noise handling.

Break condition: If the noise profile is uniform across all channels, dynamic attention may fail to find discriminative signals, or attention might overfit to spurious correlations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning (SimCLR style)
  - **Why needed here:** Essential for Stage 1. Since the model must learn from unlabeled, heterogeneous data, it requires a loss function (NT-Xent) that forces representations of augmented views of the same signal closer together while pushing others apart.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why reconstruction-based objectives (like Autoencoders) were rejected in favor of contrastive learning for this specific EEG task? (Hint: SNR).

- **Concept:** Transformers with Adaptive Tokenization
  - **Why needed here:** Addresses the "sampling rate mismatch" (e.g., 128Hz vs. 200Hz). A standard transformer uses fixed patches, which creates temporal inconsistencies. The "ART" module uses Adaptive Average Pooling to ensure consistent semantic patch size regardless of input sampling rate.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the ART tokenizer ensure that a "patch" represents roughly the same temporal duration for a 128Hz signal as a 200Hz signal?

- **Concept:** Differential Learning Rates
  - **Why needed here:** Critical for the Fine-tuning stage. The pre-trained encoder has already converged on robust features; high learning rates would destroy this knowledge ("catastrophic forgetting").
  - **Quick check question:** Why is `lr_encoder` (5e-6) set significantly lower than `lr_head` (1e-4) during the fine-tuning phase?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw EEG Segment -> ART Tokenizer (1D Conv -> Adaptive Pool -> Linear Projection) -> Pre-trained Encoder (Transformer Blocks) -> Spatial Layer (GAT) -> Global Context (Transformer Encoder) -> Head (Mean Pool -> Linear Classifier)

- **Critical path:** The **ART Tokenizer** is the entry point. If `AdaptiveAvgPool1d` is misconfigured, the model cannot handle varying sampling rates. The **GAT layer** is the performance bottleneck; replacing it with standard linear layers drops performance significantly on noisy data.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - *UCS vs. Intersection:* UCS maximizes data but requires a large embedding table and careful channel mapping. Intersection is simpler but discards data.
  - *GAT vs. GCN:* GAT is computationally heavier (attention computation) but essential for noisy datasets like DEAP.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Training Collapse:** Observed on SEED when training from scratch (accuracy drops/random). *Fix:* Ensure pre-training is loaded correctly.
  - **GCN Drop:** If accuracy on DEAP drops to ~70%, check if GAT was accidentally replaced with GCN.
  - **Rate Mismatch:** If patches from different datasets yield vastly different feature magnitudes, check `E_rate` embeddings.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Overfit):** Take one subject from SEED. Train the full ART+GAT model from scratch on just 10 trials. It should reach >90% quickly. If not, the architecture is broken.
  2. **Tokenizer Validation:** Feed a 128Hz and 200Hz tensor of the same theoretical signal (e.g., sine wave) into the ART module. Verify the output embeddings are similar.
  3. **Ablation (GAT vs. GCN):** Run the DEAP cross-validation once with GAT and once with GCN. Confirm the ~22% gap exists to validate the noise-handling hypothesis.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the proposed universal pre-training framework generalize effectively to distinct EEG paradigms beyond emotion recognition, such as Motor Imagery (BCI) or sleep staging?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that the methodology "could be extended to encompass more datasets and diverse EEG paradigms (e.g., BCI, sleep staging), exploring its potential as a foundational model."
- Why unresolved: The current study validates the framework exclusively on emotion recognition datasets (SEED, DEAP, DREAMER), leaving its efficacy as a general-purpose EEG foundation model unproven.
- Evidence: Performance evaluation of the pre-trained ART encoder on downstream classification tasks involving motor imagery or sleep stage scoring without architecture modifications.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the Unified Channel Schema (UCS) perform when integrating datasets with completely disjoint or minimally overlapping channel montages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that the "Intersection" strategy outperformed UCS on DREAMER (94.08% vs 93.05%), but argues UCS is superior for scalability when intersections are empty. However, the utilized datasets (SEED, DEAP) have significant subset relationships, not disjoint layouts.
- Why unresolved: The claim that UCS prevents information loss better than downsampling is based on datasets where one (DEAP) is a strict subset of another (SEED), failing to test the "union" strategy on truly heterogeneous/incompatible hardware configurations.
- Evidence: Ablation studies pre-training on datasets with zero channel overlap (e.g., combining high-density research EEG with low-density consumer MUSE headbands) to compare UCS against other unification methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the zero-shot cross-subject generalization capability of the model without subject-specific supervised fine-tuning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The evaluation protocol (Section IV-A.c) focuses on "within-subject" accuracy, where models are fine-tuned on the target subject's data. The framework's utility as a "One Model for All" solution remains unclear if personalized training data is unavailable.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that pre-training stabilizes training, but relies on a personalized fine-tuning step to handle inter-subject variability. It does not assess if the pre-trained features alone are sufficient for a new, unseen subject.
- Evidence: Reporting classification accuracy on a subject strictly excluded from the fine-tuning phase (leave-one-subject-out), comparing the pre-trained encoder against training from scratch.

## Limitations
- The paper does not specify exact kernel sizes, strides, or number of layers for the 1D Convolutional layers in the ART tokenizer, only that they produce 16 patches.
- Augmentation parameters for "Random Resized Cropping" (min/max scale factors) are unspecified, though the contrastive learning objective depends on these transformations.
- Cross-dataset transfer is only validated on one unseen dataset (DREAMER), limiting generalizability assessment.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Within-dataset performance claims (99.27% SEED, 93.69% DEAP, 93.93% DREAMER). Well-supported by ablation studies showing consistent gains over baseline methods.
- **Medium Confidence:** Cross-dataset transfer claim (94.08% on DREAMER). Supported by results but only validated on a single unseen dataset.
- **Medium Confidence:** GAT noise-handling mechanism. The 22.19% gain over GCN on DEAP is empirically demonstrated, but the paper doesn't characterize the specific noise profile that enables this advantage.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Validation:** Replicate the GAT vs. GCN ablation on DEAP to confirm the reported ~22% performance gap, directly testing the noise-handling hypothesis.
2. **Generalization Test:** Apply the pre-trained model to a fourth EEG emotion dataset with a novel channel configuration (e.g., Neuroscan system) to assess true cross-dataset robustness beyond the DREAMER validation.
3. **Tokenizer Sensitivity:** Systematically vary the Adaptive Average Pooling window size in the ART tokenizer to determine how sensitive the model is to the "16 patches" assumption across different sampling rates.
