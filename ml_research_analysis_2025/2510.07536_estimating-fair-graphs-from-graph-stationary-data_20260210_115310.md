# Estimating Fair Graphs from Graph-Stationary Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07536
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07536
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an optimization-based method for estimating fair graphs from graph-stationary data with two variants: FST-C (via commutativity constraints) and FST-V (via shared eigenbasis).

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of estimating fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations. The authors define group and individual fairness for graphs and propose novel metrics to measure bias in both spatial and spectral domains. They introduce Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs. One variant exploits commutativity properties of graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum. The authors provide high-probability performance bounds, demonstrating that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs when the target graph is fair. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets illustrate the effectiveness of FairSpecTemp and highlight the advantages of both variants.

## Method Summary
The method estimates a graph shift operator (GSO) S from stationary graph signals while ensuring unbiased edges across sensitive groups. The approach uses sample covariance Ĉ = XX^T/M from N×M data matrix X of M graph signals, where nodes are partitioned into G groups indicated by matrix Z. The optimization minimizes ||S+||_1 subject to commutativity constraints (||ĈS - SĈ||_F ≤ ε) and bias constraints (R(S) ≤ τ²). Two variants are proposed: FST-C uses direct commutativity constraint, while FST-V uses shared eigenbasis with the sample covariance. FISTA solver is employed for both variants with specific hyperparameters τ (bias threshold) and ε (commutativity tolerance).

## Key Results
- Theoretical error bounds demonstrate that accuracy need not be sacrificed when recovering fair graphs when the target graph is fair
- FST-C variant shows more stability at low sample sizes compared to FST-V
- Experiments on Wiki-vote and Cornell classes datasets show improved fairness metrics while maintaining accuracy
- Synthetic experiments validate the method's effectiveness across different graph sizes and bias scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the commutativity property of graph-stationary signals with their generating graph. By constraining the estimated graph to commute with the sample covariance, the method ensures the resulting graph is consistent with the observed stationarity. The fairness constraints directly limit bias in edge weights across sensitive groups, either through explicit commutativity constraints (FST-C) or by restricting the graph spectrum (FST-V). The optimization framework allows for trade-offs between accuracy (data fidelity) and fairness through tunable parameters.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph stationarity**: Understanding that graph signals follow a specific statistical model relative to the underlying graph structure. Needed to justify the commutativity constraints. Quick check: Verify that sample covariance commutes approximately with the true GSO.
- **FISTA optimization**: Familiarity with fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm for constrained optimization problems. Needed to solve the non-smooth objective with linear constraints. Quick check: Monitor convergence and objective value during iterations.
- **Graph Laplacian and shift operators**: Knowledge of different graph matrix representations and their properties. Needed to understand the valid GSO constraint set. Quick check: Verify that the estimated S satisfies the required properties (e.g., zero row-sum for Laplacians).
- **Bias metrics in graph domain**: Understanding of group-wise and node-wise fairness definitions. Needed to quantify and constrain bias during estimation. Quick check: Compute R_G and R_N on synthetic biased graphs.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Data matrix X -> Sample covariance Ĉ -> FISTA solver -> Estimated GSO S -> Fairness metrics R_G/R_N

### Critical Path
1. Generate synthetic data with known bias
2. Compute sample covariance and eigendecomposition
3. Implement FISTA optimization for FST-C and FST-V
4. Evaluate fairness and accuracy metrics

### Design Tradeoffs
- FST-C offers better stability at low sample sizes but may be less efficient computationally
- FST-V potentially provides better asymptotic performance but requires accurate eigenvector estimation
- Stricter fairness constraints (lower τ) may reduce accuracy but improve fairness metrics

### Failure Signatures
- Infeasible optimization when τ is too strict for biased ground truth
- Poor eigenvector estimation at low M causes FST-V instability
- Convergence issues in FISTA due to ill-conditioned covariance matrix

### 3 First Experiments
1. Generate ER graph with 40 nodes, partition into 2 groups, create biased edge weights, and verify R(S*) > 0
2. Implement FST-C with τ=0.1 and compare R(S) vs R(S*) on synthetic data
3. Test FST-V vs FST-C at M=10^3 vs M=10^5 to observe stability differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method requires careful tuning of fairness thresholds (τ) and commutativity tolerances (ε) which are not specified
- Effectiveness depends on having sufficient sample size (M) for reliable covariance estimation
- Assumes knowledge of sensitive attributes for all nodes, which may not be available in real-world scenarios
- Spectral domain constraints in FST-V may introduce computational complexity that scales poorly with graph size

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical error bounds showing accuracy need not be sacrificed for fair graph estimation when target graph is fair
- **Medium confidence**: Relative performance comparison between FST-C and FST-V variants based on synthetic experiments
- **Medium confidence**: Fairness improvements demonstrated on real-world data (Wiki-vote and Cornell classes)

## Next Checks
1. Test method's performance when sensitive attribute information is partially available or missing for some nodes
2. Implement and benchmark computational complexity of both FST-C and FST-V on larger graphs (N > 200)
3. Apply method to additional real-world datasets with known fairness concerns to validate generalizability beyond the two presented datasets
