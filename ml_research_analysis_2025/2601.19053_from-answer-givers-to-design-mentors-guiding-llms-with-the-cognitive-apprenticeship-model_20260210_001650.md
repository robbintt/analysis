- Transforms LLMs from answer-givers to design mentors using structured prompting based on Cognitive Apprenticeship Model

## Executive Summary
This paper presents DesignMentor, a system that transforms LLMs from simple answer-givers into design mentors using the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model (CAM). By operationalizing six instructional methods through structured prompting, the system guides visualization practitioners through a three-phase feedback loop that emphasizes design reasoning over direct solutions. A within-subjects study with 24 practitioners showed DesignMentor significantly improved design reasoning, provided more complete feedback loops, and enhanced metacognitive awareness compared to standard LLM interactions.

## Method Summary
The authors operationalized CAM's six instructional methods (modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, exploration) through structured prompting into a three-phase "Guided Feedback Loop": (1) Clarifying Goals, (2) Diagnosing/Discussing, and (3) Reflection. This was implemented as a custom GPT with detailed system instructions enforcing the phased approach. The study used a within-subjects design with 24 visualization practitioners who interacted with both DesignMentor and a baseline ChatGPT-4o instance, comparing feedback quality, reasoning depth, and user experience across design phases.

## Key Results
- DesignMentor significantly improved design reasoning quality compared to baseline LLM
- The system provided more complete feedback loops and enhanced metacognitive awareness
- Participants preferred DesignMentor in exploration and development phases, while favoring the baseline in evaluation phases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Structured prompting operationalizes the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model (CAM) to shift LLM behavior from "answer-giving" to "process-guided mentorship."
- **Mechanism:** The authors map six CAM instructional methods into a three-phase "Guided Feedback Loop" in the system prompt. This forces the LLM to adhere to a state machine: (1) Clarifying Goals, (2) Diagnosing/Discussing, (3) Reflection. By defining strict "Phase Goals" and "Starter Formats," the prompt prevents the model from defaulting to immediate solution generation.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs can reliably adhere to complex, multi-stage pedagogical workflows when constraints and definitions are explicitly provided in the context window.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "...operationalize these instructional methods through structured prompting..."; [section 4.1] "DG1: Ensure a guided feedback loop to structure the learning journey..."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Eliciting user articulation increases design reasoning quality and metacognitive awareness compared to passive information retrieval.
- **Mechanism:** The system uses "Mentee-driven methods" (Articulating, Bounding) to force the user to externalize their design rationale before receiving feedback. By requiring the user to answer "What is the primary goal?" or "Who is the audience?", the system shifts the interaction dynamic from *Information-Request* to *Answer/Statement-Inform*.
- **Core assumption:** Forcing users to verbalize implicit constraints improves the subsequent relevance of AI feedback and the user's own understanding of the problem space.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 6.4.1] "DesignMentordrove a 12-fold increase in Answer acts..."; [section 3.4.1] "CH2. Interactions are perceived as static and one-sided..."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Grounding feedback in specific visual context via visual verification reduces generic "hallucinated" advice.
- **Mechanism:** DG6 ("Ground all feedback in the user's specific visual context") mandates a "Visual Verification" step. The LLM must first articulate what it sees before critiquing. This acts as a grounding constraint, aligning the model's latent knowledge with the specific visual features of the artifact.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM's vision capabilities are sufficient to correctly identify chart types and encodings to form a valid basis for critique.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4.2.3] "...participants felt that the AI's advice lacked credibility when it did not first confirm its understanding..."; [section 3.4.1] "CH3. Responses fall short..."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cognitive Apprenticeship Model (CAM)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the theoretical skeleton of the prompt architecture. You cannot debug the prompt without understanding the distinction between *Scaffolding* (supporting reasoning) and *Modeling* (showing solutions).
  - **Quick check question:** Can you distinguish between "Coaching" (diagnosing the current state) and "Scaffolding" (hinting at future steps)?

- **Concept: System 1 vs. System 2 Thinking**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper frames DesignMentor as a tool to force "System 2" (slow, deliberate) thinking. Understanding this helps explain why the system is sometimes preferred (exploration) and sometimes rejected (routine evaluation).
  - **Quick check question:** Does a user in the "evaluation" phase of a project likely want System 2 engagement from their tools?

- **Concept: The Nested Model for Visualization Design**
  - **Why needed here:** This provides the vocabulary for the feedback content. The study found DesignMentor provided feedback at higher levels of this model (Domain/Data & Task Abstraction) compared to the baseline (Visual Encoding).
  - **Quick check question:** If an LLM suggests changing a color palette, which level of the nested model is it operating on?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Custom GPT Wrapper -> Instructions Field (DG1-DG7) -> Knowledge Files -> Conversation Starters
- **Critical path:** 1. User uploads image 2. Visual Verification (DG6) 3. Phase 1 (Articulation/Bounding) 4. Phase 2 (Coaching/Scaffolding) 5. Phase 3 (Modeling/Reflection)
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Depth vs. Friction: Enforcing the 3-phase loop guarantees better reasoning but increases user effort/frustration for simple queries
  - Specificity vs. Generality: Strict prompting ensures "Mentor" behavior but may reduce flexibility for non-standard queries
  - Token Usage: Storing the Codebook in "Knowledge" reduces instruction tokens but requires the model to successfully retrieve those definitions
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Premature Modeling: The LLM jumps to a solution in Phase 1 or 2
  - Hallucinated Visuals: The LLM claims to see elements that do not exist
  - Infinite Articulation: The system gets stuck asking clarifying questions
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Phase Ablation: Run the prompt with *only* Phase 2 active to measure user preference when "context setting" (Phase 1) is removed
  2. Scaffold-to-Model Ratio: Measure the ratio of "Hints" vs. "Direct Solutions" in the output
  3. Blind Context Test: Feed the system visualizations with intentionally vague or contradictory goals to test if "Visual Verification" successfully overrides user error

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can an AI mentor adaptively switch between direct feedback (System 1) and scaffolded reasoning (System 2) based on user expertise and task phase?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section explicitly calls for "personalized cognitive mode switching" (Section 7.2) to balance efficiency with reflection
  - Why unresolved: The study found a static "mentor" approach caused frustration for users in evaluation phases or those wanting quick answers
  - What evidence would resolve it: An adaptive system that dynamically adjusts its prompting strategy based on real-time user engagement metrics

- **Open Question 2:** Does sustained interaction with a cognitive apprenticeship-based AI mentor result in the internalization of design reasoning skills?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section (7.6.2) explicitly asks how the framework affects "sustained engagement" and whether practitioners "gradually internalize reflective strategies"
  - Why unresolved: The study was limited to 10-minute sessions, making it impossible to determine if improvements were temporary
  - What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study tracking the design capabilities of users over weeks or months after using the system

- **Open Question 3:** How does integrating visual examples (sketches/mockups) into the feedback loop affect the efficacy of the DesignMentor framework?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section (7.6.1) notes that participants explicitly requested visual mockups
  - Why unresolved: The current implementation relies on text-based scaffolding, and it's unclear if visual examples would enhance the cognitive apprenticeship model
  - What evidence would resolve it: An A/B test comparing text-only DesignMentor against a multimodal version that generates visual artifacts

## Limitations
- The study was conducted with visualization practitioners working on their own projects, limiting generalizability to other domains
- The 10-minute interaction limit may not capture long-term learning effects or user adaptation to the system
- The baseline comparison used ChatGPT-4o without specifying system-level constraints, making the comparison somewhat uneven

## Confidence
- The core mechanism of structured CAM prompting enabling process-guided mentorship: **Medium-High**
- User preference patterns across design phases: **Medium**
- Consistent improvement in metacognitive awareness: **Medium-Low**

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain replication**: Test the DesignMentor framework with practitioners in web design, product design, or data science visualization to assess generalizability beyond the original visualization context

2. **Longitudinal learning assessment**: Conduct a study tracking the same users over multiple sessions to measure whether the process-guided mentorship leads to improved independent design reasoning skills over time

3. **Expert blind evaluation**: Have independent visualization experts evaluate the quality and appropriateness of feedback from DesignMentor versus baseline without knowing which system generated which response
