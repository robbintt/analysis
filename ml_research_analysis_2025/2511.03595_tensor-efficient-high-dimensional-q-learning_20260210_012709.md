# Tensor-Efficient High-Dimensional Q-learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.03595
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03595
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: TEQL achieves near-optimal sample-complexity scaling with sublinear regret bounds and demonstrates superior performance on classic control benchmarks through tensor decomposition and adaptive exploration

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses the exponential complexity challenge in high-dimensional reinforcement learning by proposing Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which represents Q-functions using low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition. This approach reduces parameter complexity from exponential to linear in the number of dimensions while maintaining learning effectiveness. TEQL incorporates two key innovations: Error-Uncertainty Guided Exploration that balances approximation errors with visit count-based exploration, and a frequency-based penalty term that encourages exploration of less-visited state-action pairs.

## Method Summary
TEQL combines CP tensor decomposition with adaptive exploration strategies to tackle the curse of dimensionality in reinforcement learning. The method represents Q-functions as multi-dimensional tensors using low-rank decomposition, reducing parameter space from exponential to linear complexity. Two core innovations are introduced: EUGE (Error-Uncertainty Guided Exploration) that combines approximation error estimates with upper confidence bounds based on visit counts, and a frequency penalty term added to the objective function that discourages revisiting already-explored state-action pairs. These components work together to improve sample efficiency and exploration in high-dimensional state-action spaces.

## Key Results
- TEQL achieves sublinear regret bound of Õ(√deff·T) where deff = R·N, indicating near-optimal sample-complexity scaling
- Outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL approaches on Pendulum and CartPole benchmarks in both sample efficiency and total rewards
- Ablation studies confirm frequency penalty and EUGE exploration strategy significantly contribute to performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits the low-rank structure often present in high-dimensional problems, allowing efficient representation of Q-functions through tensor decomposition. By combining approximation error guidance with visit count-based uncertainty, the exploration strategy efficiently balances exploitation of known good actions with discovery of potentially better ones. The frequency penalty creates a push-pull dynamic where the agent is encouraged to explore new areas while still exploiting known rewarding actions, leading to faster convergence and better overall performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tensor Decomposition**: Factorizes high-dimensional tensors into lower-rank components, essential for reducing parameter complexity from exponential to linear. Quick check: Verify rank R is appropriate for the problem dimensionality.
- **CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) Decomposition**: A specific tensor factorization method that represents multi-dimensional arrays as sums of rank-one tensors. Quick check: Ensure CP decomposition captures the essential structure of the state-action space.
- **Regret Bounds**: Measures cumulative loss compared to optimal policy, with sublinear bounds indicating learning efficiency. Quick check: Confirm regret scaling with effective dimension deff matches theoretical predictions.
- **Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB)**: Exploration strategy that balances exploration and exploitation by adding uncertainty bonuses. Quick check: Verify UCB term properly scales with visit counts.
- **Frequency-based Exploration**: Penalizes revisiting state-action pairs to encourage broader exploration. Quick check: Ensure frequency penalty weight is tuned appropriately for the task.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: State Space → Tensor Decomposition → CP Factors → Q-function Approximation → EUGE Exploration → Frequency Penalty → Policy Update

**Critical Path**: The most important sequence is State Space → Tensor Decomposition → Q-function Approximation → EUGE Exploration → Policy Update, as this chain directly determines learning performance and sample efficiency.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Low-rank tensor decomposition reduces parameters but may miss complex state dependencies; EUGE exploration balances uncertainty and error but requires careful tuning; frequency penalty promotes exploration but may slow convergence if over-weighted.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on problems with inherently high-rank state dependencies; slow learning when frequency penalty is too strong; exploration inefficiency when EUGE parameters are mis-tuned.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test rank parameter sensitivity on simple benchmark tasks; 2) Compare TEQL with and without frequency penalty on CartPole; 3) Evaluate EUGE exploration against standard epsilon-greedy on Pendulum.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- CP decomposition may not generalize well to state spaces with complex dependencies beyond low-rank structure
- Theoretical regret bounds depend on effective dimension assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios
- EUGE exploration strategy performance untested in high-dimensional continuous state spaces

## Confidence
- High confidence in sample efficiency improvements on tested benchmark tasks
- Medium confidence in theoretical regret bounds due to idealized assumptions
- Medium confidence in frequency penalty's contribution, as ablation results are promising but limited in scope

## Next Checks
1. Test TEQL on high-dimensional continuous control tasks like HalfCheetah or Humanoid to evaluate scalability beyond classic control benchmarks
2. Compare TEQL against state-of-the-art model-based RL methods to assess relative advantages in sample efficiency
3. Conduct experiments varying the rank parameter R to understand its impact on performance across different problem complexities
