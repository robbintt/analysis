# A Computational Framework for Interpretable Text-Based Personality Assessment from Social Media

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02811
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02811
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: SIMPA framework achieves correlation coefficient up to 0.458 for extraversion traits

## Executive Summary
This thesis presents a computational framework for interpretable text-based personality assessment from social media, addressing the gap between formal psychological inventories and colloquial online language. The SIMPA framework operationalizes personality assessment by matching user-generated statements with validated questionnaire items to provide interpretable trait scores. The work develops two large-scale datasets from Reddit (MBTI9k and PANDORA) containing personality labels and demographic information, and demonstrates that the framework significantly improves prediction accuracy while maintaining interpretability through its matching-based approach rather than black-box classification.

## Method Summary
The framework follows a three-stage process based on the Realistic Accuracy Model: first, it filters user comments to identify "Trait Indicative Statements" (TISes) by detecting sentences containing "I"; second, it matches these TISes to a repository of "Trait Relevant Statements" (TRSes) using semantic similarity; third, it aggregates the matches to generate user-level personality scores. The method uses IPIP-NEO questionnaire items as the base TRS bank, supplemented by expert-generated statements to capture colloquial expressions. For supervised prediction, it combines TIS-based features (aggregated counts reduced to 20 PCA dimensions) with Tf-Idf unigrams using Ridge Regression with 5-fold cross-validation. An unsupervised variant uses percentile ranking based on positively and negatively keyed TISes.

## Key Results
- SIMPA-based features significantly improve prediction accuracy over baselines, achieving correlation coefficients up to 0.458 for extraversion traits
- The framework demonstrates superior interpretability by providing traceable connections between user statements and personality scores
- Expert-generated TRSes improve coverage and performance compared to using only standard IPIP-NEO items
- The unsupervised percentile ranking approach shows promise for contexts where labeled data is unavailable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Trait-Constrained Semantic Matching
SIMPA bridges the lexical gap between formal psychological inventories and social media language through Trait-Constrained Semantic Similarity (TCSS). Rather than using standard semantic similarity which measures topic overlap, TCSS captures behavioral implication overlap by matching user statements (TISes) to validated questionnaire items (TRSes). This allows the system to distinguish between topically similar statements and those that actually imply personality traits, reducing "errors of omission" where colloquial expressions would be missed.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Cue Aggregation
The framework assesses personality at the lowest levels of trait taxonomy (facets) and aggregates up to domains, rather than predicting broad traits directly. This mimics psychometric scoring where domain scores are sums of their parts. By detecting specific facet-level cues (e.g., "Gregariousness," "Cheerfulness") and aggregating their relevance scores, the system provides more stable and valid domain-level scores, especially useful when users don't post enough content to reveal evidence for entire domains but may reveal strong cues for specific facets.

### Mechanism 3: The Expert/LLM Feedback Loop
The framework maintains and improves validity through a feedback loop that promotes high-quality user statements into the TRS bank. When TISes match TRSes with high confidence, experts (human or LLM) validate these statements, and validated TISes become new TRSes. This adapts formal psychological inventories to platform-specific vernacular (e.g., Reddit slang), ensuring the system captures valid personality signals from natural language expressions found "in the wild" that are functionally equivalent to formal questionnaire items.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: The Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM)**
  - Why needed: Provides theoretical justification for SIMPA's architecture, moving from supervised classification to a multi-stage psychological process (Relevance → Availability → Detection → Utilization)
  - Quick check: How does SIMPA handle the "Availability" stage differently from standard NLP models? (Answer: It explicitly acknowledges that some traits cannot be assessed if the user hasn't posted relevant content, rather than forcing a prediction)

- **Concept: Trait-Constrained Semantic Similarity (TCSS)**
  - Why needed: This is the core technical innovation; standard semantic similarity measures topic overlap, while TCSS measures behavioral implication overlap
  - Quick check: Why is "I hate working in groups" a better match for "I prefer working alone" than "I work alone often" is for "I prefer working alone"? (Context: Preference vs. Frequency/Constraint)

- **Concept: Construct Validity vs. Predictive Validity**
  - Why needed: The thesis argues that high predictive accuracy (NLP goal) is insufficient without validity (Psychology goal), explaining why SIMPA uses questionnaire items as features rather than just tf-idf vectors
  - Quick check: If a model predicts "Extraversion" using the word "party," is that valid if the user is a professional party planner who hates parties? (No, it lacks discriminant validity regarding context)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Reddit comments → Sentence tokenizer → "I"-pronoun filter → TIS detection → TRS bank (IPIP-NEO + Expert) → Sentence-Transformer similarity → Cosine similarity matrix → Aggregation → User-level trait profiles
- **Critical path:** Bank Generation (curating initial TRS list) → Thresholding (setting cosine similarity cutoff) → Aggregation (converting sparse matches to dense profiles)
- **Design tradeoffs:** Sentence vs. Clause (speed/complexity vs. precision), Static vs. Dynamic TRS bank (fixed IPIP only vs. adaptive with feedback loop), Binary vs. Continuous matching (winner-take-all vs. weighted distributions)
- **Failure signatures:** Commission Errors (high similarity for irrelevant contexts), Availability Gaps (users with high traits but low self-disclosure), Bias in TRS bank (demographic skew)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Threshold Sensitivity Analysis: Vary cosine similarity threshold (0.4 to 0.9) and measure Correct Matches to Commission Errors ratio
  2. TRS Bank Ablation: Compare IPIP-NEO only vs. IPIP-NEO + Expert TRSes on TIS retrieval recall and ground-truth correlation
  3. Facet Coverage Audit: Calculate detected TISes per facet to identify "Availability" issues and test "refusal to assess" logic

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can a formalized definition of Trait-Constrained Semantic Similarity (TCSS) be developed to explicitly handle linguistic phenomena like negation and epistemic hedging? The paper notes that while future work may develop a formalized characterization of TCSS adhering to certain similarity measures' desired properties, this pursuit is left for future research. Current implementations use off-the-shelf paraphrase detection models that don't explicitly model trait constraints or handle complex linguistic modifiers robustly.

### Open Question 2
To what extent does the SIMPA framework satisfy content validity given the potential sparsity of detected Trait Indicative Statements (TISes)? The framework relies on availability of cues in natural text, which may be unevenly distributed across facets, unlike forced-questionnaires that guarantee coverage. This can challenge content validity since users might not post enough relevant content for all facets.

### Open Question 3
Can state-of-the-art Large Language Models surpass human experts in the generation and evaluation of Trait-Relevant Statements (TRSes)? Experiments using previous-generation models (DaVinci003, GPT-3.5) with simple prompts did not exceed the performance of average human annotators, establishing a lower bound rather than exploring the upper limits of model capability.

## Limitations
- The semantic similarity mechanism's performance is highly dependent on the quality of the paraphrase detection model, with no ablation study comparing different models
- The "expert" feedback loop mechanism remains largely theoretical with limited experimental validation of its effectiveness
- The framework's generalizability beyond Reddit data is untested, as both datasets are collected from Reddit communities

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The overall framework architecture and its three-stage process (Relevance → Detection → Utilization) are well-specified and theoretically grounded
- **Medium Confidence:** The empirical results showing improved correlation coefficients (up to 0.458 for extraversion) are valid for the specific Reddit dataset used
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about the feedback loop's ability to continuously improve the TRS bank through expert validation lack sufficient experimental support

## Next Checks

1. **Semantic Model Ablation Test:** Compare TCSS performance using different semantic similarity models (e.g., Sentence-BERT vs. RoBERTa vs. multilingual models) to establish robustness to model choice
2. **Feedback Loop Efficacy Study:** Implement a controlled experiment testing whether expert-validated TIS promotion actually improves prediction accuracy over time versus a static TRS bank
3. **Cross-Platform Generalization Test:** Apply the framework to personality-labeled data from non-Reddit sources (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) to evaluate domain transfer capabilities and identify platform-specific biases
