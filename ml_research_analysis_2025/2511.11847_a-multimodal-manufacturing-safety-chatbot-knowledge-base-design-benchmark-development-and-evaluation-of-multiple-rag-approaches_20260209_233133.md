# A Multimodal Manufacturing Safety Chatbot: Knowledge Base Design, Benchmark Development, and Evaluation of Multiple RAG Approaches

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11847
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11847
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Multimodal chatbot achieving 86.66% accuracy, 10.04-second latency, and $0.005 per query for manufacturing safety training

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a multimodal chatbot system designed for manufacturing safety training in Industry 5.0 environments. The system employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide accurate, low-latency, and cost-effective safety guidance by grounding responses in authoritative regulatory and technical documentation. The research addresses critical challenges in providing accessible safety information to manufacturing workers while maintaining compliance with industry standards.

The work presents a comprehensive framework including domain-specific benchmark development, systematic evaluation of 24 RAG configurations using full-factorial design, and expert validation of the top-performing configuration. The approach balances technical performance with practical considerations of cost and responsiveness, making it suitable for real-world deployment in manufacturing settings where safety compliance is paramount.

## Method Summary
The research team developed a multimodal chatbot system that combines RAG architecture with domain-specific knowledge bases for manufacturing safety. They created a benchmark dataset for three representative manufacturing machines and systematically tested 24 different RAG configurations using a full-factorial experimental design. The configurations varied parameters including retrieval methods, chunking strategies, and model parameters. Expert evaluators validated the top-performing configuration through structured assessment, measuring accuracy, latency, and cost per query to identify the optimal balance for practical deployment.

## Key Results
- Achieved 86.66% accuracy in expert evaluation of safety responses
- Maintained 10.04-second average latency for query responses
- Delivered cost-effective performance at $0.005 per query
- Identified optimal RAG configuration balancing accuracy, speed, and cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages RAG architecture to combine the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches. By retrieving relevant information from authoritative safety documentation and regulatory sources, the chatbot grounds its responses in verified information rather than relying solely on pre-trained knowledge. The multimodal capability allows processing of both text and visual inputs, enabling the system to handle diverse safety scenarios including machine-specific hazards and emergency procedures. The systematic benchmarking and full-factorial design ensure that the selected configuration is truly optimal rather than coincidentally performing well on a limited test set.

## Foundational Learning

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines information retrieval with text generation to provide accurate, context-aware responses. Why needed: Ensures responses are grounded in authoritative safety documentation rather than potentially outdated or incorrect pre-trained knowledge. Quick check: Verify retrieved documents contain relevant safety information before generating response.

**Multimodal Processing**: Handles both text and visual inputs for comprehensive safety assessment. Why needed: Manufacturing safety often requires visual inspection of equipment and environments alongside procedural knowledge. Quick check: Test system with combined text-image queries representing real safety scenarios.

**Full-Factorial Design**: Systematically varies all configuration parameters to identify optimal combinations. Why needed: Ensures comprehensive evaluation of RAG parameters rather than testing in isolation. Quick check: Confirm all parameter combinations were tested and results are statistically significant.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> Text/Image Processing -> RAG Engine -> Knowledge Base -> Response Generation -> Expert Validation

**Critical Path**: Query processing → Document retrieval → Context selection → Response generation → Output delivery

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Accuracy vs. latency: More comprehensive retrieval improves accuracy but increases response time
- Cost vs. comprehensiveness: Larger knowledge bases improve coverage but increase operational costs
- Multimodal complexity vs. usability: Supporting images improves capability but adds processing overhead

**Failure Signatures**:
- Inaccurate responses: Indicates poor document retrieval or context selection
- High latency: Suggests inefficient retrieval or generation processes
- Low cost-effectiveness: Points to suboptimal parameter configuration

**First Experiments**:
1. Test basic text-only queries with simplified knowledge base to verify core RAG functionality
2. Evaluate single machine safety scenario with multimodal inputs to validate image processing
3. Compare different chunking strategies on representative safety documentation to optimize retrieval

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Validation limited to three representative machines, potentially missing diverse manufacturing scenarios
- Small expert panel (four participants) may introduce bias and limit generalizability
- Performance metrics specific to tested infrastructure may not transfer to different hardware configurations

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Technical implementation details and benchmark development methodology are well-documented and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: Performance metrics (86.66% accuracy, 10.04-second latency, $0.005 per query) were validated through expert evaluation, though small sample size limits generalizability.

**Low Confidence**: Scalability claims are not supported by concurrent usage testing or analysis of performance under load conditions.

## Next Checks

1. Expand benchmark to include at least 10 different machine types across various manufacturing sectors to assess generalizability beyond the initial three representative machines.

2. Conduct longitudinal study over 3-6 months with 20+ end-users to evaluate real-world effectiveness and identify edge cases not captured in controlled testing.

3. Perform stress testing with 100+ concurrent users to verify scalability and measure performance degradation under realistic load conditions.
