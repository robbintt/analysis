# Transforming Datasets to Requested Complexity with Projection-based Many-Objective Genetic Algorithm

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.15132
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15132
- **Reference count:** 28
- **Primary result:** Genetic algorithm optimizes problem complexity measures through linear feature projections to achieve target difficulty levels for classification and regression tasks

## Executive Summary
This work presents a genetic algorithm approach for transforming datasets to achieve specific complexity targets through linear feature projections. The method uses a many-objective optimization framework to adjust classification and regression datasets toward desired complexity levels measured by established complexity metrics. By optimizing multiple complexity measures simultaneously, the algorithm can generate datasets with varying difficulty levels suitable for testing and benchmarking machine learning models.

The approach demonstrates that dataset complexity can be effectively controlled through systematic transformations, enabling researchers to create datasets with precisely calibrated difficulty levels. Experiments with state-of-the-art classifiers and regressors confirm that the generated datasets exhibit complexity levels that correlate with model performance, validating the effectiveness of the transformation approach.

## Method Summary
The method employs a many-objective genetic algorithm that optimizes a set of complexity measures for both classification and regression tasks. For classification, 10 complexity measures are used, while 4 measures are selected for regression based on their optimization capabilities. The algorithm transforms synthetically created datasets by applying linear feature projections to achieve target complexity values specified by hyperparameters.

The genetic algorithm evolves a population of candidate solutions representing linear transformation matrices. Each candidate is evaluated based on its ability to transform the original dataset to match the target complexity profile across multiple measures. The optimization process iteratively refines these transformations through selection, crossover, and mutation operations until convergence toward the desired complexity targets.

## Key Results
- The genetic algorithm successfully transforms synthetic datasets to achieve specific target complexity values for both classification and regression tasks
- Evaluation with state-of-the-art classifiers and regressors shows a strong correlation between generated dataset complexity and model recognition performance
- The approach enables systematic adjustment of problem difficulty levels through hyperparameter specification of target complexity measures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on the premise that dataset complexity, as measured by established metrics, directly influences model performance. By using a many-objective genetic algorithm to optimize linear feature projections, the method can systematically adjust multiple complexity dimensions simultaneously. The linear transformations modify feature relationships and distributions in ways that correspond to changes in complexity measures, effectively "dialing" the problem difficulty up or down toward specified targets.

## Foundational Learning

**Complexity Measures** - Mathematical metrics that quantify dataset difficulty characteristics. Needed to provide objective targets for optimization and to evaluate transformation success. Quick check: Verify that selected measures capture diverse aspects of dataset complexity (linearity, separability, feature redundancy).

**Many-Objective Optimization** - Optimization involving more than three competing objectives simultaneously. Required to balance multiple complexity measures that may conflict with each other. Quick check: Confirm Pareto front convergence and diversity across all objective dimensions.

**Genetic Algorithms** - Population-based stochastic optimization method inspired by natural selection. Essential for exploring the high-dimensional space of possible linear transformations. Quick check: Monitor population diversity and convergence rate across generations.

**Linear Feature Projections** - Matrix operations that transform feature space while preserving linear relationships. Chosen for computational efficiency and interpretability. Quick check: Verify projection matrices maintain data integrity while achieving target complexity shifts.

**Pareto Optimization** - Approach for finding optimal trade-offs among competing objectives. Critical for handling conflicting complexity measure targets. Quick check: Analyze Pareto front distribution to ensure meaningful complexity trade-offs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Original Dataset -> Complexity Measure Calculator -> Genetic Algorithm -> Linear Transformation Matrices -> Transformed Dataset -> Complexity Validation -> Model Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path:**
Dataset preparation → Complexity measure calculation → Genetic algorithm optimization loop → Linear transformation application → Complexity validation → Model performance testing

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Linear vs. non-linear transformations (computational efficiency vs. expressive power)
- Number of complexity measures (comprehensiveness vs. optimization difficulty)
- Synthetic vs. real data (control vs. practical relevance)
- Genetic algorithm parameters (exploration vs. convergence speed)

**Failure Signatures:**
- Inability to reach target complexity values despite optimization
- Convergence to local optima with poor Pareto front diversity
- Complexity transformations that don't correlate with model performance
- Excessive computational time for large datasets or many objectives

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify complexity measure calculation accuracy on benchmark datasets
2. Test genetic algorithm convergence on simple linear transformation problems
3. Validate correlation between complexity changes and classifier performance on transformed datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Relies entirely on synthetically generated datasets rather than real-world data, potentially limiting practical applicability
- Linear transformation approach may have insufficient expressive power for complex data distributions
- Computational cost of many-objective genetic algorithms may be prohibitive for large-scale applications
- Limited exploration of alternative complexity measures beyond the selected subset

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The genetic algorithm successfully optimizes complexity measures toward targets in controlled synthetic settings

**Medium confidence:** The correlation between generated complexity and model performance generalizes to practical scenarios

**Medium confidence:** Linear feature projections are sufficient for meaningful dataset complexity transformation

## Next Checks

1. Test the algorithm on real-world datasets to verify that complexity transformations translate to meaningful changes in model performance

2. Compare results with non-linear transformation approaches to assess whether linear projections are sufficient for effective complexity manipulation

3. Conduct ablation studies to determine which specific complexity measures contribute most significantly to the observed performance correlations
