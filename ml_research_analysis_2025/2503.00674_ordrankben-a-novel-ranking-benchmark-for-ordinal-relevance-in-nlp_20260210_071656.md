# OrdRankBen: A Novel Ranking Benchmark for Ordinal Relevance in NLP

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.00674
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00674
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: OrdRankBen introduces ordinal relevance labels (1-5 scale) to improve fine-grained ranking evaluation in NLP

## Executive Summary
OrdRankBen addresses a critical gap in existing NLP ranking benchmarks by introducing structured ordinal relevance labels. Traditional benchmarks rely on binary or continuous relevance scores, which either oversimplify distinctions or lack the structured ordinal relationships needed for nuanced evaluation. This benchmark incorporates 1-5 scale ordinal labels to capture multi-granularity relevance differences, enabling more precise discrimination between ranked items. The benchmark includes two datasets (document and passage ranking) with distinct label distributions and evaluates nine models across three categories: ranking-based language models, general LLMs, and ranking-focused LLMs.

## Method Summary
The OrdRankBen benchmark introduces a novel approach to ranking evaluation by incorporating ordinal relevance labels that capture nuanced distinctions in item relevance. The benchmark consists of two datasets: one for document ranking and another for passage ranking, each with carefully curated label distributions. Nine models spanning three categories (ranking-based LMs, general LLMs, and ranking-focused LLMs) were evaluated using standard ranking metrics ERR and nDCG. The experimental setup systematically compares model performance across these datasets, highlighting the advantages of ordinal labels in capturing fine-grained relevance differences that binary or continuous labels might miss.

## Key Results
- General LLMs (GPTmini and LInstruct) significantly outperform ranking-based and ranking-focused LLMs across both datasets
- nDCG demonstrates higher sensitivity to cutoff points and imposes heavier penalties than ERR, making it more suitable for applications requiring strict relevance thresholds
- Ordinal relevance labels effectively enhance the ability to discern fine-grained distinctions among ranked items, crucial for tasks requiring precise relevance differentiation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of OrdRankBen stems from its use of structured ordinal labels that capture multi-level relevance distinctions, unlike binary labels that oversimplify or continuous labels that lack clear ordinal relationships. By incorporating a 1-5 scale, the benchmark enables models to learn and evaluate nuanced relevance hierarchies, which is particularly important for tasks where fine-grained relevance discrimination directly impacts user satisfaction and task performance. The benchmark's design also allows for more meaningful comparisons between models by providing a richer evaluation framework that reflects real-world ranking challenges.

## Foundational Learning
- **Ordinal Relevance Labels**: Multi-level categorization system (1-5 scale) that captures nuanced relevance distinctions beyond binary or continuous scoring; needed because traditional labels oversimplify relevance relationships; quick check: verify label distribution consistency across datasets
- **Ranking Metrics (ERR/nDCG)**: Evaluation metrics that measure ranking quality, with ERR focusing on expected reciprocal rank and nDCG incorporating position-based discounting; needed to quantify model performance with different sensitivity to cutoffs; quick check: compare metric values across varying cutoff points
- **Benchmark Dataset Curation**: Process of selecting and annotating data with ordinal labels to ensure diverse and representative evaluation scenarios; needed to validate model generalization across different ranking contexts; quick check: analyze label distribution balance across categories

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Datasets (Document/Passage) -> Model Categories (Ranking-based LMs, General LLMs, Ranking-focused LLMs) -> Evaluation Metrics (ERR, nDCG)

**Critical Path**
Data preparation with ordinal labels → Model training/evaluation → Metric computation → Performance analysis and comparison

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Ordinal labels provide richer relevance information but require more complex annotation
- Multiple model categories enable comprehensive evaluation but increase computational requirements
- Using both ERR and nDCG captures different aspects of ranking quality but may lead to conflicting conclusions

**Failure Signatures**
- Inconsistent label distributions across datasets leading to unfair comparisons
- Metric sensitivity issues where cutoff values disproportionately affect results
- Model category imbalance where certain types systematically outperform others

**First Experiments**
1. Compare model performance using binary vs. ordinal relevance labels on the same datasets
2. Test different cutoff values in nDCG to identify optimal thresholds for various ranking tasks
3. Evaluate additional ranking models from emerging architectures not included in the original nine

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability due to evaluation on only two specific datasets (document and passage ranking)
- Unclear whether general LLM performance advantages stem from architecture or training data differences
- Lack of empirical evidence comparing ordinal vs. binary relevance impact on actual downstream task performance

## Confidence
- Benchmark design and methodology: High
- Comparative model performance results: Medium
- Claims about ordinal relevance superiority: Low
- Generalizability across ranking tasks: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing ordinal vs. binary relevance labels on actual downstream task performance (e.g., information retrieval effectiveness, user satisfaction metrics)
2. Test model performance on additional ranking datasets from diverse domains (e-commerce, recommendation systems, question answering) to validate benchmark generalizability
3. Investigate the impact of different cutoff values in nDCG across various ranking tasks to establish best practices for metric selection
