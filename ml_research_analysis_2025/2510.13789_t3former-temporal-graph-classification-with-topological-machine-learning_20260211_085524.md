- Introduces T3former, a Topological Temporal Transformer for temporal graph classification with state-of-the-art performance

## Executive Summary
T3former is a novel approach for temporal graph classification that integrates topological and spectral descriptors into a transformer-based framework. The method uses sliding windows to capture topological features (Betti numbers) and spectral features (density of states) as first-class tokens, which are processed through dedicated attention modules and fused with structural embeddings from GraphSAGE. This design preserves temporal fidelity while enhancing robustness through topological invariants, achieving superior performance across social, brain, and traffic network benchmarks.

## Method Summary
T3former processes temporal graphs by sliding windows over time to capture evolving topological and spectral features. Betti numbers quantify topological features like connected components and loops, while the density of states captures spectral properties of the graph Laplacian. These descriptors are embedded as tokens and processed through Descriptor-Attention modules, then fused with global structural embeddings from GraphSAGE. The transformer architecture enables flexible sequence modeling while maintaining temporal information without rigid discretization. The method includes theoretical stability guarantees under temporal and structural perturbations.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple temporal graph classification benchmarks
- Superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing temporal graph neural networks
- Demonstrates robustness through topological invariants and theoretical stability guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
T3former's effectiveness stems from integrating topological invariants (Betti numbers) and spectral descriptors (density of states) as first-class tokens in a transformer architecture. This preserves temporal fidelity while capturing both local and global structural patterns. The sliding window approach avoids rigid snapshot discretization, maintaining temporal information flow. The fusion of topological, spectral, and structural embeddings provides complementary views of graph evolution, while the transformer's attention mechanism dynamically weighs different temporal and structural aspects.

## Foundational Learning

**Topological Data Analysis (T0)**
Why needed: Captures intrinsic structural invariants (connected components, loops) that are robust to noise and deformation
Quick check: Compute Betti numbers for simple synthetic graphs with known topology

**Spectral Graph Theory (S1)**
Why needed: Provides frequency-domain perspective on graph structure through Laplacian eigenvalues
Quick check: Verify density of states captures expected spectral properties for different graph types

**Temporal Graph Processing (T1)**
Why needed: Models dynamic evolution of graph structure over time
Quick check: Ensure sliding window captures meaningful temporal transitions in graph structure

**Graph Neural Networks (G0)**
Why needed: Extracts node-level and graph-level representations from structural data
Quick check: Validate GraphSAGE embeddings capture relevant structural features

**Transformer Architecture (T2)**
Why needed: Handles variable-length sequences and captures long-range dependencies
Quick check: Verify attention weights meaningfully distinguish between different temporal patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Raw Temporal Graph -> Sliding Window -> Betti Numbers + Density of States -> Descriptor-Attention Modules -> GraphSAGE Embeddings -> Fusion Layer -> Classification Head

**Critical Path:**
The most compute-intensive operations are Betti number calculations and attention computations. Bottlenecks typically occur during topological feature extraction for large graphs and attention matrix calculations for long sequences.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Sliding windows vs. continuous processing: Windows preserve computational tractability but may miss fine-grained temporal transitions. Topological vs. spectral features: Both capture complementary information but have different computational costs and sensitivity to noise.

**Failure Signatures:**
Poor performance on very sparse graphs where topological features are uninformative, degradation on extremely long sequences due to attention complexity, and sensitivity to window size selection which affects temporal resolution.

**First Experiments:**
1. Ablation study removing topological features to quantify their contribution
2. Sensitivity analysis varying window size and step size
3. Performance comparison on graphs with different levels of temporal regularity
