# Continuity-Preserving Convolutional Autoencoders for Learning Continuous Latent Dynamical Models from Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.00754
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00754
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces continuity-preserving convolutional autoencoders (CpAEs) that learn continuous latent states from discrete image frames, achieving VPT scores of 99.2, 72.1, and 69.1 on damped, elastic, and double pendulum simulations respectively, outperforming standard autoencoders and competitive methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning continuous latent dynamical models from discrete image frames, where standard convolutional autoencoders often fail to produce latent states that evolve continuously with the underlying dynamics. The authors propose continuity-preserving convolutional autoencoders (CpAEs) that incorporate a mathematical formulation for learning dynamics from images and establish a sufficient condition showing that latent states evolve continuously if convolution filters are Lipschitz continuous. They introduce a regularizer to promote filter continuity and preserve latent state continuity, enabling accurate predictions and interpolation between observed states.

## Method Summary
The CpAE approach involves training an autoencoder with a proposed continuity regularizer on convolution filters, followed by separately learning a continuous dynamical model (e.g., Neural ODE) for the latent dynamics. The method differs from existing approaches that train autoencoders and dynamical models simultaneously. The encoder uses large 12×12 filters in the first three layers with a nonlocal operator regularizer to enforce filter Lipschitz continuity. After training the CpAE, a separate Neural ODE is fit to the latent trajectories. The approach is validated on simulation datasets (damped pendulum, elastic pendulum, double pendulum) and real-world datasets (double pendulum, swing stick), demonstrating superior performance in terms of Valid Prediction Time (VPT) and continuous latent state evolution.

## Key Results
- CpAEs achieve VPT scores of 99.2, 72.1, and 69.1 on damped, elastic, and double pendulum simulations respectively
- Outperforms standard autoencoders (50.7, 30.6, 24.3) and competitive methods like Neural ODEs, HNNs, and SympNets
- Successfully learns latent states that evolve continuously with time, enabling accurate predictions and interpolation between observed states
- On real-world datasets (double pendulum, swing stick), CpAEs show superior performance despite complex backgrounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Theoretical Link (Filter Continuity → Latent Continuity)
- **Claim:** If convolution filters are Lipschitz continuous, the encoder outputs latent states that evolve continuously with the underlying physical dynamics, even when inputs are discrete pixel observations.
- **Mechanism:** The paper introduces "$\delta$-continuity" (Def 3.1), a relaxed continuity definition for discretized data. Theorem 3.1 proves that for rigid body motion, the Lipschitz constant of the filters ($c_W$) bounds the rate of change of the latent states. If $c_W$ is small (filters are smooth), then $\|z_{n+1} - z_n\| \le c_E \Delta t$, satisfying the prerequisite for continuous dynamics.
- **Core assumption:** The underlying system is a rigid body motion on a 2D plane; pixel resolution $\delta$ is sufficiently small.

### Mechanism 2: Implementation of Filter Continuity (Non-Local Regularizer)
- **Claim:** Adding a specific penalty term to the loss function forces the learned convolution filters to become Lipschitz continuous, thereby activating Mechanism 1.
- **Mechanism:** The paper uses a regularizer $J$ (Eq. 6) based on non-local operators. It penalizes squared differences between filter weights at grid points $(i_1\delta, i_2\delta)$ and $(j_1\delta, j_2\delta)$, weighted by a Gaussian kernel. This explicitly enforces the condition $|W(y_1) - W(y_2)| \le c_W \|y_1 - y_2\|$ required by Theorem 3.1.
- **Core assumption:** Enforcing this smoothness on filter weights does not destroy the encoder's ability to reconstruct complex images (addressed by using large filter sizes).

### Mechanism 3: Decoupled Training for Latent Space Preparation
- **Claim:** Training the autoencoder and the dynamical model separately, rather than jointly, yields a cleaner continuous latent space.
- **Mechanism:** Standard methods (e.g., HNN+AE) use a joint loss $L = L_{recon} + L_{dynamics}$. This paper trains the CpAE first (Reconstruction + Eq. 6 Regularizer). Once the latent space is "prepared" to be continuous, a separate Neural ODE is fit to the trajectories. This prevents the dynamics model from overfitting to a discontinuous latent space.
- **Core assumption:** A continuous latent manifold exists and can be approximated by the autoencoder before dynamics are learned.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Lipschitz Continuity
- **Why needed here:** The core theoretical guarantee (Theorem 3.1) is built on this mathematical definition of smoothness.
- **Quick check question:** Can you explain why bounding the slope of a function ($K$ in $|f(x)-f(y)| \le K|x,y|$) prevents sudden jumps in the output?

### Concept: $\delta$-Continuity (Relaxed Continuity)
- **Why needed here:** Standard continuity breaks down for pixel data because small physical changes might not change the pixel grid. The paper defines this new term to handle that.
- **Quick check question:** Why is a standard Lipschitz continuous function $f(x)$ not necessarily capable of making $f(\text{pixelated } x)$ continuous?

### Concept: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs)
- **Why needed here:** This is the "dynamical model" component that is trained *after* the CpAE. Understanding that it models $dz/dt = f_\theta(z)$ is crucial.
- **Quick check question:** How does a Neural ODE differ from a standard Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in how it handles time steps?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Image Input (3x128x256) -> [Encoder] Large Kernel Layers (1-3: 12×12, stride 2) + Regularizer Eq. 6 -> Standard Conv Layers (4-8: 4×4) -> Latent State (dim 2 or 8) -> [Dynamics] Separate Neural ODE Training -> Future Latent State -> [Decoder] Transposed Convs -> Predicted Image
- **Critical path:** The implementation of the **Continuity Regularizer (Eq. 6)** on the first 3 encoder layers. This is the novel intervention. Without it, the pipeline defaults to a standard AE with discontinuous latents.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Filter Size:** Theorem requires large filters ($J_l \propto 1/\delta$) for continuity. The paper uses $12 \times 12$ vs standard $4 \times 4$. Larger filters are computationally heavier but necessary for the theorem's conditions.
  - **Regularizer Weight ($\lambda_J$):** Controls the trade-off between reconstruction quality (image sharpness) and latent continuity (smooth trajectories). Tuning is required.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Discontinuous Latent Trajectories:** Visualizing latent states over time shows zig-zag/jagged lines
  - **Poor Interpolation:** Model cannot predict states between training frames or reverse time
  - **Low VPT:** Valid Prediction Time drops quickly, especially on chaotic systems
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Circular Motion Sanity Check:** Train on the simple 220-image dataset. Compare `Standard AE` vs `AE + L2` vs `CpAE`. Plot the latent states (aim: CpAE should yield a circle, others noisy/jagged).
  2. **Ablation on Filter Size:** Train on Damped Pendulum. Compare standard small kernels ($4 \times 4$) vs the proposed large kernels ($12 \times 12$) with the regularizer. Expect standard kernels to fail continuity.
  3. **Interpolation Task:** Train on Elastic Pendulum. Test prediction at $t=0.5$ given $t=0$ and $t=1$. CpAE (via Neural ODE) should interpolate smoothly; baseline (discrete) models may fail.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Can the continuity analysis be generalized to non-rigid motion and the projection of three-dimensional motion onto a two-dimensional plane?** The authors state their continuity quantification is currently limited to rigid body motion in a 2D plane, leaving non-rigid and 3D-to-2D projection analysis for future research.
- **Can Vision Transformers (ViTs) effectively serve as autoencoders in this framework given their patch-based operations?** The authors suggest investigating "advanced architectures, such as Vision Transformers" as the mathematical formulation is not restricted to CNNs.
- **How can the robustness of CpAEs be improved to handle high visual complexity and significant background noise?** The authors note a "decline in performance" in the swing-stick task due to "complex backgrounds with significant noise," highlighting a need for sophisticated approaches.
- **Can hypernetworks enforce filter continuity more effectively than the proposed regularization term?** The authors mention that future research could explore "more effective methods, such as hypernetworks," rather than the adopted simple regularization.

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework (Theorem 3.1) is restricted to rigid body motion in 2D, limiting its applicability to more complex, non-rigid dynamics
- The continuity regularizer requires careful tuning of λJ, and the optimal value may vary across datasets
- The approach depends on having high enough pixel resolution (δ) to satisfy the large filter size requirement (J_l ∝ 1/δ), which may be computationally prohibitive for high-resolution imagery

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The empirical demonstration that CpAEs produce smoother latent trajectories than standard autoencoders (Fig. 6, VPT improvements across all datasets)
- **Medium Confidence:** The theoretical connection between filter Lipschitz continuity and latent state continuity, given its restriction to rigid body motion and idealized conditions
- **Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of the specific regularizer formulation (Eq. 6) in practice, though this is well-supported by ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. **Non-rigid Motion Test:** Apply CpAE to a dataset with non-rigid dynamics (e.g., fluid flow, elastic deformation) and quantify whether the theoretical guarantees break down while empirical performance remains adequate
2. **Real-world Scalability:** Test on high-resolution (e.g., 256×256 or higher) real-world video datasets to evaluate whether the large filter requirement remains computationally feasible and theoretically sound
3. **Regularizer Ablation:** Systematically vary λJ across multiple orders of magnitude on a single dataset and measure the trade-off between reconstruction quality and latent continuity, identifying the optimal operating regime
