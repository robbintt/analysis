# Foundations of LLM Knowledge Materialization: Termination, Reproducibility, Robustness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06780
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06780
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: GPTKB reliably surfaces core LLM knowledge, especially when using ensembling techniques, with high termination rates for GPT-4.1-mini but model-dependent behavior for other models.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates the fundamental properties of LLM knowledge materialization using the GPTKB methodology. The authors examine whether knowledge extraction terminates, how reproducible it is, and how robust it is to variations in seeds, languages, temperatures, and models. Through extensive experiments across three domain-specific miniGPTKBs (Babylon, The Big Bang Theory, DAX 40), the study reveals that while termination is generally achievable with GPT-4.1-mini, other models show model-dependent behavior. Reproducibility shows high semantic consistency but modest lexical similarity, with semantic similarity at 0.89 for named entities. Robustness is strong against seed and temperature changes but weaker for language and model variations, with certain languages causing non-termination due to synonym proliferation.

## Method Summary
The GPTKB methodology employs a prompt-based Breadth-First Search (BFS) for knowledge extraction. Starting from seed entities, the system generates (subject, predicate, object) triples using Knowledge Elicitation prompts, then classifies objects as Named Entities or Literals via NER prompts. Named Entities become new subjects for subsequent BFS layers, continuing until the domain is exhausted or termination criteria are met. The study uses three domain-specific miniGPTKBs (babylonGPTKB, tbbtGPTKB, dax40GPTKB) with 10 seed entities each, testing termination, reproducibility (30 runs across topics), and robustness (seed, language, temperature, model variations). Metrics include yield with coefficient of variation, lexical similarity via Jaccard index, and semantic similarity via cosine-based Hausdorff similarity and bidirectional semantic match percentage.

## Key Results
- GPT-4.1-mini achieves high termination rates (~3h runtime, ~20 BFS-depth) while open-source models show model-dependent termination with some failing to terminate after 96h
- Lexical similarity for named entities is 0.33 but semantic similarity is 0.89, indicating consistent semantic knowledge despite lexical variation
- Simple intersection ensembling across 3+ runs improves semantic matches from 58.3% to 75% without external verification
- Non-English languages (Italian, German, French) show non-termination due to endless synonym generation, while other languages terminate reliably

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Recursive Exhaustion via BFS Saturation
The GPTKB method employs BFS-style recursive extraction where an initial seed entity spawns triples, and objects identified as Named Entities become subjects for subsequent layers. Termination occurs when the domain exhausts the model's known entities and NER successfully filters non-entities. This works because LLMs possess finite domain knowledge and can recognize entity boundaries. Evidence shows high termination rates with GPT-4.1-mini and consistent BFS-depth (~20) across runs. The mechanism fails if the model enters hallucination loops or suffers verbosity compensation.

### Mechanism 2: Semantic Convergence via Popularity Anchoring
While lexical extraction is noisy, semantic knowledge is structured around high-frequency concepts. Popular entities (high pre-training frequency/Wikidata presence) are retrieved consistently across runs with high semantic similarity (0.89), while long-tail knowledge varies significantly. The extraction process reflects training data distribution where popular entities have denser, more deterministic representations. This mechanism weakens for domains/entities not found in Wikidata where the model relies on sparse embeddings.

### Mechanism 3: Ensembling for Noise Filtering
Intersection-based ensembling effectively separates stable knowledge from generation noise. By running extraction N times and retaining triples appearing in ≥k runs (e.g., k=3), the probability of retaining random hallucinations drops significantly while core knowledge persists. Hallucinations are uncorrelated across runs while true knowledge is semantically consistent. The "elbow" at k=3 for shared triples across topics demonstrates this effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Crawling vs. Probing**: Understanding why termination is questioned - crawling is open-ended generation while probing checks specific facts. Quick check: Does the system stop because it "knows everything" or because it "runs out of prompts"?

- **Lexical vs. Semantic Similarity**: Interpreting reproducibility results - "0.33 Jaccard similarity" (low lexical match) and "0.89 Cosine similarity" (high semantic match) means the model says the same thing in different words. Quick check: If Run 1 outputs "Sheldon Cooper" and Run 2 outputs "Dr. Cooper", is that a lexical or semantic match?

- **Verbosity Compensation**: Diagnosing why some models fail to terminate - generating "Elam's government" then "Elam's government during the Babylonian period" as distinct entities indicates this failure mode.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Topic Constraint -> Knowledge Elicitation -> NER Filter -> Queue Manager -> Consolidator
- **Critical path**: The Prompt -> NER -> Queue loop. If NER is too permissive (classifying literals as entities), the Queue grows indefinitely, breaking termination.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Cost vs. Stability (single runs ~$2 but noisy; ensembling 3× cost for high-precision core knowledge); Breadth vs. Depth (BFS-depth caps find obscure connections but risk drifting off-topic).
- **Failure signatures**: Non-Termination (exponentially increasing triples with flat BFS depth indicating looping); Entity Bloat (high yield of entities not found in Wikidata indicating hallucination); Language Drift (non-English prompts lead to 3× higher yields and non-termination).
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Domain Isolation - run miniGPTKB on narrow domain you know well to verify termination and precision; 2) Temperature Stress Test - run at Temp 0.0 vs Temp 1.0 to verify temperature similarity claims; 3) Ensemble Validation - run 5 extractions, calculate intersection @ k=3, manually inspect dropped triples for noise vs edge-cases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Will open-domain GPTKB knowledge extraction ever terminate, or is it fundamentally unbounded? The paper shows expensive open-domain runs ($3k-$14k) haven't terminated, suggesting non-termination may be fundamental rather than just time-consuming.

- **Open Question 2**: What specific model properties or training characteristics determine termination capability? Three of six tested models failed to terminate with different failure modes (repetitive loops, verbosity compensation), but causal factors remain unclear.

- **Open Question 3**: Why do certain languages (Italian, German, French) cause non-termination while others with similar resource levels terminate reliably? The pattern of endless synonym generation is observed but not explained, with weak correlation to web distribution.

- **Open Question 4**: What is the comprehensive factual accuracy of LLM-materialized knowledge bases across domains? Small-scale evaluation showed 93-95% accuracy, but systematic accuracy assessment across domains and extraction settings is missing.

## Limitations
- The paper intentionally left factual accuracy evaluation out of the study, examining only termination, reproducibility, and robustness properties
- Open-domain extraction termination remains unproven with expensive runs not yet completing after extensive time
- Language-specific termination issues (Italian, German, French) are observed but not fully explained, with unclear whether future termination is possible

## Confidence
- High: Termination with GPT-4.1-mini and reproducibility metrics (well-defined, extensive experiments across 3 topics with 30 runs)
- Medium: Semantic similarity findings and robustness to temperature/seed variations (based on experimental results but requires external validation)
- Low: Language termination patterns and open-domain termination claims (limited evidence, multiple failure modes observed)

## Next Checks
- Verify termination behavior by running a controlled experiment with GPT-4.1-mini on a narrow domain you know well, monitoring triple generation rate and BFS depth
- Test the temperature robustness claim by running extractions at Temp 0.0 vs Temp 1.0 and comparing yield and similarity metrics
- Validate the ensembling effectiveness by running 5 extractions, computing intersection @ k=3, and manually inspecting dropped triples to confirm they are noise rather than edge-cases
