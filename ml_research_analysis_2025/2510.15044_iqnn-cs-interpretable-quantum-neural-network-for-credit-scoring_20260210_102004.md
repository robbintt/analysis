# IQNN-CS: Interpretable Quantum Neural Network for Credit Scoring

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15044
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15044
- Reference count: 40
- Model achieves 100% accuracy on Dataset 1 and 77.3% on Dataset 2

## Executive Summary
IQNN-CS presents an interpretable quantum neural network framework specifically designed for multiclass credit scoring applications. The hybrid classical-quantum architecture combines variational quantum circuits with post-hoc explanation techniques and introduces a novel Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA) metric to assess attribution divergence across classes. The framework addresses the critical need for transparency in financial decision-making by providing both high accuracy and interpretable quantum embeddings that reveal model reasoning patterns.

The work demonstrates that quantum neural networks can achieve strong performance on credit scoring tasks while maintaining interpretability through attribution analysis. By applying the model to two real-world credit datasets, the authors show how ICAA can detect attribution inconsistencies and identify when model explanations may be unreliable. This dual focus on accuracy and interpretability positions IQNN-CS as a promising approach for deploying quantum machine learning in high-stakes financial applications where transparency is essential.

## Method Summary
IQNN-CS employs a hybrid classical-quantum architecture that integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with post-hoc explanation techniques to create an interpretable credit scoring model. The framework begins with classical preprocessing to encode financial features into quantum states, followed by parameterized quantum circuits that generate embeddings for each credit applicant. These quantum embeddings are then processed through classical layers for final classification into multiple credit risk categories.

The key innovation lies in the Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA) metric, which quantifies attribution divergence across different credit classes to assess explanation consistency. This metric helps identify when model attributions are reliable versus when they may be misleading due to overlapping feature contributions across classes. The authors also employ established interpretability techniques like Integrated Gradients alongside ICAA to provide comprehensive explanation of model decisions. The entire pipeline is trained end-to-end, with quantum circuit parameters optimized through classical backpropagation.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% accuracy and 1.00 F1-score on Dataset 1 (first real-world credit dataset)
- Achieved 77.3% accuracy and 0.78 F1-score on Dataset 2 (second real-world credit dataset)
- ICAA metric successfully identified attribution inconsistencies, revealing well-separated embeddings in Dataset 1 versus overlapping clusters in Dataset 2

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid architecture leverages quantum advantage in feature mapping while maintaining classical control over interpretability. Variational quantum circuits can create complex, non-linear quantum embeddings that capture intricate patterns in credit data more effectively than classical methods alone. The quantum embeddings provide a rich representation space where similar credit profiles cluster together, while the post-hoc explanation techniques and ICAA metric ensure these embeddings can be interpreted and validated. The classical-quantum integration allows for both the computational benefits of quantum processing and the interpretability requirements of financial applications.

## Foundational Learning
**Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs)**: Why needed - Create quantum embeddings that capture complex feature relationships; Quick check - Verify circuit depth matches problem complexity
**Quantum Embeddings**: Why needed - Transform classical credit features into quantum state representations; Quick check - Validate embedding separability across credit classes
**Integrated Gradients**: Why needed - Provide feature attribution for quantum model decisions; Quick check - Compare attributions with baseline feature importance
**Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA)**: Why needed - Quantify attribution consistency across different credit risk categories; Quick check - Test metric sensitivity to attribution changes
**Post-hoc Explanation Techniques**: Why needed - Make quantum model decisions interpretable after training; Quick check - Validate explanations match known credit scoring principles
**Hybrid Classical-Quantum Training**: Why needed - Enable end-to-end optimization of quantum parameters; Quick check - Monitor training convergence for both classical and quantum components

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Preprocessing -> Quantum Embedding Layer -> Classical Processing -> Classification -> Attribution Analysis -> ICAA Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The most critical execution path runs from data preprocessing through quantum embedding generation to final classification. The quantum embedding layer is the bottleneck, as its quality directly determines both model accuracy and interpretability. Any degradation in quantum state preparation or measurement directly impacts downstream classification performance and attribution reliability.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture trades quantum circuit depth for interpretability - deeper circuits could potentially achieve better accuracy but would make attributions more complex and less reliable. The hybrid approach sacrifices pure quantum advantage for the benefit of post-hoc explanations and ICAA analysis. Dataset size constraints limit the complexity of quantum circuits that can be practically trained.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor attribution alignment (high ICAA scores) indicates overlapping quantum embeddings across classes. Inconsistent Integrated Gradients attributions suggest quantum state preparation issues. Low accuracy with high interpretability scores may indicate the quantum embedding space is too constrained. Failure to converge during training often stems from quantum circuit parameterization issues.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test quantum embedding separability using t-SNE visualization across credit classes; 2) Validate ICAA metric by comparing attribution consistency on synthetic datasets with known ground truth; 3) Benchmark quantum embeddings against classical PCA representations for the same credit data.
