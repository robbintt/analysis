# Evaluating Pavement Deterioration Rates Due to Flooding Events Using Explainable AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.01056
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01056
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Flood-affected pavement sections deteriorated 5.6 in/mi faster than non-flooded sections over two years

## Executive Summary
This study analyzes 20 years of pavement condition data from TxDOT's PMIS database to quantify how flooding events impact pavement deterioration rates, measured through International Roughness Index (IRI) changes. The research employs statistical analysis and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to identify the most influential factors affecting pavement roughness after flood exposure. Results show that flood-affected pavements experience significantly higher deterioration rates compared to non-flooded sections, with initial pavement condition, truck traffic percentage, flood exposure, and climate zone conditions identified as the most critical factors.

## Method Summary
The study combines statistical analysis with machine learning and XAI to evaluate pavement deterioration due to flooding. Researchers analyzed 10,022 records from TxDOT's PMIS database spanning 20 years, focusing on sections with IRI data before and after flood events. Sections showing IRI improvement were excluded, assuming maintenance occurred. A Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) was trained to predict next year's IRI, with hyperparameters optimized via 5-fold cross-validation. SHAP and LIME techniques were applied to interpret feature importance and explain individual predictions, identifying flood exposure as a significant contributor to increased roughness.

## Key Results
- Flood-affected pavement sections showed an average IRI increase of 8.46 in/mi over two years, with high variability (standard deviation of 10.53 in/mi)
- Flood-exposed sections deteriorated up to 5.6 in/mi faster than non-flooded sections
- Initial pavement roughness was identified as the most critical predictor of future deterioration
- XAI analysis confirmed flood exposure significantly contributes to increased roughness, with LIME explaining approximately 5-unit increases in IRI due to flooding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hydro-Structural Weakening
Flooding likely accelerates pavement roughness by infiltrating structural layers and reducing material stiffness. Water intrusion elevates moisture content in unbound materials, reducing resilient modulus and adhesive bonds, leading to higher deflection under traffic load and surface deformation. The observed IRI increase is primarily driven by structural weakening rather than surface debris or measurement noise.

### Mechanism 2: Baseline Condition Sensitivity
The severity of flood-induced deterioration is conditional on the pavement's pre-flood roughness and structural integrity. High initial IRI indicates existing structural weakness, where flood exposure acts as a catalyst, causing already rough roads to degrade faster than smooth roads under identical flood stress. This assumes maintenance interventions are fully excluded or controlled for.

### Mechanism 3: XAI Attribution of Heterogeneous Factors
Explainable AI techniques isolate the specific contribution of flood exposure from confounding variables like truck traffic and climate. SHAP values aggregate marginal contributions across feature coalitions to assign consistent importance to "Flood" status, separating it from high-correlation features like initial IRI. The Gradient Boosting model must accurately approximate the true deterioration function for these attributions to reflect physical reality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: International Roughness Index (IRI)**
  - Why needed here: IRI is the sole target variable for measuring deterioration in this study. Understanding that higher IRI = worse ride quality/structural health is critical.
  - Quick check question: If a road segment's IRI decreases significantly post-flood without maintenance, is this a data error or a measurement artifact?

- **Concept: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)**
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on SHAP to rank feature importance. You must interpret global feature importance vs. local predictions.
  - Quick check question: Does a positive SHAP value for "Flood" mean flooding causes higher IRI, or that it is merely associated with it in the training data?

- **Concept: Data Censoring for Maintenance**
  - Why needed here: The methodology explicitly removes data points where IRI improves, assuming maintenance occurred. This defines the boundary of the analysis.
  - Quick check question: Why would including post-maintenance data artificially lower the calculated flood impact?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** TxDOT PMIS Data -> Preprocessing (Flood Mapping + Maintenance Filter) -> Gradient Boosting Regressor -> SHAP + LIME Interpretability Layer
- **Critical path:** Accurate geocoding of flood events to specific 0.5-mile pavement sections, followed by effective filtering of "maintained" sections (IRI improvers) to prevent underestimating deterioration.
- **Design tradeoffs:** IRI used exclusively as the only 100% available metric, limiting analysis to roughness rather than structural distress. GBR selected for best accuracy over simpler models, requiring XAI layer for interpretability.
- **Failure signatures:** Data leakage if maintenance dates are unknown and post-maintenance scans are included in "deterioration" analysis; high variance in IRI changes suggesting model struggles with individual section precision despite high global R².
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce statistical comparison of IRI change (Flooded vs. Non-Flooded) to confirm ~5.6 in/mi delta. 2) Train GBR model and verify "TX IRI AVERAGE SCORE" is dominant feature via SHAP summary plots. 3) Use LIME on 5 random segments where model predicts high IRI to verify if "Flood > 0.0" appears as positive contributor.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do flood-induced deterioration rates vary when analyzing comprehensive distress indicators (cracking, rutting, raveling) alongside International Roughness Index (IRI)?
- To what extent does the exclusion of sections with improved post-flood IRI bias the estimated impact of flooding on network-level deterioration?
- How do specific flood stressors (depth, duration, velocity) quantitatively correlate with the magnitude of pavement deterioration?

## Limitations
- Critical assumption that maintenance activities are effectively excluded by filtering sections with IRI improvement, without access to explicit maintenance records
- High standard deviation (10.53 in/mi) in IRI changes suggests substantial variability in deterioration responses, limiting generalizability
- Use of IRI as sole deterioration metric limits analysis to surface roughness, potentially overlooking underlying structural distress mechanisms

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Statistical comparison of IRI changes (8.46 in/mi average increase for flooded sections) is methodologically sound, assuming data preprocessing is accurate
- **Medium Confidence:** Attribution of flood exposure as key driver via SHAP/LIME is plausible but may be confounded by collinearity with climate zones or traffic patterns
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability of 5.6 in/mi deterioration delta to other regions or flood severities is uncertain due to high variance and limited geographic scope

## Next Checks
1. Cross-validate the IRI-based maintenance exclusion against any available maintenance logs to quantify misclassification rates
2. Test SHAP explanations with permutation importance or leave-one-feature-out training to confirm flood exposure's isolated contribution
3. Apply the model to a subset of flood events from a different climate zone to assess if deterioration patterns hold
