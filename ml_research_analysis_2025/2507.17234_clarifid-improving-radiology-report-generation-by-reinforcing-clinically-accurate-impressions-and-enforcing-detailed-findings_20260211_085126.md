# CLARIFID: Improving Radiology Report Generation by Reinforcing Clinically Accurate Impressions and Enforcing Detailed Findings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17234
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17234
- Authors: Kyeongkyu Lee; Seonghwan Yoon; Hongki Lim
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Achieves superior clinical efficacy in radiology report generation with Impression F1 scores of 0.496 (MIMIC-CXR) and 0.638 (IU X-ray)

## Executive Summary
CLARIFID is a novel radiology report generation system that optimizes clinical accuracy in Impression sections while maintaining detailed Findings quality. The method employs reinforcement learning with CheXbert-based F1 scores as rewards, combined with section-aware pretraining and controlled decoding strategies. Experimental results on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-ray datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models in clinical efficacy metrics while preserving the comprehensiveness of Findings sections.

## Method Summary
CLARIFID employs a multi-faceted approach to radiology report generation that includes section-aware pretraining, a multi-view encoder for variable chest X-ray inputs, controlled decoding with next-token forcing, and best-of-N re-ranking. The system uses reinforcement learning to optimize the clinical accuracy of Impression sections, with CheXbert-based F1 scores serving as rewards. This approach enables the model to generate clinically accurate impressions while maintaining detailed findings, addressing the challenge of producing high-quality radiology reports that meet both clinical and practical requirements.

## Key Results
- Achieves Impression F1 scores of 0.496 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.638 on IU X-ray datasets
- Outperforms baseline models in clinical efficacy metrics while maintaining strong Findings quality
- Demonstrates cross-dataset generalization capabilities with consistent performance improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CLARIFID's success stems from its targeted optimization of clinical accuracy in Impression sections through reinforcement learning, while simultaneously maintaining detailed Findings quality through controlled decoding and section-aware pretraining. The multi-view encoder handles variable chest X-ray inputs effectively, and the best-of-N re-ranking approach ensures optimal report generation by considering multiple candidate outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- Reinforcement Learning: Why needed - to optimize specific clinical accuracy metrics beyond standard language modeling; Quick check - verify reward function alignment with clinical objectives
- Multi-view Encoder Architecture: Why needed - to handle variable input formats and modalities in chest X-ray imaging; Quick check - test with different image resolutions and acquisition types
- Controlled Decoding with Next-Token Forcing: Why needed - to maintain clinical consistency while generating detailed findings; Quick check - validate against radiologist-curated reports
- Section-aware Pretraining: Why needed - to optimize performance for specific report sections with different clinical requirements; Quick check - measure section-specific metric improvements
- CheXbert-based Evaluation: Why needed - to provide clinically meaningful assessment of generated reports; Quick check - compare against ground truth annotations

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Multi-view Encoder -> Section-aware Pretraining -> Controlled Decoding -> Reinforcement Learning -> Best-of-N Re-ranking

Critical Path: The reinforcement learning component with CheXbert-based rewards represents the critical path, as it directly optimizes the clinical accuracy of Impression sections while maintaining overall report quality through the controlled decoding and section-aware pretraining components.

Design Tradeoffs: The system trades computational efficiency for clinical accuracy, with the best-of-N re-ranking approach requiring substantial resources but yielding superior results. The multi-view encoder adds complexity but improves handling of variable input formats.

Failure Signatures: Potential failures include over-optimization of CheXbert metrics at the expense of other clinically relevant aspects, computational bottlenecks in the re-ranking process, and reduced performance on rare pathologies not well-represented in training data.

First Experiments: 1) Validate CheXbert reward alignment with clinical ground truth, 2) Test multi-view encoder robustness across different image formats, 3) Evaluate controlled decoding effectiveness on clinically challenging cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on CheXbert for clinical accuracy evaluation may introduce bias toward specific findings
- Best-of-N re-ranking approach requires substantial computational resources and may not scale well
- Evaluation focuses primarily on F1 scores and ROUGE metrics, which may not fully capture clinical utility

## Confidence
High confidence in clinical accuracy improvements (Impression F1 scores of 0.496 and 0.638)
Medium confidence in cross-dataset generalization (limited to two datasets)
High confidence in findings quality maintenance (based on ROUGE scores)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with practicing radiologists to assess workflow improvements and diagnostic accuracy
2. Evaluate performance across diverse clinical scenarios, including rare pathologies
3. Assess computational efficiency and scalability in production environments
