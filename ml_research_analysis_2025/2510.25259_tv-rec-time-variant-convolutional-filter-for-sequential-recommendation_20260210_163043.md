# TV-Rec: Time-Variant Convolutional Filter for Sequential Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25259
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25259
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.49% average on six benchmarks

## Executive Summary
TV-Rec introduces a novel approach to sequential recommendation by replacing fixed convolutional filters and self-attention mechanisms with position-dependent spectral filters. The method interprets user interaction sequences as line graphs and applies graph signal processing techniques to capture both local and global patterns without requiring positional embeddings. By leveraging the spectral properties of line graphs, TV-Rec achieves superior performance on long-range sequential recommendation tasks while maintaining computational efficiency through reduced parameter counts and faster inference speeds.

## Method Summary
TV-Rec transforms sequential recommendation into a graph signal processing problem by modeling user interaction sequences as line graphs. The method computes the graph Laplacian matrix and performs spectral decomposition to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which serve as the basis for time-variant convolutional filters. These filters are designed to be position-dependent, allowing the model to capture varying patterns across different sequence positions. The spectral filtering operation is performed in the transformed space, and the results are projected back to the original space using the inverse transformation. This approach eliminates the need for positional embeddings while maintaining the ability to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in user behavior sequences.

## Key Results
- Achieves 7.49% average improvement over state-of-the-art methods across six benchmark datasets
- Demonstrates up to 11.27% improvement in NDCG@20 for long-range sequential recommendation tasks
- Uses fewer parameters and achieves faster inference than hybrid convolution-attention baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TV-Rec works by leveraging the mathematical properties of line graphs and spectral graph theory to create position-dependent filters that adapt to different parts of the sequence. The key insight is that user interaction sequences can be naturally represented as line graphs, where each item interaction is a node and consecutive interactions are connected by edges. This representation allows the application of graph signal processing techniques, where the signal is the sequence of item embeddings and the graph structure captures the temporal ordering. The spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian provides a set of basis functions (eigenvectors) that can be used to design filters with specific frequency responses. By making these filters time-variant, TV-Rec can adapt to the changing characteristics of user behavior across different positions in the sequence, capturing both local patterns near each position and global patterns that span the entire sequence.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User sequence -> Line graph construction -> Graph Laplacian computation -> Spectral decomposition -> Time-variant filter application -> Inverse transformation -> Item prediction

Critical path: The core computational path involves constructing the line graph representation, computing the graph Laplacian, performing spectral decomposition to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors, applying time-variant convolutional filters in the spectral domain, and transforming the results back to the original space for item prediction.

Design tradeoffs: The primary tradeoff is between the computational cost of spectral decomposition and the benefits of position-dependent filtering. While spectral decomposition is computationally expensive, it needs to be performed only once per sequence length, making it feasible for practical applications. The elimination of positional embeddings and self-attention reduces overall model complexity despite the additional graph processing steps.

Failure signatures: The method may struggle with very short sequences where spectral decomposition becomes unstable, or with highly irregular sequences where the line graph assumption breaks down. Performance degradation may occur when user-item interactions don't follow clear sequential patterns or when the graph structure doesn't capture the relevant relationships between items.

First experiments:
1. Test TV-Rec on sequences of varying lengths to identify the minimum length for stable spectral decomposition
2. Compare performance using different graph structures (complete graph, star graph) versus line graph to validate the importance of the line graph assumption
3. Evaluate the impact of different filter designs in the spectral domain by varying the time-variance parameterization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Assumes all sequences can be effectively modeled as line graphs, which may not capture complex user-item interactions
- Does not adequately address performance with extremely sparse or very short sequences where spectral decomposition may become unstable
- Reliance on sequence order as line graph structure could limit applicability to scenarios with complex temporal dynamics

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|

| Superior inference efficiency (fewer parameters, faster inference) | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Test TV-Rec's performance on datasets with varying sequence lengths and densities to evaluate robustness across different recommendation scenarios, particularly focusing on very short and very sparse sequences

2. Conduct a comprehensive ablation study isolating the impact of the line graph assumption by comparing against variants that use different graph structures (e.g., star graphs, complete graphs) for the same spectral filtering approach

3. Perform extensive inference time benchmarking across multiple hardware platforms and batch sizes to empirically validate the claimed efficiency improvements, including memory usage analysis and GPU utilization metrics
