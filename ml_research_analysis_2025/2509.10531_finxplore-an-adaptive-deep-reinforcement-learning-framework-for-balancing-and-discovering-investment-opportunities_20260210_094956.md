# FinXplore: An Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Balancing and Discovering Investment Opportunities

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.10531
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10531
- **Reference count**: 20
- **Primary result**: FinXplore significantly outperforms benchmarks in portfolio optimization by integrating exploration of new assets via dual-agent DRL architecture

## Executive Summary
FinXplore introduces a dual-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that enhances portfolio optimization by balancing exploitation of existing assets with exploration of new investment opportunities. The system employs two specialized agents: one using PPO for continuous portfolio weight allocation within the existing universe, and another using DQN for discrete selection of new assets from an extended universe. The agents collaborate through a reward structure based on marginal Sharpe Ratio improvement, with exploration capital capped at 10% of the portfolio. Evaluated on NIFTY and DJIA markets from 2022-2024, the framework demonstrates superior cumulative returns, annualized returns, Sharpe ratios, and Calmar ratios compared to benchmark strategies while maintaining lower maximum drawdowns.

## Method Summary
The FinXplore framework formulates portfolio optimization as a dual-agent Markov Decision Process. Agent 1 (PPO) continuously allocates weights to an existing universe of 18 stocks using a softmax output layer. Agent 2 (DQN) selects single assets from an extended universe of 5 commodities. Both agents observe augmented state vectors containing returns and technical indicators. The exploration agent receives rewards based on marginal Sharpe Ratio improvement (ΔSR) when its suggested asset is accepted. A gatekeeper mechanism compares portfolio Sharpe Ratios with and without the explored asset, deploying κ=10% of capital to exploration if beneficial. Both agents train simultaneously but independently, sharing environment feedback to develop complementary policies.

## Key Results
- Achieved higher cumulative and annualized returns than benchmark strategies across both NIFTY and DJIA markets
- Demonstrated superior Sharpe and Calmar ratios while maintaining lower maximum drawdowns
- Showed effectiveness in balancing risk and return through exploration, with exploration agent incentivized to suggest diversifying assets
- Validated framework performance using real-world data from 2022-2024 across major global stock markets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Marginal Sharpe Improvement as Exploration Reward
Conditioning the exploration agent's reward on marginal Sharpe Ratio improvement incentivizes selection of diversifying assets rather than high-return assets alone. Agent 2 receives positive reward only when its suggested asset improves the portfolio's risk-adjusted return, creating a gradient toward assets with low correlation to existing holdings. The core assumption is that Sharpe Ratio computed over a 60-day rolling window sufficiently proxies true risk-adjusted portfolio quality.

### Mechanism 2: Dual-Agent Decoupling with Fixed Exploration Budget
Separating allocation (PPO) and exploration (DQN) into specialized agents with fixed budget κ=10% prevents exploration-exploitation tradeoff from collapsing into pure exploitation. The fixed budget ensures exploration capital is preserved regardless of short-term performance, while the acceptance gate prevents capital destruction from poor suggestions.

### Mechanism 3: State Augmentation with Extended Universe Features
Providing Agent 2 with concatenated state vectors from both existing and extended universes enables cross-universe correlation learning for diversification decisions. By observing joint state dynamics, Agent 2 learns which extended assets exhibit complementary behavior to existing holdings.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation for portfolio optimization**
  - **Why needed here**: The entire framework treats portfolio rebalancing as a sequential decision problem. Understanding the tuple (S, A, P, R, γ) is essential to interpret how agents learn from environment interactions.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why portfolio optimization is naturally modeled as an MDP rather than a one-shot optimization problem?

- **Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and clipped objective**
  - **Why needed here**: Agent 1 uses PPO for continuous weight allocation. The clipping mechanism (ε=0.2) prevents destructive policy updates that could arise from high-variance reward signals in finance.
  - **Quick check question**: What would happen to training stability if the clipping parameter ε were removed or set too high?

- **Concept: Deep Q-Learning with target network**
  - **Why needed here**: Agent 2 uses DQN for discrete asset selection. The target network prevents oscillating Q-value estimates that would otherwise occur with rapidly changing portfolio states.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does DQN use a separate target network that is updated less frequently than the main Q-network?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Environment (Existing Universe: 18 stocks + OHLCV + 8 technical indicators) → Agent 1 (PPO) → portfolio weights a_U; Environment (Extended Universe: 5 commodities) → Agent 2 (DQN) → selected asset a*; Gatekeeper (SR comparison) → deployment decision; Both agents update policies based on shared feedback

- **Critical path**: 1) Agent 1 observes s_t → outputs portfolio weights a_U; 2) Compute SR_current from a_U; 3) Agent 2 observes s_t + c_t → selects asset a* from E; 4) Reoptimize portfolio with a* → compute SR_new; 5) If SR_new > SR_current: deploy a_E with κ to a*; else: deploy a_U; 6) Compute R_PPO and R_DQN; update both policies; 7) Repeat for T periods

- **Design tradeoffs**: Fixed vs. adaptive κ (paper uses fixed 10%); Sharpe Ratio window (60 days); Extended universe composition (only 5 commodities tested); Transaction cost (δ=0.05%)

- **Failure signatures**: Agent 2 reward stuck near zero (extended universe highly correlated); high volatility despite good Sharpe (PPO overfitting); maximum drawdown exceeds 25% (exploration budget too aggressive)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run Agent 1 alone without exploration (κ=0%) on NIFTY data to verify baseline performance; 2) Test κ ∈ {5%, 10%, 15%, 20%} on validation period to identify optimal budget; 3) Replace 5 commodities with random subsets of 3 to measure performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Sentiment analysis integration**: How does incorporating sentiment analysis and financial reports into the state space improve decision-making compared to using only technical indicators?

2. **Alternative risk measures**: How does performance and stability change when reward function utilizes tail-risk measures like CVaR instead of Sharpe Ratio?

3. **Extended universe scaling**: How does DQL-based exploration agent scale when extended universe expands from 5 commodities to thousands of assets?

4. **Adaptive exploration budget**: Is fixed exploration budget (κ=10%) optimal across varying market regimes, or would adaptive budget based on market volatility yield higher risk-adjusted returns?

## Limitations

- Fixed exploration budget κ=10% lacks adaptive calibration to market conditions or regime changes
- Marginal Sharpe Ratio improvement reward assumes Sharpe Ratio remains valid across all market states, breaking down during non-normal return distributions
- State augmentation approach may introduce timing mismatches when concatenating returns from different asset classes
- Evaluation period (2022-2024) covers narrow market regime slice, missing prolonged bull markets and severe bear markets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Mathematical framework for dual-agent MDP formulation and PPO/DQN implementation details are technically sound and well-specified
- **Medium Confidence**: Empirical performance claims are supported by reported results, but evaluation window is limited and doesn't test across diverse market regimes
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization claims about balancing risk and return through exploration are not yet validated across different market conditions, extended universe compositions, or transaction cost regimes

## Next Checks

1. **Regime robustness test**: Re-run FinXplore on pre-2022 data (2015-2021) covering both bull and bear markets to verify performance stability across different market regimes. Compare cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios against benchmarks in each regime separately.

2. **Exploration budget optimization**: Conduct hyperparameter sweep of κ ∈ {5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%} on validation period (e.g., 2022 Q1-Q2) and plot performance metrics against budget allocation. Identify if fixed 10% is optimal or if adaptive budget would yield superior results.

3. **Extended universe composition ablation**: Systematically remove individual commodities from extended universe and measure performance degradation. Test alternative extended universes including sector ETFs, bonds, or international indices to quantify importance of current commodity selection and assess generalizability to other asset classes.
