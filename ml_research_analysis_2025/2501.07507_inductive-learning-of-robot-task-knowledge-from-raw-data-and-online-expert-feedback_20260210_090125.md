# Inductive Learning of Robot Task Knowledge from Raw Data and Online Expert Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.07507
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07507
- Authors: Daniele Meli; Paolo Fiorini
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Learned task specifications from raw execution data using ILP under ASP semantics, achieving F1-scores of 88% (offline) to 93% (online) on surgical peg transfer task.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method for learning robotic task specifications from raw execution data using Inductive Logic Programming under Answer Set Programming semantics. The approach extracts action preconditions, effects, and constraints by combining unsupervised action identification from video-kinematic recordings with commonsense environmental features. The learned specifications are refined through an online framework incorporating expert human feedback to ensure safe execution. The method is evaluated on a surgical peg transfer task using the da Vinci Research Kit, demonstrating robustness to noisy data, data-efficiency with small heterogeneous datasets, and significant performance improvements through online refinement.

## Method Summary
The framework combines unsupervised action identification from raw video and kinematic data with Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) via the ILASP tool. Raw data is processed to extract semantic features through grounding relations, then ILASP generates Context-Dependent Partial Interpretations (CDPIs) to learn Answer Set Programs containing action preconditions, effects, and constraints. The system operates in two phases: an offline learning phase that generates initial specifications from noisy demonstrations, and an online refinement phase where expert feedback is incorporated to improve safety and performance through negative examples.

## Key Results
- Achieved median F1-score of 0.88 for learned axioms from noisy offline demonstrations
- Online refinement improved F1-score to 0.93 through expert feedback incorporation
- Demonstrated robustness to noisy data while maintaining data efficiency with small heterogeneous datasets
- Validated on surgical peg transfer task using da Vinci Research Kit with significant performance improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Noise-Tolerant Rule Induction
The system extracts consistent task specifications from noisy, heterogeneous demonstrations by minimizing a cost function that penalizes complexity and uncovered examples. ILASP searches for the shortest hypothesis (axioms) that covers the maximum weight of examples, effectively ignoring contradictory examples if the penalty for leaving them uncovered is lower than the cost of complicating the rule set.

### Mechanism 2: Context-Dependent Constraint Learning
The system learns safety constraints by treating unobserved actions in specific contexts as "excluded sets" rather than random noise. If the robot could have moved to Peg B but moved to Peg A instead, the context (e.g., "Peg B is occupied") is used to infer a constraint embedded as extended preconditions (negations in the rule body).

### Mechanism 3: Online Refinement via Human Counter-Examples
Performance improves online because human feedback converts uncertain probabilistic examples into hard logical constraints. When experts veto proposed actions, the system generates negative examples that strictly forbid the action in that context, forcing ILP to refine the hypothesis to exclude that specific solution space.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Answer Set Programming (ASP) & Event Calculus**
  - Why needed: ASP is the language of the "brain." You cannot debug the robot's decisions without understanding how it represents state changes over time (Event Calculus).
  - Quick check: Can you distinguish between an axiom that initiates a fluent (e.g., gripper closes) vs. an axiom that holds a fluent true via inertia?

- **Concept: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)**
  - Why needed: This is the "teacher" mechanism. Unlike deep learning (gradient descent), ILP is a search process over logic rules.
  - Quick check: If the learner produces a rule that covers 90% of examples but violates 10%, does ILP discard it or accept it with a penalty? (Answer: Accept with penalty, via cost function).

- **Concept: Unsupervised Action Segmentation**
  - Why needed: The "eyes" of the system. The logic learner is only as good as the segments fed to it.
  - Quick check: How does the system identify the boundary between a "Move" and a "Grasp" without a human labeling it in the dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Data -> Unsupervised Segmenter -> Symbolizer -> ILASP Learner -> ASP Controller + Human Interface
- **Critical path:** The mapping of Raw Data -> Semantic Features (Eq. 11). This is where continuous geometry (distance < radius) becomes discrete logic (`at(A, ring)`). If this thresholding is wrong, the logic is garbage.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Data Efficiency vs. Noise: The system works on "small heterogeneous datasets" but relies on ILASP to sort the noise.
  - Search Space Size: The paper limits max axiom length to 6. Longer axioms might capture more complex logic but cause exponential computation blow-up.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Empty Hypothesis": ILASP returns nothing. Cause: Threshold for noise filtering (Eq. 13) is too strict, or segmentation quality is too low.
  - Unsafe Action: Robot tries to place a ring on an occupied peg. Cause: The "excluded set" mechanism failed to capture the constraint during the offline phase.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation on Excluded Sets: Run the learner without the excluded set logic (Baseline) to verify if constraints are actually learned via this mechanism.
  2. Noise Injection: Synthetic noise into the action labels to find the breaking point where F1-score drops below a usable threshold.
  3. Simulated Feedback Loop: Run the online phase with a "perfect" oracle (script) vs. a "noisy" oracle to measure the sensitivity of the refinement loop to human error.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the framework be extended to learn new action types and environmental features autonomously rather than relying on a priori definitions?
- Basis: Section 6 states that assuming the ASP signature is known a priori may be infeasible in complex scenarios and proposes extending the framework to support new concept learning.
- Why unresolved: Current implementation requires abstract actions and commonsense features to be defined in advance by the user.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of the system learning valid axioms containing predicates not present in the initial knowledge base during online execution.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can probabilistic logical specifications be integrated to better handle task stochasticity?
- Basis: Section 6 notes that the current method learns deterministic specifications and suggests investigating probabilistic logical theories or statistical relational learning.
- Why unresolved: The system currently accounts for uncertainty only in example definition, not within the final axioms, which may fail in highly stochastic domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative performance metrics in stochastic environments between the current deterministic model and a proposed probabilistic variant.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the proposed interpretable interface significantly improve task efficiency and user trust in real-world human-robot collaboration?
- Basis: Section 6 calls for an extended user study to assess the actual benefits of human-robot interplay in complex, real-world scenarios.
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation is limited to simulated or benchmark scenarios; the practical impact on user cognitive load and trust remains unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative data from user studies measuring trust metrics, cognitive load, and task completion rates with physical robots.

## Limitations

- The action segmentation quality critically depends on the unsupervised algorithm's performance, with no explicit error bounds provided.
- The ILASP search space grows exponentially with axiom complexity, limiting scalability to more complex tasks.
- The online refinement assumes perfect human feedback, with no discussion of handling noisy or contradictory expert inputs.
- The evaluation is limited to a single peg-transfer task, raising questions about generalizability to more complex manipulation scenarios.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence (8/10):** The core mechanism of combining ILP with ASP for task specification learning is well-supported by experimental results and mathematical framework. The noise-tolerance claims are substantiated by the offline F1-score of 0.88 on noisy data.
- **Medium Confidence (6/10):** The online refinement mechanism's effectiveness is demonstrated, but the dependency on human feedback quality and potential latency issues are not fully explored.
- **Low Confidence (4/10):** The generalizability to tasks beyond peg transfer and the scalability to more complex action spaces remain largely unproven.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness Testing:** Conduct ablation studies by varying the level of noise in action labels to determine the breaking point where F1-score drops below usability thresholds.
2. **Generalization Study:** Apply the framework to a different robotic manipulation task (e.g., block stacking) to assess the method's adaptability beyond peg transfer.
3. **Human Feedback Analysis:** Test the online refinement loop with simulated "noisy" human feedback to quantify the impact of expert input quality on learning outcomes.
