## Executive Summary
SeVeDo introduces a heterogeneous transformer accelerator that structurally separates outlier-sensitive computations into a high-precision low-rank path while executing the remainder in a low-bit residual path. The design addresses the energy overhead of outlier handling and group quantization through two innovations: Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ) reduces dequantization cost by combining floating-point scaling with fine-grained shifting, and SVD-Guided Mixed Precision (SVD-MP) statically identifies precision-sensitive components via low-rank decomposition. Implemented in Samsung 28nm, SeVeDo achieves 13.8TOPS/W peak efficiency with 12.7TOPS/W on ViT-Base and 13.4TOPS/W on Llama2-7B.

## Method Summary
SeVeDo uses truncated SVD to decompose weight matrices into low-rank and residual components, processing each with specialized hardware paths. The low-rank path uses bit-sliced integer units with mixed precision (INT16-INT8 for sensitive regions, INT8-INT4 for others), while the residual path employs INT4 quantization with hierarchical group scaling. HGQ combines coarse-grained floating-point base scaling with fine-grained exponent-shifted scaling to reduce dequantization energy. SVD-MP statically identifies precision-sensitive channels in L1 and L2 projections and allocates higher bitwidths accordingly. The accelerator features four heterogeneous cores with shared memory, achieving 36.1% energy savings from HGQ and 75% from SVD-MP over FP16 baselines.

## Key Results
- Peak energy efficiency of 13.8TOPS/W, with 12.7TOPS/W on ViT-Base and 13.4TOPS/W on Llama2-7B
- 36.1% energy savings from Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ)
- 75% energy savings and 46% area savings from SVD-Guided Mixed Precision (SVD-MP)
- Accuracy loss within 0.2% absolute across all configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structural Separation via SVD Decomposition
SeVeDo uses truncated SVD to isolate outlier-sensitive components into a low-rank path while the residual term retains removed outliers. This enables INT4 quantization of the residual while preserving accuracy through the high-precision low-rank path (≈2.51% of operations). The core assumption is that outliers concentrate in salient channels that SVD can structurally isolate, while residual outliers are irregular enough for local group quantization to handle.

### Mechanism 2: Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ)
HGQ reduces floating-point dequantization cost by replacing 75% of FP accumulations with shift-based integer operations through a two-level scaling hierarchy. Base Scaling Factor (BSF) uses FP16 shared across sub-groups, while Exponent-Shifted Scaling Factor (ESSF) uses lightweight power-of-two shifts per sub-group. This approach assumes that after SVD outlier removal, sub-group maxima are small enough that exponent-based approximation error is acceptable.

### Mechanism 3: SVD-Guided Mixed Precision (SVD-MP)
SVD-MP statically identifies precision-sensitive regions through SVD decomposition and processes them with bit-sliced integer units. The method identifies top-128 channels in L1 projection and top-4 channels in L2 projection as precision-sensitive, using INT16-INT8 for these regions and INT8-INT4 elsewhere. The core assumption is that precision sensitivity patterns are statically determinable from SVD structure and bit-sliced temporal multiplexing has negligible throughput overhead.

## Foundational Learning

- **Truncated SVD / Low-Rank Decomposition**
  - Why needed here: Core to SeVeDo's approach—understanding how W ≈ U_k Σ_k V_k^T + R separates outlier-capturing low-rank from quantizable residual is essential.
  - Quick check question: Given a 4096×4096 weight matrix with k=16, what are the dimensions of U_k, Σ_k, and the residual R?

- **Group Quantization with Scaling Factors**
  - Why needed here: HGQ builds on group quantization concepts; must understand per-group scaling to grasp why FP dequantization is costly and how hierarchy helps.
  - Quick check question: For group size G32 with FP16 scaling factors, how many FP multiplications are needed to dequantize a 4096-element vector?

- **Bit-Sliced Integer Arithmetic**
  - Why needed here: SVD-MP uses bit-sliced PEs to handle mixed INT16/INT8/INT4 precision temporally within the same hardware.
  - Quick check question: How would you decompose an INT16 multiplication into two INT8 operations using bit-slicing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Four core clusters (each with four heterogeneous cores) -> shared 64KB IOMEM -> global 1.5MB memory -> NoC -> top controller and auxiliary SIMD core

- **Critical path:**
  1. Offline: Truncated SVD decomposition → identify k ranks, compute residual R
  2. Offline: Weight reordering and quantization (INT8 for sensitive, INT4 for others)
  3. Runtime: LVC processes low-rank path with SVD-MP (bit-sliced INT)
  4. Runtime: RMC processes residual path with HGQ (INT4 + hierarchical scaling)
  5. Merge results from both paths

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Group size (G32 vs G128): Finer groups improve accuracy but increase FP dequantization cost; HGQ attempts to break this tradeoff
  - Low-rank path precision (FP16 vs INT16–INT8 vs INT8–INT4): Higher precision costs more energy/area; SVD-MP targets sweet spot
  - k value for SVD: Larger k captures more outliers but increases low-rank path computation (paper uses k=16)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Accuracy collapse (PPL >1000): SVD decomposition failed to isolate outliers, or group quantization too coarse
  - Efficiency degradation near peak: High outlier ratio in workload exceeds low-rank path capacity
  - HGQ accuracy loss >1%p: Sub-group approximation error too large—check if SVD suppression is effective

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate HGQ accuracy/energy tradeoff: Run INT4 w/ SVD with G32, G128, and HGQ (G32/G128 E2) on Llama2-7B; measure PPL and energy per token
  2. Profile SVD-MP sensitivity: Ablate precision allocation (INT16–INT8 vs INT8–INT4) on L1/L2 projections for ViT-Base; track accuracy loss and PE utilization
  3. End-to-end efficiency benchmark: Compare TOPS/W on ViT-Base and Llama2-7B against FP16 baseline and prior quantized accelerators; verify 12.7–13.4 TOPS/W target

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the optimal SVD truncation rank (k) vary across transformer layers, model architectures, and task domains?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses a fixed k=16 for all experiments without systematic exploration of how this hyperparameter should be adapted.
- Why unresolved: Different layers may have varying outlier distributions and rank structures; a single k may be suboptimal for heterogeneous layer characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies across layers showing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for different k values, or an analytical method for per-layer rank selection.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can SeVeDo's static SVD-MP channel allocation (top-128 for L1, top-4 for L2) generalize effectively to larger LLMs beyond 7B parameters?
- Basis in paper: "The top-128 and top-4 precision-sensitive channels are identified in the L1 and L2 projections, respectively" without justification for these specific values or scaling rules.
- Why unresolved: Larger models may exhibit different outlier distributions and precision-sensitivity patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on 13B, 70B, and larger models with analysis of whether fixed channel counts or proportional scaling is more effective.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the latency implications of the heterogeneous LVC/RMC parallel architecture compared to energy-only metrics?
- Basis in paper: The paper reports 12.7–13.4 TOPS/W energy efficiency but does not report inference latency or throughput metrics.
- Why unresolved: Parallel heterogeneous cores may introduce synchronization overhead or underutilization that affects real-time performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: End-to-end latency measurements and throughput analysis comparing against homogeneous baselines.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does HGQ's hierarchical scaling accuracy degrade under adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs not seen during calibration?
- Basis in paper: HGQ relies on calibration data to establish base scaling factors, but robustness to input distribution shift is uncharacterized.
- Why unresolved: The exponent-shifted approximation assumes sub-group maxima remain within expected ranges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Accuracy evaluation on out-of-distribution datasets or adversarial examples with analysis of scaling factor robustness.

## Limitations

- SVD decomposition stability is uncharacterized across different model sizes and layers, with k=16 choice appearing arbitrary
- Quantization error bounds for HGQ's exponent-shifting approximation lack rigorous validation across diverse weight distributions
- Static precision sensitivity identification assumes consistent patterns across inputs without exploring dynamic adaptation benefits

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Energy efficiency measurements (13.8TOPS/W peak) and area savings (36.1% HGQ, 46% SVD-MP) are hardware-validated with concrete silicon data
- **Medium Confidence:** The specific SVD decomposition approach for outlier isolation and the two-level HGQ hierarchy are novel but rely on several assumptions that aren't fully validated
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about bit-sliced integer units providing 75% energy savings in the low-rank path lack detailed implementation analysis

## Next Checks

1. **SVD Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary k (e.g., k=8, 16, 32) across multiple transformer layers and model sizes to quantify accuracy-energy tradeoffs. Measure outlier distribution changes and identify when decomposition fails to isolate precision-critical components.

2. **HGQ Error Characterization:** Create synthetic weight distributions with known outlier patterns to validate the exponent-shifting approximation error bounds. Compare against alternative hierarchical scaling schemes and quantify the minimum outlier suppression ratio required for acceptable accuracy.

3. **Runtime Precision Adaptation:** Implement a dynamic precision sensitivity detection mechanism that monitors activation statistics during inference. Compare accuracy and efficiency against the static SVD-MP approach on workloads with varying outlier characteristics to assess potential gains from adaptive precision allocation.
