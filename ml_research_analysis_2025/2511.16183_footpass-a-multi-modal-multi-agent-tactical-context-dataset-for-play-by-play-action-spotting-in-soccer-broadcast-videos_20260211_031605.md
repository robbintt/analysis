# FOOTPASS: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Tactical Context Dataset for Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Broadcast Videos

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.16183
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16183
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** FOOTPASS introduces the first dataset with full-match soccer broadcast videos annotated for play-by-play events, player identities, game-state, and tracking data, enabling improved action spotting via multi-modal reasoning.

## Executive Summary
FOOTPASS addresses the challenge of reliable play-by-play action spotting in soccer broadcast videos, a task that current methods struggle with due to occlusions, limited contextual understanding, and long-range temporal dependencies. To bridge perception and tactical reasoning, the authors introduce FOOTPASS, the first dataset providing full-match broadcast videos with human-annotated play-by-play events, player identities, game-state data, and tracking information. They benchmark three approaches: a purely visual baseline (TAAD), a graph-augmented version (TAAD+GNN), and a denoising sequence transduction model (TAAD+DST) that leverages tactical priors over long temporal horizons. Results show that integrating game-state and role-based reasoning substantially improves precision and recall, especially in challenging scenarios without visible bounding boxes, demonstrating the value of multi-modal, multi-agent representations for scalable soccer analytics.

## Method Summary
The FOOTPASS dataset contains 54 full-match broadcast videos (1920x1080, downsampled to 640x352) with single-player tracking bounding boxes, game-state data (positions, velocities, roles), and human-annotated play-by-play events. The authors evaluate three methods: TAAD, a visual-only baseline using 3D CNNs (X3D-L) on 50-frame clips; TAAD+GNN, which adds a Graph Neural Network to encode inter-player relationships from game-state data; and TAAD+DST, a denoising sequence transduction model that refines noisy clip-level predictions over long temporal horizons (750 frames) using role-based and team-contextual priors. All models are trained to predict action class, team, and jersey number at the frame level, with metrics computed at low confidence thresholds and temporal tolerances.

## Key Results
- TAAD+DST achieves the highest F1-score (0.377) among all tested models, nearly doubling the performance of the visual-only TAAD baseline.
- Integrating game-state data via TAAD+GNN improves precision and recall by encoding inter-player relationships and tactical context.
- TAAD+DST maintains 33.4% recall on events where the acting player has no bounding box, demonstrating effective occluded-player inference via role-based priors.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating structured game-state (player positions, velocities, roles) with visual features improves action spotting precision by encoding tactical context.
- Mechanism: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) create spatio-temporal graphs where nodes represent players and edges encode inter-player relationships. This allows the model to learn coordinated behaviors (e.g., passing lanes) rather than treating detections in isolation.
- Core assumption: Soccer actions are governed by tactical regularities that can be captured via inter-player spatial and temporal dependencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results show that integrating game-state and role-based reasoning substantially improves precision and recall..."
  - [section 2.3] "...TAAD+GNN... encodes local inter-player relationships as a spatio-temporal graph... improves its action-spotting performance."
  - [corpus] Related paper "SoccerChat" integrates multimodal data (video + event data) for enhanced game understanding, supporting the value of structured context.
- Break condition: If game-state data is extremely sparse or role assignments are highly dynamic/unpredictable, the learned graph structure may fail to generalize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Long-range temporal modeling via denoising sequence transduction (DST) refines noisy clip-level predictions into coherent, tactically plausible action sequences.
- Mechanism: DST takes noisy, context-free player-centric predictions from a visual model (TAAD) as input, along with role-based structured features (position, velocity, role). It's trained to denoise these sequences over long horizons (750 frames), enforcing ball possession continuity and filtering implausible events.
- Core assumption: Soccer has long-range tactical regularities (e.g., ball flow) that can be learned and used to correct short-term visual errors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...denoising sequence transduction model (TAAD+DST) that leverages tactical priors over long temporal horizons."
  - [section 4.3] "TAAD+DST... achieves the best overall performance... almost doubling the F1 score relative to TAAD."
  - [corpus] Related paper "VERSA" emphasizes the need for reliable event data, indirectly supporting methods that improve data quality via sequence modeling.
- Break condition: If the visual prior is extremely unreliable (e.g., consistently wrong player tracking), the DST model may not have enough signal to correct the sequence effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Role-based and team-contextual priors allow the model to infer actions even when the acting player is visually occluded or missing from the broadcast.
- Mechanism: By conditioning predictions on player roles (e.g., winger, defender) and team memberships, the model learns priors about "who is likely to do what, where." When visual evidence is missing, it can leverage this learned knowledge and the temporal context of other visible players to make plausible inferences.
- Core assumption: Player roles and team structures are stable enough to provide predictive power when direct visual evidence is absent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...especially in challenging scenarios without visible bounding boxes..."
  - [section 4.3, Figure 6] "...TAAD+DST maintains 33.4% recall... when bounding boxes are missing... TAAD+DST can infer actions even when the actor is not visible."
  - [corpus] No directly equivalent mechanism found in the provided corpus snippets for explicit occluded-player inference via role-based priors in soccer.
- Break condition: If players frequently switch roles or team structures are highly fluid/chaotic, the learned role-based priors will become unreliable for inference.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Spatio-Temporal Action Detection (STAD)**
  - Why needed here: This is the baseline perceptual task the paper aims to improve upon. It involves jointly detecting *who* is doing *what* action, *where*, and *when* in a video.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between Temporal Action Localization (finding the start/end times of an action) and Spatio-Temporal Action Detection (which adds spatial bounding boxes)?

- **Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for Multi-Agent Systems**
  - Why needed here: The TAAD+GNN model uses a GNN to model the relationships between multiple players (agents). This is a core technique for injecting tactical context.
  - Quick check question: How would you construct a graph to represent a soccer game at a single timestep? What would nodes and edges represent?

- **Concept: Denoising Sequence Transduction (DST)**
  - Why needed here: This is the mechanism for the TAAD+DST model. It's a sequence-to-sequence task where the input is a noisy sequence and the model learns to output a clean one.
  - Quick check question: In this context, what constitutes the "noisy" input sequence and what is the "clean" target output sequence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video Frame -> Object Detector -> Player Tracker -> 3D CNN Feature Extractor -> [GNN or DST Module] -> Action Classifier -> Final Prediction
- **Critical path:** The path from `Video Frame -> Object Detector -> Player Tracker -> 3D CNN Feature Extractor -> [GNN or DST Module] -> Action Classifier -> Final Prediction`. The performance of the initial tracking and feature extraction heavily limits the downstream models.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **TAAD (Visual-only):** Fast, simpler, but lacks context. High recall but very low precision in complex scenarios.
  - **TAAD+GNN:** Adds inter-player context. End-to-end trainable. Improves precision but operates on short clips, missing long-range dependencies. More complex architecture.
  - **TAAD+DST:** Best performance. Models long-range temporal dependencies. Not end-to-end; it post-processes TAAD's outputs. Requires a pre-trained visual model (TAAD). Adds a separate training step.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **TAAD:** High false positive rate, especially for ambiguous actions. Fails completely when a player is occluded (no bounding box = no prediction).
  - **TAAD+GNN:** May struggle with very rare actions (like tackles) due to limited examples for the GNN to learn patterns from. Can be misled if the input tracking data is noisy.
  - **TAAD+DST:** If the initial TAAD predictions are extremely poor (very high noise), the denoising model might not converge or may hallucinate actions that fit the tactical prior but didn't happen. May miss highly irregular, non-tactical plays (e.g., a random deflection).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Reproduction:** Implement and train the lightweight TAAD model from scratch on the FOOTPASS training set. Evaluate on the validation set to establish a baseline Precision/Recall.
  2. **Ablation on Input Features:** Train the TAAD+DST model using only visual logits (from TAAD) vs. visual logits + game-state features. Compare F1 scores to quantify the contribution of tactical context.
  3. **Occlusion Robustness Test:** Create a test subset containing only events where the acting player has no bounding box. Compare the recall of TAAD (expected ~0%) vs. TAAD+DST to validate the mechanism of inference under occlusion.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can an end-to-end architecture that unifies perception, tracking, and sequence reasoning outperform the current modular pipeline (TAAD followed by DST) on the FOOTPASS benchmark?
- To what extent can audio signals and commentary be leveraged to recover off-screen or occluded actions that are currently missed by visual models?
- Is it possible to train a direct spotting system that predicts (frame, team, jersey, class) solely from video pixels without explicit tactical inputs?
- How can sequence sampling strategies or feature representations be modified to improve the detection of rare and visually ambiguous classes like "Tackle"?

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of the denoising sequence transduction (DST) model hinges on the assumption that long-range tactical priors (e.g., ball possession flow) are stable and predictable.
- The role-based inference mechanism for occluded players relies on stable role assignments, which may not hold in all teams or leagues, representing a significant generalization risk.
- The paper does not thoroughly explore the sensitivity of the model to errors in the initial tracking and game-state data, which can propagate through the pipeline.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The claim that integrating structured game-state data (positions, velocities, roles) with visual features improves action spotting performance is strongly supported by quantitative results showing higher F1-scores for both TAAD+GNN and TAAD+DST compared to the visual-only baseline.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that the DST model is effective specifically for inferring actions when players are occluded is based on a single illustrative example. While the recall improvement is noted, the lack of extensive quantitative breakdown by occlusion level limits full confidence.
- **Low Confidence:** The assertion that the dataset enables "scalable soccer analytics" is a forward-looking statement about potential downstream applications. The paper validates performance on the spotting task but does not demonstrate actual scalability or application to broader analytical workflows.

## Next Checks
1. **Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis:** Quantitatively evaluate TAAD+DST's performance on a test set stratified by the degree of player occlusion (e.g., fully visible, partially occluded, fully occluded). Report precision, recall, and F1-score for each stratum to rigorously validate the occluded-player inference mechanism.
2. **Role Stability Stress Test:** Train and evaluate the TAAD+GNN and TAAD+DST models on a subset of matches where player roles are deliberately shuffled or randomized. Measure the drop in performance to empirically test the stability assumption underlying role-based inference.
3. **Temporal Prior Robustness:** Create adversarial sequences where the tactical priors (e.g., ball possession order) are violated (e.g., player 1 → player 3 → player 2 instead of 1→2→3). Test whether TAAD+DST can detect such anomalies or if it blindly enforces the learned prior, leading to incorrect predictions.
