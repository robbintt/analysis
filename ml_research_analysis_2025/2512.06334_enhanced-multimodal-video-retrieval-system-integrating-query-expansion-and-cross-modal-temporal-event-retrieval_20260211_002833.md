# Enhanced Multimodal Video Retrieval System: Integrating Query Expansion and Cross-modal Temporal Event Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.06334
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06334
- **Reference count:** 30
- **Primary result:** Novel multimodal video retrieval system integrating query expansion and cross-modal temporal event retrieval, demonstrating strong performance on Ho Chi Minh AI Challenge 2025

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multimodal video retrieval system designed to handle complex temporal queries through three key innovations: an adaptive Kernel Density Gaussian Mixture Thresholding (KDE-GMM) algorithm for scene segmentation, large language model-based query expansion for semantic broadening, and a cross-modal temporal event retrieval framework for multi-scene queries. The system was evaluated on the Ho Chi Minh AI Challenge 2025, showing robust performance particularly in handling temporal queries requiring different modalities per scene. The approach addresses the challenge of finding specific temporal sequences in videos by combining semantic understanding with adaptive preprocessing and intelligent query handling.

## Method Summary
The system processes videos through TransNetV2-based scene segmentation using KDE-GMM adaptive thresholding, followed by K-Means keyframe selection on MobileNetV2 features. Parallel feature extraction generates CLIP/BEiT3 embeddings (indexed in FAISS), YOLO object metadata (stored in MongoDB), OCR text, and color features. User queries are optionally expanded via Gemini API, then retrieved through embedding-based and metadata-based searches with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. For temporal queries, Algorithm 2 performs cross-modal temporal event retrieval using the first scene as a pivot and a fixed window size of 10 frames to align subsequent scenes.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated strong performance on Ho Chi Minh AI Challenge 2025 with complex temporal queries
- KDE-GMM adaptive thresholding provides optimal keyframe selection through bimodal distribution analysis
- LLM-based query expansion improves retrieval performance by generating semantically equivalent variants
- Cross-modal temporal event retrieval enables different query modalities to describe distinct scenes within temporal sequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Adaptive thresholding via KDE-GMM improves scene segmentation over fixed thresholds.
- **Mechanism:** KDE-GMM estimates score distributions using Kernel Density Estimation, initializes a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model at detected modes, refines via Expectation-Maximization, and selects the intersection point as the optimal classification threshold, minimizing Bayes error.
- **Core assumption:** Scene transition scores follow a bimodal distribution separable by a single threshold.
- **Evidence anchors:** KDE-GMM algorithm details in Section 3.1; weak direct corpus support for KDE-GMM specifically.
- **Break condition:** Fails when score distributions are unimodal or heavily overlapping, yielding unstable threshold estimates.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** LLM-based query expansion improves retrieval by generating semantically equivalent query variants.
- **Mechanism:** User query q is submitted to Gemini, producing paraphrased alternatives Q = {q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ}. Each variant is embedded and matched against FAISS index independently; top-k results are merged by selecting distinct keyframes with highest similarity scores.
- **Core assumption:** Expanded queries remain semantically faithful to user intent and retrieval models generalize across paraphrases.
- **Evidence anchors:** LLM query expansion mentioned in abstract; Figure 5 shows correction of incorrect retrieval through expansion; TCDE and Aligned Query Expansion papers support effectiveness in text domains.
- **Break condition:** Degrades when LLM introduces hallucinated or off-topic expansions, or when latency/quota constraints limit deployment.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Cross-modal temporal event retrieval enables more robust multi-scene queries by allowing per-scene modality specialization.
- **Mechanism:** For k-scene temporal query, each scene can use different modality (e.g., semantic text for scene 1, OCR for scene 2, object metadata for scene 3). Results are retrieved per scene independently, then Algorithm 2 enumerates candidate frame tuples, scores them based on rank positions and temporal window constraints (0 < f₂ - f₁ < w_d), and returns highest-scoring sequence.
- **Core assumption:** Temporal ordering is strict and pivot scene retrieval is sufficiently accurate to anchor the sequence.
- **Evidence anchors:** Cross-modal temporal event retrieval framework mentioned in abstract; Figure 6 shows cross-modal robustness; MADTempo supports broader temporal reasoning.
- **Break condition:** Fails when pivot scene retrieves no relevant frames, or when temporal window size w_d is misconfigured relative to actual scene duration.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Gaussian Mixture Models and EM Algorithm
  - *Why needed here:* Core to KDE-GMM thresholding; requires understanding soft assignments, component means/variances, and iterative likelihood maximization.
  - *Quick check:* Given a bimodal score distribution, can you explain why the intersection of two Gaussian PDFs minimizes classification error under equal priors?

- **Concept:** Vision-Language Alignment (CLIP/BEiT3)
  - *Why needed here:* These models provide joint embedding space for semantic retrieval; understanding contrastive pretraining explains text-visual frame matching.
  - *Quick check:* What does it mean for a text embedding and an image embedding to be "aligned" in CLIP's shared space?

- **Concept:** Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
  - *Why needed here:* Combines multiple ranked lists into unified ranking; critical for multimodal result integration.
  - *Quick check:* Why does RRF use 1/(k + rᵢ(d)) rather than raw similarity scores for fusion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video input → TransNetV2 with KDE-GMM thresholding → K-Means keyframe selection → MobileNetV2 features → parallel feature extraction (CLIP/BEiT3 → FAISS, YOLO → MongoDB, OCR → MongoDB, color) → Gemini query expansion → parallel retrieval streams → RRF fusion → optional temporal re-ranking → final ranking

- **Critical path:** 1) Video input → scene segmentation (KDE-GMM) → keyframe extraction 2) Keyframes → parallel feature extraction (CLIP/BEiT3, YOLO, OCR, color) 3) User query → optional Gemini expansion → parallel retrieval streams 4) Retrieval results → RRF fusion → optional temporal re-ranking → final ranking

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Gemini API vs. local LLM: API eliminates deployment overhead but introduces latency (~100-500ms per query) and quota limits; local deployment inverts this tradeoff
  - Multiple YOLO versions: YOLOv11 (COCO) + YOLOv8 (OpenImagesV7) increases object coverage but doubles inference cost
  - Fixed temporal window (w_d=10): Covers ~3 scenes but may miss longer-range dependencies or over-constrain shorter videos

- **Failure signatures:**
  - KDE-GMM returns extreme threshold: Indicates unimodal or highly skewed score distribution; fallback to fixed threshold needed
  - Temporal re-ranking returns empty results: Pivot scene retrieved no frames; check embedding quality or expand top-k for first query
  - OCR-heavy queries fail: Text detection may have missed low-contrast or stylized text; verify CRAFT detection output

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. KDE-GMM vs. fixed threshold ablation: Run TransNetV2 with fixed threshold vs. KDE-GMM on held-out videos; measure scene boundary F1 and keyframe quality
  2. Query expansion impact: Run retrieval with and without Gemini expansion on ambiguous queries; compute Recall@k and measure latency overhead
  3. Cross-modal temporal retrieval stress test: Construct 4-scene temporal queries with different modalities per scene; compare against single-modality baselines on temporal sequence accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but based on the identified limitations and the methodology presented, several implicit questions emerge:

1. How can the latency and API quota constraints introduced by the external Gemini model be mitigated while preserving the semantic benefits of query expansion?

2. Does the cross-modal temporal event retrieval framework scale effectively to temporal sequences longer than the four-scene maximum tested in the challenge?

3. How robust is the KDE-GMM algorithm when applied to videos with gradual transitions that lack a clear bimodal score distribution?

## Limitations

- KDE-GMM thresholding assumes bimodal score distributions; performance degrades when scene transitions are subtle or absent
- Cross-modal temporal retrieval relies heavily on accurate first-scene retrieval; no robustness analysis when pivot query fails
- System's real-world performance demonstrated only on Ho Chi Minh AI Challenge dataset, limiting generalizability claims

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Query expansion using LLMs (Gemini) for semantic broadening - supported by multiple corpus papers (TCDE, Aligned Query Expansion)
- **Medium confidence:** KDE-GMM adaptive thresholding - novel contribution with limited direct corpus support; mechanism sound but untested on edge cases
- **Medium confidence:** Cross-modal temporal retrieval framework - conceptually supported by MADTempo, but specific implementation details need empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **KDE-GMM robustness test:** Run KDE-GMM on videos with varying scene transition densities (from dense cuts to near-continuous shots) and measure threshold stability and scene segmentation F1 compared to fixed threshold baselines

2. **Pivot failure analysis:** Systematically remove the first query's correct frames from the retrieval set and measure how often cross-modal temporal retrieval still succeeds vs. single-modality approaches

3. **Temporal window sensitivity:** Evaluate retrieval accuracy across different temporal window sizes (w_d=5, 10, 15) on videos with known scene durations to identify optimal window configuration and failure patterns
