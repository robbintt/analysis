# MMR-V: What's Left Unsaid? A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.04141
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04141
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Current models struggle with multimodal deep video reasoning, with best model o4-mini achieving only 52.5% accuracy vs human 86% baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MMR-V, a benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal deep reasoning in videos, addressing a critical gap in existing video understanding benchmarks that focus on perception and understanding tasks within question frames and adjacent frames. MMR-V requires models to infer and analyze evidence frames far from the question frame, involving reasoning over hidden information across long temporal ranges. The benchmark includes 317 videos and 1,257 tasks across six categories, with tasks manually annotated for reliability and confusability. Experiments with nine proprietary and eleven open-source models reveal that current models struggle significantly with multimodal reasoning, achieving only 52.5% accuracy on average, and that reasoning enhancement strategies like Chain-of-Thought provide limited improvements.

## Method Summary
The MMR-V benchmark evaluates 20 multimodal models (9 proprietary, 11 open-source) on 317 videos spanning 1,257 multiple-choice tasks requiring long-range, multi-frame reasoning. Models process video frames (8-512 depending on capacity), optional audio streams, question text, and 10 options per question under zero-shot and zero-shot+CoT settings. The benchmark categorizes tasks into implicit reasoning (metaphor, theme, emotion) and explicit reasoning (causal, sequential, counterintuitive) types. Evaluation measures accuracy against human baseline of 86%, with experiments conducted on 4×A100 80GB GPUs. The methodology includes manual annotation of distractors and analysis of model reasoning traces to identify failure modes.

## Key Results
- Current models achieve only 52.5% accuracy on MMR-V, significantly below human baseline of 86%
- Chain-of-Thought prompting provides minimal improvement (0.57% average gain) on MMR-V
- Models perform better on implicit tasks (+7.9%) than explicit tasks due to distributed visual cues in implicit reasoning
- Adding audio modality provides modest improvements of 1-1.4% for models supporting full-modal input

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Current multimodal models fail at deep video reasoning primarily because they default to text-dominant reasoning over question-adjacent frames rather than locating and analyzing long-range evidence frames.
- Mechanism: When presented with video questions, models tend to briefly perceive the frame mentioned in the question and nearby frames, then perform extended textual reasoning over question and option text, without integrating visual evidence mining into the reasoning chain. This creates a mismatch between the multimodal reasoning demanded and the text-oriented CoT strategies that work well for language tasks.
- Core assumption: The observed performance gap stems from architectural/behavioral limitations in multi-frame evidence localization, not solely from insufficient model scale or training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Further analysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from it in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains."
  - [section 4.2]: "Analysis of sampled model responses shows that visual analysis accounts for only about 10% of the CoTs. This reveals that reasoning process of current model is mostly text-based (reasoning on questions and options), relying on visual perception of question frame, instead of integrating visual reasoning and evidence mining into CoTs."
  - [section 4.5]: "Lack of Visual Reasoning accounts for the largest proportion [47% of errors]. This indicates that current models still lack genuine multimodal reasoning capabilities."
  - [corpus]: "Video Finetuning Improves Reasoning Between Frames" (FMR=0.63) provides supporting evidence that explicit video fine-tuning with visual CoT can improve inter-frame reasoning, indirectly validating that default behavior lacks this capability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Task type significantly affects model performance: implicit reasoning tasks are easier than explicit reasoning tasks because implicit cues are distributed throughout videos, reducing the precision required for evidence localization.
- Mechanism: Implicit tasks (e.g., metaphor, theme, emotion) often embed meaningful visual signals across many frames, providing redundant evidence that reduces the burden on precise frame retrieval. Explicit tasks (e.g., causal reasoning about specific events, counterintuitive reasoning, sequential structure) require identifying sparse, localized evidence—demanding more accurate long-range frame reasoning.
- Core assumption: The performance differential between implicit and explicit tasks reflects differences in evidence distribution rather than differences in reasoning complexity per se.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2]: "Firstly, the models performed better on implicit tasks than on explicit tasks (with an average gain of +7.9%). Through analysis of tasks and model responses, we found that in implicit tasks, video creators often embed implicit meanings throughout the entire video, resulting in abundant visual cues that can support reasoning."
  - [section 4.2]: "In contrast, explicit tasks demand finer-grained reasoning and the ability to identify specific evidence."
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus evidence on implicit vs. explicit task differentiation; related work focuses on long-video understanding benchmarks (HLV-1K, LongVideoBench) without this specific categorization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adding audio modality provides modest but consistent performance improvements because it supplies complementary evidence for tasks where visual information alone is ambiguous or incomplete.
- Mechanism: Audio carries information (dialogue, ambient sounds, music cues) that can disambiguate visual content, particularly for implicit reasoning tasks where tone, emotion, and context matter. However, improvements are limited (~1-1.4%) because current models may not fully integrate audio-visual reasoning or because the benchmark's core challenges (long-range frame reasoning) remain visual.
- Core assumption: The observed improvements reflect genuine audio-visual integration rather than models simply having more total signal to exploit.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4]: "For models that support full-modal input, we compared their performance before and after incorporating the audio modality... Gemini 2.0-Flash, Gemini 2.0-Flash-Thinking, and Phi-4-multimodal-instruct showed improvements of 1.4%, 1.0%, and 1.0%, respectively."
  - [abstract]: Not explicitly mentioned; audio contribution is a secondary finding.
  - [corpus]: "See, Hear, and Understand: Benchmarking Audiovisual Human Speech Understanding" (FMR=0.62) provides external evidence that audiovisual integration remains challenging and under-evaluated in current benchmarks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Dual Process Theory (System 1 vs. System 2 reasoning)**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly grounds its task categorization (implicit vs. explicit reasoning) in Kahneman's Dual Process Theory. Understanding this distinction helps interpret why implicit tasks may feel "effortless" for humans but remain challenging for models lacking world knowledge integration.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why implicit reasoning tasks (like metaphor understanding) might be easier for humans but harder to evaluate in models compared to explicit tasks like causal reasoning?

- Concept: **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central finding is that standard CoT strategies provide limited gains for multimodal video reasoning. Understanding how CoT works in text-only settings is prerequisite to appreciating why visual CoT differs.
  - Quick check question: In standard text-based CoT, what role does intermediate reasoning play, and why might this not transfer directly to video reasoning where evidence is distributed across frames?

- Concept: **Multi-frame Evidence Localization in Videos**
  - Why needed here: The core challenge MMR-V addresses is that models must locate relevant frames distant from the question frame. This is distinct from single-image reasoning or adjacent-frame perception that current benchmarks optimize for.
  - Quick check question: Given a 277-second average video with 12 evidence frames spanning ~60% of duration, what search and retrieval capabilities would a model need to efficiently locate task-relevant evidence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video frames -> Frame sampling module -> Visual encoder -> Multimodal fusion -> Reasoning module -> Output

- Critical path:
  1. Frame sampling quality (insufficient frames → missing evidence)
  2. Evidence frame identification (model must locate non-question frames with relevant clues)
  3. Visual-textual integration in reasoning chain (current failure: text-dominant CoT with ~10% visual analysis)
  4. Long-range dependency modeling across frames (explicit tasks require connecting sparse evidence across temporal distance)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Frame count vs. context length**: More frames capture more evidence but increase computational cost and may exceed context windows. Paper shows accuracy improves with more frames but plateaus as reasoning capacity becomes the bottleneck.
  - **Implicit vs. explicit task optimization**: Training for implicit reasoning (abundant distributed cues) may not transfer to explicit reasoning (sparse localized evidence).
  - **Audio inclusion**: Adds ~1% performance but requires multimodal architecture support; may not justify complexity for video-only deployments.
  - **CoT prompting vs. direct answering**: CoT provides only 0.57% average gain on MMR-V (vs. significant gains in text tasks), suggesting current CoT formulations don't address visual reasoning gaps.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Lack of Visual Reasoning (47% of errors)**: Model perceives question frame briefly, then conducts extended text analysis of options without returning to video. CoT shows sequential option comparison rather than frame-by-frame evidence gathering.
  - **Question-frame fixation**: Model analyzes only frames immediately adjacent to the referenced moment, missing distant evidence (e.g., magician's reveal at end of video explaining earlier trick).
  - **Implicit Misinterpretation (26% of errors)**: Model surface-level perception misses deeper metaphorical or emotional meaning, selecting literal interpretations.
  - **Hallucination (6% of errors)**: Model invents visual details not present in frames.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Visual-CoT intervention**: Implement explicit visual checkpoints in the reasoning chain where the model must describe and analyze specific frames before proceeding. Measure whether forcing visual analysis at intermediate steps improves evidence localization. Compare against baseline text-dominant CoT on explicit reasoning subtasks.
  2. **Frame retrieval ablation**: Test whether providing oracle evidence frames (frames containing correct answer clues) improves performance, isolating whether failure is due to retrieval or reasoning. Use this to quantify the retrieval vs. reasoning contribution to overall error.
  3. **Audio-visual fusion analysis**: For models supporting audio, analyze performance delta on task subcategories where audio provides critical information (e.g., emotion recognition with tone cues vs. purely visual emotion). Identify which task types benefit most and whether fusion is occurring at the right abstraction level.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can model architectures or training paradigms be redesigned to ensure Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes actively integrate visual evidence mining rather than performing text-based reasoning on perceived information?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state in Section 4.5 that visual analysis accounts for only 10% of CoTs and conclude that the CoT demanded for multimodal reasoning differs significantly from textual reasoning (Abstract, Conclusion).
- **Why unresolved**: Current "thinking" models treat visual inputs as static context for text generation rather than iterative evidence sources, leading to a reliance on surface-level perception.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Development of models that demonstrate a significant increase in "visual analysis" steps within their reasoning traces and a corresponding accuracy increase on the MMR-V benchmark.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can video-MLLMs be trained to overcome "question frame" bias and autonomously locate evidence in temporally distant frames required for explicit reasoning tasks?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper defines MMR-V by the need to analyze evidence frames far from the question frame (Abstract) and notes that models perform significantly worse on explicit tasks (like Causal or Sequential Reasoning) where evidence is localized rather than dispersed (Section 4.2).
- **Why unresolved**: Standard attention mechanisms and uniform frame sampling often prioritize immediate context, causing models to miss specific, long-range visual clues necessary for explicit logical deduction.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A model architecture that demonstrates improved performance on the "Explicit Reasoning" subset of MMR-V, specifically on tasks requiring reasoning across high temporal distances.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: To what extent does the integration of audio modalities bridge the gap between model and human performance on implicit reasoning tasks such as Emotion Recognition?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] Section 4.4 shows audio improves overall performance, but the paper explicitly notes a significant human-model gap, particularly in implicit reasoning where humans leverage subtle cues (Section 4.2).
- **Why unresolved**: While the authors observed general improvements with audio, the specific interaction between audio cues and complex implicit semantic understanding (like humor or metaphor) remains under-analyzed.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Detailed ablation studies showing accuracy gains specifically in "Implicit Reasoning" categories when audio is introduced, compared to visual-only baselines.

## Limitations
- **Dataset availability**: The core video dataset, questions, options, and answers are not included in the paper, only examples are provided.
- **Proprietary model implementations**: Exact API versions, configurations, and temperature/decoding parameters for proprietary models are not disclosed.
- **Annotation platform details**: The specific annotation platform and exact distractor generation prompts for GPT-4o are not fully specified.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mechanism explaining why current models fail at multimodal video reasoning (text-dominant CoT vs. visual reasoning integration) is well-supported by analysis of sampled model responses and error categorization. The finding that o4-mini's superior performance correlates with more frame analysis provides strong evidence for this claim.
- **Medium Confidence**: The implicit vs. explicit task differentiation is well-reasoned but relies on analysis of a single benchmark's task structure. External validation across multiple benchmarks would strengthen this claim.
- **Low Confidence**: The audio modality contribution finding (1-1.4% improvement) is based on only three models and may not generalize across the broader model landscape.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Validation**: Verify the MMR-V dataset is publicly available with complete video URLs, questions, options, and ground truth labels before attempting reproduction.

2. **Error Analysis Replication**: Independently categorize model errors on a subset of MMR-V tasks to confirm the 47% "Lack of Visual Reasoning" finding and validate the error distribution reported.

3. **Cross-Benchmark Comparison**: Test whether the implicit/explicit performance differential (7.9% average gap) holds on other video reasoning benchmarks like HLV-1K or LongVideoBench to assess generalizability of this finding.
