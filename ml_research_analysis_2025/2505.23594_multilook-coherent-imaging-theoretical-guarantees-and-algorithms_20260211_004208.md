# Multilook Coherent Imaging: Theoretical Guarantees and Algorithms

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.23594
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23594
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Establishes first MSE upper bound for MLE under DIP hypothesis and develops Bagged-DIP-PGD achieving 1.09-1.47 dB improvement over state-of-the-art

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses image reconstruction from multilook coherent measurements with speckle noise, establishing theoretical guarantees and developing practical algorithms. The authors prove the first theoretical upper bound on MSE for maximum likelihood estimation under the deep image prior hypothesis, showing dependence on the number of parameters, looks, signal dimension, and measurements per look. They introduce Bagged-DIP-PGD, which combines projected gradient descent with bagging of deep image prior networks and Newton-Schulz matrix inversion. Extensive experiments on natural images demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in undersampled regimes where the method outperforms previous approaches by 1.09-1.47 dB.

## Method Summary
The method formulates image recovery as constrained maximum likelihood estimation over the range of an untrained CNN (deep image prior). Projected gradient descent is used with two key innovations: bagging strategy and Newton-Schulz matrix inversion. The bagging approach trains separate DIPs on different patch sizes (32×32, 64×64, 128×128), averaging their outputs to reduce variance and prevent overfitting. Newton-Schulz iteration provides fast matrix inversion with fallback to exact inversion when estimates change too rapidly. The algorithm uses adaptive learning rates (0.001 for L≤8, 0.01 for L>8) and trains DIP networks with 4 blocks of 128 channels each.

## Key Results
- Establishes first MSE upper bound for MLE under DIP hypothesis with polynomial growth in signal dimension n
- Bagged-DIP-PGD achieves 1.09-1.47 dB improvement over previous methods in undersampled regimes
- Newton-Schulz iteration provides ~500-1000× speedup over exact matrix inversion with identical PSNR curves
- Method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on 8 natural images with varying sampling rates (0.125-0.5) and looks (1-128)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Projected Gradient Descent with Deep Image Prior Projection
The constrained MLE problem is solved by alternating between likelihood gradient descent and projection onto the deep image prior manifold. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the gradient of the negative log-likelihood, takes a gradient step, then projects the result onto the image manifold defined by an untrained CNN. This projection is achieved by optimizing network parameters to minimize the distance between the network output and the current estimate. The alternation between data fidelity and structural regularization enables recovery even when measurements are fewer than unknowns.

### Mechanism 2: Bagged Deep Image Prior for Variance Reduction
Multiple DIP reconstructions from different patch partitions are averaged to reduce variance without manual network tuning. The method creates K weakly dependent estimates by training separate DIPs on non-overlapping patches of different sizes. Each patch-based DIP sees only local information, creating estimation errors with limited correlation. Averaging these estimates exploits the classical bagging principle: variance of average equals single variance divided by K when estimates are uncorrelated.

### Mechanism 3: Newton-Schulz Iterative Matrix Inversion for Computational Efficiency
A single Newton-Schulz iteration per PGD step is sufficient to maintain convergence while dramatically reducing computational cost. The gradient computation requires inverting a 2m×2m matrix at each iteration. Newton-Schulz iteration approximates the inverse quadratically fast, and since consecutive iterates are close, the previous inverse provides excellent initialization. The paper shows empirically that one iteration suffices because the initialization is already near the true inverse.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Deep Image Prior (DIP)**
  - Why needed here: Both the theoretical bound and algorithm depend on understanding that untrained CNNs have implicit bias toward natural images, enabling them to fit clean images faster than noise
  - Quick check question: Given a randomly initialized CNN with fixed random input u, if you train it to minimize ||g_θ(u) - y||² where y is a noisy image, what happens to reconstruction quality as training iterations increase?

- **Concept: Speckle Noise as Multiplicative Noise**
  - Why needed here: Unlike additive Gaussian noise, speckle multiplies the signal (y = AXw + z), making the likelihood function more complex and requiring specialized gradient derivations
  - Quick check question: In the multilook model y_ℓ = AX₀w_ℓ + z_ℓ, why does taking more looks (increasing L) help with estimation even though the measurement matrix A remains constant?

- **Concept: Constrained Maximum Likelihood Estimation**
  - Why needed here: The paper formulates recovery as minimizing the negative log-likelihood over a constraint set C, with Theorem III.1 bounding the MSE of this estimator
  - Quick check question: In Eq. (5), why does the log-likelihood contain both a log-det term and a quadratic-form term? What does each term penalize?

```

- **Critical path**: The gradient computation through Newton-Schulz inversion must be numerically stable; the DIP training must converge within specified iterations. The algorithm is most sensitive to the Newton-Schulz initialization quality.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - More bagging estimates (K) → lower variance but linear increase in computation
  - Larger patch sizes → better context but higher correlation between estimates
  - More PGD iterations → better convergence but risk of overfitting
  - Exact inversion fallback threshold δ_x = 0.12 balances stability vs. speed

- **Failure signatures**:
  - PSNR decreases after initial increase: DIP overfitting → reduce DIP training iterations
  - Gradient explosion: Newton-Schulz divergence → check δ_x threshold, ensure exact inversion triggers
  - Stagnant PSNR despite more looks: Simple DIP architecture limiting factor → use Bagged-DIP
  - Reconstruction has patch artifacts: Patch sizes too small → increase minimum patch size

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Sanity check with exact inversion**: Run PGD with exact matrix inversion on a 64×64 image with L=32, m/n=0.5. Verify the algorithm can recover a simple test image.
  2. **Newton-Schulz ablation**: Compare convergence curves for exact inversion always, 1-step Newton-Schulz always, and adaptive (exact when ||x_t - x_{t-1}||_∞ > 0.12).
  3. **Bagged-DIP contribution**: For a fixed test image, compare single full-image DIP, single 64×64 patch DIP, and Bagged-DIP with K=3 patch sizes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the sharp/optimal rate at which MSE grows with signal dimension n in multilook coherent imaging with speckle noise?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Remark III.4 states: "However, the exact rate at which the error increases is yet unclear. Nonetheless, we believe the dependency on L for the term nk log n/Lm² is sharp..."
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes an upper bound with polynomial growth in n, contrasting with logarithmic growth in additive-noise models, but does not provide lower bounds to confirm tightness
- What evidence would resolve it: Derivation of matching lower bounds showing the same polynomial dependence on n, or construction of problem instances that achieve the upper bound rate

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the theoretical MSE bounds be extended to the general case with both speckle and additive noise (σ_z > 0)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section III-A states the main theorem is proven "Consider the case of no additive noise, i.e. σ_z = 0."
- Why unresolved: The proof techniques simplify analysis by assuming no additive noise; incorporating both noise types introduces additional complexity not addressed
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified Theorem III.1 with explicit MSE dependence on both σ_w² and σ_z², maintaining sharp dependence on k, m, n, and L

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal number and configuration of bagged DIP estimates for minimizing reconstruction error?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section IV-B2 states: "The goal of this section is not to explore the full-potential of Bagged-DIPs... we have only considered three bagged estimates."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates feasibility with K=3 estimates using fixed patch sizes but provides no theoretical guidance on optimal K or patch configurations
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic empirical study across varying K and patch sizes, or theoretical analysis connecting bagging configuration to variance reduction and reconstruction quality

## Limitations

- The theoretical MSE bound relies heavily on the deep image prior hypothesis, which lacks rigorous mathematical foundation in the literature
- The Newton-Schulz approximation's stability guarantee is asymptotic and not rigorously verified for the specific problem structure
- The bagging strategy's variance reduction depends on weak dependence between patch-based estimates, but the paper doesn't quantify or prove this dependence structure

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The gradient computation, likelihood function formulation, and basic PGD framework are mathematically sound and well-established in optimization literature
- **Medium Confidence**: The empirical improvements (1.09-1.47 dB) are convincingly demonstrated, but exact contribution of each component is difficult to isolate
- **Low Confidence**: The theoretical guarantees for the MSE bound under the deep image prior hypothesis, while novel, depend on assumptions that are not fully validated

## Next Checks

1. **Theoretical validation**: Reproduce the MSE bound derivation independently, focusing on the concentration inequalities used to bound the estimation error. Verify the conditions under which the bound holds and test edge cases where assumptions might break.

2. **Component ablation study**: Run controlled experiments that isolate each algorithmic innovation: compare exact inversion vs. Newton-Schulz, single DIP vs. bagged DIP, and different patch sizes to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains.

3. **Generalization test**: Apply Bagged-DIP-PGD to datasets beyond natural images (medical imaging, satellite imagery) to assess whether the deep image prior hypothesis and bagging strategy transfer to different image domains with distinct statistical properties.
