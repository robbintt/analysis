# GVCCS: A Dataset for Contrail Identification and Tracking on Visible Whole Sky Camera Sequences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.18330
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18330
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: First open dataset for instance-level contrail segmentation, tracking, and flight attribution using ground-based visible spectrum cameras

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GVCCS, the first open dataset specifically designed for contrail identification and tracking from ground-based visible spectrum cameras. The dataset contains 122 video sequences with 24,228 frames and temporally consistent polygon annotations for 4,651 contrails. The authors establish baseline performance using Mask2Former, demonstrating that modern deep learning methods can effectively segment and track contrails from ground-based imagery, with Dice scores around 0.6 and mIoU around 0.4 for semantic segmentation tasks.

## Method Summary
The GVCCS dataset was created by collecting video sequences from whole sky cameras at three sites in Germany between 2017-2022. Contrails were annotated using polygon masks at 20-30 frames per second, with each contrail tracked across its lifetime. The annotation process involved identifying contrails, creating initial masks, and then tracking them temporally. For evaluation, the authors used Mask2Former, a state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation model, comparing its performance against a U-Net baseline. Two formulations were tested: single-polygon (treating fragmented contrails as multiple instances) and multi-polygon (treating each contrail as a single instance despite fragmentation).

## Key Results
- GVCCS contains 122 video sequences with 24,228 frames and 4,651 contrail annotations
- Mask2Former achieved Dice scores around 0.6 and mIoU around 0.4 for semantic segmentation
- Multi-polygon formulation (AP@[0.25:0.75|all|100] = 0.34) was more challenging than single-polygon (0.35) but showed comparable performance
- Mask2Former outperformed U-Net baseline on instance segmentation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of contrail detection and tracking using deep learning methods stems from the dataset's consistent annotation approach and the temporal continuity of contrail evolution. Contrails exhibit predictable patterns of formation, persistence, and dissipation that can be learned from sequential frames. The multi-polygon formulation captures the natural fragmentation of contrails due to atmospheric conditions, providing a more realistic representation of real-world contrail behavior. The combination of geometric (polygon) and semantic information allows models to learn both the physical structure and environmental context of contrails.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrail physics**: Understanding contrail formation, persistence, and dissipation mechanisms is crucial for interpreting model predictions and identifying false positives/negatives. Quick check: Can you explain why contrails fragment and what atmospheric conditions affect their lifetime?
- **Panoptic segmentation**: The framework combining semantic and instance segmentation is essential for handling both contrail classification and individual tracking. Quick check: What's the difference between semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation?
- **Temporal annotation consistency**: Maintaining coherent tracking across frames requires understanding how contrails evolve over time. Quick check: How would you handle a contrail that splits into multiple fragments versus one that merges with another?
- **Evaluation metrics**: Understanding Dice coefficient, IoU, and AP@[0.25:0.75] is necessary for interpreting model performance. Quick check: What does a Dice score of 0.6 imply about segmentation quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Whole Sky Camera -> Video Sequences -> Frame Extraction -> Mask2Former Model -> Contrail Detection -> Tracking -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**: Camera Data Collection → Annotation Pipeline → Model Training → Performance Evaluation → Dataset Publication

**Design Tradeoffs**: Single-polygon formulation offers simpler tracking but loses physical realism of contrail fragmentation; multi-polygon formulation better represents reality but increases annotation complexity and computational cost.

**Failure Signatures**: False positives typically occur with cirrus clouds or aircraft condensation trails; false negatives happen with faint contrails or those partially obscured by foreground objects; tracking failures occur when contrails rapidly change shape or disappear temporarily.

**First Experiments**:
1. Train Mask2Former on a single site's data and evaluate on another site to assess geographic generalization
2. Compare single-polygon vs multi-polygon performance on contrails with varying degrees of fragmentation
3. Test different frame sampling rates (e.g., every 5th frame vs every frame) to determine minimum temporal resolution needed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Can a single deep learning architecture jointly process video, flight trajectory data, and meteorological fields to optimize detection, segmentation, tracking, and attribution simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that ideally, these tasks should be addressed by a single architecture, though integration is "not straightforward."
- Why unresolved: Current methods use separate models or pipelines; input representations and loss functions for multi-modal spatiotemporal data remain undeveloped.
- What evidence would resolve it: A unified model achieving higher mIoU or AP@[0.25:0.75] on GVCCS while maintaining consistent flight attribution compared to the disjoint Mask2Former pipeline.

**Open Question 2**: Can contrails detected by ground-based cameras be reliably linked to their evolving counterparts in satellite imagery to enable full-lifecycle monitoring?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as a "promising direction" that would allow monitoring from formation to dissipation while preserving flight attribution.
- Why unresolved: Parallax, wind drift, and resolution differences between ground and satellite modalities make continuous tracking difficult.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful instance matching between ground-based GVCCS annotations and satellite-based datasets (e.g., OpenContrails) with high temporal consistency.

**Open Question 3**: Can the GVCCS dataset be used to calibrate or validate physical models like CoCiP to improve the accuracy of contrail formation and climate impact forecasts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they plan to use the dataset to "evaluate the predictions of physical models... and potentially inform improvements."
- Why unresolved: Physics-based models rely on uncertain atmospheric inputs; it is unclear if observational ground truth can effectively refine these parameters.
- What evidence would resolve it: A reduction in error margins for CoCiP predictions of contrail persistence or spatial extent when calibrated against GVCCS ground truth.

**Open Question 4**: Does the addition of co-located infrared imaging enable accurate segmentation and radiative forcing estimation of contrails during nighttime?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the visible-light camera is restricted to daytime, a limitation they are addressing with a deployed infrared system.
- Why unresolved: The radiative impact of contrails is often greatest at night, but segmentation performance on IR data in this context is unproven.
- What evidence would resolve it: Semantic segmentation results (Dice/mIoU) from the IR system comparable to the visible spectrum results presented in the paper.

## Limitations
- Dataset size may not capture full diversity of contrail appearances across different atmospheric conditions and geographic locations
- Manual temporal annotation process introduces potential inconsistencies in annotation quality across sequences
- Geographic and temporal constraints (Germany, 2017-2022) may limit generalizability to other regions and seasons
- Performance metrics indicate substantial room for improvement, with Dice scores around 0.6 suggesting incomplete segmentation

## Confidence
- Dataset creation and characteristics: High
- Baseline model performance: Medium
- Multi-polygon vs single-polygon formulation comparison: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate model performance across different atmospheric conditions (e.g., cirrus vs non-cirrus background, varying solar angles) to assess robustness
2. Test generalization by applying trained models to data from different geographic locations and seasons not represented in the training set
3. Conduct ablation studies on the impact of temporal consistency in annotations versus frame-by-frame annotation approaches on tracking accuracy
