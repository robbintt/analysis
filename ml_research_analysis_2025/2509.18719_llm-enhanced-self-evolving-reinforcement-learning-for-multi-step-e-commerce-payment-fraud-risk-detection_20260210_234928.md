# LLM-Enhanced Self-Evolving Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Step E-Commerce Payment Fraud Risk Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.18719
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18719
- Reference count: 6
- Multi-step RL with LLM-evolved rewards significantly improves fraud detection accuracy over supervised learning baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework integrating reinforcement learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect e-commerce payment fraud. By modeling transaction risk as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, the approach enables sequential decision-making across pre-authorization, issuer check, and post-authorization stages. LLMs autonomously evolve reward functions that directly optimize precision-recall metrics, outperforming human-designed rewards. Experiments on real-world transaction data demonstrate significant improvements in fraud detection accuracy compared to baseline supervised learning models. Long-term evaluations over six months confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the evolved reward functions.

## Method Summary
The approach models payment fraud detection as a multi-step Markov Decision Process with three transaction stages: pre-authorization, issuer check, and post-authorization. The framework employs reinforcement learning with action space defined by transaction attributes, state space capturing current and historical transaction context, and reward functions evolved by LLMs to directly optimize precision-recall metrics. LLMs autonomously generate and refine reward functions through self-evolution, enabling the system to adapt to changing fraud patterns. The RL agent learns optimal decision policies that maximize detection accuracy while minimizing false positives.

## Key Results
- Significant improvements in fraud detection accuracy compared to baseline supervised learning models
- Long-term evaluation over six months confirms robustness of evolved reward functions
- Lightweight RL architecture supports efficient deployment with inference latencies under 50 milliseconds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages LLMs to autonomously evolve reward functions that directly optimize the precision-recall metrics critical for fraud detection. By treating payment processing as a multi-step MDP, the system can capture temporal dependencies and context across different transaction stages. The self-evolving reward mechanism allows the RL agent to adapt to changing fraud patterns without manual intervention. The integration of LLM-generated rewards with reinforcement learning enables more nuanced decision-making that balances fraud detection with minimizing false positives.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-step Markov Decision Process: Why needed - to model sequential decision-making across transaction stages. Quick check - verify transition probabilities between stages are accurately estimated.
- Reinforcement Learning for fraud detection: Why needed - to enable adaptive decision-making based on changing fraud patterns. Quick check - ensure reward signals are properly aligned with detection objectives.
- LLM-based reward function evolution: Why needed - to automatically generate and refine rewards that optimize precision-recall metrics. Quick check - validate evolved rewards actually improve detection performance.
- Transaction stage modeling: Why needed - to capture different risk profiles at pre-authorization, issuer check, and post-authorization phases. Quick check - confirm stage boundaries and transitions are meaningful for fraud detection.
- Real-time inference requirements: Why needed - to ensure practical deployment in high-volume payment processing. Quick check - benchmark inference latency under realistic load conditions.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Transaction Data -> Pre-processing -> State Representation -> RL Agent -> Decision Output -> Reward Evaluation -> LLM Reward Evolution

Critical Path: Transaction input → State encoding → RL action selection → Fraud/no-fraud decision → Reward calculation → LLM reward evolution

Design Tradeoffs: The framework balances detection accuracy with inference speed, using lightweight RL models to achieve sub-50ms latency while maintaining high precision. The LLM component adds computational overhead but provides superior reward function optimization compared to human-designed alternatives.

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation may occur when fraud patterns shift significantly beyond the training distribution, or when transaction stage definitions become misaligned with actual risk profiles. Reward function evolution may stall if the LLM cannot generate improvements beyond local optima.

First Experiments: 1) Benchmark baseline supervised learning models on held-out transaction data. 2) Test RL agent performance with fixed vs. evolved reward functions. 3) Evaluate inference latency under realistic transaction volumes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Proprietary real-world transaction datasets limit independent verification of results
- Specific architecture and implementation details of LLM-generated reward functions remain unclear
- Does not address potential adversarial attacks or distribution shifts in fraud patterns

## Confidence
- High: Significant improvements in fraud detection accuracy compared to baseline supervised learning models
- High: Long-term evaluation over six months confirming robustness of evolved reward functions
- Medium: LLM's autonomous evolution of reward functions directly optimizing precision-recall metrics
- Medium: Multi-step Markov Decision Process modeling across three transaction stages
- Low: Generalizability of the approach to other fraud detection domains

## Next Checks
1. Open-sourcing the codebase and evaluation datasets to enable independent reproduction and benchmarking against other fraud detection methods
2. Conducting adversarial testing by simulating sophisticated fraud patterns to assess the system's resilience to evolving attack strategies
3. Implementing cross-domain validation by applying the LLM-enhanced RL framework to different types of fraud detection scenarios to evaluate generalizability and robustness across contexts
