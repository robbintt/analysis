# KARMA: A Multilevel Decomposition Hybrid Mamba Framework for Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08939
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08939
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Novel hybrid Mamba framework with multi-level decomposition achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on eight real-world datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces KARMA, a time series forecasting framework that combines multi-level decomposition with Mamba state-space models. The key innovation is an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition (ATCD) module that dynamically extracts trend and seasonal components, and a Hybrid Frequency-Temporal Decomposition (HFTD) module that further processes these components using discrete wavelet transforms to capture frequency and temporal information. These components are processed through multi-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlocks for efficient long-range dependency modeling. Evaluated on eight real-world datasets, KARMA outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines including Transformers and other Mamba variants, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy while maintaining linear computational complexity. The framework is particularly effective for data with pronounced trend and seasonal patterns.

## Method Summary
KARMA addresses long-term time series forecasting through a hybrid decomposition-Mamba architecture. The framework employs Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition (ATCD) to separate input sequences into trend and seasonal components, followed by Hybrid Frequency-Temporal Decomposition (HFTD) that applies discrete wavelet transforms to capture both frequency and temporal characteristics. These decomposed components are then processed through multi-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlocks that enable efficient long-range dependency modeling. The architecture achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining strong performance on multivariate forecasting tasks, particularly excelling with data exhibiting clear trend and seasonal patterns.

## Key Results
- KARMA outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines including Transformers and other Mamba variants on eight real-world datasets
- Demonstrates superior predictive accuracy while maintaining linear computational complexity
- Particularly effective for data with pronounced trend and seasonal patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its multi-level decomposition approach that isolates different time series characteristics before processing. By separating trend and seasonal components through ATCD, the model can apply specialized processing to each pattern type. The subsequent HFTD module captures both frequency-domain and temporal information through discrete wavelet transforms, enabling the Mamba backbone to focus on modeling dependencies within each decomposed component rather than the raw, complex signal. This hierarchical decomposition reduces the burden on the sequence modeling component while preserving essential information for accurate forecasting.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Mamba State-Space Models**
   - Why needed: Provides efficient long-range sequence modeling with linear complexity, avoiding the quadratic complexity of Transformers
   - Quick check: Verify model maintains O(n) complexity as sequence length increases

2. **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**
   - Why needed: Enables simultaneous frequency and temporal analysis, crucial for capturing multi-scale patterns in time series
   - Quick check: Confirm wavelet coefficients preserve essential signal information

3. **Multi-level Time Series Decomposition**
   - Why needed: Separates trend, seasonal, and residual components to enable specialized processing of each pattern type
   - Quick check: Validate decomposition accuracy against ground truth patterns

4. **Adaptive Decomposition Techniques**
   - Why needed: Dynamically adjusts decomposition parameters based on input characteristics rather than using fixed thresholds
   - Quick check: Test adaptation performance across varying data patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input -> ATCD -> HFTD -> Multi-scale Mamba Blocks -> Output

**Critical Path:** The decomposition modules (ATCD and HFTD) form the critical path as they must complete before the Mamba blocks can process the signal. The Mamba blocks themselves are the computational bottleneck for sequence modeling.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Linear complexity achieved through Mamba architecture versus potential information loss from decomposition. The discrete wavelet transform provides frequency-temporal analysis but may struggle with non-stationary patterns.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on non-stationary or irregularly sampled time series, overfitting when decomposition hyperparameters are poorly tuned, and degraded accuracy when trend/seasonal patterns are weak or absent.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test decomposition accuracy on synthetic time series with known trend and seasonal components
2. Evaluate Mamba block performance with varying sequence lengths to verify linear complexity
3. Compare full KARMA against ablated versions (removing ATCD or HFTD) to isolate decomposition benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on MSE-based metrics with limited discussion of other error measures or robustness across diverse data distributions
- Decomposition module performance depends on hyperparameters without thorough sensitivity analysis
- Claims of superior performance versus Transformers and other Mamba variants lack comprehensive ablation studies isolating decomposition impact

## Confidence
- High: Architectural design and empirical improvements demonstrated through extensive benchmarking
- Medium: Decomposition approach generalizability across different time series patterns
- Low: Robustness under distributional shifts or noisy conditions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of ATCD and HFTD modules versus the Mamba backbone
2. Test the framework on irregularly sampled or non-stationary time series to assess DWT limitations
3. Evaluate computational overhead across varying decomposition levels to validate linear complexity claims
