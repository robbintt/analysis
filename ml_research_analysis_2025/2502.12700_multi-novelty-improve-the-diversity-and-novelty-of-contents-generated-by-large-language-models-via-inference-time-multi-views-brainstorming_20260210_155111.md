# Multi-Novelty: Improve the Diversity and Novelty of Contents Generated by Large Language Models via inference-time Multi-Views Brainstorming

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.12700
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12700
- **Reference count**: 24
- **Primary result**: Multi-Novelty achieves up to 9x improvement in novelty scores while maintaining correctness

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of enhancing diversity and novelty in outputs from large language models (LLMs), which often produce repetitive or overly deterministic responses. To tackle this, the authors propose a model-agnostic approach called Multi-Novelty, which enriches input prompts with multiple perspectives derived from both textual and visual sources. These multi-view embeddings are generated using tools like GPT-4o for text and Qwen-2VL for image descriptions, providing diverse starting points for the model's reasoning. The approach is evaluated across 909,000 responses from various open-source and closed-source LLMs, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen. Results show significant improvements in diversity and novelty, with up to a ninefold increase in novelty scores for some models, while maintaining correctness. The method demonstrates that incorporating multi-view embeddings can effectively enhance the creativity and variety of LLM-generated content without requiring architectural modifications.

## Method Summary
The Multi-Novelty approach enhances LLM output diversity by enriching input prompts with multiple perspectives derived from both textual and visual sources. The method generates multi-view embeddings using external models: GPT-4o for text-based perspectives and Qwen-2VL for image-based perspectives. These diverse embeddings are then incorporated into the original prompt, providing the LLM with multiple reasoning starting points. The approach is model-agnostic and can be applied during inference time without requiring architectural modifications to the base LLM. The enriched prompts are processed by various LLMs including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen models to generate outputs that are subsequently evaluated for diversity and novelty improvements.

## Key Results
- Multi-Novelty achieved up to 9x improvement in novelty scores for Qwen-2.5-7B-Chat model
- Significant improvements in diversity metrics across 909,000 responses from various LLMs
- Maintained correctness of outputs while substantially enhancing diversity and novelty
- Demonstrated effectiveness across both open-source and closed-source LLM models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Multi-Novelty approach works by enriching the input context with multiple diverse perspectives, effectively expanding the reasoning space available to the LLM. By incorporating both textual and visual multi-view embeddings generated by specialized models (GPT-4o for text, Qwen-2VL for images), the method provides the LLM with alternative starting points for content generation. This multi-perspective approach counteracts the tendency of LLMs to converge on similar or repetitive outputs by exposing them to varied conceptual frameworks early in the generation process. The diversity in initial embeddings propagates through the LLM's reasoning chain, resulting in more varied and novel final outputs while the model's inherent capabilities ensure correctness is maintained.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-view embeddings**: Why needed - To provide diverse reasoning starting points that counteract LLM output convergence. Quick check - Compare single-view versus multi-view input representations in controlled experiments.

**Inference-time augmentation**: Why needed - To enhance output diversity without requiring architectural modifications to base LLMs. Quick check - Verify that the method works across different LLM architectures and sizes.

**Diversity vs. novelty metrics**: Why needed - To quantitatively measure improvements in output variety and originality. Quick check - Ensure metrics capture meaningful differences beyond superficial variations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input prompt -> Multi-view embedding generator (GPT-4o, Qwen-2VL) -> Enriched prompt -> Target LLM -> Output evaluation

**Critical path**: The multi-view embedding generation phase is critical, as it determines the quality and diversity of perspectives provided to the LLM. Poor quality embeddings will limit the effectiveness of the approach.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades increased computational overhead and potential latency (due to multiple embedding generations) for improved output diversity. It also depends on the quality and diversity capabilities of the embedding generation models.

**Failure signatures**: Limited improvement in diversity/novelty metrics, increased computational costs without proportional benefits, or degradation in output correctness. The approach may also fail if the embedding generation models themselves produce overly similar perspectives.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Compare diversity metrics between single-view and multi-view enriched prompts using the same base LLM
2. Test the approach across different model sizes (7B, 14B, 70B parameters) to assess scalability
3. Evaluate the impact of using only textual versus only visual multi-views versus the combined approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on automatic metrics without comprehensive human evaluation of output quality
- Requires access to multiple specialized models (GPT-4o, Qwen-2VL), creating deployment overhead and cost considerations
- Experimental scope primarily focused on Chinese content, potentially limiting generalizability to other languages and domains

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The method successfully increases diversity and novelty metrics as measured by the reported evaluation framework

**Medium confidence**: The approach maintains correctness while improving diversity, based on limited validation presented

**Low confidence**: The ninefold improvement claim represents an exceptional case and may not generalize across models or tasks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess whether increased novelty translates to meaningful improvements in practical output quality and usefulness
2. Test the approach across multiple languages and domains beyond Chinese content to evaluate generalizability
3. Perform ablation studies comparing performance when using single-view versus multi-view embeddings to quantify the specific contribution of the multi-perspective approach
