# Lightweight Multi-Frame Integration for Robust YOLO Object Detection in Videos

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.20550
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20550
- **Reference count:** 27
- **Primary result:** Early fusion of 7 adjacent frames improves YOLOv7-tiny mAP@0.5 by 4.4 points on MOT20Det dataset.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of improving object detection in videos by leveraging temporal information from multiple consecutive frames. The core method involves stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a YOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single target frame. This approach uses early fusion by stacking frames at the pixel level, allowing the network to learn spatiotemporal features directly from raw pixels. The method is lightweight, requiring minimal modifications to existing architectures and maintaining real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the MOT20Det and BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models like YOLOv7-tiny. On MOT20Det, using 7 adjacent frames increases mAP@0.5 by 4.4 points over the single-frame baseline. The BOAT360 dataset, featuring fisheye video sequences from a boat, shows the method's generalizability to challenging real-world scenarios. The BOAT360 dataset is contributed to support further research in multi-frame video object detection.

## Method Summary
The proposed method stacks n consecutive RGB frames along the channel dimension (creating a 3n-channel input tensor) and feeds this to a modified YOLO detector. The first convolutional layer is expanded to handle 3n input channels, with weights initialized by replicating the pretrained 3-channel weights n times and scaling by 1/n to maintain activation magnitude consistency. This early fusion approach allows standard convolutions to jointly learn spatial and temporal features from the first layer. During training, only the target frame (typically the last in the stack) is supervised with standard YOLO loss, while preceding frames serve as temporal context. The method supports both adjacent frame sampling and stepped sampling with configurable stride. Extensive experiments on MOT20Det and BOAT360 datasets show consistent improvements over single-frame baselines, with optimal frame counts varying by dataset characteristics.

## Key Results
- Early fusion of 7 adjacent frames increases mAP@0.5 by 4.4 points on MOT20Det compared to single-frame baseline
- 3-frame adjacent configuration achieves optimal performance on BOAT360 dataset, demonstrating adaptability to different motion characteristics
- Early fusion outperforms grouped convolution by 4.4 mAP@0.5 points, showing the importance of pixel-level temporal mixing
- YOLOv7-tiny shows 8% relative improvement in mAP@0.5:0.95, while larger YOLOv7 gains are more modest, suggesting lightweight models benefit more from temporal context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Early Fusion Enables Direct Spatiotemporal Feature Learning
- **Claim:** Stacking frames at the pixel level allows standard convolutions to jointly learn spatial and temporal features from the first layer, improving detection under transient visual challenges without explicit temporal modules.
- **Mechanism:** By concatenating n consecutive RGB frames along the channel dimension (creating a 3n-channel input tensor), the first convolutional layer processes spatial patterns within frames and temporal variations across frames simultaneously. Kernels learn motion signatures and object persistence directly from pixel intensity changes across time—no optical flow or recurrent structures required.
- **Core assumption:** The network can infer meaningful temporal relationships from raw pixel differences without explicit motion modeling.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "This approach uses early fusion by stacking frames at the pixel level, allowing the network to learn spatiotemporal features directly from raw pixels."
  - [Section III-B] "This simple early fusion exposes the model to temporal variations at the pixel level from the first convolutional layer onward."
  - [Section IV-C] "fusing spatial-temporal information early at the pixel-level allows the network to learn richer joint features, whereas restricting low-level channels by frame (grouping) hinders effective feature integration."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is limited for this specific early-fusion mechanism in detection; related work (e.g., "Temporal Object-Aware Vision Transformer") addresses temporal consistency but via different architectural approaches.
- **Break condition:** Performance degrades when the temporal window exceeds an optimal range—9 adjacent frames reduced mAP@0.5 from 0.855 (7 frames) to 0.829, suggesting excessive temporal context introduces noise.

### Mechanism 2: Implicit Temporal Redundancy Buffers Transient Degradation
- **Claim:** Multi-frame input provides cross-frame evidence that compensates for localized degradation (occlusion, blur, glare) in the target frame.
- **Mechanism:** When the target frame has corrupted or missing object information, preceding frames may contain clearer views. The network learns to aggregate evidence across the temporal stack, effectively "filling in" from context frames. Grad-CAM++ visualizations show more localized attention on objects in challenging scenarios compared to diffuse activations in single-frame baselines.
- **Core assumption:** Objects maintain sufficient visual consistency across the temporal window for cross-frame correlation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions, and abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection performance."
  - [Section IV-F] "The examples showcase challenging scenarios where the multi-frame detector demonstrates clear advantages over the single-frame baseline, including partial object truncation at the image boundary, motion blur, occlusion, and sunlight glare."
  - [Figure 3 caption] "heatmaps from our multi-frame model, showing improved focus and spatial understanding contributed by temporal context."
  - [corpus] "Human-Centric Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos Using YOLO-World and Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning" similarly leverages spatio-temporal modeling for robustness under visual clutter, supporting the general principle.
- **Break condition:** Fast scene dynamics break the consistency assumption—BOAT360 showed peak performance at only 3 frames, degrading beyond 5 frames due to rapid scene changes from the moving boat platform.

### Mechanism 3: Scaled Weight Replication Preserves Pretrained Feature Distribution
- **Claim:** Initializing the expanded first-layer weights by replicating pretrained weights with 1/n scaling maintains activation magnitude consistency, enabling stable optimization.
- **Mechanism:** The first convolutional layer is expanded from 3 to 3n input channels. Weights are initialized by copying the pretrained 3-channel kernel n times and scaling by 1/n. This ensures the output magnitude matches the original single-frame model at initialization, preventing distribution shifts that would require extensive relearning. Gradients then specialize kernels for temporal patterns during fine-tuning.
- **Core assumption:** Pretrained features generalize sufficiently across all frames in the temporal stack.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III-C] "This initialization ensures that, at the start of training, the response of the first convolution remains consistent with the original single-frame model, facilitating stable optimization and faster convergence."
  - [Section IV] All configurations converged before the final epoch, indicating efficient optimization.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific initialization strategy in multi-frame detection contexts.
- **Break condition:** Large domain shifts between pretrained data (e.g., ImageNet) and target video data may limit initialization benefits, requiring more aggressive learning rates or longer training.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Channel-wise concatenation (early fusion)**
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how stacking frames along the channel dimension differs from other fusion strategies is essential for implementing the method correctly and debugging feature extraction.
  - **Quick check question:** If you have 5 RGB frames of size 640×640, what is the shape of the stacked input tensor? (Answer: (15, 640, 640))

- **Concept: Grouped convolution vs standard convolution**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper compares early fusion (standard conv) against grouped convolution; understanding the difference explains why early fusion outperforms grouped approaches.
  - **Quick check question:** In grouped convolution with n groups processing n frames separately, at which layer are temporal features first combined? (Answer: Only after the grouped conv layer)

- **Concept: Sparse/weak supervision in video**
  - **Why needed here:** The method supervises only the target frame despite multi-frame input—understanding this reduces labeling costs and clarifies why the approach is practical.
  - **Quick check question:** If you use 7 frames as input but only label frame index 6, what role do frames 0–5 play during training? (Answer: They provide temporal context for learning spatiotemporal features)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Frame stacking (3n, H, W) -> First conv layer (3×3×3n kernels, scaled weight replication) -> Backbone (standard YOLOv7/YOLOv7-tiny) -> Detection head (standard YOLO outputs) -> Loss (applied only to target frame predictions)

- **Critical path:** Frame stacking strategy -> first-layer weight initialization -> augmentation consistency across frames -> single-frame supervision

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Adjacent vs stepped frames: Adjacent captures fine motion; stepped spans longer temporal context with fewer frames (Table IV shows 3 frames step-3 matches 7 adjacent)
  - Early fusion vs grouped conv: Early fusion (+4.4 mAP@0.5 over baseline) outperforms grouped (-0.12 to -0.51 vs early fusion) because early pixel-level mixing learns richer joint features
  - Frame count: More frames help up to a point (7 optimal on MOT20Det), then degrade (9 frames worse than 7)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - mAP degradation with >7 frames: Temporal window too large; noise dominates signal
  - Grouped conv underperforming: Early fusion likely needed for your data
  - Fast scene changes (e.g., moving camera): Reduce frame count to 3–5

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline + 3-frame adjacent early fusion:** Modify first conv layer, initialize with scaled weight replication, train on your dataset. Compare mAP@0.5 against single-frame baseline.
  2. **Frame count sweep (3, 5, 7 adjacent):** Identify optimal temporal window for your domain. Monitor for degradation at higher counts.
  3. **Sparse sampling test (3 frames, step-3):** Compare against best adjacent-frame config to evaluate whether temporal coverage matters more than frame density for your use case.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can adaptive frame selection strategies dynamically determine the optimal temporal window based on scene content and motion characteristics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state: "In future work, we aim to... explore adaptive frame selection strategies."
- **Why unresolved:** Current experiments use fixed frame counts (3, 5, 7, 9) and fixed step sizes, but results show 9 frames degrade performance while 7 frames peak on MOT20Det, and only 3 frames work best on BOAT360 due to rapid scene changes.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A mechanism that automatically adjusts frame count and sampling stride per video based on motion magnitude, occlusion frequency, or scene dynamics, evaluated across diverse datasets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can lightweight temporal attention mechanisms be integrated with the early fusion approach to further improve detection without violating real-time constraints?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state: "In future work, we aim to... investigate integration with lightweight temporal attention mechanisms to further boost video object detection performance while maintaining real-time constraints."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates that simple frame stacking works, but does not explore whether learnable attention over temporal features could enhance the implicit temporal learning.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparison of early fusion with and without temporal attention modules, measuring both mAP improvements and FPS retention on embedded hardware like Orin AGX.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Why does early fusion consistently outperform grouped convolution for temporal integration, and under what conditions might grouped convolution be preferable?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Table V shows grouped convolution degrades performance across all configurations (e.g., 7-frame adjacent drops from 85.5% to 80.4% mAP@0.5), but the paper only hypothesizes that "fusing spatial-temporal information early at the pixel-level allows the network to learn richer joint features."
- **Why unresolved:** The intuition for grouped convolution (independent low-level feature extraction per frame) seemed reasonable, yet results consistently contradict this. The mechanism causing this performance gap remains unexplained.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies analyzing learned filter patterns in early vs. grouped convolutions, or experiments with different network depths and feature resolutions to identify when temporal mixing at different stages helps.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Why do larger-capacity models (YOLOv7) benefit less from temporal context than lightweight models (YOLOv7-tiny)?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Table VI shows YOLOv7 gains are marginal (+0.9 mAP@0.5:0.95 best case) compared to YOLOv7-tiny gains (+8% relative improvement). The authors only hypothesize: "the high-capacity YOLOv7 model already achieves strong single-frame performance, leaving less opportunity for additional temporal information."
- **Why unresolved:** This is a reasonable hypothesis but not experimentally validated. Alternative explanations could include different feature learning dynamics, overfitting with additional input channels, or architectural differences.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments varying model capacity while controlling for architecture, or analyzing whether single-frame YOLOv7 already learns features that multi-frame YOLOv7-tiny acquires from temporal context.

## Limitations

- Performance gains depend heavily on temporal consistency of target domain, with fast-moving scenes limiting effective temporal window
- Optimal frame count varies significantly by dataset characteristics (7 frames for MOT20Det vs 3 frames for BOAT360), requiring domain-specific tuning
- Weight replication initialization strategy's effectiveness across domains is uncertain, particularly for pretrained models from significantly different data distributions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Early fusion mechanism and its superior performance over grouped convolution (+4.4 mAP@0.5 on MOT20Det). The basic architectural modifications and training procedure are well-specified.
- **Medium Confidence:** Optimal frame count varies significantly by dataset characteristics (7 frames for MOT20Det vs 3 frames for BOAT360). The weight replication initialization strategy's generalizability is supported but not extensively validated across domains.
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization to datasets with very different characteristics (e.g., surveillance with uniform camera vs. moving platform with fisheye lens). The method's behavior with non-adjacent frame sampling beyond what was tested remains uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **Frame count optimization for new domain:** Conduct a systematic sweep (3, 5, 7, 9 frames) on your target dataset to identify the optimal temporal window, monitoring for degradation beyond the peak.
2. **Initialization robustness test:** Compare the scaled weight replication initialization against random initialization and fine-tuning from scratch to quantify the initialization benefit for your specific pretrained model and target domain.
3. **Dynamic scene stress test:** Evaluate the method on sequences with rapid camera motion or object movement to determine if the temporal window needs adjustment or if alternative fusion strategies would be more appropriate for your use case.
