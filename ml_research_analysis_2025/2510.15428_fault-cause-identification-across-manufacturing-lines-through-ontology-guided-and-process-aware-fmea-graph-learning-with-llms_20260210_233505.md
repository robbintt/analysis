# Fault Cause Identification across Manufacturing Lines through Ontology-Guided and Process-Aware FMEA Graph Learning with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15428
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15428
- Reference count: 40
- The framework achieves F1@20 score of 0.523 for cross-manufacturing-line fault cause identification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of reusing Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) knowledge across heterogeneous manufacturing lines by proposing an ontology-guided framework that transforms FMEA worksheets into unified knowledge graphs. The approach leverages large language models to extract domain concepts and employs a process-aware Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to learn embeddings that respect both semantic relationships and sequential process constraints. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional RAG and RGCN baselines in a case study involving automotive pressure sensor assembly lines.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework consists of two main components: an ontology-guided conceptualization module and a process-aware graph learning module. The conceptualization module uses LLMs to extract manufacturing-domain concepts (actions, states, components, parameters) from FMEA worksheets, then structures these into a unified knowledge graph using an ontology that represents their relationships. The process-aware graph learning module applies RGCNs with a custom scoring function that incorporates both semantic relationships and process flow information to learn effective node embeddings for fault cause identification. This approach enables the transfer of FMEA knowledge across manufacturing lines with different equipment and terminology while maintaining process constraints.

## Key Results
- F1@20 score of 0.523 achieved on automotive pressure sensor assembly line case study
- Outperforms RAG baseline (0.267) and RGCN baseline (0.400)
- Ablation studies confirm contributions of both manufacturing-domain conceptualization and process-aware learning components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a unified representation of manufacturing processes that can bridge the gap between heterogeneous production lines. By using LLMs to extract domain-specific concepts and structuring them into a knowledge graph with an ontology, the system captures the essential relationships between different elements of the manufacturing process. The process-aware RGCN then learns embeddings that respect both the semantic meaning of these relationships and the sequential nature of manufacturing processes, enabling effective transfer of FMEA knowledge across different lines.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graph Construction: Needed to represent complex manufacturing process relationships in a structured format; quick check: verify node and edge types capture essential manufacturing concepts
- Relational Graph Convolutional Networks: Needed to learn embeddings that respect graph structure and relationships; quick check: ensure message passing captures both local and global graph features
- Process-Aware Scoring Functions: Needed to incorporate sequential manufacturing constraints into the learning; quick check: validate that process order is preserved in learned representations

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: LLM Concept Extraction -> Ontology Construction -> Knowledge Graph Formation -> Process-Aware RGCN -> Fault Cause Identification

Critical Path: The core processing pipeline flows from concept extraction through ontology-guided graph construction to process-aware graph learning, with each stage building upon the previous one to create meaningful representations for fault cause identification.

Design Tradeoffs: The approach trades computational complexity for improved accuracy and generalizability, using LLMs for concept extraction despite their computational cost, in exchange for more accurate and transferable knowledge representations.

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation may occur if concept extraction fails to capture domain-specific nuances, if ontology construction misses critical relationships, or if process-aware constraints are not properly encoded in the scoring function.

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate LLM concept extraction accuracy and its impact on downstream performance
2. Test ontology construction with varying levels of domain specificity
3. Assess process-aware scoring function performance with different weighting parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single case study from automotive pressure sensor assembly lines may not generalize to other domains
- Limited evaluation using only four test FMEA forms, potentially reducing statistical robustness
- LLM concept extraction performance not evaluated independently, creating uncertainty in the pipeline
- Manual tuning required for process-aware scoring function weights may not transfer across contexts

## Confidence
High: Process-aware learning component effectiveness within tested domain
Medium: Manufacturing-domain conceptualization contribution confirmed by ablation studies
Low: Overall framework generalizability due to limited testing scope

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework across multiple manufacturing domains beyond automotive pressure sensors to assess domain transferability
2. Conduct comprehensive evaluation of LLM concept extraction accuracy and its impact on downstream performance
3. Implement automated methods for determining process-aware scoring function weights instead of manual tuning
