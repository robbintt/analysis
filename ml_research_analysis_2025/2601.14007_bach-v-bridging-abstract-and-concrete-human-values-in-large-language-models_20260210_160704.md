# BACH-V: Bridging Abstract and Concrete Human-Values in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.14007
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14007
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Probing shows cross-level transfer of value traces across abstraction levels; steering reveals asymmetry where interventions shift concrete judgments but not abstract interpretations

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models genuinely understand abstract human values or merely manipulate them as statistical patterns. The authors introduce an abstraction-grounding framework testing three capacities: interpreting abstract concepts (A-A), grounding abstractions in concrete events (A-C), and applying abstract principles to regulate decisions (C-C). Using human values as a testbed, the study employs probing to detect value traces in internal activations and steering to modify representations and shift behavior across six open-source LLMs and ten value dimensions.

The findings reveal that while value-specific probes reliably detect the same values across abstract descriptions, concrete events, and decision reasoning, demonstrating cross-level transfer, steering interventions show an asymmetry: modifying value representations causally shifts concrete judgments and decisions but leaves abstract interpretations unchanged. This suggests LLMs maintain structured value representations that function as stable anchors rather than malleable activations, providing a mechanistic foundation for building value-driven autonomous AI systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs an abstraction-grounding framework to test LLMs' understanding of human values across three capacity dimensions: interpreting abstract concepts (A-A), grounding abstractions in concrete events (A-C), and applying abstract principles to regulate decisions (C-C). The methodology combines two complementary approaches: probing and steering. Probing uses linear classifiers trained on internal activations to detect value traces across different abstraction levels, testing for cross-level transfer. Steering involves causal interventions on value representations to assess their functional role in decision-making. The framework is applied across six open-source LLMs and ten human value dimensions, examining how value representations operate across abstract descriptions, concrete events, and decision reasoning contexts.

## Key Results
- Probing demonstrates reliable detection of value traces across abstract descriptions, concrete events, and decision reasoning, showing cross-level transfer
- Steering reveals asymmetry: interventions on value representations shift concrete judgments and decisions but leave abstract interpretations unchanged
- Value representations in LLMs function as stable anchors that bridge abstraction and action, rather than as purely malleable activations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that LLMs encode value representations in a structured manner that bridges abstract concepts and concrete decision-making. The cross-level transfer observed in probing indicates that value traces are not merely surface-level patterns but are embedded in internal representations that span abstraction levels. The asymmetry in steering effects suggests a hierarchical organization where abstract value representations serve as stable reference points that anchor more flexible concrete-level judgments. This architecture allows models to maintain consistent value principles while adapting their application to specific contexts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Abstraction-grounding framework**: A methodology for testing whether models can bridge abstract concepts and concrete applications; needed to systematically evaluate LLM understanding of human values beyond surface-level pattern matching
- **Probing methodology**: Uses linear classifiers on internal activations to detect latent representations; needed to verify whether value traces exist across different levels of abstraction
- **Steering interventions**: Causal modifications to internal representations to test functional roles; needed to determine whether value representations causally influence behavior or are merely correlational
- **Cross-level transfer**: The ability to detect the same representations across different abstraction levels; needed to demonstrate that models maintain coherent value representations rather than treating each context separately
- **Asymmetric steering effects**: The phenomenon where interventions affect concrete judgments but not abstract interpretations; needed to reveal the hierarchical organization of value representations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** A-A interpretation -> A-C grounding -> C-C application

**Critical path:** Probing (A-A detection) → Probing (A-C detection) → Probing (C-C detection) → Steering intervention (C-C level) → Observation of asymmetric effects

**Design tradeoffs:** The study uses linear probes for interpretability and computational efficiency versus more complex methods that might capture nonlinear relationships; focuses on open-source models for reproducibility versus potentially broader insights from proprietary models

**Failure signatures:** If cross-level transfer fails in probing, it would suggest models treat each abstraction level independently; if steering affects abstract interpretations, it would suggest abstract values are as malleable as concrete ones

**3 first experiments:**
1. Train probes at each abstraction level (A-A, A-C, C-C) and test detection accuracy across all levels
2. Apply steering interventions at C-C level and measure effects on both concrete judgments and abstract interpretations
3. Compare probing results across different value dimensions to identify systematic patterns in representation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Probing results demonstrate detection reliability but don't establish genuine understanding versus sophisticated pattern matching
- Steering asymmetry could reflect either genuine anchoring of abstract values or limitations in methodology's ability to access abstract representations
- Findings may not generalize beyond human values to other abstract domains like fairness, justice, or aesthetic judgments
- Limited sample of six open-source LLMs may not represent broader LLM landscape, including proprietary models

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Cross-level detection of value traces via probing is reliable and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: The asymmetry in steering effects reflects genuine structural properties of value representations
- **Medium confidence**: Value representations bridge abstraction and action in functionally meaningful ways

## Next Checks
1. Test steering interventions across multiple abstraction levels simultaneously to determine whether abstract representations can be modified when concrete-level representations are also targeted
2. Apply the abstraction-grounding framework to non-value abstract domains (e.g., moral principles, aesthetic judgments) to assess generalizability
3. Compare results across proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to evaluate whether findings hold beyond open-source models
