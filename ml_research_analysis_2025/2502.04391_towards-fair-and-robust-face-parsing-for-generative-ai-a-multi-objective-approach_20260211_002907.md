# Towards Fair and Robust Face Parsing for Generative AI: A Multi-Objective Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.04391
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04391
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-objective face parsing achieves mIoU ~74% with reduced bias and improved robustness, improving GAN realism (FID ~98.87) when integrated into Pix2PixHD.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of fairness and robustness limitations in face parsing models, which can propagate demographic biases and fragility into generative AI outputs. The authors propose a multi-objective learning framework that dynamically balances segmentation accuracy, fairness across demographic groups, and robustness to perturbations using a homotopy-based loss function. Their approach is evaluated by integrating the models into a Pix2PixHD GAN pipeline and conducting preliminary ControlNet diffusion experiments, demonstrating that fairness-aware parsing enhances both perceptual quality and generative realism.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a U-Net architecture with ResNet-34 encoder (ImageNet pre-trained) for 19-class face segmentation on CelebAMask-HQ. The key innovation is a homotopy-scheduled multi-objective loss function: α(t)·L_dice + β(t)·L_rob + γ(t)·L_fair, where the weights transition from accuracy-dominant to balanced across training epochs. The fairness loss minimizes variance of per-group mIoU, while robustness is trained via on-the-fly perturbations (noise, blur, occlusion). Models are evaluated both on segmentation metrics and downstream in Pix2PixHD GANs and ControlNet diffusion models, showing improved FID scores and perceptual quality while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.

## Key Results
- Multi-objective models achieve competitive segmentation performance (mIoU ~74%) while reducing demographic bias variance
- GAN integration yields lower FID scores (down to 98.87) and improved perceptual quality compared to single-objective baselines
- Models demonstrate improved resilience to noise and occlusions while maintaining fairness across demographic groups
- Preliminary ControlNet diffusion experiments show promise but require further training to realize full benefits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The homotopy-based loss scheduling allows the model to first learn accurate segmentation patterns before gradually incorporating fairness and robustness constraints. This prevents early optimization instability that would occur if all objectives were weighted equally from the start. By dynamically balancing the three objectives throughout training, the model can achieve Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy, fairness, and robustness rather than optimizing for one at the expense of others.

## Foundational Learning
- **Homotopy scheduling**: Gradual transition of loss weights during training to stabilize multi-objective optimization; needed because simultaneous optimization of competing objectives often leads to poor convergence.
- **Demographic fairness metrics**: Variance of per-group performance metrics to quantify bias; needed because standard aggregate metrics mask disparities across different demographic groups.
- **On-the-fly data augmentation**: Generating perturbed versions of inputs during training for robustness; needed to expose the model to distribution shifts without requiring additional labeled data.
- **Multi-objective Pareto optimization**: Finding solutions that balance multiple competing objectives rather than optimizing one at the expense of others; needed because real-world applications require trade-offs between accuracy, fairness, and robustness.
- **Downstream evaluation in generative models**: Using segmentation maps as conditioning for GANs/diffusion models; needed to validate that improvements in parsing quality translate to better generative outputs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: CelebAMask-HQ images → U-Net (ResNet-34 encoder, 19-class decoder) → Segmentation maps → Pix2PixHD GAN → Generated images

**Critical path**: U-Net training → Segmentation map generation → GAN training → FID/LPIPS evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: The homotopy scheduler trades off immediate accuracy gains for long-term fairness/robustness benefits, accepting lower early performance for better final Pareto-optimal solutions. This requires careful weight scheduling to prevent catastrophic forgetting of accurate segmentation patterns.

**Failure signatures**: 
- If fairness variance doesn't decrease, check demographic group representation in training batches and ensure the fairness loss is properly computing per-group statistics
- If robustness doesn't improve, verify perturbation types/severities during training match evaluation conditions
- If GAN FID doesn't improve, validate that segmentation maps capture sufficient detail and that the Pix2PixHD conditioning is properly implemented

**3 first experiments**:
1. Train single-objective baseline (accuracy only) to establish performance floor
2. Train multi-objective model with Linear homotopy schedule, logging all three loss components per epoch
3. Evaluate fairness by computing per-group mIoU variance on test set across demographic attributes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How would incorporating bi-directional optimization, where segmentation feedback influences GAN training, affect parsing fidelity and generative realism? The authors state that their framework currently treats GANs as "passive consumers" and suggest that "incorporating bi-directional optimization" is a necessary future direction.

**Open Question 2**: To what extent does fair and robust segmentation improve diffusion-based synthesis when trained to convergence? The authors describe their ControlNet experiments as "preliminary" and "limited to one epoch," explicitly stating "further research is needed."

**Open Question 3**: Is there a theoretically optimal or learnable homotopy schedule for balancing accuracy, fairness, and robustness? The paper manually compares Linear, Sigmoid, and Piecewise scheduling strategies but provides no theoretical justification for selecting one over the others.

**Open Question 4**: Does the multi-objective framework maintain its advantages on inherently demographically balanced datasets? The authors acknowledge that the CelebAMask-HQ dataset is imbalanced, raising the question of whether the method corrects for data bias or introduces unnecessary trade-offs when data is already fair.

## Limitations
- The exact homotopy scheduling parameters (α, β, γ transition values and timing) are not specified, making exact reproduction difficult
- Robustness loss computation method during training lacks detail on perturbation types and severities
- Downstream diffusion experiments are preliminary and limited to one epoch of training
- The framework's benefits on demographically balanced datasets remain unvalidated

## Confidence
- Main conclusions: High
- Quantitative claims (mIoU ~74%, FID ~98.87): Medium
- Reproducibility of exact results: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test multiple homotopy schedules (Linear, Sigmoid, Piecewise) with varied parameter ranges to observe impact on fairness and accuracy trade-offs
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating each loss component (accuracy, fairness, robustness) to verify their individual contributions to the multi-objective model performance
3. Validate fairness metrics by auditing segmentation outputs across different demographic groups in the test set to ensure reduced bias is consistent and measurable
