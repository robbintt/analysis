## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fundamental limitations in dataset pruning by identifying that conventional fitting-based methods produce dense, undiscriminating sample scores, leading to unstable selection. UNSEEN introduces a plug-and-play framework that evaluates sample importance from a generalization perspective by using cross-validation—models score only samples they haven't seen during training. The method scales this through multi-step incremental selection, dynamically refining the coreset. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate UNSEEN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 30% lossless pruning on ImageNet-1K.

## Method Summary
UNSEEN is a dataset pruning framework that scores sample importance from a generalization perspective. It partitions the dataset into K folds, trains K models (each on one fold), and uses these models to score the hold-out samples they haven't seen. This creates dispersed score distributions compared to fitting-based methods. UNSEEN also implements incremental selection where an initial coreset is refined by retraining on selected samples and re-scoring remaining data, adding high-scoring samples iteratively. The framework is applied on top of existing scoring metrics like entropy, making it a plug-and-play enhancement.

## Key Results
- Achieves 30% lossless pruning on ImageNet-1K (73.55% accuracy vs 73.61% full data)
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K
- Demonstrates strong cross-architecture generalization, with coresets selected by small models performing well on larger architectures
- Implicitly prioritizes hard-class samples, reducing inter-class variance and improving overall accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Scoring samples using models that were *not* exposed to them during training prevents score density and improves selection stability. Standard fitting-based methods score training data using the model trained on it, producing dense distributions near zero loss that make samples hard to distinguish. UNSEEN uses K-fold cross-validation where models trained on subset k score hold-out samples, spreading scores across a wider range through the generalization gap.

### Mechanism 2
Sample importance is dynamic relative to the current dataset size; an incremental selection process optimizes the coreset better than single-shot selection. After initial selection, a model is trained only on the selected coreset and used to re-score remaining pruned samples. High-scoring samples from the pruned set are added to the coreset, as samples deemed redundant for full-dataset models may become critical for smaller subsets.

### Mechanism 3
The generalization-based scoring implicitly prioritizes "hard" classes, reducing inter-class variance and improving overall accuracy. By forcing models to score unseen data, the method amplifies signals from classes that are inherently difficult to generalize to. UNSEEN assigns higher scores to samples from difficult classes because models fail to generalize to them without specific training exposure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Coreset Selection (Dataset Pruning)**
  - Why needed: This is the fundamental task—selecting subset S⊂D such that |S|≪|D| but performance≈Full Data
  - Quick check: Can you explain why simply selecting random samples is often a strong baseline compared to complex metrics?

- **Concept: Cross-Validation**
  - Why needed: The core innovation applies K-fold CV to the scoring process, not just evaluation
  - Quick check: In standard K-fold CV, how do we aggregate performance across folds? How does UNSEEN aggregate scores?

- **Concept: Loss-based Scoring (Entropy/EL2N)**
  - Why needed: UNSEEN is a plug-and-play framework applied on top of metrics like Entropy
  - Quick check: Why might a sample have high loss at the end of training (fitting)? Why does this make it hard to distinguish between a "hard" sample and a "noisy" sample?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Partitioner -> Scoring Engine -> Aggregator -> Incremental Selector
- **Critical path:** The Initial Scoring Phase requires training K separate models before main training can begin
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - K (Folds): Higher K means more scoring granularity but more management overhead
  - J (Stages): Default J=2; increasing J adds retraining cost but performance plateaus quickly
  - Prune Rate vs Accuracy: Shows high robustness at 30%-50% pruning, degrades at extreme rates (>70%)
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Score Collapse: Dense scores near zero indicates improper cross-validation
  - High Variance: Low PCC between sample rankings indicates scoring models underfitting
  - Cost Overrun: Large refill batch sizes in incremental selection cause excessive retraining
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Density Check: Replicate Figure 1a comparing standard Entropy vs UNSEEN (K=4) score distributions
  2. Ablation on K: Run UNSEEN with K∈{2,4,10,20} at fixed 30% pruning rate
  3. Cross-Architecture Transfer: Prune with ResNet-18, train final model on ResNet-50 using same coreset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the optimal number of partitions K be determined adaptively or theoretically based on dataset complexity and model capacity, rather than through empirical tuning? The paper fixes K=4 based on experimental results but offers no formal rule for selecting K for new datasets.

### Open Question 2
Does UNSEEN's prioritization of "hard-class" samples inadvertently increase the selection of mislabeled or noisy data? Since UNSEEN selects high-loss samples, it may struggle to distinguish between genuinely difficult examples and erroneous data.

### Open Question 3
Why does multi-stage Incremental Selection fail to provide significant gains when J>2? The authors note performance remains nearly unchanged despite growing computational cost, but don't explain why additional refinement stages don't yield further coreset optimization.

### Open Question 4
Does UNSEEN's cross-validated scoring generalize to diverse modern architectures like Vision Transformers? The cross-architecture experiments only transfer between ResNet variants, leaving behavior on architectures with different inductive biases unverified.

## Limitations

- Computational overhead from scoring phase requiring training K=4 separate models before main training
- Effectiveness depends critically on proper K-fold partitioning and representative class distribution
- Cross-validation mechanism's optimal K value appears dataset-dependent and requires empirical tuning
- Claims about class difficulty prioritization need more explicit validation of causal relationships

## Confidence

- Generalization perspective claims: Medium-High confidence - theoretical argument is sound with convincing density reduction
- Incremental selection claims: Medium confidence - demonstrates improved performance but optimal J=2 appears arbitrary
- Class difficulty prioritization claims: Low-Medium confidence - shows behavior correlation but needs causal validation

## Next Checks

1. **Runtime Analysis**: Measure and compare wall-clock time for UNSEEN vs fitting-based methods across different dataset sizes, including scoring phase overhead

2. **K-fold Sensitivity**: Systematically vary K∈{2,4,8,16} and measure trade-off between scoring quality (score dispersion) and computational cost

3. **Hard Class Validation**: Conduct experiment with synthetic data with known difficulty gradients to verify UNSEEN's prioritization behavior is causal rather than correlational
