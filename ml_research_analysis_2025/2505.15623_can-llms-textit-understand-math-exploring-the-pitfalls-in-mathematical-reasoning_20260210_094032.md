- MAPLE framework evaluates LLM mathematical reasoning quality beyond final answer accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MAPLE (Mathematical Pitfalls and Logical Evaluation), a novel evaluation framework for assessing LLM mathematical reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. The method uses a multi-stage process where LLMs first generate solutions and self-reflect on their errors, then a Judge LLM identifies specific error types in each reasoning step, and finally a MAPLE score is computed by integrating error rates, redundancy, and validity. Results on the MATH dataset show that MAPLE score increases with difficulty level, with Llama exhibiting the highest MAPLE scores (worst reasoning quality). Notably, accuracy and MAPLE score are inversely correlated across difficulty levels, confirming MAPLE's ability to detect reasoning weaknesses not captured by accuracy alone.

## Method Summary
MAPLE is a multi-stage evaluation framework that assesses mathematical reasoning quality through a comprehensive process. First, LLMs generate solutions and perform self-reflection on their errors using correct answers as reference. Second, a Judge LLM identifies specific error types in each reasoning step of the generated solutions. Finally, MAPLE computes an overall score by integrating error rates, redundancy in reasoning, and solution validity. The framework captures reasoning quality through weighted error label frequencies and their incorrectness penalties, providing a nuanced assessment of mathematical reasoning that goes beyond final answer correctness.

## Key Results
- MAPLE score increases with difficulty level across all tested LLMs
- Llama exhibits the highest MAPLE scores, indicating worst reasoning quality
- Accuracy and MAPLE score show inverse correlation across difficulty levels
- MAPLE successfully identifies reasoning weaknesses not captured by accuracy metrics alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MAPLE works by decomposing mathematical reasoning evaluation into multiple dimensions that capture different aspects of solution quality. The framework identifies specific error types at each reasoning step, allowing for granular analysis of where and how LLMs fail in mathematical problem-solving. By incorporating self-reflection and multi-stage error detection, MAPLE can identify systematic reasoning flaws that might be masked by correct final answers. The weighted scoring system ensures that different types of errors are appropriately penalized based on their severity and impact on the overall solution.

## Foundational Learning
- Mathematical reasoning evaluation - needed to understand limitations of accuracy-only metrics; quick check: compare reasoning quality across multiple problem types
- Error classification in mathematical solutions - needed to identify specific types of reasoning failures; quick check: validate error categories against human expert assessments
- LLM self-reflection capabilities - needed to understand model awareness of its own reasoning limitations; quick check: test consistency of self-identified errors

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Problem Input -> LLM Solution Generation -> Self-Reflection -> Judge LLM Error Classification -> MAPLE Score Calculation

**Critical Path:** The core evaluation pipeline where solution generation quality directly impacts subsequent error detection and final MAPLE scoring

**Design Tradeoffs:** Judge LLM accuracy vs. computational efficiency; granularity of error classification vs. practical implementation complexity

**Failure Signatures:** Circular reasoning patterns, systematic misclassification of error types, over-reliance on self-reflection without external validation

**First Experiments:**
1. Baseline accuracy evaluation across all LLMs on MATH dataset
2. Error type distribution analysis for each LLM
3. Correlation analysis between MAPLE scores and human expert evaluations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Judge LLM introduces potential bias and circular reasoning in evaluation
- Self-reflection stage may not reliably capture all reasoning errors
- Weighted scoring system lacks clear theoretical grounding for component balancing

## Confidence
- Framework methodology: Medium
- Empirical validation: Medium
- Judge LLM reliability: Medium
- Generalizability across mathematical domains: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the self-reflection stage to assess its actual contribution to error detection accuracy
2. Compare MAPLE scores with human expert evaluations on a subset of problems to validate the Judge LLM's error classification accuracy
3. Test MAPLE across multiple mathematical domains (geometry, algebra, calculus) to assess generalizability beyond the MATH dataset used in the current study
