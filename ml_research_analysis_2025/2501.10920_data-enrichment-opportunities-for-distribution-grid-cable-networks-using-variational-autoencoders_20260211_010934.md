# Data Enrichment Opportunities for Distribution Grid Cable Networks using Variational Autoencoders

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.10920
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10920
- Authors: Konrad Sundsgaard; Kutay Bölat; Guangya Yang
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: VAEs can effectively impute missing cable installation ages in MV cable networks, outperforming simpler methods and competing with state-of-the-art imputation techniques.

## Executive Summary
This study explores the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to address missing data challenges in reliability modeling of medium-voltage (MV) cable networks, particularly for imputing missing cable installation ages. By leveraging a proof-of-concept implementation for Danish cable data, the research demonstrates that VAEs can effectively replicate original data distributions and outperform simpler imputation methods like random and informed random imputation. Benchmarking against more sophisticated state-of-the-art techniques (e.g., KNN, MissForest) shows competitive performance, highlighting the potential of VAEs for targeted data enrichment. However, the study identifies areas for improvement, such as enhanced feature importance analysis, handling data biases, and integrating network-specific characteristics. Future work will focus on expanding applications to low-voltage networks, incorporating advanced sampling methods, and addressing privacy concerns for sensitive data. Overall, the findings underscore the promise of VAEs in advancing data-driven maintenance strategies for distribution grid components.

## Method Summary
The study implements a VAE architecture with 8 input features (1 continuous: length, 1 target: age, 6 categorical) using PyTorch. The model employs embedding layers for categorical features and a weighted loss function combining Gaussian negative log-likelihood for continuous variables, cross-entropy for categorical variables, and KL divergence. Training uses Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.0001, batch size 128, hidden dimension 145, and latent dimension 13. The method includes pseudo-Gibbs sampling for iterative imputation refinement and amputation testing to evaluate performance against known values. The approach is benchmarked against simpler methods (Random, Mean, Median, Mode) and sophisticated techniques (KNN, Iterative Imputer, MissForest).

## Key Results
- VAEs effectively replicate original data distributions and outperform simpler imputation methods like random and informed random imputation
- Benchmarking against state-of-the-art techniques (KNN, MissForest) shows competitive performance with VAEs
- KS statistic analysis reveals age distribution less accurately replicated (0.13 gap) compared to length (0.06 gap), indicating age has more complex dependencies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Pseudo-Gibbs Sampling for Missing Value Imputation
VAEs can impute missing installation ages by iteratively refining initial guesses through the learned joint probability distribution. The encoder maps available features to a latent representation; the decoder reconstructs all features including missing ones. Pseudo-Gibbs sampling cycles through this process, using each reconstruction as input for the next iteration until convergence. This works when the joint distribution learned from complete cases generalizes to incomplete records with similar observed feature patterns.

### Mechanism 2: Conditional VAE for Controlled Generation
Concatenating categorical conditions (e.g., DSO identity, insulation type) to encoder inputs and decoder latent vectors enables DSO-specific sampling. Embedding layers transform categorical conditions into continuous vectors. These concatenate with data before encoding and with latent vectors before decoding, creating conditional probability distributions p(x|c) rather than marginal p(x). This works when asset characteristics vary systematically by condition variable and this structure is learnable from available data.

### Mechanism 3: Semi-Supervised Learning to Maximize Training Data
Treating the heavily-missing feature (installation age) as a target variable in semi-supervised VAE allows all records to contribute to distribution learning. The model learns two things simultaneously: (1) unsupervised distribution of observed features from ALL records, (2) supervised mapping from latent space to target variable using only complete records. This works when the unsupervised feature distribution learning from incomplete records transfers to better target predictions than using only complete records.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: VAE Loss Function Composition (L_VAE = α·L_cont + (1-α)·L_cat + β·L_KL)**
  - Why needed here: Asset data has mixed continuous (length, age) and categorical (DSO, insulation type) features. The α hyperparameter (0.071 in paper) balances these; β controls latent space regularization.
  - Quick check question: If your dataset had 90% categorical features, would you increase or decrease α from 0.07?

- **Concept: Missingness Mechanisms (MCAR/MAR/MNAR)**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly identifies MNAR as a risk—older cables more likely to have missing installation dates. Imputation validity depends on whether training distribution matches target distribution.
  - Quick check question: How would you test whether missingness of installation age depends on the age itself?

- **Concept: Amputation Testing Methodology**
  - Why needed here: Ground truth for imputation is unknown. Amputation (systematic removal from validation set) enables performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²) against known values.
  - Quick check question: What bias might be introduced if amputation is random (MCAR) but real missingness is MNAR?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Input layer (8 features) -> Embedding layers (167 parameters) -> Encoder (63,815 parameters) -> Latent space (13 dimensions) -> Decoder (74,651 parameters) -> Output reconstruction

- **Critical path:**
  1. Standardize continuous features (sklearn scalers)
  2. Encode categorical features via embedding layers
  3. Concatenate and encode to latent distribution (μ, σ)
  4. Sample latent vector z via reparameterization trick
  5. Decode to reconstruct all features
  6. Compute weighted loss; backpropagate

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **latent_dim=13 vs. larger:** Smaller latent forces compression but may lose feature correlations relevant to age prediction
  - **α=0.07 (heavy categorical weight):** Appropriate given 6 categorical vs. 2 continuous features, but may underweight age-length relationship
  - **Early stopping before convergence:** Paper terminated training early for proof-of-concept; full convergence may improve imputation
  - **VAE vs. CVAE:** Paper implements VAE but discusses CVAE for DSO-specific generation—trade-off between model complexity and conditional control

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **VAE matches KNN/MissForest but doesn't outperform:** Section V notes "did not significantly outperform" SOTA methods—signals that current features lack strong predictors for installation age
  - **KS statistic gap (0.13 for age vs. 0.06 for length):** Age distribution less accurately replicated, suggesting age has more complex dependencies or higher noise
  - **High MAE on amputation test (Figure 8):** VAE achieves ~10 years MAE on age imputation—acceptable for reliability modeling but not precise dating

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Feature importance ablation:** Train VAE with feature subsets (remove conductor size, then DSO, etc.) to identify which features drive age prediction. Paper explicitly flags this as priority future work.
  2. **MNAR bias quantification:** Compare amputation performance under MCAR vs. MAR vs. MNAR removal patterns. Stratify by cable age buckets to simulate realistic missingness.
  3. **Network characteristics integration:** Transform asset data into graph structure (connected cables share installation periods); benchmark VAE against Variational Graph Autoencoder on same imputation task.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent does VAE-based data enrichment improve the performance of downstream reliability models, such as failure risk ranking, compared to standard imputation methods?
- Basis in paper: The authors state a need to "investigate the impact of the presented data enrichment techniques on practical applications... by formulating proper downstream tasks."
- Why unresolved: The current study validates the VAE only on imputation accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE) against ground truth, rather than evaluating the utility of the enriched data in a predictive maintenance or failure prediction context.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing that reliability models trained on VAE-enriched datasets predict cable failures with higher precision or recall than models trained on datasets imputed via KNN or MissForest.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can VAE training be adapted to account for "Missing Not at Random" (MNAR) biases, particularly the likelihood that installation age data is missing specifically for older cables?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that "missingness is likely biased toward older cables, suggesting MNAR" and explicitly identifies "addressing such biases during training" as an open research question.
- Why unresolved: Standard VAEs generally assume data is missing at random (MAR) or completely at random (MCAR); if the missingness is correlated with the unobserved values (MNAR), the model may learn a biased distribution that underestimates older cable populations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified VAE architecture or loss function that successfully models the MNAR mechanism, validated by accurate imputation of artificially amputated data representing older cable demographics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can integrating network topological features via Graph Auto-Encoders improve imputation accuracy by exploiting dependencies between connected grid components?
- Basis in paper: The authors suggest future work could involve "transforming the training data into graph structures and applying network-based methods, such as Variational Graph Auto-Encoders."
- Why unresolved: The current Proof-of-Concept treats cable attributes as independent tabular data, ignoring the physical constraints and correlations of the electrical network (e.g., connected cables often share similar installation vintages or environmental conditions).
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder that utilizes adjacency information, demonstrating lower imputation errors compared to the standard VAE approach presented in the paper.

## Limitations
- Proof-of-concept relies on Danish cable data that cannot be shared, limiting reproducibility and leaving key architectural details unspecified
- Performance metrics show VAE achieves competitive but not superior results to established methods (KNN, MissForest), suggesting feature set may lack strong age predictors
- MNAR missingness mechanism—older cables more likely to have missing installation dates—creates potential distribution shift between training and target populations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: VAEs can learn joint distributions of asset features and perform imputation; benchmarking methodology via amputation testing is sound
- **Medium confidence**: Competitive performance against SOTA methods; pseudo-Gibbs sampling enables iterative refinement
- **Low confidence**: Long-term reliability of synthetic data generation for grid planning; scalability to networks with more severe missingness patterns

## Next Checks
1. **Feature importance ablation study**: Systematically remove conductor size, DSO, and other categorical features to quantify their contribution to age prediction accuracy
2. **MNAR bias quantification**: Compare imputation performance under MCAR vs MAR vs MNAR removal patterns, stratifying by cable age buckets to simulate realistic missingness
3. **Network structure integration**: Transform asset data into graph representation (connected cables share installation periods) and benchmark VAE against Variational Graph Autoencoder on same imputation task
