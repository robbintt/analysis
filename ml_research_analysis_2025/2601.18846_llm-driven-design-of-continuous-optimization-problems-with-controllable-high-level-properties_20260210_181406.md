# LLM Driven Design of Continuous Optimization Problems with Controllable High-level Properties

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18846
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18846
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Automatic generation of continuous optimization problems with specific high-level landscape properties using large language models and ELA-based fitness sharing.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for automatically generating continuous optimization problems with specific high-level landscape properties using large language models. The authors extend the LLaMEA framework with an ELA-based fitness-sharing mechanism to increase population diversity. Generated problems are verified using basin-of-attraction analysis and statistical testing. The method successfully creates problems with desired properties, as confirmed by both the prediction models and verification techniques. The generated problems expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster, providing a diverse, interpretable, and reproducible benchmark library for landscape analysis and algorithm selection tasks.

## Method Summary
The method extends LLaMEA by integrating an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that steers the LLM away from redundant landscapes. The process involves training XGBoost models to predict five landscape properties (multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity, and global-local optima contrast) from ELA features extracted from BBOB functions. The evolutionary loop uses these predictors as a proxy fitness function, with fitness sharing applied in the ELA feature space to encourage diversity. Generated functions are verified using basin-of-attraction analysis to confirm they truly possess the target properties. The approach successfully generates problems that expand the BBOB instance space while maintaining interpretability and reproducibility.

## Key Results
- Successfully generated problems with controllable high-level properties (multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, etc.)
- ELA-space fitness sharing effectively increased population diversity, shifting distributions toward larger pairwise distances
- Generated problems expanded the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster
- Verification through basin-of-attraction analysis confirmed target properties in generated instances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: ELA-Driven Feedback Loops
Large Language Models can iteratively refine mathematical functions to match abstract landscape properties when provided with quantitative feature feedback. The LLM generates Python code for an objective function, which is executed to sample the landscape and extract ELA features. Pre-trained XGBoost models map these features to probabilities of high-level properties, serving as the fitness score fed back to the LLM via prompt to guide mutation. The core assumption is that the LLM can interpret "low multimodality score" and syntactically alter a function's mathematical definition to introduce local optima or basins.

### Mechanism 2: Feature-Space Niching for Diversity
Enforcing diversity in the feature space (ELA vectors), rather than just the syntax space, prevents the generator from clustering around redundant landscapes and encourages coverage of the BBOB instance space. The framework calculates Manhattan distance between z-standardized ELA vectors of candidate functions and applies a fitness sharing penalty to individuals that are too close in this ELA-space. This explicitly encourages the population to explore distinct structural regions.

### Mechanism 3: Asymmetric Verification Protocol
Rapid generation is achievable only by decoupling the optimization objective (cheap proxy) from the verification step (expensive analysis). The evolutionary loop uses fast XGBoost predictors trained on BBOB data to approximate fitness, while only final candidates undergo rigorous, computationally expensive Basin-of-Attraction analysis to confirm they truly possess target properties. This assumes the BBOB function set provides a sufficiently representative basis for training predictors that can generalize to novel, LLM-generated functions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA):** The lingua franca of the system for interpreting fitness scores, diversity metrics, and verification results. Quick check: Can you explain what high "basin-size homogeneity" implies for an optimization algorithm's trajectory?

- **Evolutionary Strategies (μ, λ):** The paper utilizes a specific evolutionary strategy (μ=8, λ=16, comma strategy). Understanding selection pressure and niching is required to tune the generator. Quick check: What is the effect of a "comma strategy" (no elitism) on exploration vs. exploitation in this context?

- **Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB):** The entire definition of "high-level properties" and training data for predictors are derived from BBOB. The goal is to "expand" this space. Quick check: Why might training a predictor solely on BBOB instances limit the discovery of fundamentally new landscape types?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** LLM Engine (gpt5-nano) -> Executor -> Feature Extractor (pflacco) -> Predictor Suite (XGBoost) -> Diversity Manager -> Verifier

- **Critical path:** The loop is Sample → Extract → Predict → Share. Latency in ELA extraction or Predictor steps is multiplied by population size and generation count. LLM inference is a separate bottleneck.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Using XGBoost predictors is fast but results in false positives (approx. 50% retention rate). Direct Basin-of-Attraction fitness would be accurate but computationally intractable for the evolutionary loop. The paper selected gpt5-nano for balance between understanding capability and speed.

- **Failure signatures:** Syntactic fragility (invalid code or crashes), trivial landscapes (constant or linear functions gaming predictors), low verification yield due to predictor inaccuracy or distribution shift.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate XGBoost property predictors on held-out BBOB functions to establish baseline accuracy
  2. Run LLaMEA loop with and without ELA-space fitness sharing on single property to confirm diversity increase
  3. Generate function with conflicting properties and verify with Basin-of-Attraction analysis to inspect yield rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Do the generated benchmark instances improve automated algorithm selection performance or help predictive models generalize to unseen problem sets? The paper generates and verifies problems but does not evaluate their utility for downstream tasks like training algorithm selectors.

- How sensitive are the generated problem quality and diversity to the choice and parametrisation of the underlying LLM? Only five LLMs were briefly compared in pre-experiments, with only gpt5-nano used for the main study without extensive hyperparameter analysis.

- Do the generated problems reliably exhibit intended properties in dimensions beyond 2D? Verification relied on computationally expensive basin-of-attraction analysis only feasible in 2D, leaving higher-dimensional property claims supported only by ELA-based predictors.

- How does LLaMEA-driven problem generation compare in diversity, novelty, and benchmark utility to existing generators (affine combinations, GP-based methods, tree generators)? The paper visualizes expansion of BBOB space but does not quantitatively compare against alternative generation approaches.

## Limitations

- The method's success depends on ELA features from BBOB being representative enough to train accurate predictors for novel LLM-generated functions, which may fail if the LLM explores regions far outside the BBOB distribution.

- The fitness sharing mechanism's effectiveness depends on ELA features capturing the "right" structural differences; if they miss key dimensions of landscape difficulty, diversity in irrelevant aspects may be promoted instead.

- The exact prompt templates and adaptive niche radius update rules are not specified, and the gpt5-nano model referenced may be unreleased, making direct reproduction challenging.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The ELA-driven feedback loop mechanism works for guiding LLM code generation when accurate predictors are available. The verification protocol using basin-of-attraction analysis correctly confirms landscape properties.
- **Medium Confidence:** The fitness sharing mechanism effectively increases population diversity in the ELA feature space. The generated problems meaningfully expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster.
- **Low Confidence:** The predictor models will maintain high accuracy when applied to functions far outside the BBOB training distribution. The gpt5-nano model will perform equivalently to other similarly-sized models.

## Next Checks

1. Validate the XGBoost property predictors on a held-out set of BBOB functions to establish a baseline accuracy before running the LLM.

2. Run the LLaMEA loop with and without the ELA-space fitness sharing mechanism on a single property (e.g., Multimodality) to empirically confirm the increase in nearest-neighbor distances in the ELA feature space.

3. Attempt to generate a function with conflicting properties (e.g., Separable + Multimodal) and pass the output to the Basin-of-Attraction verifier. Measure the "yield" rate to assess the gap between proxy fitness and true landscape properties.
