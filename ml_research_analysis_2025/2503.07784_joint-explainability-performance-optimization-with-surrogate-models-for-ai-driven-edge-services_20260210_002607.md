# Joint Explainability-Performance Optimization With Surrogate Models for AI-Driven Edge Services

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.07784
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07784
- **Reference count**: 16
- **Primary result**: Over 99% improvement in Global Fidelity with less than 3% absolute reduction in predictive accuracy through joint optimization of accuracy and explainability

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of balancing predictive accuracy and explainability in AI-driven edge services. The authors propose a novel joint training framework based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) that simultaneously minimizes prediction error and the discrepancy between complex models and their surrogate counterparts. Their bi-level training scheme optimizes both models together rather than independently, achieving significant improvements in explainability while maintaining high predictive performance. The approach is validated across both tabular and image datasets, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in real-world edge computing scenarios.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces a joint training framework that optimizes both complex models and surrogate models simultaneously using gradient-based multi-objective optimization. Unlike traditional approaches that train models independently, this bi-level scheme ensures that explainability and performance objectives are pursued in tandem. The algorithm finds local Pareto optimal solutions by minimizing a combined loss function that accounts for both prediction error and fidelity between the complex and surrogate models. This integrated approach allows for fine-grained control over the accuracy-explainability trade-off, enabling deployment of AI models in edge services where both performance and interpretability are crucial.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 99% improvement in Global Fidelity compared to single-task learning baselines
- Maintains less than 3% absolute reduction in predictive accuracy
- Demonstrates up to 98.5% improvements in local explainability settings across tabular and image datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by jointly optimizing the complex model and its surrogate through a bi-level training framework. The key insight is that by optimizing both models simultaneously rather than independently, the surrogate model learns to accurately represent the complex model's decision boundaries while the complex model maintains its predictive power. The multi-objective optimization framework balances two competing objectives: minimizing prediction error and minimizing the discrepancy between the complex and surrogate models. This joint optimization creates a feedback loop where improvements in one model directly benefit the other, leading to superior overall performance in both accuracy and explainability metrics.

## Foundational Learning
**Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)**: Why needed - To handle the competing objectives of accuracy and explainability simultaneously; Quick check - Verify Pareto front solutions provide meaningful trade-offs
**Surrogate Models**: Why needed - To provide interpretable approximations of complex models; Quick check - Confirm surrogate accuracy matches target model behavior
**Bi-level Optimization**: Why needed - To enable joint training of both models in a coordinated manner; Quick check - Ensure convergence stability across optimization levels
**Gradient-based Optimization**: Why needed - For efficient parameter updates in high-dimensional model spaces; Quick check - Monitor gradient magnitudes and update patterns
**Global vs Local Fidelity**: Why needed - To measure explainability at different scales of model behavior; Quick check - Compare fidelity metrics across dataset subsets

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Complex Model -> Surrogate Model -> Joint Loss Function -> Gradient Updates -> Both Models

**Critical Path**: Data Input -> Complex Model Prediction -> Surrogate Model Prediction -> Joint Loss Calculation -> Gradient Computation -> Parameter Updates -> Optimized Models

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances model complexity (affecting accuracy) against surrogate simplicity (affecting explainability). Higher-complexity surrogates provide better fidelity but sacrifice interpretability, while simpler surrogates are more explainable but may poorly represent complex models.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor convergence occurs when the surrogate cannot adequately capture the complex model's behavior, leading to high fidelity loss. Overfitting manifests as surrogate models that memorize training data rather than learning general decision patterns. Suboptimal Pareto solutions emerge when the joint optimization cannot find good trade-offs between accuracy and explainability.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Compare single-task learning (independent training) against joint optimization on a simple benchmark dataset
2. Vary the complexity of surrogate models to identify optimal balance points
3. Test sensitivity to different weighting schemes in the joint loss function

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Does not extensively evaluate resource constraints typical in edge environments such as latency and power consumption
- Limited validation across diverse edge service scenarios beyond tabular and image datasets

## Confidence
**Method Validity**: Medium-High - The bi-level training framework with gradient-based optimization demonstrates theoretical soundness
**Real-world Applicability**: Medium - Strong performance metrics but limited edge-specific deployment validation
**Generalizability**: Medium - Good performance across different data types but limited edge service application diversity

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive resource utilization benchmarking on actual edge devices to verify acceptable latency and power consumption while maintaining reported accuracy-explainability trade-offs
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of surrogate model and joint optimization framework components to overall performance improvements
3. Test the framework across a broader range of edge service applications, particularly focusing on time-series and streaming data common in edge deployments
