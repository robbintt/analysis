# Adapting Neural Audio Codecs to EEG

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.23142
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23142
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** Pretrained neural audio codec adapts to EEG compression via fine-tuning, preserving clinically relevant features and improving downstream classification performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that neural audio codecs pretrained on 44.1 kHz audio can be adapted to compress EEG signals sampled at 512 Hz through direct mapping into the codec's stride-based framing. The approach outperforms training from scratch and maintains clinically relevant information for downstream classification tasks. The authors extend the single-channel model to multi-channel EEG using attention-based cross-channel aggregation with channel-specific decoding, finding that multi-channel grouping improves epilepsy detection but may reduce performance for other clinical tasks.

## Method Summary
The method adapts a pretrained Differential Audio Codec (DAC) to EEG by feeding raw EEG segments directly into the audio-trained encoder-decoder architecture. EEG signals are preprocessed (resampled to 512 Hz, high-pass filtered at 0.1 Hz, clipped ±200 µV, normalized to [-1, 1], segmented into 30s windows) and fine-tuned with a composite loss function including spectrogram, waveform, and adversarial components. For multi-channel extension (DAC-MC), each channel is encoded independently, then cross-channel self-attention captures spatial dependencies before channel-conditioned decoding with style vectors.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning audio-pretrained DAC on EEG achieves 1.05 spectrogram reconstruction loss vs. 1.46 for training from scratch and 2.5 for pretrained without fine-tuning
- Epilepsy detection accuracy reaches 85% with grouped DAC-MC vs. 80% for single-channel
- Abnormal EEG detection achieves 83% with single-channel DAC vs. 78% with grouped DAC-MC
- Reducing codebooks from 9 to 3 doubles reconstruction loss, confirming coarse-to-fine information hierarchy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Audio-pretrained codecs transfer to EEG because the encoder-decoder operates on sample structure, not semantic meaning of temporal units.
- **Mechanism:** DAC uses stride-based framing where 512 input samples produce one token. At 44.1 kHz audio, this is ~13 ms; at 512 Hz EEG, this is 1 second. The model learns to encode/decode sample-level patterns independent of their real-world temporal semantics. Fine-tuning adjusts these patterns to EEG statistics while retaining learned compression priors.
- **Core assumption:** The learned representation captures general signal structure (amplitude variation, local patterns) that transfers across modalities with different temporal semantics.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "raw EEG can be mapped into the codec's stride-based framing, enabling direct reuse of the audio-pretrained encoder-decoder"
  - [Section 2.1] "we directly feed raw EEG segments... into the pretrained model, even though the temporal meaning of each segment differs"
  - [corpus] Limited corpus relevance; neighbor papers focus on audio codec optimization, not cross-modal transfer.
- **Break condition:** If EEG signals have fundamentally different spectral/statistical structure than audio (e.g., discontinuous spike patterns that don't match learned codebook entries), reconstruction quality will degrade substantially.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Fine-tuning audio-pretrained codecs outperforms training from scratch because large-scale audio pretraining provides useful inductive biases for signal compression.
- **Mechanism:** The pretrained DAC model has learned to distribute information across residual codebook layers (coarse-to-fine hierarchy). This structure is reused during EEG fine-tuning, requiring only adaptation to EEG-specific amplitude distributions and spectral characteristics rather than learning compression from scratch.
- **Core assumption:** The hierarchical codebook structure learned on audio is appropriate for EEG signal decomposition.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "fine-tuning on EEG data further improves fidelity and generalization compared to training from scratch"
  - [Section 3, Table 1a] "Audio-to-EEG Fine-tuned model achieved significantly lower spectrogram reconstruction loss (approximately 1.05) compared to both the Scratch (1.46) and Audio-Pretrained models without fine-tuning (2.5)"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on cross-modal transfer; this appears novel.
- **Break condition:** If EEG datasets were orders of magnitude larger, training from scratch might match or exceed fine-tuning performance.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multi-channel attention aggregation improves downstream task performance when spatial dependencies across electrodes are task-relevant.
- **Mechanism:** DAC-MC encodes each channel independently, then applies self-attention over concatenated latents to capture inter-channel correlations. Channel-specific style vectors condition the decoder for per-channel reconstruction. Grouping strategies (random vs. anatomical) determine which spatial relationships are learned.
- **Core assumption:** Cross-channel dependencies exist and are beneficial to model jointly rather than independently.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "attention-based cross-channel aggregation with channel-specific decoding... evaluations... show that the adapted codecs preserve clinically relevant information"
  - [Section 3, Table 1b] Epilepsy: grouped DAC-MC reaches 85% vs. 80% for DAC-SC. Abnormal EEG: grouped DAC-MC underperforms at 78% vs. 83% for DAC-SC.
  - [corpus] No corpus papers address multi-channel neural signal codec extensions.
- **Break condition:** When task-relevant information is localized to individual channels (as in abnormality detection), cross-channel aggregation may introduce noise and reduce performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ):**
  - Why needed here: The codec uses stacked codebooks where each layer refines the residual error from previous layers. Understanding this hierarchy is essential for interpreting compression-quality trade-offs (e.g., pruning codebooks).
  - Quick check question: If you use only the first 3 of 9 codebooks, what type of information is preserved versus lost?

- **Transfer Learning Across Modalities:**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution is adapting audio models to EEG. You must understand what transfers (sample-level patterns) versus what doesn't (temporal semantics).
  - Quick check question: Why does the model work despite the 44.1 kHz → 512 Hz sampling rate mismatch?

- **Attention-Based Multi-Channel Aggregation:**
  - Why needed here: DAC-MC extends single-channel compression to multi-channel EEG. Understanding how attention captures spatial dependencies is critical for debugging grouping strategies.
  - Quick check question: When would per-channel processing outperform joint multi-channel processing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - **DAC Backbone:** Pretrained encoder (strided convolutions) → Residual Vector Quantizer (9 codebooks, configurable) → Decoder (transposed convolutions)
  - **DAC-MC Extension:** Per-channel encoder → Cross-channel self-attention → Projection → Shared quantizer → Channel-conditioned decoder (style vectors)
  - **Configuration Layer:** Sampling rate (256/512 Hz), vocabulary size (512/1024), codebook depth (3-9)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Preprocess EEG: clip ±200 µV → normalize [-1, 1] → resample to 256 or 512 Hz → segment into 30s windows
  2. Load pretrained DAC checkpoint (44.1 kHz audio weights)
  3. Fine-tune with composite loss (spectrogram, waveform, reduced GAN)
  4. Evaluate: reconstruction loss + downstream classification

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Compression vs. Fidelity:** Fewer codebooks = higher compression but ~2× loss when reducing from 9 to 3 (Figure 3a)
  - **Spatial modeling vs. task fit:** Grouped DAC-MC helps epilepsy (85%) but hurts abnormality detection (78% vs. 83% single-channel)
  - **Pre-prune vs. post-prune:** Fine-tuning with fewer codebooks from scratch outperforms pruning a fully fine-tuned model

- **Failure signatures:**
  - GAN divergence during fine-tuning (domain mismatch) → use two-phase training, remove GAN losses early
  - Over-smoothed reconstructions (peak amplitudes suppressed) → reduce waveform loss weight gradually
  - Cross-channel attention adds noise for localized tasks → fall back to single-channel decoding mode

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline transfer test:** Load pretrained DAC, pass EEG through without fine-tuning, measure reconstruction loss. Expected: stable but lower fidelity (loss ~2.5 per Table 1a).
  2. **Fine-tuning ablation:** Fine-tune DAC-SC on EEG with all 9 codebooks. Compare spectrogram loss against training from scratch. Expected: fine-tuned achieves ~1.05 vs. scratch ~1.46.
  3. **Task-specific channel strategy:** For your downstream task, compare DAC-SC vs. DAC-MC with random groups vs. DAC-MC with anatomical groups. Use classification accuracy to determine whether spatial modeling helps.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Why does cross-channel aggregation in DAC-MC improve epilepsy detection accuracy (85%) but degrade abnormality detection accuracy (78%) compared to single-channel decoding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Table 1b shows grouped DAC-MC achieves 85% on epilepsy but only 78% on abnormal EEG, while single-channel decoding achieves 81% on abnormal EEG. Authors state: "for abnormality detection, per-channel decoding preserves the relevant features better than cross-channel grouping."
- Why unresolved: The paper observes this discrepancy but does not investigate whether it stems from task-specific spatial dependencies, differences in how clinical features manifest across channels, or artifacts introduced by the attention mechanism.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies analyzing which channels contribute most to each task; visualization of attention weights during both tasks; comparison of spectral features preserved under grouped vs. per-channel decoding.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal channel grouping strategy for multi-channel EEG compression, and does the optimal strategy depend on the downstream task?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates random groups and manual (anatomically-motivated) groups, finding both reach 85% on epilepsy and 78% on abnormality. Authors do not declare a superior strategy.
- Why unresolved: Both strategies yield identical downstream performance despite different inductive biases, leaving open whether anatomical priors are beneficial or whether a task-adaptive grouping could outperform both.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison across more tasks (sleep staging, BCI); learned grouping via end-to-end optimization; analysis of group composition vs. performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can audio-pretrained codecs generalize to EEG datasets with different channel counts, montages, or recording protocols without extensive re-fine-tuning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates only on TUH datasets with fixed preprocessing (512 Hz, specific channel set). The DAC-MC architecture uses fixed channel ordering and positional encodings, suggesting sensitivity to channel configuration.
- Why unresolved: Clinical EEG varies widely in electrode placement (10-20 vs. 10-10 vs. high-density) and channel count (19 to 256+). It is unclear whether the learned cross-channel attention transfers or requires retraining.
- What evidence would resolve it: Zero-shot or few-shot evaluation on datasets with different montages (e.g., sleep EEG with fewer channels, high-density research EEG); analysis of style vector adaptation across configurations.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does adversarial training remain unstable for EEG compression due to fundamental domain mismatch, or can modified discriminators stabilize learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Adversarial losses proved unstable on EEG data, often diverging due to domain mismatch. To mitigate this, we adopted a two-phase training strategy: GAN losses were included with reduced weight in the first phase, then removed entirely once divergence was observed."
- Why unresolved: The paper abandons adversarial training rather than resolving the instability, leaving open whether spectral-only losses are sufficient or whether improved GAN formulations could further enhance reconstruction fidelity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing alternative discriminators (multi-scale, spectral-domain, or contrastive); progressive adversarial training with curriculum; comparison of reconstruction quality with and without stabilized adversarial losses.

## Limitations
- Training details underspecified (exact epochs, batch size, loss weight schedules, train/val/test splits)
- GAN instability handled through ad-hoc early stopping rather than architectural solutions
- Multi-channel grouping strategies lack systematic evaluation of optimal configurations
- Cross-modal transfer mechanism demonstrated but not theoretically grounded

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Single-channel EEG compression with pretrained DAC (reconstruction metrics and downstream task performance are empirically validated)
- **Medium Confidence:** Multi-channel extension (DAC-MC) performance is mixed and task-dependent, with some results suggesting potential overfitting or noise injection
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization to other neural signals or clinical scenarios beyond the two tested datasets

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on Codebook Depth:** Systematically evaluate DAC performance with 3, 6, and 9 codebooks on EEG reconstruction and downstream tasks to quantify the coarse-to-fine information preservation trade-off
2. **Transferability Test to Other Neural Signals:** Apply the same fine-tuning pipeline to EMG or ECoG data to assess modality generalization beyond EEG
3. **Optimal Grouping Strategy Analysis:** Conduct controlled experiments varying channel grouping granularity and anatomical vs. random assignments across multiple clinical tasks to identify optimal spatial modeling configurations
