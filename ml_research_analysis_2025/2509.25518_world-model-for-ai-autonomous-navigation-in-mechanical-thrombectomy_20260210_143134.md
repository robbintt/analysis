# World Model for AI Autonomous Navigation in Mechanical Thrombectomy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25518
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25518
- Reference count: 30
- Single RL agent trained across 5 navigation tasks in 10 real patient vasculatures achieved 65% mean success rate versus SAC's 37%

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that a world model-based reinforcement learning approach, specifically TD-MPC2, significantly improves autonomous endovascular navigation performance in mechanical thrombectomy compared to the current state-of-the-art SAC method. Training a single RL agent across multiple navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures, TD-MPC2 achieved a 65% mean success rate versus SAC's 37%, with statistically significant improvements in path ratio across all tasks. The model-based approach showed superior generalization capabilities, though at the cost of increased procedure times. These findings establish a framework for multi-task learning in autonomous endovascular interventions and highlight the potential of world models for developing AI-driven robotic systems capable of navigating diverse anatomical variations.

## Method Summary
The study compares SAC (model-free) with TD-MPC2 (model-based) for autonomous endovascular navigation across 5 phases: A1 (common iliac to descending aorta), A2L/R (descending aorta to left/right CCA), and A3L/R (CCA to ICA). Ten patient-specific vasculatures were used, with single RL agents trained on all tasks simultaneously. SAC agents were first trained individually per task to generate demonstration trajectories, which populated a shared replay buffer. TD-MPC2 was then trained for 10M steps using an LSTM-based observation embedder. Evaluation occurred every 250K steps over 250 episodes, measuring success rate, path ratio, and procedure time with statistical comparison via paired t-tests.

## Key Results
- TD-MPC2 achieved 65% mean success rate versus SAC's 37% across all tasks
- Path ratio improved significantly in all tasks with TD-MPC2 (p<0.05)
- Procedure times increased substantially with TD-MPC2 (e.g., A1: 8.9s → 16.7s)
- Multi-task training with a single agent showed better generalization than task-specific SAC models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TD-MPC2's latent dynamics model enables sample-efficient planning by simulating environment transitions internally.
- Mechanism: The algorithm learns a compact latent representation of vascular navigation dynamics, then uses model-predictive control (MPC) with cross-entropy planning to evaluate action sequences over a short horizon before execution. This reduces reliance on real-world interaction data compared to model-free approaches.
- Core assumption: The learned latent dynamics sufficiently capture the key physical constraints of catheter/guidewire navigation to enable useful rollforward planning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "TD-MPC2 combines temporal difference learning with model-predictive control, leveraging a learned dynamics model to simulate environment transitions and plan action sequences over a short horizon."
  - [abstract] "world model-based reinforcement learning approach, specifically TD-MPC2, significantly improves autonomous endovascular navigation"
  - [corpus] Related work on autonomous endovascular navigation uses model-free RL (SAC) without learned dynamics, limiting multi-task transfer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-task training with a single world model agent improves generalization across anatomical variations compared to task-specific models.
- Mechanism: Training one agent across 5 navigation phases and 10 patient vasculatures forces the world model to learn shared representations of vascular navigation that transfer across anatomies. Augmentation via random scaling (0.7-1.3) further regularizes the model.
- Core assumption: There exist learnable shared dynamics patterns across different vessel geometries that a single model can exploit.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "trained a single RL agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures"
  - [section 3.2] "significant increases in success rate and path ratio were seen across tasks when moving from SAC to TD-MPC2"
  - [corpus] Prior work (cited as [14, 16]) examined single-task or single-vasculature scenarios with limited generalization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Planning-based action selection improves navigation success at the cost of increased procedure time.
- Mechanism: TD-MPC2's MPC component evaluates multiple action trajectories before selection, enabling more cautious/explored navigation. This deliberation improves path-finding in complex vessels but increases step-level computation and reduces action frequency.
- Core assumption: The trade-off between planning depth and execution speed is acceptable for clinical scenarios where success outweighs speed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "increase in procedure time was observed across all tasks when moving from SAC to TD-MPC2" with significance in A1, A3L, A3R
  - [section 4] "longer procedure times suggest that TD-MPC2 may conceivably prioritize exploration and more deliberate navigation strategies"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus signal on speed-accuracy tradeoffs in endovascular RL—limited prior data on this specific mechanism.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Model-based vs model-free reinforcement learning
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution compares TD-MPC2 (model-based, learns environment dynamics) against SAC (model-free, learns policy directly). Understanding this distinction is essential to interpret why TD-MPC2 generalizes better but requires different training assumptions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model-based agent might require fewer environment interactions to adapt to a new vessel geometry?

- Concept: World models and latent dynamics
  - Why needed here: The paper proposes a "world model" without detailed architecture—readers must understand that this means a learned simulator of environment transitions, typically implemented as a neural network predicting next-state distributions from (state, action) pairs.
  - Quick check question: What would happen to TD-MPC2's performance if its latent dynamics model systematically overestimated guidewire flexibility?

- Concept: Multi-task reinforcement learning with shared replay
  - Why needed here: The study trains a single agent on 5 tasks using a shared replay buffer of 10M transitions. This requires understanding how task interleaving, replay buffer composition, and reward scaling affect learning stability.
  - Quick check question: Why might filling the replay buffer with SAC demonstrations before TD-MPC2 training improve sample efficiency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Observation embedder (LSTM) -> Latent dynamics model -> Planner (MPC with cross-entropy) -> Actor-critic heads
- Critical path: 1) Single-task SAC training generates demonstration trajectories (5 agents, one per task) 2) Demonstrations populate TD-MPC2 replay buffer 3) TD-MPC2 trains online for 10M exploration steps across all tasks 4) Evaluation: 250 episodes per checkpoint, measuring success rate, path ratio, procedure time
- Design tradeoffs: Success rate vs. procedure time (65% vs 37% success, but procedure times roughly double); Single-agent multi-task vs. task-specific agents (enables generalization but sacrifices per-task optimization); Replay buffer size (10M vs standard 1M requires more memory but improves stability)
- Failure signatures: Low success on left-sided tasks (A2L: 22%, A3L: 50%) suggests anatomical complexity or training data imbalance; High variance (std approaching mean in some tasks) indicates policy instability; If procedure time exceeds episode limit (200 steps ≈ 27s), episodes terminate unsuccessfully
- First 3 experiments: 1) Reproduce single-task SAC baseline on one vasculature to validate simulation environment and confirm 90-100% success rates on simple phases (A1, A2R) 2) Ablate replay buffer pre-filling: train TD-MPC2 from scratch without SAC demonstrations to measure sample-efficiency contribution of bootstrapping data 3) Test generalization to held-out vasculature: train on 9 patients, evaluate on 1 unseen patient to assess out-of-distribution performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Can the trade-off between the high navigation success rate of TD-MPC2 and its increased procedure time be optimized without sacrificing reliability?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "Future work could explore optimizing the trade-off between efficiency and exploration in navigation," noting that TD-MPC2 exhibited increased procedure times compared to SAC.
  - Why unresolved: While TD-MPC2 improves success rates (65% vs 37%), it prioritizes deliberative planning which slows down execution; it is unclear if this efficiency gap can be closed while maintaining robustness.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A modified TD-MPC2 agent or reward structure that achieves comparable success rates (>65%) with procedure times statistically similar to or better than the SAC baseline.

- Question: Does incorporating image-based observations (e.g., fluoroscopy-like visual inputs) improve navigation performance compared to the coordinate-based tracking used in this study?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion suggests, "Future work may also compare image-based RL, such as DreamerV3, to the current approach, to evaluate if human-like visual input provides benefit."
  - Why unresolved: The current agent relies on abstract coordinate feedback (x', y') rather than raw visual data; the utility of visual features for anatomical reasoning in this context remains untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study benchmarking a vision-based world model against the current coordinate-based TD-MPC2 implementation on the same set of navigation tasks.

- Question: How effectively does the proposed world model generalize to entirely unseen patient anatomies not included in the training distribution?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper demonstrates multi-task learning across ten vasculatures, it notes the need to "improve generalization to unseen diverse vasculatures," and implies testing occurred on the same set of vasculatures used for training ("We train and test on 10 patient-specific vascular anatomies").
  - Why unresolved: It is unclear if the agent has simply overfitted to the specific geometric features of the ten training patients or if it has learned a generalizable navigation policy.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful deployment and maintenance of high success rates on a held-out validation set of patient anatomies with diverse tortuosity and aortic arch types.

## Limitations

- The results are based on simulation environments derived from 10 real patient vasculatures, which may not capture the full diversity of clinical anatomy
- The model-based approach shows superior success rates but at the cost of substantially increased procedure times, raising questions about clinical viability
- The paper does not report performance on completely unseen vasculatures, limiting assessment of true generalization capabilities

## Confidence

- High confidence: SAC vs TD-MPC2 success rate comparison, statistical significance of path ratio improvements
- Medium confidence: Mechanism 3 (planning-based deliberation tradeoff) due to weak corpus signals on endovascular RL speed-accuracy tradeoffs
- Low confidence: Claims about world model architecture details and specific latent dynamics implementation, as these are not fully specified in the paper

## Next Checks

1. Test TD-MPC2 on held-out vasculatures not seen during training to assess true generalization performance
2. Conduct ablation study comparing TD-MPC2 with and without SAC demonstration pre-training to quantify sample-efficiency benefits
3. Evaluate clinical acceptability of increased procedure times by establishing maximum acceptable delays for different thrombectomy phases
