## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20296
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20296

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of sparse-view CT reconstruction by proposing a deep unfolding framework called PromptCT. The method integrates a Lipschitz-constrained network (LipNet) as the prior network and utilizes explicit prompts to handle multiple sparse sampling views within a single model. LipNet is constructed using a sparse representation model-driven architecture with a constant-generating sub-network (CGNet) that employs explicit prompts to generate view-aware and spatial-variant thresholds. The deep unfolding network PromptCT combines an image update module with LipNet to iteratively reconstruct high-quality CT images from sparse-view projection data. Experimental results demonstrate that PromptCT outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and RMSE metrics while significantly reducing storage costs by enabling multiple sparse-view reconstructions with a single model.

## Method Summary
PromptCT is a deep unfolding proximal gradient descent framework that alternates between an Image Update Module (implementing data fidelity gradient descent) and LipNet (acting as the proximal operator). The key innovation is the explicit prompt module that processes the binary sinogram mask to generate view-aware features, which are fed into CGNet to produce spatial-variant thresholds for the soft shrinkage operation. The method uses a learned sparse representation frame (not constrained to be tight) combined with a soft thresholding operator, and proves both Lipschitz continuity and convergence of the iterative algorithm. Training uses a mixed-view strategy where different view counts are sampled per batch, with the binary mask serving as the explicit prompt input to the CGNet.

## Key Results
- PromptCT achieves superior reconstruction quality with PSNR gains of 1.5-2.0 dB over single-view models across multiple sparse-view settings
- Storage efficiency improves by factor of 4 as single model replaces four dedicated models for 60, 90, 120, and 180 views
- Theoretical analysis confirms Lipschitz continuity and convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm under specific conditions
- Explicit prompt module outperforms adaptive prompts in ablation studies, validating the multi-view generalization approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Lipschitz-Constrained Sparse Representation Network (LipNet)
LipNet unrolls a sparse representation optimization problem using Half Quadratic Splitting, providing theoretical convergence guarantees through explicit Lipschitz continuity. The network learns a sparsifying frame W and uses a spatially-variant soft thresholding operator, with proportional constants bounded to ensure the Lipschitz constant remains controlled. This avoids the need for closed-form solutions for data fidelity terms while maintaining provable convergence.

### Mechanism 2: Explicit Prompt-Based Multi-View Generalization
The binary sinogram mask serves as an explicit prompt vector processed by a small sub-network to generate view-aware features. These features modulate the generation of spatial-variant proportional constants in CGNet, allowing a single model to adapt its reconstruction parameters for different view numbers. This approach is more sample-efficient than learnable prompts and assumes the artifact distribution differs significantly across view counts.

### Mechanism 3: Deep Unfolding with Convergence Guarantee (PromptCT)
The framework forms a convergent iterative algorithm when unrolled, embedding LipNet as the prior network in a proximal gradient descent scheme. Convergence is proven under specific conditions on the step size relative to the eigenvalues of P^TP and the Lipschitz constant of LipNet, ensuring stable reconstruction through the alternating updates between image update and prior network.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sparse Representation and Iterative Thresholding**
  - Why needed here: LipNet is built by unrolling an iterative algorithm for sparse representation, where images are assumed sparse under a transform domain
  - Quick check question: How does the soft thresholding operator T_{ε(σ)}(u) = sign(u) max(|u| - ε, 0) enforce sparsity on the frame coefficients?

- **Concept: Lipschitz Continuity and Convergence**
  - Why needed here: The core theoretical contribution proves convergence of the PromptCT iterative algorithm, which hinges on LipNet being Lipschitz continuous
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for LipNet D_θ(·; σ) to be υ-Lipschitz continuous, and how does this property relate to the contractive nature of the full PromptCT iteration map?

- **Concept: Prompt Learning in a Conditional Model**
  - Why needed here: The "multiple-in-one" capability is achieved via an explicit prompt that conditions the network's forward pass using the sinogram mask
  - Quick check question: How does the explicit prompt vector m derived from the downsampling mask allow a single set of network weights to adapt its processing for distinct tasks like 60 vs 180 views?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Sinogram y -> Image Update Module (IUM) -> LipNet -> CGNet -> Soft Shrinkage -> Frame W^T -> Next IUM stage
- **Critical path**: Input sparse sinogram y enters IUM using P^T to backproject initial image estimate, this image enters LipNet where frame W extracts coefficients, CGNet uses these coefficients plus prompt to generate thresholds, soft thresholding denoises coefficients, frame W^T reconstructs image for next IUM stage, with the explicit prompt being critical at the threshold generation step
- **Design tradeoffs**: Relaxing the tight frame constraint (W^TW=I) improves representational power but adds complexity to the convergence proof; using explicit prompts is more sample-efficient than learnable prompts but assumes mask contains all discriminative information; more unfolding stages improve theoretical convergence but increase inference time
- **Failure signatures**: Blurred reconstructions if thresholds are too aggressive; residual streak artifacts if prompt module fails to discriminate views; training instability if Lipschitz constant grows too large or step size is improper
- **First 3 experiments**: (1) Stage ablation testing K ∈ {1,2,3,4,5} to verify reconstruction quality increases and converges; (2) Prompt effectiveness ablation comparing LipCT, MLipCT, and PromptCT to quantify prompt's role; (3) LipNet component ablation testing CNNs, fixed frame, and tight frame configurations against learned non-tight frame

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Practical enforcement of Lipschitz constraint during training is unspecified, with no details on clipping values for proportional constants or monitoring strategy
- Architectural details of CGNet's Explicit Prompt Module (convolutional kernel sizes, channel dimensions) are underspecified, affecting reproducibility
- Convergence proof assumes specific conditions on Radon transform and noise model that may not hold perfectly for real clinical data

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Explicit prompt module effectiveness is well-supported by ablation studies showing clear performance gains over MLipCT
- **Medium Confidence**: Lipschitz continuity and convergence guarantees are theoretically sound but depend on successful constraint enforcement during training
- **Medium Confidence**: Overall reconstruction quality improvements are demonstrated on multiple datasets, though direct comparison with most recent state-of-the-art is limited

## Next Checks

1. **Prompt Feature Validation**: Visualize and analyze learned prompt features using t-SNE to verify they form distinct clusters for different view numbers (60, 90, 120, 180), confirming discriminative capability

2. **Lipschitz Constraint Monitoring**: Implement runtime monitoring of LipNet's Lipschitz constant during training to ensure it remains below theoretical threshold, and log generated proportional constants to verify they stay within required bounds

3. **Multi-View Generalization Test**: Evaluate model on unseen sparse view count (e.g., 150 views) to test whether explicit prompt mechanism generalizes beyond four trained view numbers, confirming true multi-view capability
