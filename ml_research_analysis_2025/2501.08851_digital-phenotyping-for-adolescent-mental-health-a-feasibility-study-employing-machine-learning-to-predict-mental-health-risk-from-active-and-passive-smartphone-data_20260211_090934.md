# Digital Phenotyping for Adolescent Mental Health: A Feasibility Study Employing Machine Learning to Predict Mental Health Risk From Active and Passive Smartphone Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.08851
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08851
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Machine learning model achieves mean balanced accuracies of 0.71 for SDQ-high risk, 0.67 for insomnia, 0.77 for suicidal ideation, and 0.70 for eating disorders by integrating active self-reports with passive smartphone sensor data

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning to predict adolescent mental health risks by integrating active self-reports and passive smartphone sensor data. A novel contrastive learning framework was developed to stabilize user-specific feature representations and enhance prediction accuracy across four outcomes: high-risk SDQ scores, insomnia, suicidal ideation, and eating disorders. The combined data model achieved mean balanced accuracies of 0.71 for SDQ-high risk, 0.67 for insomnia, 0.77 for suicidal ideation, and 0.70 for eating disorders, outperforming models using only active or passive data. SHAP analysis revealed clinically meaningful features, highlighting the complementary nature of both data types. The findings underscore the potential of digital phenotyping for early, scalable detection of mental health risks in non-clinical adolescent populations.

## Method Summary
The study collected 14 days of active (self-reported mood, sleep, loneliness, etc.) and passive (phone sensor data including location, steps, app usage, ambient light, etc.) data from 103 adolescents. A contrastive pre-training framework with triplet margin loss was used to stabilize daily behavioral representations by clustering same-user data while separating different users. The resulting embeddings were fine-tuned using a supervised classifier for four binary mental health outcomes. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation with 10 repetitions was employed for evaluation, with balanced accuracy as the primary metric.

## Key Results
- Combined model achieved balanced accuracies of 0.71 (SDQ-high risk), 0.67 (insomnia), 0.77 (suicidal ideation), and 0.70 (eating disorders)
- Models integrating active and passive data outperformed those using only active or passive data alone
- Contrastive pre-training significantly improved model performance compared to models without pre-training
- SHAP analysis revealed clinically meaningful features from both data sources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Integrating active self-reports with passive sensor data improves mental health risk prediction accuracy compared to using either data source in isolation.
- **Mechanism:** Active data captures subjective internal states (e.g., negative thinking), while passive data provides objective, continuous behavioral markers (e.g., location entropy, sleep patterns). The model leverages the complementary nature of these inputs to create a more robust feature representation.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: Distinct mental health outcomes (SDQ, insomnia, etc.) manifest in detectable patterns across both reported mood and physical behavior that are consistent across individuals.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "The combined data model achieved mean balanced accuracies of 0.71... outperforming models using only active or passive data."
  - [Page 13]: "For SDQ-High risk... The combined model... achieved a significantly higher balanced accuracy of 0.71 compared to active data alone (P=.003)."
  - [Corpus]: Related work confirms that multimodal data fusion (e.g., speech and text) is increasingly used for mental state inference, though this paper focuses on sensor fusion.
- **Break condition:** If active data engagement drops significantly (attrition), the combined model may degrade to passive-only performance levels.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Contrastive pre-training stabilizes daily behavioral representations, improving model robustness against day-to-day variability.
- **Mechanism:** A triplet margin loss function clusters data points from the same user (anchor/positive) while pushing apart data from different users (negative). This forces the encoder to learn user-invariant features or stable user-specific embeddings before the supervised classification task.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: An individual's behavior across different days is more similar to itself than to another individual's behavior, providing a reliable signal for self-supervision.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 7]: "This pretraining step clustered user-specific features from different days, minimising day-to-day variability... The resulting stable embeddings were fine-tuned..."
  - [Page 14]: "Models with pretraining achieved the highest balanced accuracy (0.67), significantly outperforming both the model without pretraining (0.65, P<.001)..."
  - [Corpus]: No direct evidence for contrastive learning in mental health was found in the provided neighbors, highlighting this as a novel contribution of the specific paper.
- **Break condition:** If users exhibit extremely erratic behavior (high intra-subject variance) or populations are too homogeneous (low inter-subject variance), the triplet loss may fail to form meaningful clusters.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Specific engineered features from passive sensors (e.g., ambient light, step count) act as proxies for clinical symptoms.
- **Mechanism:** Raw sensor data is transformed into meaningful features (e.g., "location entropy" for routine stability, "nighttime ambient light" for sleep disruption). These features correlate with clinical thresholds for risk.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: Digital traces like movement and phone usage are reliable proxies for complex psychological states like depression or anxiety.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Page 17-18]: "High-risk individuals showed greater ambient light exposure... [and] fewer high-risk individuals exceeded 5,000 daily steps."
  - [Page 4]: "Passive data comprised data from phone sensors... enabling digital phenotyping... revealing dynamic interactions..."
  - [Corpus]: Neighboring papers support the premise that "Human-computer interactions predict mental health" and that digital phenotyping is a valid approach.
- **Break condition:** If sensors are disabled by users or data collection is interrupted, these specific features become unavailable, potentially breaking the prediction logic.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Contrastive Learning (Triplet Loss)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core methodological innovation used to handle the "noise" of daily behavior. You cannot understand the model's performance boost without understanding how it learns to group a user's Monday data with their Tuesday data.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the model identify a "positive" pair versus a "negative" pair during the pre-training phase?

- **Concept:** **Digital Phenotyping**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the theoretical framework of the paper. It explains why we treat phone sensors as medical instruments.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the difference between "active" and "passive" data in the context of digital phenotyping, and why does the paper argue for combining them?

- **Concept:** **Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation (LOSO CV)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the evaluation standard used to claim the model is "feasible" and generalizable.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is LOSO CV a better metric for this study than a random 80/20 split of the total data rows?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Ingestion (Mindcraft App) -> Preprocessing (median aggregation over 14 days) -> Encoder (2-layer MLP + projection head with triplet margin loss) -> Classifier (2-layer MLP with weighted BCE loss) -> Interpretability (SHAP DeepExplainer)
- **Critical path:** The Contrastive Pre-training phase is the critical dependency. Without it, the paper shows performance drops to levels comparable with standard CatBoost models. The system relies on having sufficient historical data per user to form stable embeddings before fine-tuning.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Android vs. iOS:** The feature set is inconsistent across platforms. Android provides ambient light/noise; iOS does not (Page 5). This requires the model to handle missing data columns depending on the user's device.
  - **Attrition vs. Density:** Passive data persists longer than active data (Page 10). The architecture must function even if active self-reports cease after a few days.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Sparse Data:** Users enabling 0 sensors (36 users did this) or stopping active input.
  - **Threshold Confusion:** The model struggles with scores near clinical thresholds (e.g., SDQ 9-16), performing well only at extremes (Page 15).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Replication:** Run a CatBoost classifier on the raw active/passive features without pre-training to establish a baseline.
  2. **Embedding Visualization:** Generate t-SNE plots of user data before and after the contrastive learning phase to verify if "same-user" clustering is actually occurring (replicate Figure 1B).
  3. **Ablation Study:** Retrain the model using *only* passive data to quantify the performance drop and validate the claim that active data provides necessary complementary signals for specific outcomes like Suicidal Ideation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the prediction model maintain high accuracy when applied to a larger, more demographically diverse adolescent population over a period longer than 14 days?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that "future studies should aim for a more balanced and diverse sample and an extended data collection period to validate these findings across various demographic groups."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study was restricted to a small sample (N=103) from three London schools with a skewed gender distribution (71% female) and a short 14-day data collection window.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A longitudinal study with a larger, gender-balanced sample from multiple geographic regions demonstrating consistent balanced accuracies over several months.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the model be optimized to accurately identify individuals with borderline clinical scores who are at risk of developing future disorders?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors acknowledge that "model performance also needs improvement in identifying individuals with borderline SDQ scores who might develop mental disorders in the future."
- **Why unresolved:** The current results show significantly lower prediction accuracy for scores near the risk thresholds (e.g., SDQ 9–16) compared to extreme risk levels, limiting utility for early intervention in ambiguous cases.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A study specifically analyzing borderline cohorts, perhaps using regression-based modeling rather than binary classification, to successfully predict transition from borderline to high-risk states.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can reinforcement learning algorithms be effectively integrated into the app to provide adaptive, personalized mental health interventions?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper suggests that "Future iterations could incorporate reinforcement learning algorithms to adaptively suggest mood-enhancing activities... to improve user engagement and the effectiveness of interventions."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study focused purely on the feasibility of detection and prediction using active and passive data, without testing the delivery or efficacy of automated interventions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A randomized controlled trial (RCT) where the app delivers algorithm-driven suggestions, demonstrating measurable improvements in mental health outcomes compared to a control group.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (N=103) and single-site recruitment limit generalizability to broader adolescent populations
- Moderate balanced accuracies (0.67-0.77) indicate reasonable but imperfect prediction performance, particularly for insomnia (0.67)
- Platform inconsistency between Android and iOS devices creates missing data issues, as iOS users lack certain passive features
- 14-day observation window may be insufficient to capture longer-term behavioral patterns
- Reliance on self-reported clinical thresholds without clinical validation introduces potential measurement error

## Confidence
- High confidence in the feasibility demonstration and the comparative advantage of combined active-passive data integration
- Medium confidence in the clinical meaningfulness of specific feature importance rankings, as these depend on the self-report validation framework
- Medium confidence in the generalizability of contrastive learning benefits, given the novel application to mental health prediction and limited cross-validation evidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multi-site validation with larger, more diverse adolescent samples across different geographic and socioeconomic contexts to assess generalizability
2. Perform clinical validation study where model predictions are compared against standardized psychiatric assessments rather than self-reported thresholds
3. Implement longitudinal tracking beyond 14 days to evaluate model performance stability and assess whether extended observation periods improve prediction accuracy for outcomes like insomnia
