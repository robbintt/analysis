# Beyond Direct Generation: A Decomposed Approach to Well-Crafted Screenwriting with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23163
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23163
- Authors: Hang Lei; Shengyi Zong; Zhaoyan Li; Ziren Zhou; Hao Liu
- Reference count: 29
- Key outcome: Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR) framework achieves 75% win rate against strong baselines and 82.7% of human-level performance in professional screenwriter evaluations for generating high-quality screenplays from basic inputs.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating high-quality screenplays from basic inputs like outlines and character profiles. The authors propose a Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR) framework that separates creative narrative generation from rigid format conversion, allowing specialized focus at each stage. A hybrid data synthesis strategy combining reverse synthesis (deconstructing screenplays) and forward synthesis (generating novel-style prose) resolves the scarcity of paired training data. In blind evaluations by professional screenwriters, DSR achieved a 75% win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reached 82.7% of human-level performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of decomposed generation for complex creative writing tasks.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR) framework that decomposes screenplay generation into two specialized stages: creative narrative generation and format conversion. To address the scarcity of paired training data, the authors employ a hybrid data synthesis strategy that combines reverse synthesis (deconstructing existing screenplays) and forward synthesis (generating novel-style prose). This approach enables the model to learn both creative storytelling and rigid formatting requirements separately, resulting in higher-quality screenplay outputs compared to direct generation methods.

## Key Results
- DSR achieved 75% win rate against strong baselines including Gemini-2.5-Pro in blind evaluations by professional screenwriters
- The framework reached 82.7% of human-level performance on the screenplay generation task
- Hybrid data synthesis strategy successfully addressed the scarcity of paired training data for screenplay generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Dual-Stage Refinement framework works by decomposing the complex task of screenplay generation into two specialized stages. The first stage focuses on creative narrative generation, allowing the model to concentrate on storytelling without being constrained by formatting requirements. The second stage handles rigid format conversion, ensuring proper screenplay structure and conventions. This separation allows each stage to develop expertise in its specific domain, resulting in higher overall quality. The hybrid data synthesis strategy addresses the fundamental challenge of data scarcity by combining reverse synthesis (deconstructing existing screenplays to create training pairs) with forward synthesis (generating novel-style prose that can be paired with screenplays). This approach creates sufficient paired training data while maintaining the creative and structural aspects necessary for effective screenplay generation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dual-Stage Decomposition**: Separating creative and technical tasks allows specialized optimization at each stage. Why needed: Complex creative tasks often require different skills and cannot be effectively learned in a single unified process. Quick check: Can each stage independently produce outputs that meet their respective quality standards?
- **Hybrid Data Synthesis**: Combining reverse and forward synthesis strategies to create paired training data. Why needed: Lack of large-scale paired data for screenplay generation tasks. Quick check: Does the synthetic data maintain the distribution and quality of real screenplay data?
- **Format-Agnostic Creative Generation**: Generating narrative content without formatting constraints. Why needed: Formatting requirements can interfere with creative storytelling quality. Quick check: Can the creative stage produce engaging narratives that don't depend on specific formatting?
- **Format Conversion as Post-Processing**: Treating screenplay formatting as a separate, rule-based transformation. Why needed: Formatting is largely mechanical and benefits from dedicated processing. Quick check: Does the format conversion stage preserve the creative quality while ensuring technical correctness?
- **Blind Professional Evaluation**: Using industry experts to assess output quality. Why needed: Automated metrics cannot fully capture creative quality standards. Quick check: Do professional evaluations consistently identify quality differences between methods?
- **Win Rate Metrics**: Measuring performance through competitive comparison rather than absolute scores. Why needed: Relative quality assessment is more meaningful for creative tasks. Quick check: Does the win rate correlate with other quality indicators?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Outline/Characters -> Creative Narrative Stage -> Format Conversion Stage -> Final Screenplay

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from basic inputs through creative narrative generation, then through format conversion to produce the final screenplay. The hybrid data synthesis strategy supports both stages by providing appropriate training data for each specialized task.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff involves complexity versus performance - decomposing the task adds architectural complexity but enables specialized optimization. The hybrid synthesis approach balances data quality with quantity, using reverse synthesis for accuracy and forward synthesis for coverage.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor creative narratives indicate issues in the first stage's ability to generate engaging stories
- Formatting errors suggest problems in the conversion stage's understanding of screenplay conventions
- Disconnections between narrative and format indicate misalignment between the two stages
- Quality degradation when applied to out-of-domain styles suggests limited generalizability

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate creative narrative quality independently by removing format conversion and assessing story engagement
2. Test format conversion accuracy using pre-written narratives to isolate formatting capabilities
3. Conduct ablation studies removing either reverse or forward synthesis to measure their individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns when applying the framework to diverse screenplay genres or styles not represented in training data
- Reliance on paired training data, even with hybrid synthesis strategies, may limit robustness for novel formats
- Evaluation by professional screenwriters, while rigorous, was limited in scale and may not capture full industry diversity
- The 82.7% human-level performance metric depends on evaluation methodology and baseline representativeness

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| DSR achieves 75% win rate against strong baselines | Medium |
| Framework reaches 82.7% of human-level performance | Medium |
| Hybrid data synthesis effectively addresses data scarcity | Medium |
| Decomposed generation improves screenplay quality | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale evaluation involving professional screenwriters across multiple genres and cultural contexts to assess generalizability
2. Test the framework's robustness on out-of-domain screenplay styles or novel formats not represented in the original training data
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contributions of reverse and forward synthesis strategies, clarifying which aspects of the hybrid approach drive performance gains
