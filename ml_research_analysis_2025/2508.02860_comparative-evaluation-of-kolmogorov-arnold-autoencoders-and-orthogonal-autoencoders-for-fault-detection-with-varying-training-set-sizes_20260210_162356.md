# Comparative Evaluation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Autoencoders and Orthogonal Autoencoders for Fault Detection with Varying Training Set Sizes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.02860
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02860
- Reference count: 40
- Kolmogorov-Arnold Autoencoders (KAN-AEs) achieve higher fault detection rates with fewer training samples than traditional autoencoders by using learnable edge functions instead of fixed node activations.

## Executive Summary
This study compares four variants of Kolmogorov-Arnold Autoencoders (KAN-AEs) against Orthogonal Autoencoders (OAE) for fault detection in chemical processes. Using the Tennessee Eastman Process benchmark with 21 fault types, the research demonstrates that KAN-AEs achieve superior data efficiency, with WavKAN-AE reaching ≥92% fault detection rate using only 4,000 training samples compared to OAE's requirement of 30,500+ samples. The study systematically evaluates performance across 13 different training set sizes (625-250,000 samples) and identifies that wavelet-based KAN-AEs are particularly effective for fault detection in low-data regimes.

## Method Summary
The study employs static autoencoder architectures trained on normal operation data from the Tennessee Eastman Process. Five models are evaluated: OAE baseline and four KAN-AE variants using different basis functions (B-splines, Gaussian RBFs, Fourier series, and wavelets). Models are trained across 13 dataset sizes using 80/20 simulation-level splits. Fault detection is performed via squared prediction error (SPE) statistics with kernel density estimation for threshold determination at 5% false alarm rate. Performance is measured by Fault Detection Rate (FDR) on back-to-control and uncontrollable faults, with statistical significance assessed using Bayesian signed-rank tests on nine challenging faults.

## Key Results
- WavKAN-AE achieves highest overall FDR (≥92%) using just 4,000 training samples
- EfficientKAN-AE reaches ≥90% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating strong performance in extreme low-data scenarios
- FastKAN-AE becomes competitive with larger training sets (≥50,000 samples)
- FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms across all dataset sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KANs achieve higher fault detection rates with fewer training samples than MLP-based autoencoders by replacing fixed node activations with learnable edge functions.
- Mechanism: In KANs, each connection carries a learnable univariate function $\phi_{ij}^{(\ell)}(x)$ rather than a scalar weight. Nodes simply sum transformed inputs. This allows the network to adapt its nonlinearities to the data distribution rather than imposing fixed transformations (e.g., ReLU) that may be mismatched to the underlying signal structure.
- Core assumption: Fault patterns in chemical process data exhibit structured nonlinearities that can be decomposed into compositions of univariate functions, consistent with the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "KANs place learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families... WavKAN-AE achieves the highest overall FDR (≥92%) using just 4,000 training samples"
  - [section 2.2] "each edge in a KAN is parameterized by a learnable univariate function, enabling the model to approximate complex nonlinear relationships with enhanced adaptability"
  - [corpus] Related work on hybrid autoencoder frameworks (arXiv:2510.15010) shows similar data efficiency gains, though corpus lacks direct KAN comparisons for fault detection.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Basis function choice creates inductive biases that differentially benefit fault detection across data regimes.
- Mechanism: Each KAN variant parameterizes edge functions differently—B-splines (EfficientKAN) provide localized smooth approximation; Gaussian RBFs (FastKAN) offer fixed radial bases; Fourier series (FourierKAN) impose global periodicity; wavelets (WavKAN) enable multiresolution analysis. Wavelets' ability to capture both sharp transients and broad trends matches the mixed-frequency nature of fault signatures.
- Core assumption: Faults in chemical processes produce signals with localized deviations (sharp changes) and persistent shifts that wavelets are well-suited to represent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "WavKAN-AE achieves the highest overall FDR... FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger scales (≥50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms"
  - [section 2.3.4] "WavKAN supports localized adaptation to both low- and high-frequency patterns... advantageous for modeling structured signals in industrial process data"
  - [corpus] Fourier-KAN-Mamba (arXiv:2511.15083) applies Fourier-KAN to time-series anomaly detection, suggesting Fourier bases may work better in sequential contexts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: KAN-AEs' parameter efficiency and structured basis functions reduce sample complexity for learning normal operating boundaries.
- Mechanism: By constraining edge functions to smooth basis expansions (e.g., B-splines with 6 basis functions), KAN-AEs impose regularization through architecture rather than post-hoc penalties. This reduces the hypothesis space, requiring fewer samples to identify the correct decision boundary between normal and faulty operation.
- Core assumption: The true normal operating manifold can be approximated with relatively low-order basis expansions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "EfficientKAN-AE reaches ≥90% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating robustness in low-data settings"
  - [section 4.3] "This pattern reflects the inability of static autoencoders to capture temporal dependencies... EfficientKAN-AE outperforms other variants on each of these faults, surpassing the next best models by 13–34 percentage points"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence—no direct comparisons of sample complexity in related fault detection work.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - Why needed here: This is the theoretical foundation justifying why learnable univariate functions on edges can approximate arbitrary continuous multivariate functions. Without understanding this, the architectural choices seem arbitrary.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why composing univariate functions with addition is sufficient to represent any continuous function on a bounded domain, and what the practical limitations of this theorem are?

- Concept: **Basis Function Expansions and Inductive Bias**
  - Why needed here: The four KAN variants differ primarily in their basis families. Understanding how B-splines, RBFs, Fourier series, and wavelets impose different smoothness, locality, and frequency assumptions is essential for selecting the right variant.
  - Quick check question: Why would wavelets be better suited than Fourier series for detecting step-change faults in chemical process data?

- Concept: **Autoencoder-Based Anomaly Detection**
  - Why needed here: The fault detection approach relies on reconstruction error (SPE statistic) as a proxy for abnormality. This assumes the autoencoder learns to reconstruct normal data well but fails on out-of-distribution fault data.
  - Quick check question: What are the failure modes where an autoencoder might achieve low reconstruction error on faulty data, and how does the paper address (or not address) this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - 33 process variables -> KAN Encoder layers [33 → 25] -> 25-dimensional latent space -> KAN Decoder layers [25 → 33] -> 33 reconstructed variables
  - Detection pipeline: SPE computation -> KDE threshold estimation -> binary fault decision

- Critical path:
  1. Select basis function family based on expected fault characteristics (wavelets for mixed-frequency, B-splines for smooth localized, Fourier for periodic—though not recommended per results)
  2. Train on normal data only, minimizing reconstruction loss with appropriate regularization
  3. Compute SPE on held-out normal data, fit KDE, extract 95th percentile threshold
  4. At inference, flag samples with SPE > threshold as faulty

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **EfficientKAN vs WavKAN**: EfficientKAN wins in extreme data scarcity (n < 1,000) but WavKAN is more robust across regimes. If data availability is uncertain, WavKAN is safer.
  - **Parameter count vs expressiveness**: WavKAN has fewest parameters (6,716) but best overall performance. FourierKAN (9,958 params) underperforms—more parameters don't guarantee better results.
  - **Temporal modeling tradeoff**: All models here are static. For intermittent/evolving faults (e.g., Faults 10, 16, 19), consider recurrent extensions (not explored in paper).

- Failure signatures:
  - **High FAR on specific faults**: Fault 16 shows elevated false alarms across all models (7-20%), suggesting pre-fault dynamics confuse the detector.
  - **SPE dipping below threshold during faults**: Intermittent fault signatures cause missed detections (Fig. 7c). Static models cannot capture temporal structure.
  - **FourierKAN underperformance**: If FourierKAN performs comparably to baselines, check whether data preprocessing normalized away periodic components.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Train EfficientKAN-AE and WavKAN-AE on 500 and 4,000 TEP samples. Verify FDR ≥90% and ≥92% respectively. Compare SPE distributions against OAE baseline.
  2. **Basis function ablation**: On a fixed dataset (e.g., 2,500 samples), train all four KAN-AE variants. Plot per-fault FDR to identify which fault types benefit from which basis. Check if FourierKAN's failure is consistent.
  3. **Threshold sensitivity analysis**: Vary the significance level α (e.g., 0.01, 0.05, 0.10) and plot FDR vs FAR tradeoffs. Verify that KAN-AE advantages persist across operating points, not just at the default 5% FAR.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the integration of temporal modeling mechanisms (e.g., recurrent architectures or temporal convolutions) into KAN-AEs improve the detection of intermittent or evolving fault patterns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that future research could explore "the integration of temporal modeling within KAN-AEs... to enable sequential fault detection and better capture delayed or evolving fault patterns."
- Why unresolved: The current study utilized static autoencoders which failed to consistently detect faults with fluctuating signatures (e.g., Faults 10, 16, and 19), leading to missed detections when SPE values dipped below thresholds.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study where temporal KAN-AE variants demonstrate statistically higher Fault Detection Rates (FDR) on dynamic fault types compared to the static implementations evaluated in this work.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the structural transparency of KAN-AEs translate into actionable diagnostic insights for process monitoring operators?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes that while KANs are often presented as interpretable, "this aspect is not systematically evaluated in our current framework. A more rigorous analysis is needed..."
- Why unresolved: The paper established performance metrics (FDR/FAR) but did not assess if the learnable edge functions provide better explainability than standard post hoc tools like saliency maps or SHAP.
- What evidence would resolve it: Qualitative or quantitative user studies demonstrating that KAN-AE visualizations allow operators to identify root causes faster or more accurately than standard MLP-based autoencoder contribution plots.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can KAN-AE frameworks be extended to perform fault identification and root-cause diagnosis rather than being restricted to binary fault detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors list a key limitation: "The models evaluated in this study... are restricted to fault detection, without addressing fault identification or root-cause diagnosis."
- Why unresolved: The current methodology relies on reconstruction error (SPE) to flag anomalies but lacks the architectural components or loss functions necessary to classify specific fault types or isolate causal variables.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified KAN-AE architectures (e.g., incorporating latent space classifiers) that successfully categorize specific fault types (e.g., distinguishing Fault 5 from Fault 6) in the Tennessee Eastman Process benchmark.

## Limitations

- Evaluation is limited to a single industrial benchmark (Tennessee Eastman Process), restricting generalizability to other domains
- Static autoencoder architectures cannot capture temporal dependencies in fault evolution, limiting performance on intermittent or evolving fault types
- Computational efficiency during training and inference is not evaluated, which could be critical for real-time industrial deployment

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: KAN-AEs outperform OAE in data efficiency (500 vs 30,500+ samples for 90% FDR); WavKAN-AE achieves best overall performance (≥92% FDR with 4,000 samples)
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism linking basis function choice to fault detection performance is well-supported but not exhaustively validated across diverse fault types
- **Medium confidence**: Statistical significance via Bayesian signed-rank test is properly applied but limited to specific challenging faults

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the key finding: train WavKAN-AE on 4,000 TEP samples and verify ≥92% FDR across all fault types, comparing against OAE baseline
2. Test basis function generalization: apply EfficientKAN and WavKAN to a different industrial dataset (e.g., simulated distillation column) to validate cross-domain performance
3. Evaluate temporal extension: implement a recurrent KAN-AE variant and test on intermittent fault types (10, 16, 19) to assess whether temporal modeling improves detection of evolving faults
