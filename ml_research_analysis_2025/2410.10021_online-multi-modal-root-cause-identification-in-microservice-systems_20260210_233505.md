# Online Multi-modal Root Cause Identification in Microservice Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10021
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10021
- Authors: Lecheng Zheng; Zhengzhang Chen; Haifeng Chen
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: OCEAN achieves 1.00 PR@1, 1.00 PR@5, 1.00 PR@10, 1.00 MRR, and 1.00 MAP@3 on Product Review dataset

## Executive Summary
OCEAN is an online multi-modal causal structure learning method designed for root cause localization in microservice systems. The method addresses key challenges in microservice fault diagnosis including long-term temporal causal relationship learning, multi-dimensional factor correlation capture, and multi-modal causal structure learning. Through a dual-encoder framework combining dilated convolutional networks and graph neural networks, OCEAN demonstrates superior performance across multiple real-world datasets while reducing computational costs significantly compared to existing baselines.

## Method Summary
OCEAN employs a dual-encoder framework that integrates temporal modeling through dilated convolutional networks with causal structure learning via graph neural networks. The method features a multi-factor attention mechanism for analyzing relationships among metrics and logs, and a contrastive mutual information maximization-based graph fusion module for modeling cross-modal relationships. This architecture enables online learning of multi-modal causal structures while maintaining computational efficiency. The system processes metric and log data streams to identify root causes of failures in microservice architectures, with particular emphasis on handling the complexity and heterogeneity inherent in distributed systems.

## Key Results
- Achieved perfect precision scores (1.00) at ranks 1, 5, and 10 on Product Review dataset
- Demonstrated 12.5% higher MRR compared to CORAL baseline
- Reduced computational cost to 1/9 of CORAL while maintaining superior performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OCEAN's effectiveness stems from its dual-encoder architecture that simultaneously captures temporal dependencies through dilated convolutions and learns causal relationships via graph neural networks. The multi-factor attention mechanism enables effective correlation analysis across different data modalities, while the contrastive mutual information maximization approach ensures robust modeling of cross-modal relationships. This combination allows OCEAN to identify causal structures in complex microservice environments where traditional methods struggle with temporal dynamics and multi-modal data integration.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal causal modeling**: Needed to capture long-term dependencies in system behavior; quick check: validate temporal consistency across different time scales
- **Multi-modal data fusion**: Required for integrating metrics and logs from heterogeneous sources; quick check: verify cross-modal correlation accuracy
- **Online learning adaptation**: Essential for handling concept drift in production systems; quick check: measure performance stability over time
- **Graph neural networks for causality**: Enables structural learning of system dependencies; quick check: validate causal structure accuracy against known dependencies
- **Contrastive mutual information maximization**: Provides robust cross-modal relationship modeling; quick check: assess mutual information estimates across modalities
- **Dilated convolutional networks**: Facilitates efficient temporal feature extraction; quick check: compare feature extraction quality against standard convolutions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Metrics/Logs -> Dual Encoder -> Temporal/Causal Processing -> Attention Mechanism -> Graph Fusion -> Root Cause Identification

**Critical Path**: Data ingestion → Temporal feature extraction → Causal structure learning → Multi-factor attention → Root cause localization

**Design Tradeoffs**: OCEAN prioritizes online learning capability and computational efficiency over exhaustive offline analysis, sacrificing some precision for real-time applicability and reduced resource consumption.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation under concept drift, reduced accuracy with insufficient training data, potential overfitting in highly correlated metric scenarios.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Validate temporal feature extraction quality on synthetic time series data
2. Test causal structure learning accuracy on known dependency graphs
3. Evaluate multi-modal fusion performance on controlled cross-modal datasets
