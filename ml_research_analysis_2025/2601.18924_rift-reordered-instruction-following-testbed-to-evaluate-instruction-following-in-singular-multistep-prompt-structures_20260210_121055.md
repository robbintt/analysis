# RIFT: Reordered Instruction Following Testbed To Evaluate Instruction Following in Singular Multistep Prompt Structures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18924
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18924
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Instruction-following accuracy drops by up to 72% when prompts require non-sequential reasoning

## Executive Summary
RIFT introduces a controlled testbed to isolate how prompt structure affects LLM instruction-following performance. By using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs and enforcing fixed content across both linear (sequential) and jumping (non-sequential) prompt topologies, the study eliminates confounds from semantic difficulty or task complexity. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions compared to linear, revealing that models rely heavily on positional continuity rather than abstract reasoning. Error analysis showed ~50% of failures were due to instruction-order violations and semantic drift. Even reasoning-tuned models showed only modest gains under jumping prompts, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as sequential pattern continuation rather than robust, transferable reasoning. These findings expose structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation with direct implications for non-linear workflows, workflow automation, and multi-agent systems.

## Method Summary
The study constructed a testbed using Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, systematically rephrasing content to maintain semantic equivalence while varying instruction ordering. Two prompt topologies were tested: linear (sequential) and jumping (non-sequential). Fixed content across conditions eliminated semantic difficulty as a confound. Six open-source LLMs were evaluated across 10,000 test instances, measuring accuracy differences between linear and jumping prompt structures.

## Key Results
- Instruction-following accuracy drops by up to 72% under jumping prompt structures compared to linear ones
- Positional continuity significantly influences instruction-following performance across all tested models
- Even reasoning-tuned models showed only modest improvements under jumping prompts
- ~50% of failures attributed to instruction-order violations and semantic drift

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Models rely on positional continuity in instruction following rather than abstract reasoning capabilities. The sequential nature of training data and instruction patterns causes models to treat instruction order as a fundamental structural requirement rather than a flexible guideline. This creates a systematic vulnerability when encountering non-sequential instruction structures.

## Foundational Learning
- **Prompt Topology**: The structural arrangement of instructions (linear vs. jumping) fundamentally affects model performance
  - Why needed: Understanding how structural variations impact performance is crucial for designing effective instruction-following systems
  - Quick check: Compare model outputs across different prompt arrangements with identical semantic content

- **Semantic Equivalence Control**: Maintaining identical content while varying structure isolates structural effects from semantic difficulty
  - Why needed: Prevents conflating semantic complexity with structural complexity in performance analysis
  - Quick check: Verify that rephrased versions maintain equivalent difficulty through human evaluation

- **Error Attribution Methodology**: Distinguishing between structural confusion and semantic misunderstanding in failure analysis
  - Why needed: Accurate failure mode identification is essential for targeted model improvements
  - Quick check: Implement blinded error categorization to validate attribution accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Jeopardy! Content -> Rephrasing Engine -> Prompt Generator -> LLM -> Output Evaluator -> Accuracy Metrics

Critical path: Content Selection -> Rephrasing -> Prompt Construction -> Model Evaluation -> Error Analysis

Design tradeoffs: 
- Content domain specificity (Jeopardy!) provides control but limits generalizability
- Single-turn structures enable clean measurement but may not reflect real-world complexity
- Open-source model focus ensures reproducibility but excludes potentially more capable proprietary models

Failure signatures: 
- Systematic accuracy drops under jumping prompts
- High correlation between positional discontinuity and error rates
- Consistent pattern of instruction-order violations across model families

Three first experiments:
1. Cross-domain replication using medical instructions to test generalizability
2. Multi-turn extension to evaluate conversational instruction-following
3. Proprietary model benchmarking to assess commercial model differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Task domain specificity limits generalizability to other instruction types
- Single-turn structure constraint may not reflect real-world multi-turn instruction following
- Limited model diversity excludes potentially more capable proprietary models

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- Models show substantially lower accuracy under jumping prompt structures compared to linear ones
- Positional continuity significantly influences instruction-following performance
- Even reasoning-tuned models show only modest improvements under jumping prompts

Medium Confidence:
- Performance gap primarily due to structural rather than semantic factors
- Current LLMs internalize instruction following as sequential pattern continuation

Low Confidence:
- Findings will generalize to all non-linear instruction-following workflows
- Specific 72% performance drop represents universal ceiling

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Domain Replication: Replicate methodology using diverse content domains (medical instructions, software documentation, creative writing) to assess performance gap persistence
2. Multi-Turn Extension: Adapt framework to multi-turn instruction-following scenarios to measure whether structural sensitivity diminishes with conversational context
3. Proprietary Model Benchmarking: Test same prompt structures on leading proprietary LLMs to determine if commercial models exhibit similar structural dependencies
