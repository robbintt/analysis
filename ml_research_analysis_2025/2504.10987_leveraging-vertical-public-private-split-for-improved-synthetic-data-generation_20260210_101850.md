# Leveraging Vertical Public-Private Split for Improved Synthetic Data Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.10987
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10987
- **Reference count**: 16
- **Primary result**: Conditional generation consistently outperforms public-assisted methods in vertical private-public split synthetic data generation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of synthetic data generation under differential privacy when dealing with vertical public-private column splits. The authors adapt existing horizontal public-assisted methods (GEMPub, PMW, JAM-PGM) to the vertical setting and propose a conditional generation approach. Through experiments on Adult and Census-Income datasets, they demonstrate that while public-assisted methods struggle to outperform fully private AIM except when public columns exceed 50%, conditional generation consistently achieves superior utility across all privacy budgets. The work highlights fundamental limitations in leveraging public data for vertical splits and suggests future research directions focused on improving conditional methods.

## Method Summary
The paper tackles the vertical public-private partitioning problem where some dataset columns are public and others are private. The authors adapt horizontal public-assisted methods (GEMPub, PMW, JAM-PGM) to this vertical setting and introduce a conditional generation approach. Experiments were conducted on Adult and Census-Income datasets, comparing public-assisted methods against fully private AIM across varying privacy budgets. The conditional generation method leverages public columns during the generation process rather than training, showing consistent improvement over all other approaches.

## Key Results
- Public-assisted methods struggle to outperform fully private AIM except when public columns exceed 50%
- Conditional generation consistently achieves the best utility across all privacy budgets
- The performance gap between public-assisted methods and AIM remains substantial in most scenarios
- Public columns become more beneficial when they represent more than half of all columns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The conditional generation approach succeeds because it directly incorporates public column information during the generation phase, allowing the model to condition synthetic samples on available public data. This differs from public-assisted methods that attempt to leverage public information during training, which proves less effective in the vertical setting where most columns remain private. The method's success stems from its ability to make generation decisions based on available public context while maintaining differential privacy guarantees for private columns.

## Foundational Learning

**Differential Privacy**: A mathematical framework for quantifying privacy loss when releasing information about datasets. Needed to ensure synthetic data protects individual privacy while maintaining utility. Quick check: Verify privacy budget (epsilon) is properly bounded and satisfies formal privacy definitions.

**Vertical vs Horizontal Partitioning**: Vertical split means different features of same individuals are public/private; horizontal means different individuals are public/private. Needed to understand the specific challenge of leveraging cross-feature dependencies. Quick check: Confirm column-wise split matches the intended privacy-utility tradeoff.

**Public-Assisted Generation**: Techniques that leverage publicly available data to improve synthetic data quality. Needed to understand baseline approaches and their limitations. Quick check: Ensure public data is truly independent and doesn't compromise private information.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Public columns → Conditional generator → Private columns → DP-SGD training → Synthetic data

**Critical Path**: The conditional generation pipeline where public columns directly inform the generation of corresponding private columns, with differential privacy enforced through gradient clipping and noise addition during training.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Public-assisted methods vs conditional generation: Training-time leverage vs generation-time conditioning
- Privacy budget allocation: Higher budgets improve utility but reduce privacy guarantees
- Column selection: Which columns to make public affects overall performance

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor utility when public column ratio < 50%
- Degradation in utility metrics as privacy budget decreases
- Inconsistent performance across different privacy levels

**First Experiments**:
1. Vary public-private column ratios systematically below and above 50% threshold
2. Test conditional generation with different conditioning strategies (e.g., one-to-one vs many-to-one)
3. Evaluate utility across multiple metrics beyond detection rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper identifies several future research directions: improving conditional generation methods through better conditioning strategies and architectural enhancements, exploring how to effectively incorporate public data during training rather than just generation, and investigating hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of public-assisted and conditional methods. The authors also suggest examining the impact of different column selection strategies for the public-private split and extending the analysis to additional datasets and utility metrics.

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation to primarily detection rate as utility metric
- Theoretical analysis of why public-assisted methods fail in vertical setting remains incomplete
- Performance comparisons across different privacy budgets lack comprehensive evaluation
- Focus on only two benchmark datasets may limit generalizability

## Confidence

**High**: Conditional generation consistently outperforms alternatives across privacy budgets
**Medium**: Performance comparisons between specific public-assisted methods and AIM
**Low**: Theoretical explanation for why public-assisted methods fail in vertical setting

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate synthetic data quality using multiple utility metrics beyond detection rate, including statistical similarity measures and downstream task performance.

2. Conduct experiments with varying public-private column ratios beyond the 50% threshold to map the performance landscape more precisely.

3. Investigate alternative architectural modifications to public-assisted methods that could better leverage vertical public-private splits during training rather than only during generation.
