# StorySync: Training-Free Subject Consistency in Text-to-Image Generation via Region Harmonization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03735
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03735
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Training-free subject consistency method achieving 0.8735 CLIP-I and 0.8108 CLIP-T scores on SDXL

## Executive Summary
StorySync addresses the challenge of maintaining subject consistency across images in text-to-image diffusion models for visual storytelling. The paper introduces a training-free approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring fine-tuning. By combining masked cross-image attention sharing, regional feature harmonization, and base layout interpolation, StorySync enables consistent character appearance across multiple generated images while preserving prompt adherence and allowing pose diversity.

## Method Summary
The method introduces three key technical innovations to maintain subject consistency without training. First, masked cross-image attention sharing dynamically aligns subject features across images by sharing attention weights within the subject region. Second, regional feature harmonization refines subtle subject details through selective feature blending. Third, base layout interpolation maintains prompt adherence while enabling pose diversity through interpolated spatial layouts. The approach is model-agnostic and works with SDXL, Kandinsky 3, and FLUX.1-schnell, demonstrating strong performance across multiple diffusion architectures.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.8735 CLIP-I and 0.8108 CLIP-T scores on SDXL, outperforming training-free baselines
- Demonstrates strong qualitative results across multiple subject types and complex prompts
- Shows effective performance across SDXL, Kandinsky 3, and FLUX.1-schnell diffusion models
- Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of each technical component

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
StorySync works by creating a shared attention mechanism across images for the subject region, ensuring consistent feature representation. The regional harmonization step refines details by blending features from multiple views of the same subject, while layout interpolation preserves spatial relationships and prompt adherence. This combination allows the model to maintain subject identity while enabling creative variations in pose and scene composition.

## Foundational Learning
- Masked cross-image attention: Required for sharing subject features across generated images; quick check: verify attention weights are properly constrained to subject masks
- Regional feature harmonization: Needed to refine subtle subject details across different views; quick check: measure feature consistency before and after harmonization
- Base layout interpolation: Essential for maintaining prompt adherence while enabling pose diversity; quick check: validate interpolated layouts preserve key spatial relationships

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Subject Mask Extraction -> Masked Cross-Image Attention -> Regional Feature Harmonization -> Base Layout Interpolation -> Image Generation

Critical Path: The masked cross-image attention component is most critical as it establishes the foundation for subject consistency across images. Regional harmonization refines details, while layout interpolation ensures prompt adherence.

Design Tradeoffs: Training-free approach sacrifices some fine-grained control compared to fine-tuned models but gains model-agnostic flexibility. The reliance on accurate masks trades off ease of use for precision in subject consistency.

Failure Signatures: Poor mask extraction leads to inconsistent subject regions and broken attention sharing. Without proper harmonization, subtle details like facial features may vary across images. Incorrect layout interpolation can cause prompt deviation while maintaining subject consistency.

First Experiments: 1) Test masked attention sharing with synthetic masks to validate feature alignment, 2) Evaluate regional harmonization on controlled subject variations, 3) Validate layout interpolation maintains prompt adherence while enabling pose changes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dependency on accurate subject mask extraction, which is not quantified in the evaluation
- Potential misalignment in fine details when masks are imperfect or subjects have complex occlusions
- Limited evaluation of robustness across diverse real-world scenarios with varying lighting and backgrounds

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core technical innovations are well-described and produce measurable improvements in subject consistency metrics.

**Medium confidence**: Quantitative superiority over baselines is demonstrated, but real-world robustness across diverse conditions needs validation.

**Medium confidence**: Model-agnostic claims are supported by testing on three models, though deeper architectural analysis would strengthen this.

## Next Checks

1. Systematically evaluate mask quality requirements by testing with artificially degraded masks and quantifying performance degradation
2. Conduct user studies comparing StorySync against baselines on real-world visual storytelling tasks with diverse subjects and complex scenes
3. Test the method's consistency maintenance across longer narrative sequences (5+ images) to assess temporal stability
