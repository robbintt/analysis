# Enhancing Explainability of Graph Neural Networks Through Conceptual and Structural Analyses and Their Extensions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08344
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08344
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Develops a novel XAI framework for GNNs using specialized learners and concept-based explanations, validated through comprehensive experiments.

## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses the interpretability challenge of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by proposing a novel Explainable AI (XAI) framework. The framework employs specialized learners to capture specific graph interactions and generates explanations based on frequently occurring substructures ("concepts") within training graphs. By integrating Earth Mover Distance optimal transport for structure similarity measurement, the approach enhances both predictive performance and user comprehension. The work contributes a comprehensive method for providing compact, user-centric insights into GNN decision-making processes, supporting model debugging, debiasing, and improvement.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework combines specialized learners with concept discovery to create interpretable GNN explanations. The approach trains multiple specialized learners to capture different aspects of graph interactions, such as feature processing and message passing. Explanations are generated by identifying frequently occurring substructures (concepts) within training graphs. Earth Mover Distance optimal transport is employed to efficiently measure structure similarity between graphs. This combination allows the framework to provide both accurate predictions and comprehensible explanations that highlight the key structural elements influencing model decisions.

## Key Results
- Framework successfully identifies meaningful graph concepts through frequent substructure analysis
- Earth Mover Distance optimal transport provides efficient structure similarity measurement
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness in providing compact, user-centric insights
- Approach supports model debugging, debiasing, and improvement through interpretable explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing complex graph reasoning into specialized components that can be individually analyzed and explained. By focusing on frequently occurring substructures as concepts, the method captures the most relevant patterns that influence model decisions. The Earth Mover Distance optimal transport enables efficient comparison of graph structures, allowing the system to identify similar patterns across different graphs. This combination of specialized learning, concept identification, and efficient structure comparison creates a powerful mechanism for generating both accurate predictions and interpretable explanations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Preprocessing -> Specialized Learners -> Concept Discovery -> Structure Similarity (EMD) -> Explanation Generation -> Human-in-the-loop Verification

**Critical Path:** The framework's critical path follows: raw graph data → specialized learner training → concept extraction → structure similarity computation → explanation generation → user verification. Each component builds upon the previous one, with the human verification loop providing feedback to improve concept discovery and explanation quality.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach balances explanation fidelity with computational efficiency by using Earth Mover Distance instead of more computationally expensive graph matching algorithms. The concept-based approach trades off completeness for interpretability by focusing on frequently occurring patterns rather than all possible substructures.

**Failure Signatures:** The framework may fail when: concepts don't align with meaningful domain patterns, Earth Mover Distance becomes computationally prohibitive for very large graphs, or user feedback introduces bias that degrades model performance. Explanation quality may suffer when the underlying graph structures are too heterogeneous or when specialized learners fail to capture important interactions.

**3 First Experiments:** 1) Test concept discovery on synthetic BA-motif datasets with known ground truth patterns. 2) Evaluate Earth Mover Distance efficiency on increasingly large graph datasets. 3) Conduct user study with ML-savvy participants to validate explanation comprehensibility and utility.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the explainability framework be effectively integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide natural language explanations that are both faithful to the GNN's decision process and genuinely comprehensible to diverse user groups?
- Basis in paper: Chapter 6, Section 6.3, discusses "Complex Reasoning with GNN-Empowered LLMs" as a major future direction, noting strategies like hard/soft prompting but stating that "a potential approach... aims to enable flexible and accurate querying... [yet] directly applying them [LLMs] to complex graph structures is challenging."
- Why unresolved: The dissertation concludes by proposing integration with LLMs for "nuanced explanations tailored to specific customer inquiries" (6.2.2) and as a "controller" for graph reasoning (6.3.3), but does not implement or evaluate this integration. The core challenge of bridging structured graph reasoning with unstructured, human-centric natural language generation remains open.
- What evidence would resolve it: A prototype system demonstrating a GNN-LLM pipeline where a user can query a graph prediction in natural language and receive an explanation that correctly cites structural concepts from the GNN (as defined in Chapter 4), validated through a user study comparing comprehension and trust with and without the LLM layer.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the human-in-the-loop verification process, as implemented in the HVG framework (Chapter 5), be scaled to non-expert users and complex real-world graphs without introducing overwhelming cognitive load or bias amplification?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] from limitations and ethical discussions. Section 5.5 states: "malevolent entities can exploit the system, steering users towards detrimental or erroneous choices... feedback loops could amplify biases." Section 4.5.7 notes that "competitive nature of the study may introduce biases" and "participants may not represent a diverse cross-section."
- Why unresolved: The user studies (Chapters 4 & 5) are conducted as small, incentivized competitions with ML-savvy participants, which the author acknowledges may not represent a broader user base. The scalability and robustness of the interactive verification loop to noisy, non-expert feedback on large, complex graphs (e.g., social networks) is not tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study with a larger, more diverse participant pool (e.g., domain experts from different fields, end-users) interacting with the HVG system on a complex graph dataset, measuring verification accuracy, user fatigue, and stability of model performance under noisy or conflicting feedback over multiple sessions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the concept discovery module (Chapter 4) consistently yield concepts that align with established domain knowledge across different graph datasets and architectures, and how can this alignment be formally measured?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] from the motivation and evaluation method. The paper states the goal is to "incorporate domain knowledge to guide GNNs toward more human-understandable representations" (Abstract, p.4). The evaluation relies on synthetic ground truth (e.g., BA-motifs) and user studies (Section 4.5.6), but lacks a systematic, quantitative method to validate that discovered concepts correspond to meaningful domain-specific patterns in real-world datasets.
- Why unresolved: The author notes that "interpretable components may exhibit subpar performance... leading to unreliable explanations" (p.18) and that similarity-based methods' "generalizability to other datasets remains questionable" (p.18). The link between automatically discovered concepts and semantically valid domain concepts is assumed but not rigorously validated across domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: A case study on a domain-specific graph dataset (e.g., molecular chemistry, where expert-defined functional groups are known), comparing discovered concepts against ground-truth domain patterns using a formal alignment metric (e.g., Jaccard index on subgraph match) and conducting an expert evaluation to rate the semantic relevance of each discovered concept.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can the framework systematically detect and mitigate the trade-off between model accuracy and explanation faithfulness, particularly for minority classes or underrepresented graph structures within a dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] from the accuracy vs. interpretability trade-off discussion (Figure 2.1) and the fairness considerations (Section 5.5). The author mentions: "If certain groups are underrepresented in either training data or chosen representative samples, the system's performance could degrade for these groups, leading to possibly discriminatory outcomes."
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on overall accuracy and user comprehension for balanced or synthetic datasets. The framework's tendency to sacrifice explanation quality or predictive performance for rare but important graph subtypes—critical for fairness in applications like fraud detection (Section 6.2.4)—is not analyzed.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study on datasets with controlled class imbalance (e.g., a modified Twitter dataset with rare but distinct subgraph motifs), measuring per-class explanation precision/recall and prediction accuracy. Resolution would involve demonstrating a mechanism (e.g., adaptive loss weighting, minority-concept augmentation) that maintains both prediction accuracy and explanation quality for minority classes.

## Limitations
- The reliance on frequently occurring substructures as concepts may not capture rare but important patterns in graph data
- Earth Mover Distance optimal transport may become computationally prohibitive for very large-scale graphs
- The framework's emphasis on user-centric insights introduces subjectivity in what constitutes a "compact" or "meaningful" explanation
- Claims about model debugging and debiasing are theoretical without empirical validation in real-world scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core methodology of using specialized learners and Earth Mover Distance for structure similarity is well-defined and experimentally supported.

**Medium Confidence:** The framework's ability to provide "compact, user-centric insights" is demonstrated but lacks rigorous user studies to validate its practical utility.

**Low Confidence:** Claims about model debugging, debiasing, and improvement are speculative and require further empirical evidence.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Testing:** Evaluate the framework's performance on large-scale graphs (e.g., social networks or biological networks) to assess the efficiency of Earth Mover Distance optimal transport.

2. **Domain Generalization:** Test the framework across diverse graph domains (e.g., molecular graphs, citation networks) to verify the universality of "concepts" as meaningful explanations.

3. **User Study:** Conduct a user study to validate the practical utility of the framework's explanations, focusing on whether they are truly "compact" and "user-centric" in real-world applications.
