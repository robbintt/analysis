# Global Convergence Analysis of Vanilla Gradient Descent for Asymmetric Matrix Completion

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.09685
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09685
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Key outcome**: Vanilla gradient descent with spectral initialization achieves linear convergence for asymmetric matrix completion without regularization

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of vanilla gradient descent (VGD) for asymmetric low-rank matrix completion, demonstrating that VGD can achieve linear convergence rates without the need for regularization terms commonly used in previous approaches. The authors show that VGD exhibits implicit regularization properties, where the balancing term remains small during iterations, enabling convergence. Through rigorous mathematical analysis using leave-one-out techniques and mathematical induction, the paper proves that VGD converges linearly when sampling probability and step size satisfy certain conditions. Empirical results indicate that VGD offers lower computational costs compared to regularized gradient descent variants while maintaining comparable completion performance.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze vanilla gradient descent for asymmetric matrix completion by proving that the algorithm converges linearly under specific conditions. The approach uses spectral initialization to start the optimization process and applies leave-one-out analysis techniques combined with mathematical induction to establish convergence guarantees. The key theoretical insight is that VGD implicitly regularizes the solution by keeping the balancing term small throughout iterations, eliminating the need for explicit regularization terms. The analysis focuses on scenarios where the sampling probability and step size are chosen appropriately to ensure convergence with high probability.

## Key Results
- VGD with spectral initialization achieves linear convergence rates without regularization terms
- Implicit regularization property keeps balancing term small during iterations
- Lower computational cost compared to regularized gradient descent while maintaining performance
- Theoretical guarantees hold when sampling probability and step size satisfy specific conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of vanilla gradient descent in asymmetric matrix completion stems from its implicit regularization properties. During iterations, the balancing term that typically requires explicit regularization remains naturally small, allowing the algorithm to converge without additional constraints. The spectral initialization provides a good starting point close to the optimal solution, while the leave-one-out analysis framework enables rigorous tracking of error propagation throughout the optimization process. This combination allows VGD to navigate the non-convex landscape effectively and achieve linear convergence under appropriate sampling and step size conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Leave-one-out analysis**: A technique for tracking error propagation by analyzing the effect of removing individual data points; needed to establish rigorous convergence guarantees; quick check: verify that error bounds remain stable when perturbing individual samples
- **Spectral initialization**: Method of initializing optimization using eigenvectors of data matrices; needed to start close to optimal solution; quick check: confirm initialization error is bounded by problem parameters
- **Implicit regularization**: Phenomenon where optimization algorithms naturally converge to solutions with desired properties without explicit constraints; needed to explain VGD's success without regularization; quick check: monitor balancing term size during iterations
- **Incoherence structure**: Property of matrices where singular vectors are not aligned with standard basis vectors; needed for theoretical guarantees; quick check: verify incoherence constants are within theoretical bounds
- **Linear convergence rate**: Error decreases exponentially fast during optimization; needed to quantify algorithm efficiency; quick check: plot log(error) vs iteration to verify linear relationship
- **Sampling probability conditions**: Requirements on how often matrix entries are observed; needed to ensure sufficient information for recovery; quick check: verify sampling rate exceeds theoretical threshold

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
VGD -> Spectral Initialization -> Leave-One-Out Analysis -> Convergence Proof -> Performance Evaluation

### Critical Path
1. Matrix sampling and initialization
2. Gradient descent iterations with error tracking
3. Leave-one-out analysis for error bounds
4. Mathematical induction for convergence proof
5. Empirical validation on test problems

### Design Tradeoffs
The choice between VGD and regularized methods involves computational efficiency versus robustness. VGD eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning of regularization parameters but requires stricter conditions on sampling probability and step size. The spectral initialization provides faster convergence than random initialization but may be computationally expensive for very large matrices. The leave-one-out analysis offers rigorous theoretical guarantees but relies on simplifying assumptions about noise structure.

### Failure Signatures
Convergence may fail if sampling probability falls below theoretical thresholds, leading to insufficient information for matrix completion. Large step sizes can cause divergence, while small step sizes result in slow convergence. Poor spectral initialization may trap the algorithm in suboptimal local minima. Violations of incoherence assumptions can invalidate theoretical guarantees.

### First Experiments
1. Test VGD convergence on matrices with varying incoherence levels to assess theoretical assumptions
2. Compare computational time and memory usage between VGD and regularized gradient descent variants
3. Evaluate performance under different noise models to test robustness beyond theoretical assumptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Convergence depends on specific conditions for sampling probability and step size that may not hold in practice
- Theoretical guarantees assume a particular incoherence structure that may not be satisfied by all real-world matrices
- Leave-one-out analysis makes simplifying assumptions about noise structure that may not capture all practical scenarios
- Empirical results lack extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets

## Confidence

**High confidence**:
- Linear convergence rate under stated conditions
- Implicit regularization property of VGD
- Spectral initialization approach effectiveness

**Medium confidence**:
- Leave-one-out analysis framework validity
- Specific threshold values for sampling probability and step size

**Low confidence**:
- Generalizability to matrices with different incoherence structures
- Performance in practical scenarios without comprehensive empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Test the algorithm on matrices with varying incoherence levels to determine the practical limits of the theoretical guarantees.

2. Conduct extensive empirical comparisons with both regularized and non-regularized matrix completion methods across multiple datasets to validate computational efficiency claims.

3. Investigate the algorithm's performance under different noise models beyond the assumptions made in the theoretical analysis.
