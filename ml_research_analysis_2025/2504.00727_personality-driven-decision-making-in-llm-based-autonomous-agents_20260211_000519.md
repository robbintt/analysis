core_contribution: This study introduces a method to quantitatively measure how induced
  personality traits affect decision-making in LLM-based autonomous agents, specifically
  regarding task selection, scheduling, and planning. By leveraging the Five-Factor
  OCEAN personality model and applying it to agents through prompt engineering, the
  research demonstrates that induced personality traits lead to significant differences
  in task prioritisation across multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-Mini, and GPT-3.5-Turbo).

# Personality-Driven Decision-Making in LLM-Based Autonomous Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.00727
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00727
- Authors: Lewis Newsham; Daniel Prince
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Personality traits significantly affect task prioritization in LLM-based autonomous agents, with Conscientiousness and Extraversion showing the strongest effects.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a method to quantitatively measure how induced personality traits affect decision-making in LLM-based autonomous agents. By leveraging the Five-Factor OCEAN personality model through prompt engineering, the research demonstrates that personality traits lead to significant differences in task prioritisation across multiple models. The findings provide empirical evidence that large-scale pre-trained language models can exhibit personality traits and that these traits meaningfully influence autonomous decision-making behaviours.

## Method Summary
The study uses zero-shot prompt engineering to induce OCEAN personality traits in LLM-based autonomous agents. Agents iteratively select tasks from pre-generated daily schedules, with personality prompts preceding each decision cycle. The method tracks position changes of specific tasks (movement deltas) and applies sequence similarity metrics to quantify personality-driven deviations from baseline schedules. Statistical analysis using Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction validates the significance of observed differences across 500 schedules per condition.

## Key Results
- Conscientiousness-positive agents significantly prioritize work-related tasks, while negative induction deprioritizes them
- Extraversion-positive agents prioritize social and collaborative tasks, with negative induction favoring solitary activities
- GPT-4o and GPT-4o-Mini show strong personality effects (p ≤ 0.001), while GPT-3.5-Turbo shows weaker but still significant effects in 41/50 conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Prompt-Based Personality Induction via OCEAN Schema
The prompt primes the LLM's attention toward personality-consistent patterns encoded in its pre-training corpus. By presenting the personality statement first in each decision-cycle, the trait context dominates subsequent reasoning about task prioritization without explicit instructions about which tasks to favor.

### Mechanism 2: Movement Delta as Behavioral Alignment Signal
By tracking position changes of specific tasks (e.g., "Work" for Conscientiousness), the method isolates whether induced traits produce expected directional shifts. Conscientiousness-positive agents move work tasks earlier (negative μ), while Conscientiousness-negative agents delay them (positive μ).

### Mechanism 3: Sequence Transformation Metrics Capture Global Personality Effects
Population-level differences in sequence similarity metrics between personality-induced and baseline conditions provide statistical evidence that personality induction systematically alters decision-making, beyond individual task movements.

## Foundational Learning

- **OCEAN Five-Factor Model:** The entire induction schema depends on mapping trait descriptors to behavioral expectations. Understanding that Conscientiousness implies diligence and Extraversion implies sociability is essential for interpreting results.
  - *Quick check:* Given a prompt inducing high Neuroticism, would you expect an agent to prioritize or deprioritize "Reflective Time"? Why?

- **Zero-Shot Prompting:** The method relies on zero-shot personality induction—no examples of trait-consistent behavior are provided. Understanding zero-shot limitations helps set expectations for effect sizes.
  - *Quick check:* If you added few-shot examples showing Conscientiousness-consistent task selections, would you expect stronger or weaker generalization to novel schedules?

- **Sequence Similarity Metrics:** Interpreting results requires knowing what LCSS, Levenshtein distance, and Hamming distance measure. LCSS captures longest consecutive matches; Levenshtein counts edits; Hamming counts position-wise mismatches.
  - *Quick check:* If an agent completes all tasks but in reverse order, which metric would show maximum disruption: LCSS, Levenshtein, or Hamming?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Schedule Generator -> Personality Prompt Assembler -> Decision-Cycle Engine -> Transformation Analyzer -> Statistical Comparator
- **Critical path:** Schedule generation → Personality induction per run → Decision-cycle execution → Sequence output → Metric computation → Population aggregation → Statistical testing
- **Design tradeoffs:** Fixed schedules isolate personality effects but limit ecological validity; zero-shot avoids example curation but may produce weaker effects; model selection balances capability against cost
- **Failure signatures:** No significant difference from baseline suggests temperature issues or prompt mis-specification; trait-opposite behavior indicates schema mapping errors; high variance suggests temperature or sample size problems
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce baseline temperature sweep to validate implementation
  2. Focus on Conscientiousness-positive vs. negative with manual inspection of top-5 tasks
  3. Run identical Conscientiousness conditions on two different models to test generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the text provided.

## Limitations
- Task-to-trait mappings are intuitive but not empirically validated, raising questions about construct validity
- Model capability differences suggest personality expression may depend on model capacity, but the mechanism remains unclear
- The study cannot definitively isolate whether observed behaviors stem from pre-trained personality representations versus emergent pattern matching

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Statistical methodology and movement delta analysis are robust
- **Medium Confidence:** Zero-shot personality induction mechanism works but exact contributions uncertain
- **Low Confidence:** Ecological validity of synthetic schedules and generalizability to real-world contexts

## Next Checks
1. Manually annotate task categories and verify movement deltas align with expected trait domains beyond provided examples
2. Systematically remove either naive descriptor or trait keywords from prompts to quantify relative contributions
3. Apply methodology to actual calendar data from human participants and compare against human trait-consistent behaviors
