# Teaching Physical Awareness to LLMs through Sounds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08524
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08524
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework achieving strong performance across five acoustic physics tasks through physics-based simulation and sound processing

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ACORN, a framework that teaches large language models physical awareness through sound by leveraging a physics-based channel simulator to generate diverse training data, an audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information, and the AQA-PHY dataset containing 1 million <Audio, Question, Answer> tuples. The framework enables LLMs to understand fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath effect, and spatial relationships. When evaluated across five tasks (LOS detection, Doppler estimation, DoA estimation, multipath analysis, and range estimation), the models achieved strong performance: 0.924 accuracy in LOS detection, 0.181 MAE in Doppler estimation, 0.907 MAE in DoA estimation, 0.903 accuracy in multipath analysis, and 1.599 relative error percentage in range estimation, demonstrating the feasibility of teaching LLMs physical awareness through sound.

## Method Summary
The ACORN framework combines a physics-based channel simulator that generates synthetic audio data capturing various physical phenomena, an audio encoder that extracts both magnitude and phase information from sound signals, and a carefully curated dataset (AQA-PHY) containing 1 million <Audio, Question, Answer> tuples. The framework processes audio through the encoder to extract relevant features, then feeds these into LLMs for reasoning about physical phenomena. The training data covers scenarios including line-of-sight detection, Doppler shifts, direction of arrival estimation, multipath effects, and range estimation. By training on this comprehensive dataset, LLMs learn to associate audio patterns with physical properties and relationships.

## Key Results
- Achieved 0.924 accuracy in LOS detection task
- Obtained 0.181 MAE in Doppler estimation task
- Reached 0.903 accuracy in multipath analysis task
- Attained 0.907 MAE in DoA estimation task
- Recorded 1.599 relative error percentage in range estimation task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by providing LLMs with structured physical knowledge through audio patterns. The physics-based simulator creates realistic acoustic scenarios that capture fundamental physical relationships, while the dual-phase and magnitude audio encoder preserves both spectral content and temporal information crucial for physical inference. The carefully curated question-answer pairs guide the model to focus on relevant physical features rather than spurious correlations. By training on diverse scenarios with explicit physical relationships, the model learns to map audio patterns to underlying physical phenomena rather than memorizing specific audio examples.

## Foundational Learning
- **Acoustic Signal Processing**: Understanding how sound waves propagate and interact with environments is essential for extracting meaningful features from audio data
  - Why needed: Physical phenomena manifest through specific acoustic signatures
  - Quick check: Can the encoder distinguish between direct and reflected signals?

- **Physical Wave Phenomena**: Knowledge of Doppler effect, multipath propagation, and spatial acoustics enables proper interpretation of audio features
  - Why needed: These phenomena create predictable patterns in audio that indicate physical properties
  - Quick check: Does the model correctly identify frequency shifts from moving sources?

- **Physics-Based Simulation**: Generating synthetic data that accurately represents real-world acoustic scenarios
  - Why needed: Provides diverse training data covering edge cases and rare phenomena
  - Quick check: Do simulated audio samples match real-world recordings in key physical properties?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Physics Simulator -> Audio Encoder (Magnitude + Phase) -> LLM Reasoning -> Physical Inference

**Critical Path:**
The audio encoder is the critical component, as it must accurately extract features that correlate with physical properties. Poor feature extraction directly degrades all downstream reasoning tasks, making it the primary bottleneck for system performance.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades computational complexity for physical accuracy by using a sophisticated physics simulator and dual-phase audio encoding. This increases training time and model complexity but enables more precise physical reasoning compared to simpler spectrogram-based approaches.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Systematic errors in Doppler estimation when source velocity exceeds certain thresholds
- Reduced accuracy in multipath analysis under high reverberation conditions
- Performance degradation in range estimation with low signal-to-noise ratios
- Confusion between similar acoustic patterns from different physical sources

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Evaluate LOS detection accuracy across varying distances and environmental conditions
2. Test Doppler estimation precision with controlled velocity changes
3. Assess DoA estimation performance with multiple simultaneous sound sources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily conducted in simulated environments, potentially limiting real-world applicability
- Performance on real-world audio data remains unverified, raising domain adaptation concerns
- 1 million synthetic samples may not comprehensively represent all possible physical scenarios and edge cases

## Confidence
- High confidence: LOS detection (0.924 accuracy) and multipath analysis (0.903 accuracy) results
- Medium confidence: Doppler estimation (0.181 MAE) and DoA estimation (0.907 MAE) results
- Medium confidence: Range estimation (1.599 relative error percentage)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct real-world experiments with physical speakers and microphones to validate whether ACORN-trained models maintain performance when transitioning from simulated to actual acoustic environments, particularly for range and Doppler estimation tasks

2. Perform ablation studies on the audio encoder architecture to determine whether the dual-phase and magnitude processing provides significant advantages over simpler spectrogram-based approaches, and test robustness across different audio quality levels

3. Test model generalization by evaluating on acoustic phenomena not present in the training data, such as reverberant environments, background noise interference, and non-linear propagation effects, to assess true physical understanding versus pattern matching
