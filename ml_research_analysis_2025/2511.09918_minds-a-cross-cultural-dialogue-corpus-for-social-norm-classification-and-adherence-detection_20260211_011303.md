# MINDS: A Cross-cultural Dialogue Corpus for Social Norm Classification and Adherence Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09918
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09918
- Reference count: 11
- Introduces Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework for detecting and classifying social norms in multilingual dialogues, achieving 4-21% performance improvements over baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MINDS, a cross-cultural dialogue corpus for social norm classification and adherence detection. The corpus contains 31 bilingual conversations in Mandarin-English and Spanish-English pairs, annotated for norm type and adherence/violation status. The authors develop Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that combines structured attribute extraction (intent, framing, linguistic features, and contextual constraints) with semantic retrieval and re-ranking of normative knowledge. The framework demonstrates consistent performance improvements over baseline language models across multiple evaluation metrics, showcasing enhanced cultural adaptability and generalizability in socially intelligent dialogue systems.

## Method Summary
The authors developed Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework for detecting and classifying social norms in multilingual, multi-turn dialogues. The system extracts structured attributes including intent, framing, linguistic features, and contextual constraints, then performs semantic retrieval and re-ranking of normative knowledge from a knowledge base. The framework is evaluated on MINDS, a newly released bilingual dataset containing 31 Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations annotated for norm type and adherence/violation status. The approach combines rule-based attribute extraction with semantic retrieval to provide nuanced norm detection across cultural contexts.

## Key Results
- Norm-RAG consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in norm classification and adherence detection
- Performance improvements range from 4% to 21% across different models
- Framework demonstrates enhanced cultural adaptability and generalizability in socially intelligent dialogue systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by combining structured attribute extraction with semantic retrieval, allowing it to capture both explicit normative patterns and contextual nuances. By incorporating multiple linguistic and cultural dimensions (intent, framing, linguistic features, and contextual constraints), the system can better handle the complexity and variability of social norms across different cultural contexts. The retrieval-augmented approach enables access to relevant normative knowledge while the structured extraction ensures systematic analysis of dialogue features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-cultural norm detection**: Understanding how social norms vary across cultures is essential for developing socially intelligent dialogue systems. Quick check: Can the system distinguish between politeness norms in Mandarin versus English contexts?
- **Retrieval-augmented generation**: Combining structured knowledge retrieval with generation models improves accuracy for complex reasoning tasks. Quick check: Does the retrieval component improve performance on ambiguous normative scenarios?
- **Multilingual dialogue processing**: Handling multiple languages requires understanding both linguistic differences and cultural context. Quick check: Can the system process code-switching between languages within single conversations?
- **Social norm annotation**: Developing reliable annotation schemas for subjective concepts like norm adherence requires careful protocol design. Quick check: Do inter-annotator agreements support the reliability of the annotation scheme?
- **Attribute-based feature extraction**: Breaking down complex social phenomena into extractable attributes enables systematic analysis. Quick check: Which attributes contribute most significantly to norm classification accuracy?
- **Semantic re-ranking**: Re-ranking retrieved results based on context improves the relevance of normative knowledge. Quick check: How does re-ranking affect performance compared to simple retrieval?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Dialogue input -> Attribute extraction (intent, framing, linguistic features, constraints) -> Semantic retrieval -> Re-ranking -> Norm classification/adherence detection

**Critical Path:** The most critical path flows from dialogue input through structured attribute extraction to semantic retrieval and re-ranking, as these components work together to capture both explicit and contextual normative information.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational complexity for improved accuracy by combining multiple processing components. While this increases inference time compared to simple LLM approaches, it provides more reliable norm detection across cultural contexts.

**Failure Signatures:** The system may struggle with highly novel cultural contexts not represented in the knowledge base, or with subtle normative violations that require deep cultural understanding. Performance may degrade when attribute extraction fails to capture relevant contextual information.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Evaluate attribute extraction accuracy independently to identify which components most affect overall performance
2. Test retrieval performance with and without re-ranking to quantify the contribution of the re-ranking component
3. Compare performance on code-switching versus monolingual dialogue segments to assess multilingual handling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on three language pairs (Mandarin-English, Spanish-English, and English), limiting generalizability to other languages
- Annotation relies on native speaker judgments that may reflect subjective interpretations of social norms
- Study focuses on controlled dialogue scenarios without extensive real-world deployment testing

## Confidence
**High:** Technical improvements of Norm-RAG over baseline models, demonstrated by consistent performance gains across multiple metrics
**Medium:** Cultural adaptability claims, as evaluation covers limited cultural contexts and does not fully explore performance in languages beyond the three represented
**Medium:** Practical deployment implications, as the study focuses on controlled scenarios without extensive real-world testing

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Norm-RAG's performance on additional language pairs and cultural contexts beyond Mandarin, Spanish, and English to assess true cross-cultural generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of each framework component (intent extraction, framing analysis, linguistic features, and retrieval-augmented reasoning)
3. Test the framework's robustness to norm violations in adversarial or intentionally challenging dialogue scenarios to assess real-world deployment readiness
