# The Gaining Paths to Investment Success: Information-Driven LLM Graph Reasoning for Venture Capital Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23489
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23489
- Authors: Haoyu Pei; Zhongyang Liu; Xiangyi Xiao; Xiaocong Du; Suting Hong; Kunpeng Zhang; Haipeng Zhang
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: +5.0% F1 and +16.6% Precision@5 over state-of-the-art baselines on real-world VC data

## Executive Summary
MIRAGE-VC introduces an information-gain-driven path retriever and multi-agent architecture to predict startup success in venture capital. The framework iteratively selects high-value investment paths from complex networks, then integrates heterogeneous evidence streams through specialized analysts and a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable reasoning for each prediction.

## Method Summary
The method combines graph-based reasoning with large language models to predict startup success. A path selector trained on information gain labels retrieves compact investment chains from the network. Three specialized LLM agents analyze peer companies, investor profiles, and investment paths respectively. A learnable gating network dynamically weights these evidence streams based on company attributes, with a manager agent providing final predictions and interpretability.

## Key Results
- Achieves +5.0% F1 improvement over state-of-the-art baselines
- Reaches +16.6% Precision@5 on real-world VC dataset
- Demonstrates superior interpretability through step-by-step reasoning paths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information-Gain-Driven Path Selection
Iteratively selecting graph neighbors that maximize predictive information gain yields more informative paths than embedding-similarity or random selection. The selector scores candidate neighbors using a lightweight MLP trained to approximate LLM-measured information gain, producing compact chains (typically 2–4 paths at depth 3–5) that preserve task-relevant structure while eliminating noisy edges.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Perspective Evidence Decomposition
Decomposing VC prediction into three specialized analyst roles—peer-company comparison, investor-profile assessment, and investment-chain reasoning—captures complementary signals that a monolithic RAG system conflates or overlooks. Three frozen GPT-3.5-Turbo agents receive distinct prompts and output binary predictions plus free-form rationale, ensuring evidence differences drive output divergence.

### Mechanism 3: Attribute-Conditioned Dynamic Gating
Instance-specific weighting of evidence streams based on company attributes (industry, stage, region) outperforms fixed or uniform weighting. A two-layer MLP takes [rationale embedding || company attribute vector] and produces softmax weights over the three agents, trained end-to-end on the success prediction objective.

## Foundational Learning

- **Information Gain for Feature Selection**
  - Why needed here: The path selector operationalizes IG to rank graph neighbors by marginal utility to prediction accuracy. Without understanding IG as H(Y) – H(Y|A), the training objective (Eq. 2–6) is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given baseline prediction entropy H(Y|S^(h)) and candidate-extended entropy H(Y|S^(h)_v), which neighbor should be selected?

- **Listwise Learning-to-Rank**
  - Why needed here: The selector is trained via listwise KL divergence (Eq. 6) against oracle gain distributions, not pairwise or pointwise losses. This preserves within-group ranking structure.
  - Quick check question: Why might listwise loss outperform pairwise hinge loss when multiple candidates have similar but non-identical gains?

- **Gating Networks in Multi-Modal Fusion**
  - Why needed here: The attribute-conditioned gate (Eq. 8–11) is a learned soft selection mechanism over evidence streams. Understanding how softmax weights interact with downstream classification loss clarifies why this outperforms fixed heuristics.
  - Quick check question: If all three agents produce identical predictions, what will the gating network learn, and how might this affect generalization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Graph Retrieval: Path selector (2-layer MLP, 2304-dim input) → top-P paths at depth ≤d_max
  2. Text Retrieval: Sentence-BERT encoder → top-K peer companies + lead-investor profile (top-N entries)
  3. Multi-Agent Analysis: 3× GPT-3.5-Turbo calls (frozen) → binary verdict + rationale per agent
  4. Dynamic Fusion: Gating network (2-layer MLP, 384+14-dim input) → weights + classifier → probability
  5. Manager Agent: 1× GPT-3.5-Turbo call → final verdict + interpretive rationale

- **Critical path:**
  Offline: Annotate gain labels with Llama-3.1-8B → train path selector (5 min on RTX 4090) → train gating network (10 min).
  Inference: Retrieve paths (selector inference) → retrieve text (encoder similarity) → 3 agent calls → gate scoring → manager call. ~7.8s wall-clock, ~18.8K tokens per prediction.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Path count P vs. depth d_max: (P=2, d_max=4) optimal; more paths add noise, deeper paths increase latency and retrieval cost (Appendix A.2).
  - Frozen vs. fine-tuned LLM backbone: Frozen ensures anti-leakage (GPT-3.5 cutoff Sep 2021); fine-tuning on newer backbones (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen-3) shows +11–14% F1 gains but risks pretrain-test overlap (Appendix A.3).
  - Gating vs. manager-only fusion: Gating adds ~0.6–1.4% F1 over single-agent or fixed-weight baselines but requires training data and attribute engineering.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Shallow retrieved paths (≤2 hops): Correct predictions average 4.44 hops depth vs. 3.31 for errors (Appendix A.5); shallow paths indicate sparse network context.
  - Near-uniform gating weights: Suggests redundant agent outputs or uninformative attributes.
  - High-recall/low-precision on validation: Indicates over-reliance on noisy neighborhood aggregation (common in GNN baselines); check if path selector is effectively filtering.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity-check path selector**: On a held-out validation set, measure Hit@1 and NDCG@1 against oracle gain labels. Confirm >60% NDCG@1 (Table 6 baseline: 63.4%).
  2. **Ablate single evidence stream**: Remove each agent in turn and measure F1 drop. Expect ~1–3% degradation per agent (Table 2); larger drops indicate that stream is carrying disproportionate signal.
  3. **Hyperparameter sweep on (P, d_max, K, N)**: Run 5× inference per setting on 1K-sample validation subset. Target: identify plateau region where F1 stabilizes (Appendix A.2 shows plateau near P=2–3, d_max=3–5, K=4, N=5).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Path-selection mechanism depends on approximate information-gain labels from Llama-3.1-8B, with no guarantee that greedy choices approximate globally optimal subgraphs
- Multi-agent architecture assumes distinct evidence streams; high correlation between streams may cause gating network to overfit to superficial patterns
- Generalizability to other domains (e.g., M&A prediction) is untested and may degrade with sparser networks

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Information-gain-driven path retrieval improves over random and embedding-similarity baselines (+0.1851 NDCG@1); multi-agent decomposition captures complementary signals (1.4–3.3% F1 drop when any agent removed); attribute-conditioned gating outperforms fixed weighting (23.15% vs. 19.98% Precision)
- **Medium Confidence**: Path retrieval depth correlates with prediction quality, but causality is not established; fine-tuning on newer LLM backbones boosts F1 by 11–14% but risks pretrain-test overlap
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to other domains is untested; performance may degrade if investment networks are sparser or less structured than the tested dataset

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation of Path Redundancy**: On a validation subset, measure pairwise cosine similarity between retrieved paths. If >70% of paths share >0.8 similarity, test whether the selector is filtering meaningfully or merely selecting from a redundant pool. Expect: High redundancy degrades selector utility.

2. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Apply MIRAGE-VC to a non-VC relational prediction task (e.g., predicting M&A success using acquirer-target networks). Measure performance drop vs. in-domain VC setting. Expect: Performance drops >10% F1 indicate domain-specific reliance on investment-network structure.

3. **Oracling the Gating Network**: Replace the learned gating with oracle weights that select the best-performing agent per instance (using a held-out oracle). Measure maximum achievable F1 gain. If gain <1%, the gating network is near-optimal; if gain >3%, current gating underfits or overfits to attributes.
