# ParkGaussian: Surround-view 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Parking
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01386
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01386
- Reference count: 12
- Introduces ParkGaussian, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for autonomous parking scene reconstruction with novel view synthesis and parking slot detection.

## Executive Summary
ParkGaussian is a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework tailored for autonomous parking scene reconstruction. It addresses the challenges of modeling complex spatial geometry in underground parking environments, which lack GPS signals and suffer from poor lighting and repetitive textures. The authors curate ParkRecon3D, the first benchmark dataset for parking scene reconstruction, and adapt 3D Gaussian Splatting to surround-view fisheye cameras using an unscented-transform projection. ParkGaussian incorporates a differentiable Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) layer and a slot-aware reconstruction strategy to improve downstream perception consistency and parking slot detection accuracy.

## Method Summary
ParkGaussian adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting to surround-view fisheye cameras for autonomous parking scene reconstruction. It uses an unscented-transform projection to replace linearized Jacobian-based methods, improving geometric stability. A differentiable IPM layer converts fisheye views into bird's-eye view representations, aligning with parking slot detection models. A slot-aware reconstruction strategy leverages pretrained detectors to supervise reconstruction in slot-critical regions, enhancing geometric fidelity for parking slot detection.

## Key Results
- ParkGaussian achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis with PSNR up to 30.27 and SSIM up to 0.93 on ParkRecon3D.
- Parking slot detection precision and recall reach 0.97/0.43 (DMPR-PS) and 0.95/0.48 (GCN), approaching ground truth performance.
- Ablation studies confirm slot-aware supervision is critical for maintaining geometric fidelity in parking slot regions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ParkGaussian works by adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting to the unique challenges of autonomous parking environments. The unscented-transform projection provides improved geometric stability over linearized methods, while the differentiable IPM layer aligns fisheye views with bird's-eye view representations used in parking slot detection. The slot-aware reconstruction strategy leverages pretrained detectors to focus on critical regions, enhancing the quality of parking slot detection and novel view synthesis.

## Foundational Learning
- **3D Gaussian Splatting**: A technique for efficient 3D scene representation using 3D Gaussians; needed for real-time novel view synthesis in autonomous parking; quick check: verify Gaussian parameters (position, scale, color) are optimized during training.
- **Unscented Transform**: A method for propagating uncertainty through nonlinear transformations; used to improve geometric stability in fisheye camera projection; quick check: compare Jacobian-based and unscented-transform projection results.
- **Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM)**: A technique to convert images from perspective to bird's-eye view; aligns fisheye views with parking slot detection models; quick check: validate IPM layer's differentiability and gradient flow.
- **Parking Slot Detection**: Identifying parking slot boundaries and positions; critical for autonomous parking; quick check: compare DMPR-PS and GCN-Parking detector performance.
- **ParkRecon3D Benchmark**: A dataset of 40K synchronized fisheye frames and 60K parking slot annotations; enables training and evaluation of parking scene reconstruction methods; quick check: analyze dataset diversity and scene complexity.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Fisheye Cameras -> Unscented-Transform Projection -> 3D Gaussian Splatting -> Differentiable IPM -> Slot-Aware Reconstruction -> Parking Slot Detection
- **Critical Path**: Fisheye Cameras -> Unscented-Transform Projection -> 3D Gaussian Splatting -> Differentiable IPM
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Unscented-transform projection improves geometric stability but increases computational complexity; slot-aware reconstruction enhances parking slot detection but relies on pretrained detectors.
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor novel view synthesis quality, inaccurate parking slot detection, and geometric instability in complex parking environments.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Evaluate novel view synthesis quality with and without unscented-transform projection.
  2. Compare parking slot detection performance with and without slot-aware reconstruction.
  3. Test ParkGaussian on a separate parking dataset to assess cross-scene generalization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How well does ParkGaussian generalize beyond the four scenes in ParkRecon3D?
- What is the impact of dynamic objects and varying lighting conditions on ParkGaussian's performance?
- How robust is ParkGaussian to occlusions and cluttered parking environments?

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability beyond the four scenes in ParkRecon3D due to narrow dataset diversity.
- High PSNR and SSIM values may be influenced by specific camera setup and controlled parking environment.
- Reliance on pretrained detectors (DMPR-PS, GCN-Parking) raises concerns about end-to-end robustness in unseen environments.

## Confidence
- High: Technical novelty of integrating differentiable IPM and slot-aware supervision into Gaussian Splatting.
- Medium: Improvements in novel view synthesis and parking slot detection based on strong benchmark results.
- Low: Scalability and real-world applicability due to narrow dataset scope and lack of deployment trials.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ParkGaussian on a separate, diverse parking dataset to test cross-scene generalization.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of unscented-transform projection versus slot-aware supervision.
3. Perform real-world field tests in dynamic parking environments with occlusions, moving objects, and varying lighting to assess robustness.
