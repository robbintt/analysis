# The Paradigm Shift: A Comprehensive Survey on Large Vision Language Models for Multimodal Fake News Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.15316
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15316
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey tracing paradigm shift from traditional feature engineering to unified, end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks for fake news detection

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of large vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal fake news detection (MFND), documenting the field's evolution from traditional feature engineering approaches to modern unified, end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks. The authors propose a novel three-branch taxonomy categorizing MFND methods into parameter-frozen, parameter-tuning, and reasoning-paradigm applications. Through systematic review of representative architectures, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics, the survey identifies key technical challenges including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that parameter-efficient tuning and reasoning frameworks significantly improve detection performance across diverse datasets, with models like TRUST-VL achieving up to 86.16% average accuracy on multimodal misinformation tasks.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology involves systematic literature review of recent advancements in large vision-language models applied to multimodal fake news detection. The authors analyze over 40 references spanning traditional feature engineering approaches to modern end-to-end frameworks. They propose a three-branch taxonomy (parameter-frozen, parameter-tuning, and reasoning-paradigm) to categorize existing methods, providing a structured framework for understanding the field's evolution. The survey evaluates representative architectures, benchmarks, and metrics while identifying key technical challenges and opportunities for future research in causal reasoning, adversarial robustness, and efficient architectures for real-world deployment.

## Key Results
- Proposed three-branch taxonomy provides comprehensive categorization of MFND methods
- Parameter-efficient tuning and reasoning frameworks show significant performance improvements
- TRUST-VL model achieves up to 86.16% average accuracy on multimodal misinformation tasks
- Identifies critical challenges in interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paradigm shift works because modern large vision-language models can simultaneously process and reason about both visual and textual information through unified architectures, capturing complex multimodal relationships that traditional feature engineering approaches miss. The parameter-efficient tuning methods leverage pre-trained model knowledge while adapting to specific detection tasks with minimal computational overhead. Reasoning-paradigm applications enable causal inference and context-aware detection that goes beyond surface-level pattern matching, allowing models to identify sophisticated misinformation strategies that involve temporal evolution and cross-modal inconsistencies.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal Representation Learning**
- *Why needed*: Fake news often involves coordinated manipulation across visual and textual modalities that requires joint understanding
- *Quick check*: Verify models can align visual and textual features in shared semantic space

**Cross-Modal Attention Mechanisms**
- *Why needed*: Enables dynamic interaction between visual and textual information during reasoning
- *Quick check*: Confirm attention weights highlight relevant cross-modal correspondences

**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**
- *Why needed*: Allows adaptation of large pre-trained models to specific detection tasks without full retraining
- *Quick check*: Measure parameter count vs performance trade-off compared to full fine-tuning

**Temporal Reasoning**
- *Why needed*: Many misinformation campaigns evolve over time, requiring temporal context understanding
- *Quick check*: Test model performance on datasets with temporal dependencies

**Adversarial Robustness**
- *Why needed*: Fake news creators actively develop countermeasures against detection systems
- *Quick check*: Evaluate model resilience against adversarial perturbations in both modalities

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Vision Encoder -> Text Encoder -> Fusion Module -> Reasoning Layer -> Classification Head

**Critical Path**
Vision and Text Encoders → Fusion Module → Reasoning Layer → Classification Head

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Parameter count vs inference speed (larger models generally perform better but slower)
- Fusion strategy complexity vs cross-modal alignment quality
- Reasoning depth vs computational efficiency
- Pre-training data diversity vs task-specific performance

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance on out-of-distribution domains
- Inability to detect subtle multimodal inconsistencies
- Over-reliance on single modality when multimodal evidence exists
- Temporal reasoning failures on evolving narratives

**First Experiments**
1. Evaluate baseline performance on standard MFND benchmarks (MM-VID, MVFD)
2. Test cross-domain generalization on unseen datasets
3. Assess adversarial robustness against common attack strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several critical open questions for future research: How can we develop standardized benchmarks that comprehensively evaluate LVLMs across diverse misinformation scenarios? What architectural innovations are needed to enable robust temporal reasoning for detecting evolving narratives and context-dependent deception? How can we improve domain generalization to ensure consistent performance across different cultural contexts and languages? What interpretability tools and techniques are needed to make the decision-making process of LVLMs transparent and trustworthy for real-world deployment?

## Limitations

**Major Limitations:**
The survey acknowledges several key limitations in the current state of multimodal fake news detection research. First, there is a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that can comprehensively evaluate LVLMs across diverse misinformation scenarios. The absence of robust temporal reasoning capabilities limits models' ability to detect evolving narratives and context-dependent deception. Additionally, current architectures struggle with domain generalization, showing significant performance degradation when deployed in out-of-distribution environments.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The characterization of the paradigm shift from traditional feature engineering to end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks is well-supported by the literature and aligns with observed trends in the field.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about parameter-efficient tuning and reasoning frameworks improving detection performance are supported by experimental results, though the specific performance metrics may vary across different implementations and datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed three-branch taxonomy provides a useful framework for categorizing MFND methods, but its completeness and practical applicability may require further validation as the field evolves.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct independent replication studies using the benchmark datasets mentioned in the survey to verify the reported performance improvements of parameter-efficient tuning methods.
2. Perform cross-domain validation tests to assess the generalizability of LVLMs beyond their training distributions, particularly in underrepresented languages and cultural contexts.
3. Develop and evaluate interpretability tools specifically designed for multimodal fake news detection to enhance model transparency and trustworthiness in real-world deployments.
