core_contribution: The paper addresses the challenge of accurate intraoperative organ

  preoperative models often fail to align with dynamically changing intraoperative
  anatomy. To solve this, the authors propose a hybrid approach combining a data-driven

# Toward Reliable AR-Guided Surgical Navigation: Interactive Deformation Modeling with Data-Driven Biomechanics and Prompts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08048
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08048
- Reference count: 37
- Hybrid approach combining neural network with biomechanical modeling achieves 3.42 mm mean target registration error (automated) and 2.78 mm (with prompts)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of maintaining accurate augmented reality (AR) surgical navigation when preoperative organ models deform during surgery. The authors propose a hybrid approach that combines a data-driven neural network (BiomPINN) with patient-specific biomechanical modeling (BiomPINN-PBMs), enhanced by an interactive framework allowing surgeons to correct misalignments through intuitive AR-based prompts. Evaluated across synthetic, phantom, and in-vivo datasets, the method demonstrates improved volumetric accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, with mean target registration errors of 3.42 mm (automated) and 2.78 mm (with prompts), enabling more reliable AR navigation in dynamically changing intraoperative environments.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework integrates data-driven deformation prediction with physics-based biomechanical modeling through a two-stage process. First, BiomPINN employs a neural network with per-instance optimization and biomechanical regularization to predict plausible deformations while enforcing physical constraints. This prediction is then refined using BiomPINN-PBMs, which incorporates patient-specific biomechanical parameters into a one-pass biomechanical solution for improved accuracy and efficiency. The interactive component allows surgeons to provide real-time corrections through AR-based prompts, updating correspondences and refining the deformation model. This hybrid approach aims to overcome the limitations of purely data-driven methods that may produce physically implausible deformations and purely physics-based methods that require extensive computation and precise biomechanical parameters.

## Key Results
- Achieved mean target registration error of 3.42 mm in automated mode and 2.78 mm with interactive prompts
- Outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in volumetric accuracy metrics across synthetic, phantom, and in-vivo datasets
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of combining neural predictions with biomechanical refinement for intraoperative deformation modeling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method succeeds by leveraging complementary strengths of data-driven and physics-based approaches. The neural network provides fast, data-informed initial deformation predictions that capture complex, nonlinear organ behaviors learned from training data. The biomechanical regularization ensures these predictions remain physically plausible, preventing unrealistic deformations. The one-pass biomechanical refinement then corrects and optimizes the deformation using patient-specific parameters, bridging the gap between generic predictions and individual anatomy. The interactive component adds a crucial feedback loop, allowing surgeons to correct misalignments that automated systems might miss, particularly in cases of unexpected deformation patterns or when patient-specific parameters deviate from training data distributions.

## Foundational Learning
- Neural network-based deformation prediction: Needed to capture complex, nonlinear organ deformation patterns from training data; Quick check: Verify network generalizes to unseen deformation scenarios
- Biomechanical regularization: Ensures physical plausibility of predictions by constraining deformations to follow biomechanical principles; Quick check: Compare physical plausibility metrics against unconstrained models
- Patient-specific biomechanical modeling: Accounts for individual anatomical variations in tissue properties and boundary conditions; Quick check: Validate parameter estimation accuracy on ground-truth datasets
- Interactive human-in-the-loop correction: Leverages surgeon expertise to address cases where automated systems fail; Quick check: Measure improvement in registration accuracy with vs without surgeon input
- AR-based prompt system: Provides intuitive interface for surgeon feedback during surgery; Quick check: Assess usability and effectiveness in clinical workflow integration

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Preoperative model -> BiomPINN prediction -> Biomechanical refinement (BiomPINN-PBMs) -> Interactive correction (prompts) -> Deformed intraoperative model

Critical path: The most time-critical sequence is the full pipeline from preoperative model to final deformed model, as this must complete within surgical timeframes. The bottleneck is typically the biomechanical refinement stage, which requires solving partial differential equations.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational efficiency for accuracy by incorporating physics-based refinement after the initial neural prediction. While this improves registration accuracy, it increases processing time compared to purely data-driven approaches. The interactive component adds latency but enables surgeon correction of critical misalignments.

Failure signatures: Common failure modes include inaccurate biomechanical parameter estimation leading to unrealistic deformations, insufficient intraoperative correspondences causing poor predictions, and surgeon fatigue or hesitation in providing prompt corrections during complex procedures.

First experiments: 1) Ablation study removing biomechanical regularization to quantify its contribution to physical plausibility; 2) Performance comparison with varying numbers of intraoperative correspondences to establish minimum requirements; 3) Sensitivity analysis of registration accuracy to patient-specific parameter estimation errors.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Reliance on sparse intraoperative correspondences may be insufficient for highly deformable or poorly visualized anatomical regions
- Assumes availability of patient-specific biomechanical parameters, which may not always be accessible or accurately estimated
- Performance on in-vivo data still shows residual registration errors that could affect surgical precision in critical applications

## Confidence
High: Claims about the hybrid neural-biomechanical approach and integration of interactive prompts
Medium: Assertions regarding clinical applicability and robustness across diverse surgical scenarios
Low: Statements about generalization to other anatomical sites or surgical contexts without further validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework on a larger, multi-center in-vivo dataset including diverse anatomical sites and surgical procedures
2. Perform a user study with surgeons of varying experience levels to assess the reliability and consistency of the interactive correction mechanism
3. Compare the proposed approach against alternative intraoperative reconstruction methods (e.g., 4D ultrasound, stereo vision) under clinically relevant deformation scenarios
