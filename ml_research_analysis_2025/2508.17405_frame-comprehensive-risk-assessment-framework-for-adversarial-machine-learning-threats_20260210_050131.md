# FRAME : Comprehensive Risk Assessment Framework for Adversarial Machine Learning Threats

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.17405
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17405
- Authors: Avishag Shapira; Simon Shigol; Asaf Shabtai
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First automated AML risk assessment framework that integrates system profiling, attack feasibility mapping, and empirical success rates to deliver tailored, actionable risk scores for ML systems

## Executive Summary
FRAME is the first automated framework that comprehensively assesses AML risks by integrating system-specific characteristics, feasibility factors, and empirical attack success rates. The core method combines a structured profiling questionnaire, an attack feasibility impact mapping, and a performance dataset to compute risk scores for each adversarial attack. The framework outputs a ranked list of risks tailored to the evaluated ML system, prioritizing threats based on feasibility, impact, and success likelihood. Evaluation across six real-world ML applications demonstrated exceptional accuracy with 9/10 average framework accuracy and strong expert alignment, with attack-specific scores averaging 9.2/10 for accuracy and 8.9/10 for relevance. FRAME enables organizations to prioritize AML risks and supports secure AI deployment in real-world environments.

## Method Summary
FRAME assesses AML risks through a three-stage pipeline: system profiling via a 33-question questionnaire, automated matching of system properties to attack feasibility and impact factors using a pre-built mapping, and integration of empirical success rates from a literature-derived performance dataset. The framework computes risk scores by combining feasibility (log-scaled multiplicative product of factor scores), impact (multiplicative product of compromise severities), and success rates (weighted average with downgrading strategy for partial matches). Final scores are calculated as S(a) = Min(L_overall(a) × I(a) × 10, 10), with zeroing rules for infeasible attacks. The output is a ranked list of risks tailored to the specific ML system and threat actor.

## Key Results
- Achieved 9/10 average framework accuracy across six real-world ML applications
- Expert alignment scores averaged 9.2/10 for accuracy and 8.9/10 for relevance
- Successfully identified top-5 risks in diverse domains including finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems
- Demonstrated strong correlation (Pearson 0.86) between predicted and actual attack success rates
- Framework accuracy consistently exceeded 8/10 across all evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: System Profiling via Structured Questionnaire
FRAME captures system-specific characteristics through a three-part questionnaire, enabling tailored risk assessment without requiring AML expertise from users. The questionnaire collects system characteristics, safety properties, and attack impact severity, mapping responses to feasibility factors and impacts. LLM-based customization adapts questions to specific use cases for better interpretability. Core assumption: system owners possess technical knowledge but lack AML expertise; the questionnaire can reliably capture security-relevant properties needed for risk assessment.

### Mechanism 2: Attack Feasibility-Impact Mapping
A pre-constructed mapping connects each AML attack to its required feasibility factors and security impacts, enabling systematic evaluation across the attack surface. For each attack, the mapping defines required feasibility factors and compromised security impacts, built from literature review and refined with AML expert input. Core assumption: the attack taxonomy is sufficiently comprehensive and factor-to-attack mappings accurately reflect real-world attack requirements.

### Mechanism 3: Empirical Success Rate Integration
FRAME estimates attack success rates by querying a structured dataset of AML attack records from academic literature, using a downgrading strategy when exact system-attack matches are unavailable. Success rates are calculated using weighted averages across downgrading levels, with final risk scores combining feasibility, success rates, and impact. Core assumption: published attack success rates transfer to the evaluated system context; the downgrading strategy provides reasonable estimates when exact matches are absent.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Adversarial ML Attack Categories (Integrity, Privacy, Availability)**
  - Why needed here: FRAME's risk scoring multiplies impact scores that differ by attack objective. Understanding that evasion attacks target integrity, membership inference targets privacy, and resource-latency attacks target availability is essential for interpreting ranked outputs.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a poisoning attack might score higher on availability impact than on privacy impact for a real-time inference system?

- **Concept: Threat Models (White-box vs. Black-box)**
  - Why needed here: The feasibility mapping includes "Attacker Knowledge" as a factor. White-box attacks require full model access; black-box attacks rely on query access or transferability. The zeroing rules explicitly set scores to zero when threat model requirements aren't met.
  - Quick check question: If a system provides only decision-based feedback at serving time (no scores, no gradients), which attack classes would FRAME zero out?

- **Concept: Risk = Likelihood × Impact**
  - Why needed here: FRAME's final score S(a) follows this structure: L_overall (likelihood, from feasibility × success rate) multiplied by I(a) (impact, from compromise severity). The logarithmic scaling of feasibility and min-max normalization ensure no single factor dominates.
  - Quick check question: If an attack has high feasibility (0.9) but low success rate in the empirical literature (0.2), and high impact (0.8), what would contribute most to its lower risk score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** System Profiling Questionnaire -> Attack Feasibility-Impact Mapping -> Performance Dataset -> Modeling Pipeline -> Risk Ranking & Display
- **Critical path:** 1) User completes customized questionnaire (30-45 min), 2) Automated matching of system properties to feasibility factors, 3) Automated retrieval of success rates from dataset, 4) Automated computation and ranking of risk scores for all attacks, 5) LLM generates contextual attack scenarios for top-5 risks
- **Design tradeoffs:** Comprehensive attack coverage (30+ types) but may miss domain-specific nuances; fully automated after questionnaire but depends on dataset quality; fixed attack-feasibility mapping but dataset can be updated periodically; designed for non-experts but evaluation showed strong expert alignment
- **Failure signatures:** Many attacks score 0 (questionnaire responses indicate infeasible conditions); all attacks have similar scores (scaling issue or clustered questionnaire responses); high-ranked attack seems irrelevant (threat actor definition mismatch); success rates seem unrealistic (sparse dataset coverage)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline run on familiar system (compare FRAME's top-5 risks against intuition), 2) Threat actor sensitivity analysis (run with different threat actors to verify access-based scoring), 3) Cross-domain validation (apply to different domain to check success rate relevance)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Countermeasure Development**: How can a methodology be developed to deliver system-specific and impact-aware countermeasures based on FRAME's risk assessment? Current LLM suggestions are generic and do not account for specific system operational constraints or performance impact of mitigation mechanisms.

2. **Query Volume Integration**: Does incorporating query volume into the system profiling questionnaire improve the feasibility assessment for attacks involving high interaction? Current framework does not explicitly model the relationship between query volume and attack detectability/feasibility.

3. **Multi-Model System Adaptation**: How effectively can FRAME be adapted to assess risks in systems composed of multiple, interacting ML models? Current validation focuses on single ML systems; methodology for aggregating risks across a multi-model pipeline has not been empirically tested.

## Limitations

- **Dataset Dependency**: FRAME's empirical success rate component depends entirely on the quality and coverage of its performance dataset, which is not publicly released and may have limited coverage for emerging domains.
- **Static Attack Mapping**: The attack feasibility-impact mapping is constructed from literature review but not explicitly validated against real-world attack outcomes and does not account for deployed defense measures.
- **Questionnaire Sensitivity**: Framework accuracy depends heavily on questionnaire responses, with no reported sensitivity analysis showing how small changes in inputs affect risk rankings.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The framework's core architecture is logically sound and well-specified, with evaluation results showing 9/10 average accuracy and strong expert alignment (8.9/10 relevance) providing substantial empirical support.

**Medium Confidence**: The attack feasibility-impact mapping and success rate estimation methodology are well-described but not fully reproducible without access to the underlying dataset, and evaluation does not test edge cases or novel domains extensively.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about FRAME's ability to handle entirely novel attack techniques or systems with no literature precedent cannot be independently verified, as the downgrading strategy for success rate estimation is described but not validated against ground truth for cases where exact matches are unavailable.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Coverage Analysis**: For a target ML system in your domain, manually verify whether the performance dataset contains relevant attack literature. Test FRAME's behavior when relying heavily on downgrading strategies—does it still produce reasonable risk estimates, or do scores become unreliable?

2. **Cross-Expert Consistency Test**: Have two independent groups of security experts evaluate the same ML system using FRAME. Compare their risk rankings and identify whether discrepancies arise from questionnaire interpretation differences or actual expert disagreement about attack feasibility and impact.

3. **Defense-Aware Risk Assessment**: Extend FRAME to incorporate known defense mechanisms by modifying the feasibility mapping to reduce scores for attacks that are mitigated. Compare risk rankings before and after defense incorporation to verify that FRAME appropriately adjusts risk levels when defenses are present.
