- Absolute performance margins of 6%–35% over baselines across four science disciplines

## Executive Summary
SR-Scientist transforms LLMs into autonomous scientific equation discoverers by integrating code interpreters for data analysis and equation evaluation within a long-horizon optimization framework. The agent iteratively analyzes data, implements and tests equations, and refines hypotheses based on experimental feedback, overcoming context length limitations via an experience buffer. Empirical results on four science disciplines show absolute performance margins of 6%–35% over baselines, with strong robustness to noise, out-of-domain generalization, and symbolic accuracy. An end-to-end reinforcement learning pipeline further enhances the agent's capabilities.

## Method Summary
SR-Scientist employs an LLM agent with two code interpreter tools: a data analyzer for statistical insights and an equation evaluator that uses BFGS optimization to fit constants. The agent operates in up to 40 iterations with 25 turns per iteration, storing explored equations in a heap-based experience buffer ranked by MAPE. Top-K equations are retrieved as in-context examples for subsequent iterations. The system uses log-linear rewards for continuous optimization and achieves 6-35% absolute performance gains over baselines. RL fine-tuning with GRPO further improves performance by ~8.6%.

## Key Results
- SR-Scientist achieves 6-35% absolute performance margins over baselines on LSR-Synth benchmark
- Long-horizon optimization with up to 25 turns per iteration significantly improves equation discovery accuracy
- RL fine-tuning on synthesized data improves Acc₀.₀₁ by ~8.6% for Qwen3-30B
- Strong robustness to noise and out-of-domain generalization across physics, chemistry, biology, and materials domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Long-Horizon Optimization with Tool-Driven Feedback
Multi-turn interaction with data analysis and equation evaluation tools enables autonomous hypothesis refinement beyond single-shot generation. The agent operates in a ReAct-style trajectory, interleaving natural language reasoning with tool invocations over up to 25 turns per iteration. Performance plateaus when turn count exceeds ~25 turns or when the base model lacks sufficient domain knowledge.

### Mechanism 2: Experience Buffer for Cross-Iteration Memory
External memory of explored equations with their scores overcomes context length limitations and enables cumulative optimization. A heap-based buffer stores all explored (equation, MAPE) pairs, with top-K best-performing equations fetched and provided as in-context examples at each iteration. Effectiveness degrades when K is too small or when the buffer contains only poor-performing equations.

### Mechanism 3: Data Analysis Tool for Insight-Guided Equation Design
Direct data analysis through code execution enables pattern discovery that informs equation structure beyond what equation evaluation alone provides. The data_analyzer tool allows agents to write custom code for statistical analysis—correlations, distributions, residual patterns—which guides structural choices and constant initialization before equation submission. Provides limited benefit when base model lacks statistical reasoning capability or when data is too noisy for pattern extraction.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Symbolic Regression as Combinatorial Search**
  - Why needed here: SR-Scientist addresses the NP-hard problem of finding concise mathematical expressions from data; understanding that the search space is exponentially large explains why long-horizon optimization and memory are necessary.
  - Quick check question: Why does symbolic regression require balancing accuracy against equation complexity, and how does this differ from neural network fitting?

- **Concept: ReAct Framework (Reasoning + Acting)**
  - Why needed here: SR-Scientist operates in a ReAct-style trajectory `(r₁,T₁,o₁),...,(rₖ,Tₖ,oₖ)` where reasoning interleaves with tool calls; understanding this pattern is essential for debugging agent behavior.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a single-turn LLM prompt and a multi-turn agentic trajectory with tool feedback?

- **Concept: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - Why needed here: SR-Scientist uses GRPO for RL training, computing advantages relative to group samples rather than using a value function; this enables the continuous reward signal from MAPE scores.
  - Quick check question: Why might a log-linear continuous reward (Equation 2) outperform a stepwise discrete reward for equation discovery?

- **Critical path:**
  1. Input: dataset D, initial goal G₁ (MAPE < 0.1%)
  2. Per iteration (N=40): Agent generates equations using tools over M=25 turns
  3. Equation evaluator runs BFGS to optimize constants, returns MSE/NMSE/MAPE
  4. All equations stored in buffer; top-K=5 fetched for next iteration
  5. Goal updated if achieved; loop continues until convergence or max iterations
  6. Output: Best equation from buffer (lowest NMSE for fair comparison)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Turns vs. iterations:** Fixed LLM call budget (~1000); increasing turns helps up to ~25, then plateaus. Trade off exploration depth vs. restart diversity.
  - **Tool autonomy vs. structure:** Minimal human-defined pipeline allows flexible workflows but requires stronger base models (Qwen3-8B underperforms without RL).
  - **RL cost vs. gain:** Training requires 32 H200 GPUs for 60 steps but improves Acc₀.₀₁ by ~8.6% (Qwen3-30B).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Early stagnation (MAPE plateaus >1%):** Base model lacks sufficient domain knowledge; consider larger backbone or RL training.
  - **OOD generalization gap:** Equations overfitting to ID range; validate on extrapolation test sets, consider noise augmentation.
  - **Repetitive equations without improvement:** Experience buffer K too small or agent not utilizing in-context examples effectively.
  - **RL training instability:** Reward variance too high; log-linear reward (Eq. 2) more stable than stepwise (Eq. 5).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation:** Run inference-only SR-Scientist on 10 LSR-Synth problems across 4 domains with Qwen3-Coder-30B. Track turns-to-convergence, final NMSE, and compare against LLM-SR baseline. Expected: 6-15% absolute improvement in Acc₀.₀₁.
  2. **Ablation on data analysis:** Disable T1 (data_analyzer) and measure performance drop on chemistry and physics problems. Expected: 10-28% drop based on backbone (per Table 3).
  3. **RL fine-tuning pilot:** Train Qwen3-30B on 100 synthesized problems (subset of 1024), evaluate on 20 held-out problems from different domains. Track reward convergence (should saturate ~60 steps) and Acc₀.₀₁ improvement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the agent's performance scale when discovering equations with significantly higher structural complexity (e.g., >4 terms) or higher dimensionality than the 2-4 term skeletons used in RL training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Appendix A.3.1 explicitly states that training data synthesis was limited to "ensure a moderate level of complexity... limited to 2-4 total terms."
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation uses LSR-Synth, which may mirror the complexity constraints of the training distribution, leaving robustness to higher-order complexity untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results on benchmarks containing high-dimensional dynamical systems or equations with many compositional terms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the learned policy generalize to real-world experimental data where noise is non-Gaussian and no symbolic "ground truth" strictly exists?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 4.2 tests robustness using Gaussian noise ($\sigma=\{0.01, 0.05, 0.1\}$), which may not reflect the noise distributions found in physical experimental setups.
- Why unresolved: The agent's data analysis tools might overfit to statistical properties of clean or Gaussian-noisy synthetic data, failing on the messiness of real-world scientific observations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks on physical experimental datasets (e.g., drag coefficients, material properties) rather than synthetic equations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the "Top-K" experience buffer mechanism limit search diversity by discarding "stepping-stone" equations that possess correct partial structure but high overall error?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.2 describes fetching only the "best K equations" to bypass context limits, which prioritizes immediate performance over diversity.
- Why unresolved: While efficient, greedy selection based on MAPE might prune intermediate solutions that are inaccurate now but essential for evolving complex correct solutions later.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing "Top-K" selection against diversity-preserving experience buffers (e.g., using embeddings to ensure equation novelty).

## Limitations
- Performance gains from long-horizon optimization saturate around 25 turns, suggesting inherent reasoning limitations of current LLM architectures
- Effectiveness of experience buffer depends critically on quality of early iterations and optimal K value selection
- RL fine-tuning requires substantial computational resources (32 H200 GPUs) with marginal gains for smaller applications

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Long-horizon optimization with tool feedback mechanism (supported by ablation studies showing 28% drop without data analysis tool)
- **Medium confidence**: Experience buffer effectiveness (limited corpus evidence, but strong empirical results)
- **Medium confidence**: OOD generalization claims (shown across four domains but without extensive cross-disciplinary validation)

## Next Checks
1. **Buffer size sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary K (number of equations fetched from buffer) from 1 to 20 to identify optimal context size and determine if larger K provides diminishing returns.
2. **Turn efficiency evaluation**: Compare performance when using variable turn counts (adaptive termination when MAPE threshold reached) versus fixed 25-turn limit to optimize computational efficiency.
3. **Cross-domain transfer validation**: Test SR-Scientist on a held-out fifth scientific domain (e.g., economics or climate science) to validate true out-of-domain generalization beyond the four benchmark domains.
