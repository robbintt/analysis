# Semantic Trading: Agentic AI for Clustering and Relationship Discovery in Prediction Markets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.02436
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02436

- Primary result: 60-70% accuracy in predicting same/different outcome relationships between prediction markets, achieving ~20% average returns over week-long horizons

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an agentic AI pipeline that automatically clusters prediction markets into topical groups and identifies economically meaningful relationships (same or opposite outcomes) within clusters. Using resolved Polymarket data, the approach combines semantic clustering with outcome-based dependence analysis, enabling scalable discovery of latent semantic structure. Results show 60-70% accuracy in predicting same/different outcome relationships, with the induced trading strategy achieving ~20% average returns over week-long horizons. The findings demonstrate that agentic AI can uncover actionable, interpretable links between fragmented prediction markets, providing a scalable discovery layer for improving market structure, search, hedging, and risk management.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a three-stage agentic AI pipeline for discovering relationships in prediction markets. First, semantic clustering groups markets by topic using vector embeddings of market questions, reducing the search space from O(N²) to O(K·N/K) pairs. Second, an LLM-based relationship discovery agent evaluates logical dependencies between markets within clusters, inferring same/different outcome relationships through causal reasoning rather than price correlation. Third, a leader-follower trading strategy exploits information propagation delays between related markets, waiting for the "leader" to resolve before trading the "follower" based on the predicted relationship. The entire system is implemented using the Agentics framework with typed MCP (Model Context Protocol) agents.

## Key Results
- 60-70% accuracy in predicting same/different outcome relationships between semantically related markets
- Trading strategy achieves average returns of ~20% over week-long horizons with 7.4% standard deviation
- July 2025 shows significant degradation (41.2% accuracy, -12.3% ROI) indicating temporal sensitivity
- Semantic clustering successfully reduces search space while maintaining relationship discovery accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Clustering as Search Space Reduction
Grouping markets by topic reduces the combinatorial complexity of identifying relationships, filtering out unrelated pairs before expensive analysis. The pipeline embeds market text into a vector space and partitions N markets into K ≈ ⌊N/10⌋ clusters. This constrains the subsequent relationship discovery step to only within-cluster pairs, removing the need to scan O(N²) irrelevant combinations. Core assumption: Markets with semantically similar text are the only ones likely to share economic dependencies or causal drivers.

### Mechanism 2: Logical Transduction for Relationship Extraction
Large Language Models can function as "logical transducers" to infer directional relationships (same vs. different outcome) that statistical correlation cannot detect due to sparse or non-existent overlapping price history. The system uses the Agentics framework to map market questions to structured MarketRelation objects. The LLM evaluates causal logic rather than relying on historical price deltas. Core assumption: The LLM possesses sufficient world knowledge to reason about event causality and can adhere to schema constraints reliably.

### Mechanism 3: Event-Driven Information Propagation (Leader-Follower)
Prediction markets are inefficient at instantly propagating information across semantically related but distinct contracts, creating a tradeable window. The strategy waits for a "Leader" market to resolve (certainty = 100%) and then immediately trades the "Follower" market based on the predicted relationship. The mechanism exploits the delay between hard information (resolution) and price adjustment in the follower market. Core assumption: The "Follower" market has not already priced in the outcome of the "Leader" market.

## Foundational Learning

- **Prediction Market Resolution (Oracles)**: Why needed: The entire mechanism relies on "ground truth" data from resolved markets to train and validate the agent. Quick check: How does the system handle a market that resolves as "invalid" or fails to resolve?

- **Schema-Constrained Generation (ATypes)**: Why needed: The paper uses the Agentics framework where agents output strictly typed objects rather than free text. Quick check: Why is structuring the LLM output as a boolean is_same_outcome and float confidence_score critical for the backtesting phase?

- **Vector Space Clustering**: Why needed: The first stage of the pipeline relies on embedding market questions into vectors. Quick check: If two markets have high cosine similarity in vector space but mutually exclusive outcomes (e.g., "Trump wins" vs "Biden wins"), how does the pipeline handle them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Dune Analytics (Polymarket data) -> Filtered CSVs (Binary, >7 days duration) -> Agent Layer (Agentics) -> Execution Layer (Leader-Follower logic)

- **Critical path**: The Relationship Discovery MCP. If the LLM hallucinates a relationship or fails to infer the correct logic, the trading strategy executes a losing trade.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Precision vs. Recall (confidence threshold affects trade quantity and accuracy), Generality vs. Specificity (cluster size affects topic mixing)

- **Failure signatures**: July 2025 effect (accuracy drops to 41.2%, ROI becomes -12.3%), high variance in returns (up to 41.6% standard deviation)

- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Baseline Validation: Replicate clustering on specific month without paper's cluster IDs
  2. Confidence Sweep: Vary confidence_score threshold to plot Precision-Recall curve
  3. Slippage Stress Test: Simulate 1-minute delay or 0.5% slippage on follower market entry

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Semantic clustering may miss cross-topic dependencies (e.g., crypto regulation affecting multiple market types)
- LLM-based relationship discovery depends heavily on model's world knowledge and logical reasoning capabilities
- Trading strategy assumes predictable information propagation delays that may not hold across all market conditions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Semantic clustering methodology and basic relationship discovery pipeline are technically sound and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: LLM's ability to accurately identify same/different outcome relationships across diverse market topics
- **Low Confidence**: Trading strategy's consistent profitability and scalability due to high variance and temporal sensitivity

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Topic Dependency Discovery**: Test system's ability to identify relationships between semantically dissimilar markets that may share economic drivers
2. **Temporal Robustness Analysis**: Replicate pipeline across multiple non-contiguous time periods to quantify performance degradation over time
3. **Out-of-Distribution Market Testing**: Apply trained relationship discovery agent to prediction markets from different platforms or countries to assess generalization
