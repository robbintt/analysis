# LyAm: Robust Non-Convex Optimization for Stable Learning in Noisy Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.11262
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11262
- Authors: Elmira Mirzabeigi; Sepehr Rezaee; Kourosh Parand
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LyAm achieves 94.37% accuracy on GTSRB with ViT-16-B, outperforming Adam, AdamW, AdaGrad, AdaBelief, and Adan.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of training deep neural networks in noisy environments, where noisy gradients and unstable convergence hinder performance and generalization. The authors propose LyAm, a novel optimizer that integrates Adam's adaptive moment estimation with Lyapunov-based stability mechanisms. LyAm dynamically adjusts the learning rate using Lyapunov stability theory to enhance convergence robustness and mitigate training noise. The optimizer treats the loss function as a Lyapunov function, ensuring a monotonically decreasing loss trajectory to guarantee stability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that LyAm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and stability.

## Method Summary
LyAm is a novel optimizer that combines Adam's adaptive moment estimation with Lyapunov-based stability mechanisms. The optimizer treats the loss function as a Lyapunov function, ensuring a monotonically decreasing loss trajectory to guarantee stability. It dynamically adjusts the learning rate using Lyapunov stability theory, scaling the effective learning rate inversely with the second moment of the gradients. The method integrates bias-corrected moment estimates and applies an adaptive scaling factor based on gradient variance. LyAm was tested on image classification tasks using CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and GTSRB datasets with models including ViT-16-B, ResNet50, and VGG-16.

## Key Results
- LyAm achieves 94.37% accuracy on GTSRB with ViT-16-B, surpassing Adam (93.21%), AdamW (93.05%), AdaGrad (92.8%), AdaBelief (93.15%), and Adan (93.0%).
- On CIFAR-100 with ResNet50, LyAm reaches 74.2% accuracy compared to Adam's 73.1%.
- Ablation studies confirm the critical role of adaptive learning rate scaling and bias correction in maintaining performance and stability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Treating the loss function as a Lyapunov function theoretically guarantees a monotonically decreasing loss trajectory, ensuring system stability during training.
- **Mechanism:** The optimizer defines the loss $V(\theta) = L(\theta)$. To satisfy Lyapunov's stability condition (where the change in loss $\Delta V \le 0$), the algorithm scales the effective learning rate inversely with the second moment of the gradients ($\hat{v}_t$). By selecting a base learning rate $\eta_0$ sufficiently small relative to the Lipschitz constant, the "descent term" in the Taylor expansion outweighs the "quadratic error term," forcing the loss to decrease.
- **Core assumption:** The loss landscape is continuously differentiable with Lipschitz continuous gradients, and the first moment estimate approximates the true gradient direction ($m_t \approx \nabla L$).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The optimizer treats the loss function as a Lyapunov function, ensuring a monotonically decreasing loss trajectory to guarantee stability."
  - [section]: Section 2.2 derives the condition $\eta_0 \ll \frac{2(1+v_{t,(i)})}{L_s}$ to ensure the Lyapunov drift remains non-positive.
  - [corpus]: Related papers like *ROOT* and *AYLA* address optimization stability, but corpus evidence specifically linking Lyapunov theory to Adam is absent/weak in neighbors, suggesting this specific causal link is the paper's novel contribution.
- **Break condition:** If the base learning rate $\eta_0$ is set too high relative to the landscape's curvature (Lipschitz constant), the quadratic error term dominates, potentially causing divergence.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Bias-corrected moment estimation allows the optimizer to maintain accurate step directions during early training iterations, which is critical for stability in noisy settings.
- **Mechanism:** Standard exponential moving averages (EMA) start at zero, causing initial bias. LyAm corrects this by dividing the moments $m_t$ and $v_t$ by $1 - \beta^t$. This ensures that even in the presence of noisy gradients (modeled as $g_t = \nabla L + \epsilon$), the optimizer does not underestimate the gradient's magnitude or variance in early steps.
- **Core assumption:** Gradient noise $\epsilon_t$ is a stochastic vector with zero mean.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: Mentions integrating "Adam's adaptive moment estimation."
  - [section]: Section 3.3.1 (Ablation Studies) explicitly states: "Removing [bias correction] reduced accuracy (90.0% vs. 93.5%) and slowed convergence."
  - [corpus]: *ANO* (neighbor) discusses decoupling direction/magnitude in noise, supporting the general need for precise moment handling.
- **Break condition:** If training runs are extremely short, or if initialization is non-standard, the bias correction might overcompensate, though the paper suggests removal is more detrimental.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Adaptive scaling via the Lyapunov denominator ($1 + \hat{v}_t$) dampens updates in high-variance regions, filtering out gradient noise.
- **Mechanism:** In noisy environments, gradient variance ($v_t$) increases. The LyAm update rule $\eta_t = \frac{\eta_0}{1 + \hat{v}_t}$ automatically reduces the learning rate when variance is high. This prevents noisy "outlier" gradients from causing erratic parameter jumps, effectively prioritizing stable descent over speed in uncertain regions.
- **Core assumption:** High gradient magnitude/variance correlates with noise or "spurious signals" rather than informative steep descent directions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section]: Section 2.5 states: "When noise inflates the magnitude of $g_t$... the adaptive learning rate decreases... preventing overshooting."
  - [section]: Figure 2 visual shows LyAm maintaining lower, stable loss compared to oscillating competitors under noisy conditions.
  - [corpus]: *SPRINT* and others focus on variance reduction, aligning with the general principle that managing variance is key to convergence in noisy settings.
- **Break condition:** If the data is clean but high-curvature (requiring large steps), this dampening might overly slow convergence, though ablation results suggest the tradeoff is net positive.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Lyapunov Stability Theory**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the theoretical engine of the paper. Without understanding that a Lyapunov function acts as an "energy" measure that must dissipate ($\dot{V} \le 0$), the custom learning rate formula appears arbitrary.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the paper require the "Lyapunov drift" $\Delta V(\theta_t)$ to be non-positive for stability?

- **Concept:** **Bias Correction in Adaptive Optimizers**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on this specific implementation detail of Adam to function correctly. The ablation study shows this isn't just a minor tweak but a structural requirement for the optimizer's robustness.
  - **Quick check question:** How does dividing the moment estimate by $(1 - \beta^t)$ fix the initialization bias of exponential moving averages?

- **Concept:** **Non-Convex Optimization Landscapes**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly targets non-convex settings (common in deep learning) where saddle points and local minima abound. The theoretical guarantee relies on navigating these without assuming a single global minimum.
  - **Quick check question:** In a non-convex landscape, why is finding a point where $\nabla L = 0$ insufficient to guarantee a global minimum?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input gradients $g_t$ -> Moment Estimation (calculates $m_t$, $v_t$) -> Bias Correction (computes $\hat{m}_t$, $\hat{v}_t$) -> Lyapunov Scaler (calculates $\eta_t = \eta_0/(1 + \hat{v}_t)$) -> Update (applies $\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta_t \odot \hat{m}_t$)

- **Critical path:** The **Lyapunov Scaler** is the critical divergence from standard Adam. It changes the logic from "divide by root-mean-square" (Adam) to "divide by (1 + variance)." This additive term is what mathematically satisfies the stability proof.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Stability vs. Speed:** The algorithm prioritizes stability (dampening noise) which may result in slightly slower time-per-epoch (Table 2 shows LyAm is sometimes 5-10s slower than Adam on ViT) but higher final accuracy.
  - **Robustness vs. Simplicity:** Introduces theoretical guarantees at the cost of slightly more complex hyperparameter tuning (specifically the interplay of $\eta_0$ with the new scaling factor).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Stagnation:** If $\eta_0$ is too small, the $1 + \hat{v}_t$ denominator might suppress learning entirely in high-variance regions.
  - **Early Instability:** If bias correction is disabled (Setup A in ablation), expect erratic loss spikes in the first few epochs.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Synthetic Noise):** Train a small MLP on a regression task with injected Gaussian noise in the gradients. Plot $\Delta V$ to verify it stays $\le 0$ compared to standard Adam.
  2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Run a grid search on $\beta_2$ (values 0.9, 0.99, 0.999) on CIFAR-10 to replicate the ablation study finding that $\beta_2 \approx 0.99$ is optimal for stability.
  3. **Convergence Robustness:** Train ResNet50 on "poisoned" CIFAR-10 (10% label noise) and compare validation loss curves against AdamW to verify the "monotonic decrease" claim under real perturbation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Does LyAm provide performance benefits in non-vision domains, such as natural language processing (NLP) or reinforcement learning?
  - **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The conclusion states that the findings "pave the way for future exploration into other complex optimization scenarios."
  - **Why unresolved:** The experimental validation is restricted entirely to computer vision benchmarks (CIFAR, TinyImageNet, GTSRB) using CNNs and ViTs.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluations of LyAm on standard NLP tasks (e.g., GLUE benchmark with Transformers) or reinforcement learning control tasks.

- **Question:** Is LyAm effective against stochastic gradient noise and adversarial perturbations, distinct from the data poisoning tested?
  - **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] The abstract and intro emphasize "noisy gradients," but Section 3.1.1 simulates noise via data poisoning (replacing CIFAR data with MNIST) rather than injecting noise into gradient calculations.
  - **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the Lyapunov scaling mechanism is robust to computational gradient noise or adversarial gradient attacks, or if it is specifically tuned for label/distribution noise.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments using explicit gradient noise injection (e.g., Gaussian noise on gradients) or adversarial training setups.

- **Question:** Does the adaptive learning rate scaling introduce computational bottlenecks that hinder scalability to very large models?
  - **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] Table 2 consistently shows LyAm has a slightly higher "Time (s)" per epoch compared to AdamW (e.g., 350s vs 340s on ViT/GTSRB).
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper does not analyze the algorithmic complexity of the Lyapunov scaling step or profile its performance on extremely large-scale models (>100M parameters).
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Complexity analysis and scaling experiments on large language models or high-resolution segmentation tasks.

## Limitations

- Theoretical guarantees rely on Lipschitz continuity assumptions that may not hold in real-world deep learning landscapes.
- Computational overhead is modest but not quantified in wall-clock time for all model-dataset combinations.
- Claims about "broad applicability" beyond image classification are not validated.

## Confidence

- **High**: LyAm outperforms standard optimizers in empirical benchmarks (CIFAR-10, GTSRB).
- **Medium**: Theoretical stability guarantees hold under idealized assumptions.
- **Low**: Claims about "broad applicability" beyond image classification are not validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Convergence verification**: Measure $\Delta V = L(\theta_{t+1}) - L(\theta_t)$ across training epochs to confirm monotonic decrease in practice.
2. **Lipschitz sensitivity test**: Systematically vary $\eta_0$ relative to estimated local Lipschitz constants to find the stability boundary.
3. **Generalization robustness**: Test LyAm on non-image tasks (e.g., language modeling or reinforcement learning) to assess true broad applicability.
