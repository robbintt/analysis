# Multitask LSTM for Arboviral Outbreak Prediction Using Public Health Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.04566
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04566
- **Reference count**: 27
- **Primary result**: Developed a multitask LSTM architecture predicting dengue, chikungunya, and Zika outbreaks in Recife, Brazil, with strongest regression performance for dengue (MedAPE: 4.45% at 120-day window)

## Executive Summary
This study presents a multitask LSTM architecture for predicting arboviral disease outbreaks and case counts in Recife, Brazil, using public health data from 2017-2023. The model simultaneously performs binary classification (outbreak detection) and regression (case forecasting) for three diseases: dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Through hyperparameter tuning and time series cross-validation, the research demonstrates that multitask learning with LSTM networks can provide effective outbreak forecasting in public health contexts, with optimal performance linked to disease-specific sequence lengths.

## Method Summary
The research employs a multitask LSTM architecture trained on public health data spanning 2017-2023, with a held-out 2023 test set for evaluation. The model uses varying input windows of 60, 90, and 120 days to capture temporal patterns in arboviral disease progression. Both binary classification for outbreak detection and regression for case forecasting are performed simultaneously, leveraging shared LSTM layers to capture common disease characteristics while maintaining disease-specific output heads. Hyperparameter tuning and time series cross-validation ensure robust model training and evaluation.

## Key Results
- Regression performance was strongest for dengue (MedAPE: 4.45% at 120-day window)
- Classification metrics showed robust validation performance (F1-score 0.94 for dengue)
- Test set generalization showed some degradation in classification metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multitask learning approach works by leveraging shared representations across related arboviral diseases while maintaining disease-specific prediction heads. The LSTM architecture captures temporal dependencies in disease progression patterns, allowing the model to learn both short-term and long-term dependencies in the public health data. By training simultaneously on classification and regression tasks, the model develops richer internal representations that benefit both prediction objectives.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multitask Learning**: Training multiple related tasks simultaneously to improve generalization across all tasks. Needed to leverage shared patterns between arboviral diseases and prevent overfitting to single-disease characteristics. Quick check: Verify task-specific loss weights balance properly.
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks**: Recurrent neural networks designed to capture long-term temporal dependencies. Needed to model the temporal progression of arboviral diseases over extended periods. Quick check: Validate gradient flow through LSTM gates during training.
- **Time Series Cross-Validation**: Specialized validation technique for temporal data that respects chronological ordering. Needed to ensure realistic evaluation of forecasting models on future data. Quick check: Confirm no future data leakage in validation folds.
- **Multivariate Time Series Analysis**: Handling multiple interdependent time-dependent variables. Needed to capture relationships between different disease case counts and potential external factors. Quick check: Verify input feature scaling and normalization.
- **Regression vs Classification Trade-offs**: Balancing continuous value prediction with discrete class assignment. Needed to address both outbreak detection and case count forecasting simultaneously. Quick check: Monitor both task performances during training.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Public Health Data -> Input Preprocessing -> LSTM Encoder -> Disease-Specific Heads (Classification + Regression) -> Output Predictions

**Critical Path**: Data preprocessing and feature engineering are critical as they directly impact LSTM input quality. The LSTM encoder's ability to capture temporal patterns determines overall model performance. The disease-specific heads must be properly balanced to ensure both tasks contribute meaningfully to training.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The multitask approach trades potential single-task optimization for improved generalization across diseases. Longer input windows capture more temporal context but increase computational cost and risk of overfitting. The simultaneous classification and regression objectives require careful loss function balancing to prevent one task from dominating training.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on either task may indicate imbalanced loss weighting or insufficient representation learning. Degradation in test set performance suggests potential overfitting to training data patterns. Inconsistent performance across diseases may indicate inadequate disease-specific modeling capacity.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test single-task vs multitask performance for each disease individually. 2) Vary input window lengths systematically to identify optimal temporal context. 3) Compare different LSTM architectures (stacked, bidirectional) for temporal pattern capture.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single-city focus on Recife limits generalizability to other arboviral-endemic regions
- Model performance may not generalize to novel outbreak patterns or emerging variants
- Optimal input window lengths were empirically determined and may not capture longer-term seasonal patterns

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Regression performance for dengue prediction (MedAPE: 4.45% at 120-day window)
- **Medium Confidence**: Classification metrics show robust validation but some test set generalization degradation
- **Medium Confidence**: Multitask learning effectiveness demonstrated but requires external validation across geographical contexts

## Next Checks
1. Test model architecture using public health data from at least two other arboviral-endemic cities in different countries to assess generalizability
2. Implement rolling window validation across multiple years to evaluate model stability during different outbreak seasons and intensities
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine which input features most significantly impact prediction accuracy for each disease
