# Interpretable Depression Detection from Social Media Text Using LLM-Derived Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.06616
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06616
- **Reference count**: 30
- **Primary result**: Zero-shot LLMs achieve 96% accuracy on binary depression detection, while LLM-derived summary embeddings enable superior ordinal severity classification (~58% accuracy)

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers for depression detection from social media text across three tasks: binary classification, depression severity classification, and differential diagnosis among depression, PTSD, and anxiety. The authors compare zero-shot LLMs with supervised classifiers trained on conventional text embeddings and LLM-generated summary embeddings. Results show zero-shot LLMs excel at binary classification (96% accuracy) but struggle with fine-grained ordinal tasks. Classifiers trained on LLM-generated summary embeddings achieve competitive or superior performance, particularly for ordinal classification tasks, demonstrating that combining LLMs' contextual understanding with supervised learning on curated embeddings offers a promising approach for mental health prediction from social media data.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three approaches: zero-shot LLM classification, traditional classifiers with all-mpnet-base-v2 embeddings, and traditional classifiers with LLM-generated summary embeddings. Data preprocessing includes deduplication, length filtering (10th-90th percentile), and column selection. The LLM summary generation uses GPT-4o with prompts forcing mental health-focused reasoning. Traditional classifiers include Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with class-wise F1 for multi-class tasks. The LLM summary approach involves generating mental health-focused summaries via GPT-4o, embedding these summaries using all-mpnet-base-v2, and training supervised classifiers on these embeddings.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot LLMs achieve 96% accuracy on binary depression classification, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities
- Classifiers trained on LLM-generated summary embeddings achieve 58% accuracy for ordinal severity detection, outperforming raw text embeddings
- Zero-shot LLMs struggle with fine-grained ordinal tasks where pretraining doesn't capture subtle severity distinctions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Zero-Shot LLM Generalization for Binary Classification
- Claim: Pretrained LLMs can classify depression vs. non-depression without task-specific training, achieving high accuracy on binary tasks.
- Mechanism: Extensive pretraining on diverse corpora provides implicit knowledge of depressive language patterns; the model maps input text directly to diagnostic labels via prompted reasoning.
- Core assumption: Depressive language has distinctive patterns sufficiently represented in pretraining data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "zero-shot LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification"
  - [section IV.A] "the zero-shot LLM classifier achieved the highest overall accuracy... likely due to its extensive pretraining on large-scale, diverse datasets"
  - [corpus] Xu et al. [18] found zero-shot prompting yields limited results on some mental health tasks, suggesting performance is task-dependent
- Break condition: Performance degrades substantially on fine-grained ordinal tasks where pretraining doesn't capture subtle severity distinctions.

### Mechanism 2: Semantic Enrichment via LLM-Guided Summarization
- Claim: Prompting LLMs to generate mental health-focused summaries produces embeddings that capture more task-relevant affective semantics than raw text.
- Mechanism: The prompt forces the LLM to reason about emotional tone, cognitive state, and mental health signals, producing a condensed representation that highlights relevant cues while filtering irrelevant information. This summary is then embedded with a sentence encoder.
- Core assumption: The LLM can reliably extract mental health signals from noisy, informal social media text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLM-derived summary embeddings can capture task-relevant affective semantics"
  - [section III.D] "This method induces reasoning by forcing the LLM to generate a semantically enriched interpretation beyond surface-level syntax. It also reduces noise by allowing the LLM to filter irrelevant information."
  - [corpus] Direct corpus evidence for this specific summary embedding mechanism is limited; related work (AttentionDep) explores domain-aware attention for semantic enrichment but uses different approaches
- Break condition: Summary quality degrades when input text is very short, highly ambiguous, or contains sarcasm/irony the LLM misinterprets.

### Mechanism 3: Supervised Ordinal Learning on Curated Embeddings
- Claim: Traditional classifiers trained on LLM-generated summary embeddings outperform both raw text embeddings and zero-shot LLMs for ordinal severity prediction.
- Mechanism: Supervised learning captures ordinal label structure (minimum → mild → moderate → severe) that zero-shot LLMs don't explicitly model; LLM-derived embeddings provide semantically enriched features that make ordinal boundaries more learnable.
- Core assumption: The ordinal structure in labels reflects meaningful gradations that can be learned from the embedding space geometry.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "classifiers trained on LLM-generated summary embeddings achieve competitive or superior performance, particularly for ordinal classification tasks (e.g., 58% accuracy for severity detection)"
  - [section IV.B] "trained machine learning models benefit from supervised learning, capturing both the semantic and ordinal relationships in the data"
  - [corpus] Corpus shows limited direct replication of ordinal severity detection with LLM embeddings; HelaDepDet provides graded labels but similar approaches not widely reported
- Break condition: Performance drops when training data is insufficient to learn stable ordinal boundaries, or when embeddings don't preserve ordinal relationships in their vector geometry.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Zero-shot vs. Supervised Classification Paradigm**
  - Why needed here: The paper's central comparison is between zero-shot LLM inference and supervised classifiers; understanding when each excels is essential for system design.
  - Quick check question: Why would a zero-shot model achieve 96% on binary depression detection but struggle with 4-level severity classification?

- Concept: **Text Embeddings as Fixed Vector Representations**
  - Why needed here: Both raw text and LLM summaries are converted to 768-dimensional vectors via all-mpnet-base-v2; this representation choice determines what information classifiers can access.
  - Quick check question: What semantic information might be lost when converting a variable-length social media post into a fixed-size embedding?

- Concept: **Ordinal Classification Constraints**
  - Why needed here: Severity levels have inherent ordering (minimum < mild < moderate < severe) that standard multi-class classifiers don't exploit; understanding this affects model selection.
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts "severe" for a "mild" case vs. "minimum" for a "mild" case, should these errors be weighted differently?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. **Data preprocessing**: Deduplication, length filtering (10th–90th percentile), column selection
  2. **Traditional feature extraction**: all-mpnet-base-v2 embeddings (768-dim) + LIWC psycholinguistic features
  3. **Zero-shot LLM path**: GPT-4o API with task-specific prompts → direct label output
  4. **LLM summary path**: GPT-4o summary generation → all-mpnet-base-v2 embedding → supervised classifier
  5. **Classifiers**: Logistic Regression (L2, C=1.0), SVM (linear, C=1.0), Random Forest (100 trees)
  6. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score; class-wise F1 for multi-class tasks

- Critical path: For the LLM summary embedding approach—the paper's main innovation—the flow is: **Raw text → GPT-4o summary generation → all-mpnet-base-v2 embedding → classifier training → prediction**. Latency and cost are dominated by the GPT-4o summary generation step during training.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot LLM: No training data needed, high binary accuracy (96%), poor ordinal performance, per-inference API cost, no interpretability beyond final label
  - LLM summary + supervised: Training data required, better ordinal performance (~58%), one-time API cost for summary generation, interpretable intermediate summaries
  - Raw text + traditional: No API dependency, lower accuracy, fastest inference, least interpretable

- Failure signatures:
  - Zero-shot returns invalid labels → Prompt parsing failure; add output format constraints
  - Summary embeddings underperform raw text → LLM generating generic/uninformative summaries; inspect summary quality
  - High binary accuracy but random severity → Ordinal structure not captured; consider ordinal regression or label smoothing
  - Depression/anxiety confusion → Expected per Section IV.C; overlapping linguistic patterns require additional features or multimodal signals

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate binary classification with zero-shot GPT-4o on a 500-post held-out sample; verify accuracy near 96% and analyze false positive/negative patterns.
  2. Generate LLM summaries for 100 posts across severity levels; manually assess whether summaries capture clinically relevant signals before training.
  3. Compare Logistic Regression severity classification using raw text embeddings vs. LLM summary embeddings; target ~58% accuracy improvement with summary embeddings as reported.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Cross-platform generalizability is limited as the study exclusively uses Reddit data, which may not capture depression expressions in other social media contexts with different linguistic patterns and interaction styles.
- Clinical validation gap exists as the study uses self-reported social media labels rather than clinical diagnoses and doesn't validate predictions against professional assessments or correlate with actual treatment-seeking behavior.
- Prompt sensitivity and reproducibility remain unclear as the paper doesn't report sensitivity analyses showing how performance varies with prompt wording, temperature settings, or examples provided.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Binary depression classification performance (96% accuracy with zero-shot LLMs). Well-supported by direct experimental results and aligns with established literature on zero-shot capabilities for binary mental health classification.
- **Medium confidence**: LLM-derived summary embeddings capturing "task-relevant affective semantics." Theoretical justification and some evidence, but relies heavily on assumptions about LLM reliability that lack extensive empirical validation.
- **Low confidence**: Clinical interpretability and actionability of the proposed approach. Discusses interpretability through summary generation but lacks evidence that summaries would be useful to clinicians or that the system would improve mental health outcomes in practice.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-platform validation study**: Test the zero-shot LLM and summary embedding approaches on at least two additional social media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Tumblr) using identical methodology. Compare performance drops and identify platform-specific linguistic patterns that affect depression detection accuracy.

2. **Prompt sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary prompt wording, few-shot examples, and temperature settings for both zero-shot classification and summary generation. Measure performance variance across 10+ prompt variations to establish robustness and identify optimal prompt configurations.

3. **Clinical correlation validation**: Obtain a small sample of social media posts from users who have received clinical depression diagnoses. Compare model predictions against actual clinical assessments to measure real-world diagnostic accuracy and false positive/negative rates that would occur in deployment.
