# Increasing AI Explainability by LLM Driven Standard Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07083
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07083
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Embedding LLM reasoning within formalized analytical processes produces auditable decision traces even when underlying model reasoning remains opaque.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes embedding LLM reasoning within standardized analytical processes to enhance AI explainability. The approach uses a layered architecture that separates the LLM's opaque reasoning from transparent decision models like QOC, Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management. Empirical evaluations show the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts. The framework achieves meaningful agreement with human decisions while maintaining auditable reasoning traces.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a layered architecture that separates LLM reasoning from explainable process space using formal analytical frameworks. The system uses role-conditioned LLM agents to populate structured schemas (criteria, options, payoffs, influence matrices) within QOC, Vester sensitivity analysis, game-theoretic, and risk management models. Deterministic analyzers then compute weighted scores, Nash equilibria, Vester metrics, and risk assessments from these schema inputs. The approach includes statistical validation through outlier detection and variance analysis across multiple agent evaluations.

## Key Results
- QOC framework achieved 56-54% agreement with human decisions across models, with GPT-5 showing the best performance at 23.5% false positives and 0.303 significance
- Sensitivity analysis achieved 62.9% factor alignment and 92.97 average rubric score
- Game theory analysis achieved 93% path-level label matching for the Cuban Missile Crisis scenario

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Explainability Barrier via Layered Architecture
Separating LLM inference from structured analytical processes produces auditable decision traces, even when underlying model reasoning remains opaque. A lower layer contains the LLM's uninterpretable reasoning while an upper layer enforces deterministic process logic. The boundary between them marks where outputs become measurable and auditable.

### Mechanism 2: Formal Process Constraint on LLM Sub-Tasks
Restricting LLMs to well-defined sub-tasks within mathematically-defined frameworks preserves interpretability of the aggregate result. The LLM populates structured schema elements while deterministic analyzers compute final outputs. The schema—not the LLM—governs the reasoning logic.

### Mechanism 3: Statistical Aggregation and Outlier Detection Across Role-Conditioned Agents
Instantiating multiple LLM agents with distinct stakeholder perspectives, then applying statistical aggregation, improves robustness and surfaces divergent interpretations. Each agent independently evaluates options, risks, or influences; consolidation merges overlapping elements; statistical analysis identifies inconsistencies.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Question–Option–Criteria (QOC) Framework**
  - Why needed here: Core decision-analytic structure used throughout the paper
  - Quick check question: Given three options and four weighted criteria, can you compute which option achieves the highest weighted-sum score?

- Concept: **Vester Sensitivity Analysis (Active/Passive Sum, Role Classification)**
  - Why needed here: Section 4.2 and 5.2 rely on Vester-style influence matrices and variable role taxonomy
  - Quick check question: If a variable has high Active Sum and low Passive Sum, what systemic role does it likely play?

- Concept: **Game-Theoretic Solution Concepts (Nash Equilibrium, Subgame Perfect Equilibrium, Backward Induction)**
  - Why needed here: Sections 4.3–4.4 and 5.3 use normal-form and sequential game analysis
  - Quick check question: In a two-player sequential game, how does backward induction identify the subgame perfect equilibrium path?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Intake Module -> Agent Instantiation Layer -> Schema Population -> Consolidation & Cleaning -> Deterministic Analyzer -> Interpretation Agent -> Visualization Layer
- Critical path: 1) Define scenario and select analytical module, 2) Instantiate agents with role prompts and collect independent schema inputs, 3) Consolidate inputs and apply deterministic analyzer, 4) Run statistical validation, 5) Generate interpretation and visualizations
- Design tradeoffs: More agents → richer perspective diversity but higher compute cost; stricter consolidation → cleaner schemas but risk of over-pruning valid minority viewpoints; deeper game trees → finer-grained analysis but increased LLM call volume
- Failure signatures: Hallucination cascade (detect via cross-agent consistency checks), role misalignment (manifests as inconsistent evaluations), schema corruption (invalid matrix dimensions), equilibrium inconsistency (multiple conflicting Nash/SPE outputs)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Run QOC pipeline on small decision set with 3 agents and compare to human expert baseline, 2) Execute Sensitivity Analysis on known system and compute role classification accuracy, 3) Run sequential-game pipeline on simplified crisis scenario and verify SPE path alignment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does fine-tuning LLMs on structured reasoning patterns effectively internalize decision-analytic schemas to reduce reliance on external orchestration? Current implementation relies on external process orchestration to enforce structure; it is unproven if this structure can be internalized without losing fidelity.

### Open Question 2
What formal reconciliation mechanisms most effectively mitigate divergent interpretations among role-conditioned agents in multi-agent settings? The current architecture uses statistical outlier detection but lacks dynamic mechanisms to adjust agent influence based on reliability or context.

### Open Question 3
How can consistency-checking and reference validation mechanisms be integrated to prevent hallucination propagation across the layered architecture? While the "Explainability Barrier" isolates layers, fabricated data can still cascade through the reasoning chain.

## Limitations
- The "Explainability Barrier" lacks empirical validation that deterministic upper-layer processes truly compensate for LLM opacity in complex scenarios
- Performance claims rely on domain-specific datasets that may not generalize to broader decision contexts
- Prompt engineering details, model configurations, and consolidation algorithms are underspecified

## Confidence
- **High**: QOC framework application, game-theoretic solution computation, statistical validation methods
- **Medium**: Agent consensus aggregation benefits, Explainability Barrier effectiveness in practice, cross-domain performance stability
- **Low**: Exact reproducibility of prompts, model version mapping, influence matrix generation fidelity

## Next Checks
1. Implement a minimal QOC pipeline with three agents; compare consolidated rankings against a small human expert panel to measure agreement and detect hallucination patterns
2. Test Sensitivity Analysis on a well-documented system; compute AS/PS role classification accuracy and variance across multiple runs
3. Validate sequential-game pipeline on a simplified crisis scenario; verify SPE path consistency with intuitive escalation/de-escalation trajectories and log mid-sequence decision variance
