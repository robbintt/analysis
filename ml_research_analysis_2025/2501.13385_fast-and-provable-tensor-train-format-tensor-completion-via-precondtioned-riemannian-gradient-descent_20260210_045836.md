# Fast and Provable Tensor-Train Format Tensor Completion via Precondtioned Riemannian Gradient Descent

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.13385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13385
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: PRGD achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedup in tensor completion with provable linear convergence

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a preconditioned Riemannian gradient descent (PRGD) algorithm for tensor completion in the Tensor Train (TT) format. The method introduces a data-driven metric on the tangent space of the TT manifold, which accelerates convergence compared to standard Riemannian gradient descent. The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees of linear convergence under suitable initialization conditions and demonstrates significant computational efficiency gains in both synthetic and real-world experiments, including hyperspectral image completion and quantum state tomography applications.

## Method Summary
The paper addresses low-rank tensor completion by minimizing the objective function over the TT manifold. PRGD modifies standard Riemannian gradient descent by introducing a preconditioner based on the diagonal weighting matrix derived from mode-$i$ unfoldings of the gradient. This preconditioner defines a new metric on the tangent space, effectively reweighting the gradient directions according to the data structure. The algorithm uses TT-SVD for retraction and can employ either adaptive or constant step sizes, with the paper noting that optimal constant step size performs best in practice.

## Key Results
- PRGD reduces computation time and iterations by up to two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods
- The algorithm demonstrates linear convergence under suitable initialization conditions
- Experimental results show substantial efficiency gains on both synthetic tensors (orders 3, ranks 4-10) and real hyperspectral images (250×329×33)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The preconditioned metric adapts to the local geometry of the TT manifold by incorporating information from the current gradient's structure. This data-driven weighting helps the algorithm move more efficiently along directions that reduce the objective function, particularly in the presence of structured low-rank patterns. The preconditioner effectively balances the influence of different tensor modes, leading to faster convergence.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tensor Train (TT) format**: A compact representation for high-dimensional tensors that factorizes the tensor into a sequence of low-rank matrices. Essential for handling high-dimensional data efficiently.
- **Riemannian gradient descent**: Optimization method that respects the manifold structure, ensuring updates remain within the feasible set. Required for maintaining the low-rank constraint.
- **Preconditioning**: A technique to improve convergence by transforming the gradient space. Here, it adapts the metric to the data structure.
- **Manifold retraction**: A method to project updated points back onto the manifold after gradient steps. TT-SVD serves this role in the algorithm.
- **Tangent space projection**: Maps Euclidean gradients to the tangent space of the manifold. Modified here to incorporate the preconditioned metric.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input tensor -> Sampling pattern -> Initialization (TT-SVD) -> Preconditioned Riemannian Gradient Computation -> Retraction (TT-SVD) -> Output completed tensor

**Critical Path**: The algorithm alternates between computing the preconditioned Riemannian gradient and applying retraction via TT-SVD. The preconditioner construction and tangent space projection under the new metric are the most computationally intensive steps.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The preconditioner adds computational overhead but significantly reduces the number of iterations needed for convergence. The choice between adaptive and constant step sizes involves a tradeoff between theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

**Failure Signatures**: If PRGD is slower than standard RGD, it likely indicates the preconditioner overhead is not being offset by convergence gains. Divergence with constant step size suggests the step size is too large for the given sampling ratio.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Implement synthetic tensor generation with known TT-rank and verify the preconditioner computation on simple cases
2. Compare PRGD and standard RGD on a small synthetic tensor with varying step sizes
3. Test the initialization procedure on partial observations to ensure it satisfies theoretical requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees require specific initialization conditions that may not always be satisfied in practice
- The optimal step size depends on the sampling ratio and noise level, requiring careful tuning
- Implementation details for the orthogonal decomposition step in the preconditioner are not fully specified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core algorithmic framework and mathematical foundations are clearly specified
- **Medium Confidence**: Theoretical convergence analysis holds under stated assumptions, though practical initialization may vary
- **Medium Confidence**: Experimental results demonstrate significant computational improvements, though exact baselines for comparison are unclear

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the exact initialization procedure described in the supplementary materials to verify it satisfies the theoretical requirements
2. Benchmark PRGD against standard RGD using identical random seeds and initialization to quantify the claimed 2-order-of-magnitude improvement
3. Validate the orthogonal decomposition step (Definition 3.2) with varying tensor dimensions to ensure numerical stability across different problem scales
