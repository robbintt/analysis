# GCN-TULHOR: Trajectory-User Linking Leveraging GCNs and Higher-Order Spatial Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.11095
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11095
- Reference count: 39
- This paper proposes GCN-TULHOR, an enhanced trajectory-user linking (TUL) model that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with higher-order mobility flow representations to improve user identification from anonymized trajectory data.

## Executive Summary
GCN-TULHOR is a novel trajectory-user linking model that combines Graph Convolutional Networks with higher-order spatial representations to enhance user identification from anonymized trajectory data. The method unifies sparse check-in and continuous GPS trajectory data into hexagonal grid-based sequences, capturing richer spatial semantics and reducing sparsity. By explicitly modeling complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies, GCN-TULHOR outperforms classical ML methods, RNN-based models, and the state-of-the-art TULHOR, achieving consistent improvements in accuracy and F1-score across six real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
GCN-TULHOR integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with higher-order mobility flow representations to address the trajectory-user linking (TUL) problem. The method first converts heterogeneous trajectory data (check-ins and GPS logs) into unified hexagonal grid-based sequences, which reduces sparsity and captures richer spatial semantics. The GCN layer then explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies among users' mobility patterns. This combination of sequential modeling and graph-based spatial learning results in improved performance over classical ML methods, RNN-based models, and the state-of-the-art TULHOR, with 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1-score across six real-world datasets. Optimal performance is achieved with a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings.

## Key Results
- GCN-TULHOR consistently outperforms classical ML methods, RNN-based models, and TULHOR, achieving 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1-score.
- The method demonstrates the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with sequential modeling for trajectory-user linking.
- Optimal configuration involves a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of GCN-TULHOR stems from its ability to model both sequential and spatial dependencies in trajectory data. By converting heterogeneous trajectory data into hexagonal grids, the model reduces sparsity and unifies representations. The GCN layer then captures higher-order spatial flows and complex relationships among users' mobility patterns, enabling more accurate user identification. This dual approach leverages the strengths of both sequential modeling and graph-based spatial learning, resulting in robust and scalable TUL solutions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs):** Why needed: To model complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies in mobility data. Quick check: Verify that the GCN layer captures higher-order spatial flows effectively.
- **Hexagonal Grid Representation:** Why needed: To reduce sparsity and unify heterogeneous trajectory data (check-ins and GPS logs). Quick check: Confirm that the hexagonal grid encoding captures richer spatial semantics.
- **Trajectory-User Linking (TUL):** Why needed: To identify users from anonymized trajectory data, a critical task for privacy-preserving applications. Quick check: Assess the model's performance on real-world datasets with known user identities.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** Trajectory Data -> Hexagonal Grid Encoding -> GCN Layer -> User Identification
- **Critical Path:** The critical path involves the conversion of trajectory data into hexagonal grids, followed by the application of the GCN layer to capture spatial relationships, and finally the user identification step.
- **Design Tradeoffs:** The use of a single GCN layer balances model complexity and performance, while hexagonal grids reduce sparsity but may introduce some information loss.
- **Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may indicate issues with the hexagonal grid encoding or insufficient capture of spatial relationships by the GCN layer.
- **First Experiments:** 1) Test the model on a simple dataset with known user identities. 2) Evaluate the impact of different hexagonal grid resolutions on performance. 3) Conduct an ablation study to quantify the contribution of the GCN layer.

None

## Limitations
- The model's generalizability to datasets with significantly different geographic distributions or mobility patterns remains untested.
- The fixed single GCN layer may not capture all types of spatial dependencies in highly complex urban environments.
- The interpretability of GCN-derived spatial patterns could be improved.

## Confidence
- **Technical Design:** High
- **Quantitative Results:** High
- **Generalizability:** Medium
- **Scalability:** Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on additional datasets with diverse urban topologies and mobility behaviors.
2. Evaluate the impact of multi-layer GCN architectures on performance.
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of hexagonal grid encoding versus higher-order flow modeling.
