# Learning Pareto-Optimal Pandemic Intervention Policies with MORL

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.03340
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03340
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Multi-objective RL framework using SDE simulator achieves significantly higher fidelity (relative AUC errors of 0.29-0.79) than alternative approaches for pandemic intervention policy design

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework for designing pandemic intervention policies that balance epidemiological control and socioeconomic costs. The authors developed a stochastic differential equation (SDE) simulator calibrated against global COVID-19 data, achieving significantly higher fidelity than alternative simulator types. Training a Pareto-Conditioned Network (PCN) agent on this simulator produced non-dominated intervention strategies that adapt to different priorities and disease characteristics. The framework successfully extended to other pathogens including polio, influenza, and measles.

## Method Summary
The method trains a Pareto-Conditioned Network (PCN) agent using a stochastic differential equation (SDE) simulator with 5 compartments (Susceptible, Healthy, Infected, Quarantined, Deceased). The simulator is calibrated using OxCGRT and Our World in Data datasets, with transmission rate σ=0.020 determined via Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing on zero-intervention periods. Episodes run for 50 days (5,000 steps) with 3D reward vectors representing infections, deaths, and economic impact. The PCN is initialized with enumerated Pareto front solutions and trained to produce diverse non-dominated intervention strategies across different preference vectors.

## Key Results
- SDE simulator achieves relative AUC errors of 0.29-0.79 versus 236-2888 for agent-based models and 296-5501 for SIR models
- Cross-disease transferability: polio requires ~3x stronger interventions, influenza needs minimal measures, measles validates 95% vaccination threshold
- Agent produces diverse Pareto-optimal policies that adapt to different priority weightings without retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** SDE-based simulation produces higher-fidelity pandemic dynamics than agent-based or SIR alternatives
- **Mechanism:** Stochastic differential equations model population compartments with drift terms for deterministic progression and diffusion terms introducing multiplicative Gaussian noise proportional to subpopulation size
- **Core assumption:** Fluctuations in real epidemics can be approximated by Gaussian noise processes scaled to compartment sizes
- **Evidence anchors:** Relative AUC errors show SDE (0.29-0.79) significantly outperforms Agent-Based (236-2888) and SIR (296-5501) models
- **Break condition:** If epidemic trajectories exhibit non-Gaussian heavy-tailed fluctuations, the diffusion approximation may underestimate variance

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pareto-Conditioned Networks produce diverse non-dominated intervention strategies from a single trained network
- **Mechanism:** PCN conditions policy networks on preference or desired return vectors, enabling the model to map different priority weightings to corresponding Pareto-efficient actions
- **Core assumption:** The preference-conditioned policy can approximate the full Pareto front through single-network training
- **Evidence anchors:** Training with enumerated Pareto front initialization produces non-dominated strategies that adapt to different priorities
- **Break condition:** If the Pareto front is highly non-convex or discontinuous, single-network approximation may miss regions of the frontier

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Epidemiological parameter reparameterization transfers the framework across pathogens with distinct transmission profiles
- **Mechanism:** Disease characteristics (transmission rate σ, mortality rate ν, recovery rate φ) are explicitly parameterized in the SDE
- **Core assumption:** Cross-disease differences are adequately captured by parameter changes; intervention mechanisms remain structurally valid
- **Evidence anchors:** Framework successfully extended to polio (3x stronger interventions), influenza (minimal measures), and measles (95% vaccination threshold)
- **Break condition:** If pathogens require qualitatively different intervention types, the three-action framework may be insufficient

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL)**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard RL scalarizes rewards, collapsing trade-offs into single objectives. MORL preserves competing objectives to produce Pareto fronts rather than single "optimal" policies
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why scalarizing infections and economic costs into one reward might produce policies that are optimal for neither objective alone?

- **Concept: Compartmental Epidemic Models (SIR-family)**
  - **Why needed here:** The SDE simulator extends basic SIR with additional compartments to model intervention effects more granularly
  - **Quick check question:** What epidemiological state transitions are added by introducing a quarantined compartment Q?

- **Concept: Pareto Optimality**
  - **Why needed here:** Policymakers face trade-offs where improving one objective worsens another. Pareto-optimal policies represent the frontier where no objective can improve without degrading another
  - **Quick check question:** If policy A has (100 infections, 50 economic cost) and policy B has (80 infections, 70 economic cost), can you determine if either dominates the other?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** OxCGRT + OWID datasets -> SDE simulator (5 compartments) -> PCN agent (3D action space) -> Pareto front strategies
- **Critical path:** Calibrate σ=0.020 using KS test on zero-intervention data -> Validate simulator against held-out trajectories (AUC error <1.0) -> Train PCN with enumerated Pareto front initialization -> Verify policy adaptation across preference vectors
- **Design tradeoffs:** 3-action space enables interpretability but collapses 24 OxCGRT indicators; SDE chosen over agent-based models due to computational feasibility at national scale
- **Failure signatures:** Numerical instability in SDE solver; policy homogeneity indicating poor Pareto front coverage; transfer breakdown suggesting parameter scaling issues
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline validation: Run simulator on UK data with σ=0.020, confirm wavelike fluctuations and AUC error <0.5
  2. Pareto front sanity check: Train PCN with balanced objective, verify front spans moderate trade-offs
  3. Disease transfer test: Reparameterize for measles with 95% vaccination coverage, verify agent discovers near-zero additional interventions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How would incorporating age-stratified vaccination and mortality rates affect the learned Pareto-optimal intervention policies?
  - **Basis:** The authors state they do not model different vaccination or mortality rates based on age
  - **Why unresolved:** Population-averaged rates may misrepresent disease dynamics where age significantly influences transmission and mortality
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments with age-structured compartments compared against age-disaggregated epidemiological data

- **Open Question 2:** Can the framework be extended to handle waning immunity for pandemic planning horizons beyond 6-7 weeks?
  - **Basis:** The paper assumes permanent immunity, valid only for short time periods
  - **Why unresolved:** Real pandemics span months to years with reinfection risk
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Modified SDE model incorporating immunity decay rates, validated against reinfection data over extended horizons

- **Open Question 3:** How does real-world economic cost calibration change the Pareto-optimal trade-off surface compared to the relative cost model?
  - **Basis:** Economic cost is not calibrated with real-world costs and is mostly used for relative comparisons
  - **Why unresolved:** Policymakers require absolute cost estimates for budget allocation
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Calibration using country-specific economic data, followed by comparison of Pareto fronts against relative-cost formulation

## Limitations
- Diffusion approximation may inadequately capture non-Gaussian epidemic events like superspreader dynamics
- 3-action intervention space oversimplifies the 24 OxCGRT indicators, potentially missing nuanced policy effects
- Permanent immunity assumption restricts validity to 6-7 week episodes, limiting long-term policy evaluation

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Simulator calibration methodology and fidelity improvements over alternatives
- **Medium confidence:** Cross-disease transferability and vaccination threshold validation for measles
- **Medium confidence:** Pareto front quality and policy diversity across preference vectors

## Next Checks
1. **Noise sensitivity analysis:** Test simulator performance with alternative noise distributions to evaluate robustness to non-Gaussian epidemic fluctuations
2. **Policy granularity validation:** Implement expanded action space mapping more OxCGRT indicators and measure changes in intervention effectiveness
3. **Long-term immunity extension:** Modify simulator to include waning immunity and re-infection dynamics, then validate extended episode performance against longitudinal pandemic data
