# A Survey on Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.06869
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06869
- Reference count: 16
- This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL) methods that address the black-box nature of deep reinforcement learning systems.

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL) methods that tackle the inherent opacity of deep reinforcement learning systems. The authors systematically categorize XRL techniques into four levels - feature-level, state-level, dataset-level, and model-level - each targeting different aspects of RL decision-making transparency. The survey explores how these methods enhance understanding through various approaches including saliency maps, trajectory analysis, influence functions, and interpretable architectures. It also addresses practical applications such as policy refinement through human-in-the-loop correction and the dual nature of explainability in both launching and mitigating adversarial attacks.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic categorization framework for XRL methods, organizing them into four distinct levels based on what aspect of the RL system they aim to explain. Feature-level methods include saliency maps and attention mechanisms that highlight important input features, while state-level approaches focus on trajectory analysis and temporal explanation of decision sequences. Dataset-level techniques utilize influence functions and Shapley values for attribution analysis, and model-level methods involve interpretable architectures and rule extraction. The survey also examines evaluation metrics spanning qualitative assessments through user studies and quantitative measures including fidelity and performance impact.

## Key Results
- XRL methods are systematically categorized into feature-level, state-level, dataset-level, and model-level approaches
- The survey identifies both qualitative (user studies, interpretability) and quantitative (fidelity, performance impact) evaluation metrics for XRL
- Applications include policy refinement through human-in-the-loop correction and the dual role of explainability in adversarial attack dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of XRL methods stems from their ability to bridge the gap between complex neural network decision-making and human-understandable explanations. By decomposing the explanation task into different levels - from individual features to entire model architectures - these methods can provide targeted insights that match the user's needs and expertise level. The multi-level approach allows for both granular feature attribution and holistic model understanding, enabling users to trace decisions from input signals through intermediate representations to final actions.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Reinforcement Learning Basics** - Understanding Markov Decision Processes, value functions, and policy optimization is essential for grasping how XRL methods interface with RL systems.
   - Why needed: Provides context for how explanations integrate with RL learning and decision processes
   - Quick check: Can explain the relationship between states, actions, rewards, and policies

2. **Deep Neural Network Interpretability** - Familiarity with techniques like saliency maps, attention mechanisms, and activation visualization
   - Why needed: XRL methods often borrow from or adapt deep learning interpretability techniques
   - Quick check: Can describe how gradient-based saliency maps highlight input importance

3. **Attribution Methods** - Understanding Shapley values, influence functions, and other attribution techniques
   - Why needed: These methods form the basis for dataset-level and feature-level explanations in XRL
   - Quick check: Can explain the difference between local and global attribution methods

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Feature extraction -> State representation -> Policy network -> Action selection -> Reward feedback

**Critical Path**: Input observation → Feature importance analysis → State trajectory tracking → Policy interpretation → Action explanation

**Design Tradeoffs**: XRL methods must balance explanation fidelity (accuracy of explanations) against computational overhead and potential performance degradation. More detailed explanations typically require more complex computations, which can slow down real-time decision-making. Additionally, explanations that are too technical may not be useful for end-users, while overly simplified explanations may miss important details for debugging.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Explanations that contradict observed behavior indicate model-policy misalignment
- High computational overhead that impacts real-time performance
- Explanations that are technically correct but not actionable for users
- Adversarial exploitation of explanation vulnerabilities

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Apply saliency map-based feature importance to a DQN agent on Atari games and compare explanation quality across different game types
2. Implement trajectory-based state-level explanations for a policy gradient method and evaluate their effectiveness in identifying decision patterns
3. Test influence function-based dataset attribution on a deep RL model to identify which training examples most affect specific decisions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several critical open questions in XRL research, particularly the need for user-oriented explanations that provide narrative-based rationales accessible to non-experts, and developer-oriented explanations that enable actionable policy debugging and refinement. The dual-edged nature of explainability - where explanations can both enhance trust and debugging while potentially exposing vulnerabilities to adversaries - remains an important area requiring further investigation.

## Limitations
- The rapid evolution of the field means some recent approaches may be missing from the analysis
- The categorization framework may not capture all emerging hybrid techniques that span multiple levels
- The survey's focus on technical methods may underrepresent practical implementation challenges and real-world validation studies

## Confidence

**High**: The categorization framework and methodological descriptions are well-established and widely accepted in the literature

**Medium**: The applications section (policy refinement, adversarial attacks) accurately reflects current capabilities but may not fully capture future developments

**Medium**: The identified future research directions are plausible but may not represent all critical gaps

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic review of post-2024 XRL literature to identify any significant methodological developments not captured in this survey
2. Perform empirical validation studies comparing the effectiveness of different XRL approaches across multiple RL benchmarks
3. Evaluate the practical utility of XRL methods through controlled user studies with both technical and non-technical participants to assess explanation effectiveness and usability
