# A Machine Learning Pipeline for Multiple Sclerosis Biomarker Discovery: Comparing explainable AI and Traditional Statistical Approaches

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.22484
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22484
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: ML pipeline achieves F1-score: 0.75, Accuracy: 0.78, AUC: 0.86 for MS biomarker discovery using PBMC microarray data

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a machine learning pipeline that combines Bayesian-optimized XGBoost classification with SHAP-based explainability to identify biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis from eight PBMC microarray datasets. The approach achieves strong classification performance despite class imbalance and compares favorably with traditional differential expression analysis. The pipeline uniquely identifies known MS-associated genes like IL1B and IL2RA alongside novel candidates, demonstrating how explainable AI can complement traditional methods to uncover new insights into MS pathogenesis.

## Method Summary
The pipeline integrates Bayesian-optimized XGBoost for classification with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature importance analysis. It processes eight PBMC microarray datasets containing a total of 270 samples, with class imbalance ranging from 1:2 to 1:4 ratios. The approach systematically compares SHAP-identified genes with traditional differential expression analysis results, performing enrichment analysis on both sets to validate biological relevance through pathway and gene ontology analyses.

## Key Results
- Achieved strong classification performance: F1-score: 0.75, Accuracy: 0.78, AUC: 0.86
- Identified 167 overlapping genes between SHAP and DEA methods
- SHAP uniquely identified IL1B and IL2RA (known MS genes) plus novel candidates ABCA1, NDUFS5, and EIF2S2
- Enrichment analysis linked SHAP genes to sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr virus pathways

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline leverages XGBoost's ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in gene expression data while SHAP provides interpretable feature importance scores. Bayesian optimization tunes hyperparameters efficiently despite limited sample sizes. The combination allows detection of both well-known MS biomarkers and novel candidates that traditional methods might miss, particularly those involved in subtle regulatory networks rather than simple differential expression.

## Foundational Learning
- Bayesian optimization: Needed for efficient hyperparameter tuning in small-sample settings; quick check: convergence within 50 iterations
- SHAP values: Required for interpretable feature importance in complex models; quick check: sum of absolute SHAP values equals model output
- Differential expression analysis: Traditional statistical baseline; quick check: adjusted p-value < 0.05
- Pathway enrichment: Validates biological relevance of selected genes; quick check: FDR < 0.05 for enriched terms
- Class imbalance handling: Critical for reliable biomarker discovery; quick check: balanced accuracy metrics reported
- PBMC microarray limitations: Peripheral tissue may not capture CNS-specific mechanisms; quick check: sample size per dataset

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data preprocessing -> Bayesian-optimized XGBoost -> SHAP analysis -> DEA comparison -> Enrichment analysis

Critical path: Raw microarray data → normalization → model training → SHAP feature ranking → biological validation

Design tradeoffs: XGBoost offers superior classification but requires careful tuning; SHAP provides interpretability but computational cost increases with feature count; microarray data offers breadth but limited depth compared to RNA-seq

Failure signatures: Poor classification metrics indicate model underperformance; low overlap with known MS genes suggests feature selection issues; enrichment results lacking biological coherence indicate potential artifacts

First experiments: 1) Test different imbalance correction methods (SMOTE vs class weights); 2) Compare SHAP with permutation importance; 3) Validate top features using cross-validation stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample sizes across datasets (10-25 samples per class) limit generalizability
- Class imbalance may have influenced feature selection despite balanced metrics
- PBMC microarray data represents peripheral tissue that may not fully capture CNS-specific MS mechanisms
- Novel SHAP-identified genes require independent biological validation

## Confidence

High:
- Classification performance metrics (F1-score: 0.75, Accuracy: 0.78, AUC: 0.86) and SHAP implementation
- Biological pathway enrichment results showing connections to MS-relevant processes

Medium:
- Overlap analysis between SHAP and DEA methods (167 shared genes)

## Next Checks

1. Independent validation of top 20 SHAP-identified genes in a separate MS cohort using qPCR or RNA-seq
2. Functional validation through knockdown/overexpression studies in relevant immune cell models
3. Integration with single-cell RNA-seq data to assess cell-type-specific expression patterns of key biomarkers
