# FLDmamba: Integrating Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition with Mamba for Enhanced Time Series Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.12803
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12803
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** State-of-the-art long-term time series prediction on nine real-world datasets, outperforming Transformer and Mamba baselines

## Executive Summary
FLDmamba introduces a novel framework that integrates Fourier and Laplace transforms with Mamba architecture to enhance long-term time series prediction. The method addresses limitations of existing approaches by incorporating data smoothing, multi-scale periodicity capture, and transient dynamics modeling. By leveraging spectral decomposition techniques, FLDmamba demonstrates superior performance in capturing complex temporal patterns while maintaining efficiency in handling long sequences.

## Method Summary
FLDmamba processes time series through a multi-stage architecture: RBF kernel smoothing for noise reduction, followed by parallel FMamba and Mamba branches within FMM blocks for dual-domain feature extraction. The FMamba branch applies Fourier transform to the state space model's step size parameter, filtering it through a learnable kernel before inverse transformation. The final prediction layer uses Inverse Laplace Transform to reconstruct signals from damped oscillatory components. The model is trained on nine public datasets with varying lookback and forecast horizons.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across nine real-world datasets
- Demonstrates particular effectiveness in capturing multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics
- Shows robustness to noise while maintaining efficiency in long sequence processing
- Outperforms both Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Frequency-Filtered Discretization (FMamba)
If the step size $\Delta$ in State Space Models governs temporal granularity, applying spectral filtering to $\Delta$ prioritizes dominant periodicities and suppresses noise. The architecture computes $\Delta$ input-dependently, applies FFT, multiplies by a learnable kernel $\tilde{W}$, and inverts it back to produce a filtered $\Delta_F$. This "clean" step size is used for SSM discretization.

### Mechanism 2: Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) for Transient Modeling
If time series dynamics include oscillations and exponential decay, ILT basis functions ($e^{-\sigma t} \cos(\omega t + \phi)$) can reconstruct these dynamics more faithfully than linear layers. The model maps features to Laplace representation parameters and reconstructs the signal, enforcing an inductive bias toward damped oscillatory patterns.

### Mechanism 3: Parallel Dual-Domain Processing (FMM Block)
Optimizing for periodicity (Fourier) and local dynamics (Mamba) in isolation creates conflicting gradients. Parallelizing them allows independent feature extraction before fusion. The FMM block feeds input simultaneously into FMamba and standard Mamba branches, which are summed before final projection.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Discretization in State Space Models (SSM)**
*Why needed:* FLDmamba modifies the discretization step $\Delta$ that controls the "resolution" of the model's memory. Understanding $\Delta$ is essential to grasping why filtering it changes what the model learns.
*Quick check:* How does increasing the step size $\Delta$ theoretically affect the model's ability to distinguish high-frequency events in a standard SSM?

**Concept: Spectral Filtering (FFT)**
*Why needed:* The FMamba module relies on the convolution theorem to apply a learnable filter in the frequency domain. You must understand that multiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution (filtering) in the time domain.
*Quick check:* If the learnable kernel $\tilde{W}$ sets all high-frequency coefficients to zero, what happens to the sharp edges in the original signal after the Inverse FFT?

**Concept: Laplace vs. Fourier Transform**
*Why needed:* The paper explicitly differentiates them: Fourier for stationary periodicity, Laplace for transient/decaying dynamics. You need to know that Laplace handles non-stationary (exponential) components better than Fourier.
*Quick check:* Why would a Fourier basis struggle to efficiently represent a sudden spike that decays exponentially over time compared to a Laplace basis?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Input Layer (RBF Kernel smoothing) -> FMM Block (x2) -> FFT -> Linear -> Inverse Laplace Transform

**Critical path:**
The calculation of the filtered step size $\Delta_F$ in Algorithm 2 (Line 7-9). If the gradient fails to propagate through the FFT -> Filter -> IFFT chain, the FMamba branch collapses into a standard Mamba.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Efficiency:** Adding FFTs introduces $O(L \log L)$ complexity, which may become noticeable for very long sequences ($L > 10k$).
- **Inductive Bias:** The ILT output layer forces the model to predict smooth/decaying functions, excellent for physics/electricity but potentially brittle for financial data with abrupt regime shifts.

**Failure signatures:**
- **Over-smoothing:** If RBF bandwidth is too wide or $\tilde{W}$ filters too aggressively, the model outputs a flat line (mean prediction).
- **ILT Instability:** If learnable parameters of the ILT ($\sigma_n$) become negative, predictions may explode (gradient explosion).

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Sanity Check (Synthetic Data):** Generate a signal $y = \sin(t) + e^{-0.1t} + \text{noise}$. Verify FMamba captures the sine component and ILT captures the exponential decay better than a vanilla Linear head.
2. **Ablation on $\Delta$:** Run the model with $\Delta_F$ disabled (standard $\Delta$) vs. enabled. Plot the "step size" values over time to visualize if FMamba actually filters out noise spikes.
3. **Long Context Stress Test:** Compare inference speed and accuracy vs. iTransformer at $L=1500$ lookback to verify the claimed efficiency/accuracy tradeoff.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How can FLDmamba be adapted to handle continuously changing "dynamic data environments" or concept drift?
2. Does the specific mathematical formulation of the Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) limit the model when transient dynamics do not fit a damped oscillatory pattern?
3. Is the simple additive summation in the FMamba-Mamba (FMM) block sufficient for balancing periodic and transient features?

## Limitations
- Implementation details for Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) are not fully specified, including numerical method and number of singularities.
- Critical hyperparameters like RBF kernel bandwidth, ILT configuration, and FFT filter initialization lack detailed documentation.
- Results may be biased toward domains with clear periodic and transient patterns rather than purely stochastic data.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Core architectural innovations (FMamba parallel processing, frequency-domain step-size filtering) are well-documented and supported by theoretical reasoning.

**Medium Confidence:** Empirical superiority over baselines is demonstrated, but exact contribution of each component is not isolated through ablation studies.

**Low Confidence:** Claims about ILT's effectiveness in capturing transient dynamics lack external validation beyond this paper's results.

## Next Checks
1. **Synthetic Signal Test:** Generate a controlled signal with known periodic and exponential components to verify FMamba and ILT capture their respective features as claimed.
2. **Component Ablation:** Systematically disable RBF smoothing, FMamba branch, and ILT head to quantify each component's contribution to final performance.
3. **Non-Periodic Dataset Test:** Evaluate on datasets with minimal periodicity (e.g., financial time series) to test the method's robustness when spectral assumptions break down.
