# A Kernel-based Resource-efficient Neural Surrogate for Multi-fidelity Prediction of Aerodynamic Field

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10287
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10287
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves comparable accuracy to dense neural networks with 94-98% fewer parameters for multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces KHRONOS, a kernel-based neural surrogate that achieves high accuracy in predicting aerodynamic pressure distributions while using significantly fewer parameters than traditional dense networks. The method leverages a separable tensor product architecture combined with multi-fidelity learning, where abundant low-fidelity data from a vortex-based method is combined with sparse high-fidelity CFD data. KHRONOS demonstrates strong corrective capability on error-prone low-fidelity data, shifting 52.8% of low-accuracy cases to R² > 0.7 while maintaining inference times of 2.44-3.64 ms.

## Method Summary
KHRONOS is a delta-learning architecture that combines low-fidelity and high-fidelity aerodynamic data through a two-stage process. First, a low-fidelity surrogate is trained on abundant vortex-method data using a separable tensor product of B-spline kernels. Second, a correction model (Delta model) is trained to predict residuals between high-fidelity CFD results and the low-fidelity predictions. The method uses learnable per-dimension scaling parameters and quadratic B-splines with compact support to achieve parameter efficiency, with total parameters growing linearly rather than quadratically with input dimension. The approach was validated on predicting surface pressure coefficient distributions over 2D airfoils using the AirfRANS dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves R² ≥ 0.8 on high-fidelity data with only 0-30% high-fidelity samples available
- Uses 94-98% fewer parameters than baseline dense networks (MLP/GNN/PINN)
- Inference times of 2.44-3.64 ms versus 5.13-9.77 ms for baselines
- Corrects 52.8% of low-accuracy cases to R² > 0.7 through multi-fidelity delta learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Separable Tensor Product Decomposition
KHRONOS achieves parameter efficiency by decomposing high-dimensional mappings into additive combinations of rank-r tensor products of one-dimensional basis functions. Each input dimension is independently represented by compact 1D B-spline expansions; cross-dimensional interactions emerge only through outer products. This yields linear parameter scaling with input dimension d rather than the quadratic/exponential growth typical of dense networks. The target aerodynamic field exhibits low intrinsic dimensionality amenable to separable representation (Assumption: this holds for the airfoil Cp prediction domain tested, generalization to other physics is uncertain).

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Fidelity Delta Learning with LF-Conditioned Correction
A residual correction model conditioned on LF predictions can recover HF accuracy using sparse HF samples, particularly when LF errors are systematic rather than random. Stage 1 trains an LF surrogate on abundant low-fidelity data (NeuralFoil vortex method). Stage 2 trains a Delta model to predict residuals Δ = yHF - ŷLF→HF. The Delta model receives both geometry/flow inputs AND the normalized LF prediction as additional features. LF predictions contain useful structural information about the HF field; errors are correctable rather than orthogonal to the true signal.

### Mechanism 3: Localized Kernel Basis with Learnable Scaling
Quadratic B-spline activations with learnable per-dimension scaling parameters (γᵢ) adapt local smoothness while maintaining partition of unity, enabling efficient optimization with fewer epochs. Each input is mapped to a set of k uniformly-spaced kernel grid points; scaled distance dᵢs(xᵢ) = |xᵢ - gₛ|^γᵢ determines B-spline activation. This provides smooth, localized responses rather than global dense projections. The response surface is piecewise smooth and can be approximated by low-order splines; γᵢ > 0 allows adaptation to different sensitivity scales across input dimensions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Tensor decomposition / Separable approximations**
  - Why needed here: KHRONOS replaces dense layers with tensor products of 1D bases; understanding rank-truncated approximation helps diagnose underfitting vs. appropriate capacity.
  - Quick check question: Given a 5D input with rank-4 expansion and 30 spline elements per dimension, can you compute the total parameter count?

- **Multi-fidelity surrogate theory**
  - Why needed here: The delta-learning formulation assumes LF provides useful prior structure; knowing when this assumption holds informs data collection strategy.
  - Quick check question: If your LF model has R² = 0.3 against HF on a held-out set, would you expect delta learning to help? What if R² = 0.85?

- **B-spline basis functions**
  - Why needed here: The kernel layer uses quadratic B-splines with compact support; understanding locality and partition of unity properties clarifies why parameter growth is controlled.
  - Quick check question: For a quadratic B-spline with k=5 grid points on [0,1], how many basis functions are non-zero at x=0.5?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input layer → Normalization to [0,1]^d → Kernel layer → Per-dimension B-spline expansions (k elements, learnable γᵢ scaling) → Tensor product layer → Rank-r outer products across dimensions → Aggregation layer → Linear combination to output dimension (N_Cp = 81 surface points) → Multi-fidelity stack → LF model (trained first) + Delta model (trained on residuals, receives LF prediction as input)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Implement B-spline evaluation with learnable γᵢ scaling per dimension (Eq. 14)
  2. Build separable product aggregation matching Eq. 12 with configurable rank r
  3. Implement two-stage training: LF model → predict on HF domain → compute residuals → train Delta model
  4. Validate on held-out HF data with R² metric

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Rank (r) vs. accuracy: Higher rank captures more complex interactions but increases parameters; paper uses r=4 for LF, r=6 for Delta
  - Kernel elements (k) vs. resolution: More elements enable finer local detail but slow computation; k=3 worked best (Table 3)
  - HF/LF ratio: 10-30% HF was sufficient; diminishing returns beyond 30% for this problem

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Training loss plateaus early with high error → rank too low, increase r
  - Test error much higher than training → k too large causing overfitting, or insufficient LF coverage
  - Delta model fails to improve over LF-only → HF data too sparse or LF/HF inconsistency too large
  - Inference time approaches baseline → check for unnecessary dense layers mixed with kernel layers

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce Case 1 (0% HF) on a subset: Train LF-only KHRONOS with r=4, k=3; target R² ≥ 0.82 with <3,000 parameters. This validates the core kernel implementation.
  2. Ablate the Delta input conditioning: Train Delta model with geometry-only inputs vs. geometry + LF prediction; quantify the R² gap to confirm LF conditioning is necessary.
  3. Test scaling with input dimension: Fix other hyperparameters and vary number of geometry control points (16→32→64); confirm parameter growth is approximately linear as claimed in Figure 10 rather than the quadratic growth seen in MLP/GNN baselines.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does KHRONOS perform on out-of-distribution (OOD) airfoils and operating conditions compared to its interpolation performance?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly state the need to "test generalization to out-of-distribution airfoils and operating conditions" in the conclusion.
- Why unresolved: The current study evaluates the model only on NACA 4/5 digit families and specific flow conditions contained within the AirfRANS and NeuralFoil datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking R² scores and inference times on airfoil geometries (e.g., complex multi-element airfoils) and flight regimes explicitly excluded from the training distribution.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can adaptive HF/LF allocation policies improve the efficiency of the surrogate beyond the fixed 0%, 10%, and 30% ratios tested?
- Basis in paper: The paper lists exploring "wider and adaptive HF/LF allocation policies" as a direction for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current methodology relies on static, pre-defined mixing ratios of high-fidelity data rather than dynamic sampling based on error estimation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of an active learning loop that selects HF samples based on LF uncertainty, comparing convergence rates against the fixed-ratio baseline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does KHRONOS maintain its parameter efficiency advantage when scaled to 3D aerodynamic field predictions?
- Basis in paper: The paper limits validation to 2D airfoil surfaces (N_Cp=81); performance on 3D fields where tensor product dimensions increase is unverified.
- Why unresolved: While the theory suggests linear scaling, the rank (r) and grid point (k) requirements necessary to capture 3D flow structures without parameter explosion are unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the method to 3D wing or turbomachinery datasets, comparing trainable parameter counts against the 2D baselines.

## Limitations

- The method relies heavily on a separate technical report ([33]) for core kernel implementation details, creating a dependency gap for exact reproduction
- The airfoil geometry parameterization uses 16 control points with unspecified continuity constraints and optimization procedures
- Performance on out-of-distribution airfoils and operating conditions remains unverified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Parameter efficiency claims (94-98% reduction verified via Table 3 parameter counts) and inference time improvements (2.44-3.64 ms vs 5.13-9.77 ms) are directly measurable from the reported results
- **Medium confidence**: The delta-learning correction mechanism is theoretically sound and supported by convergent evidence from related multi-fidelity studies, but the specific 52.8% accuracy improvement for low-agreement cases would benefit from independent validation
- **Medium confidence**: The separable tensor decomposition achieving linear parameter scaling is mathematically justified, but the rank-4/rank-6 configuration choices and their sufficiency for capturing aerodynamic physics remain domain-specific

## Next Checks

1. Implement the B-spline kernel layer with learnable γᵢ scaling and verify the parameter count grows linearly with input dimension rather than quadratically
2. Conduct ablation studies on the Delta model's LF conditioning input to quantify the contribution of residual learning versus pure geometry-based prediction
3. Test KHRONOS on a different multi-fidelity physics problem (e.g., thermal simulations or structural mechanics) to assess generalization beyond aerodynamic field prediction
