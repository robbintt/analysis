# MEMFOF: High-Resolution Training for Memory-Efficient Multi-Frame Optical Flow Estimation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.23151
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23151
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** State-of-the-art optical flow estimation with 4× memory efficiency (2.09 GB at 1080p) and competitive accuracy across multiple benchmarks

## Executive Summary
MEMFOF introduces a memory-efficient multi-frame optical flow estimation method that enables high-resolution processing (1080p) on consumer-grade hardware. The approach extends SEA-RAFT to three frames while reducing correlation volume resolution, achieving significant memory savings without sacrificing accuracy. By incorporating high-resolution training with upsampled datasets, MEMFOF better captures large motions while maintaining competitive performance across Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. The method addresses the critical memory bottleneck in multi-frame optical flow estimation, making it practical for real-world applications.

## Method Summary
MEMFOF is built on SEA-RAFT architecture, extending it from two to three input frames while implementing correlation volume resolution reduction. The key innovation is a memory-efficient design that reduces GPU memory consumption to 2.09 GB at 1080p resolution, enabling inference on consumer hardware. The method employs high-resolution training using upsampled datasets to better handle large motions and improve accuracy. By optimizing the correlation computation and feature extraction pipeline, MEMFOF achieves 4× better memory efficiency compared to RAFT while maintaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple optical flow benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.355 EPE on Sintel clean pass
- 2.94% Fl-all on KITTI-2015 benchmark
- 3.289 1px outlier rate on Spring dataset
- 4× more memory efficient than RAFT (2.09 GB at 1080p)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MEMFOF works by extending SEA-RAFT's two-frame architecture to three frames while strategically reducing correlation volume resolution. This reduction maintains sufficient information for accurate flow estimation while dramatically decreasing memory requirements. The high-resolution training strategy, which uses upsampled datasets, enables the model to better capture large motions that are common in real-world scenarios. By optimizing the feature pyramid and correlation computation, the method balances accuracy and efficiency, allowing native 1080p processing without requiring specialized hardware.

## Foundational Learning
- **Correlation volumes:** Essential for matching features between frames; reduced resolution saves memory but may impact subtle motion detection
- **Feature pyramids:** Enable multi-scale processing; critical for handling large motions at different resolutions
- **Optical flow estimation:** Core computer vision task for motion analysis; MEMFOF extends traditional two-frame methods to three frames
- **Memory-efficient architectures:** Necessary for deploying models on consumer hardware; correlation volume reduction is a key technique
- **High-resolution training:** Improves performance on large motions; upsampling datasets helps capture more diverse motion patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input frames (3) -> Feature extraction -> Correlation volume reduction -> Feature pyramid -> Flow refinement -> Output flow

**Critical Path:**
Feature extraction → Correlation volume reduction → Feature pyramid → Flow refinement

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Memory efficiency vs. correlation volume resolution: Reduced resolution saves memory but may impact accuracy in textureless regions
- Three-frame extension vs. computational complexity: Adds motion context but increases processing requirements
- High-resolution training vs. dataset availability: Improves large motion handling but requires upsampled data

**Failure Signatures:**
- Textureless regions may produce artifacts due to reduced correlation volume resolution
- Subtle motions might be missed when correlation resolution is too low
- Performance degradation on real-world conditions not represented in curated benchmarks

**First Experiments to Run:**
1. Test correlation volume resolution reduction at different scales to find optimal balance
2. Evaluate three-frame extension benefits versus two-frame baseline
3. Assess high-resolution training impact by comparing with standard resolution training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily on synthetic and curated datasets, limiting real-world generalization
- Correlation volume reduction may introduce artifacts in textureless regions or subtle motion patterns
- Scaling behavior for resolutions beyond 1080p (4K and higher) remains unexplored

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Memory efficiency claims (2.09 GB at 1080p) - directly measurable and verifiable
- **Medium confidence:** Accuracy improvements - strong benchmark results but limited evaluation scope
- **Medium confidence:** Generalization claims - performance on curated datasets doesn't guarantee real-world robustness

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MEMFOF on real-world video sequences with challenging conditions (night scenes, rain, snow, high dynamic range) to assess robustness beyond curated benchmarks
2. Test the correlation volume reduction approach on 4K resolution inputs to determine if the method scales effectively to higher resolutions
3. Conduct ablation studies specifically focusing on textureless regions and subtle motion patterns to quantify the impact of reduced correlation volume resolution on accuracy
