# A Framework for Generating Artificial Datasets to Validate Absolute and Relative Position Concepts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.18177
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18177
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces Scrapbook framework to generate artificial datasets for validating AI models' understanding of object recognition, absolute/relative positions, and attribute identification

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Scrapbook framework, a methodology to generate artificial datasets for probing AI models' learned concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and attribute identification. By generating extensive questions about individual concepts with wide linguistic variation, the framework validates models' understanding of basic elements before tackling complex tasks. The approach addresses a critical gap in AI evaluation by providing controlled environments to systematically test model capabilities on fundamental visual and linguistic concepts.

The framework was tested with three visual language models (MobileVLM-V2, TinyGPT-V, and MiniGPT-4) to assess their performance on basic object recognition, positional reasoning, and attribute identification tasks. The experiments revealed that while models excelled at recognizing and enumerating objects, they struggled significantly with positional information and handling questions with additional constraints. The framework provides a valuable tool for generating diverse datasets to systematically assess and enhance AI model performance through targeted evaluation of specific conceptual understanding.

## Method Summary
The Scrapbook framework generates artificial datasets by creating controlled visual scenes with configurable attributes including geometric shapes, colors, and spatial arrangements. The methodology systematically varies linguistic complexity while maintaining consistent visual content to isolate model performance on specific concepts. Questions are generated with wide linguistic variation around individual concepts such as object recognition, absolute positions (top, bottom, left, right), relative positions (between, beside, above, below), and attribute identification (color, shape, size). The framework allows controlled testing of model capabilities by presenting the same visual information through different linguistic formulations, enabling researchers to identify whether failures stem from visual understanding or language comprehension.

## Key Results
- Models excelled at recognizing and enumerating objects across all three tested architectures
- All models struggled significantly with positional information and questions involving additional constraints
- MobileVLM-V2 showed significant answer disagreements and produced plausible wrong answers
- TinyGPT-V exhibited bias toward affirmative answers and struggled with geometric shapes and positional reasoning
- MiniGPT-4 encountered issues with plausible wrong answers and answer disagreements, particularly with absurd questions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by systematically decoupling visual understanding from linguistic complexity through controlled dataset generation. By creating artificial scenes with known ground truth configurations and generating questions that vary only in linguistic formulation while maintaining consistent visual content, the framework can isolate whether model failures stem from visual perception limitations or language understanding gaps. This controlled approach allows for targeted assessment of specific conceptual capabilities without confounding factors present in real-world datasets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Visual language model architecture** - Why needed: Understanding how models process and integrate visual and textual information; Quick check: Verify models use transformer-based architectures with vision encoders and language decoders
- **Absolute vs relative positioning concepts** - Why needed: Critical distinction for evaluating spatial reasoning capabilities; Quick check: Confirm models can distinguish between "the red circle is on top" vs "the red circle is above the blue square"
- **Controlled dataset generation** - Why needed: Enables systematic isolation of specific capabilities; Quick check: Validate generated datasets maintain consistent visual ground truth while varying linguistic complexity
- **Question-answering evaluation metrics** - Why needed: Standardizes assessment of model performance; Quick check: Implement classification of answers as correct, wrong, or plausible wrong
- **Model bias patterns** - Why needed: Identifies systematic weaknesses in model reasoning; Quick check: Analyze answer distributions for affirmative/negative response bias
- **Linguistic variation techniques** - Why needed: Ensures comprehensive testing across language formulations; Quick check: Generate multiple phrasings for identical visual questions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Question Generator -> Dataset Generator -> Model Inference -> Answer Classifier -> Performance Analysis

**Critical Path:**
Question Generator creates diverse questions -> Dataset Generator produces corresponding artificial images -> Model Inference generates answers -> Answer Classifier evaluates correctness -> Performance Analysis identifies model strengths/weaknesses

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Artificial vs real images: Artificial provides controlled ground truth but lacks real-world complexity
- Question diversity vs consistency: More variations test robustness but increase evaluation complexity
- Model selection: Three models provide initial validation but limit generalizability

**Failure Signatures:**
- High answer disagreement rates indicate model uncertainty or conflicting reasoning paths
- Bias toward affirmative answers suggests language comprehension issues
- Struggles with positional questions reveal limitations in spatial reasoning capabilities

**First Experiments:**
1. Generate dataset with simple object recognition questions and verify model performance
2. Create controlled positional questions (absolute positions only) to test spatial reasoning baseline
3. Introduce linguistic variation while maintaining identical visual content to assess language understanding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework focuses on controlled artificial datasets rather than real-world scenarios, potentially missing practical complexity
- Experiments evaluated only three specific models, limiting generalizability across visual language models
- Human judgment used for answer classification introduces potential subjectivity and inter-rater variability

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Models' consistent excellence in object recognition and enumeration across all three architectures
- Framework's effectiveness in generating controlled test scenarios

**Medium Confidence:**
- Models' weaknesses in positional reasoning based on limited artificial scenarios
- Observations about answer disagreement patterns and model biases
- Claims about linguistic variation impact on model performance

## Next Checks
1. Test the Scrapbook framework with a broader range of contemporary visual language models to assess generalizability of the findings
2. Validate the framework using real-world images with naturally occurring objects and positions, comparing results against the artificial dataset approach
3. Conduct inter-rater reliability studies for the human evaluation process to quantify and minimize subjectivity in answer classification
