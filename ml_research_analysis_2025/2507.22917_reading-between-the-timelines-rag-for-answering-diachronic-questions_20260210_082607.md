# Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.22917

- Standard RAG struggles with diachronic questions; TA-RAG improves accuracy by up to 27% on ADQAB benchmark.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the problem of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems failing to answer diachronic questions—those requiring analysis of trends or changes across extended time periods. Standard RAG methods focus on semantic relevance but often neglect temporal coherence, missing crucial information spread over the entire queried duration. To address this, the authors propose TA-RAG, a framework that enhances RAG with explicit temporal awareness at each stage. It disentangles query semantics from temporal constraints, employs a specialized retriever that balances semantic and temporal relevance, and structures retrieved context chronologically for coherent synthesis. To evaluate this capability, they introduce ADQAB, a benchmark for diachronic questions grounded in real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show TA-RAG significantly outperforms standard RAG, achieving up to 27% higher accuracy in answering complex, time-based questions. This work provides a validated pathway toward RAG systems capable of nuanced, evolutionary analysis for real-world queries.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces TA-RAG, a framework for answering analytical diachronic questions (ADQ) that require trend synthesis over time. TA-RAG disentangles query semantics from temporal constraints, uses a specialized retriever balancing semantic and temporal relevance, and structures retrieved context chronologically. It introduces ADQAB, a benchmark with 27,037 documents (real FNSPID news and synthetic data) and 50 diachronic questions. The approach involves time extraction (2-stage LLM), query decomposition, retrieval using hypothetical temporal embeddings, and generation with chronologically sorted context. Evaluation is done via Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where TA-RAG achieves up to 27% higher accuracy than standard RAG.

## Key Results
- TA-RAG outperforms standard RAG by up to 27% in accuracy on the ADQAB benchmark for diachronic questions.
- Optimal retrieval size is k=20; accuracy drops at k=50 due to context overload.
- Adding a standard semantic reranker degrades performance because it disrupts the chronological order of retrieved context.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TA-RAG works by explicitly modeling time at each stage of the RAG pipeline. It separates query semantics from temporal constraints, uses a hypothetical temporal embedding to guide retrieval, and ensures retrieved context is chronologically sorted for coherent synthesis. This allows the model to capture and reason over temporal trends, which standard RAG misses due to its focus on semantic relevance alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diachronic Questions:** Queries requiring trend or change analysis over time. Needed because standard RAG fails to synthesize temporal information. Quick check: Identify if a query asks for "trend," "evolution," or "change" over a period.
- **Hypothetical Temporal Embedding:** An embedding representing the temporal scope of a query, built by averaging embeddings of time-anchored sub-queries. Needed to guide retrieval toward temporally relevant documents. Quick check: Verify that the embedding is computed by averaging sub-queries anchored at sampled time points.
- **Chronological Context Sorting:** Ordering retrieved documents by publication time before generation. Needed to ensure coherent trend synthesis. Quick check: Confirm that context is sorted by $\hat{t}_{pub}$ before being passed to the LLM.
- **Two-Stage Time Extraction:** First extracts publication time, then event intervals, from text chunks. Needed to accurately ground events in time. Quick check: Validate that both stages are run and metadata is stored.
- **Adaptive Granularity:** Sampling temporal anchor points at varying frequencies based on the query's time range. Needed to balance coverage and noise. Quick check: Test retrieval with different granularities (e.g., monthly vs. quarterly) for year-range queries.
- **Context Overload:** Performance degradation when too many documents are retrieved (k too large). Needed to identify optimal retrieval size. Quick check: Plot accuracy vs. k to find the peak.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Document Chunks -> Time Extraction (LLaMA-3.1-7B) -> Metadata Store (PyRanges + Faiss) -> Query Processor -> Hypothetical Embedding Generator -> Temporal Filter -> Semantic Ranker -> Chronologically Sorted Context -> LLM Generator (LLaMA-3.3-70B) -> Answer

### Critical Path
Document chunking and time extraction (metadata generation) -> Retrieval (temporal filter + semantic ranking) -> Chronological sorting -> Generation. The retrieval stage is critical because it must balance semantic and temporal relevance to provide coherent context.

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Granularity vs. Noise:** Finer temporal sampling improves coverage but risks including irrelevant documents.
- **Context Size vs. Coherence:** Larger k increases information but risks "lost-in-the-middle" and context overload.
- **Model Size vs. Cost:** Using large LLaMA models ensures quality but increases computational cost.

### Failure Signatures
- Accuracy drops at k=50 (context overload).
- Adding a semantic reranker lowers accuracy (disrupts chronological order).
- Extracted temporal metadata does not match ground truth (extraction failure).

### 3 First Experiments
1. Run the two-stage time extraction pipeline on a held-out subset of ADQAB and verify extracted temporal intervals match ground truth.
2. Implement the hypothetical temporal embedding generator and test retrieval accuracy for queries spanning different time ranges, comparing adaptive vs. fixed granularity.
3. Run the full TA-RAG pipeline on a new diachronic QA dataset (e.g., from a different domain) to assess generalization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None.

## Limitations
- The approach relies on LLaMA models for both extraction and generation, which may not generalize to other LLM families or lower-resource settings.
- The claim of up to 27% improvement is based on a single benchmark (ADQAB), so robustness across diverse domains is untested.
- The paper does not provide a solution for the observed accuracy drop at higher k values (context overload).

## Confidence
- **High**: TA-RAG outperforms standard RAG on the ADQAB benchmark, as directly supported by reported results.
- **Medium**: General applicability to other diachronic question-answering tasks, since evaluation is limited to one domain.
- **Low**: Claims about optimal retrieval parameters (e.g., k=20) and the precise mechanics of the adaptive granularity heuristic, as these details are underspecified.

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the two-stage time extraction pipeline on a held-out subset of ADQAB and verify that extracted temporal intervals match the ground truth.
2. Implement the hypothetical temporal embedding generator and test retrieval accuracy for queries spanning different time ranges, comparing adaptive vs. fixed granularity.
3. Run the full TA-RAG pipeline on a new diachronic QA dataset (e.g., from a different domain) to assess generalization.
