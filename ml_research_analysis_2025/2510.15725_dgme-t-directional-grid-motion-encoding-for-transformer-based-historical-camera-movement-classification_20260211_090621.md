# DGME-T: Directional Grid Motion Encoding for Transformer-Based Historical Camera Movement Classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.15725
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15725
- **Reference count:** 28
- **Primary result:** DGME-T improves Transformer-based camera movement classification on modern data (accuracy 86.14%, Macro F1 87.81%) and on degraded historical footage (accuracy 84.62%, Macro F1 82.63%).

## Executive Summary
Camera movement classification models trained on high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film due to noise, missing frames, and low contrast. This paper introduces DGME-T, a lightweight extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion encoding derived from optical flow via a learnable, normalized late-fusion layer. The method boosts modern dataset performance and shows significant improvements on challenging WWII archival footage, demonstrating that structured motion priors complement transformer representations even in degraded conditions.

## Method Summary
DGME-T combines a Video Swin Transformer backbone with a directional grid motion encoding (DGME) head. The DGME head computes optical flow (Farneback), thresholds it, and bins flow angles into histograms over a 3×3 spatial grid to form a compact motion vector. This vector is normalized using z-score statistics from the modern training set and concatenated with the backbone's global feature via a learnable scalar α and LayerNorm. The model is trained with AdamW, cosine annealing, and intermediate fine-tuning on modern data before adaptation to historical footage.

## Key Results
- Top-1 accuracy improves from 81.78% to 86.14% on modern clips.
- Macro F1 increases from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips.
- Historical WWII footage accuracy rises from 83.43% to 84.62% and Macro F1 from 81.72% to 82.63%.
- Intermediate fine-tuning on modern data yields over five percentage points improvement on historical performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Explicit, localized directional priors compensate for the Transformer's insensitivity to fine-grained motion cues when visual degradation masks pixel-level dynamics.
- **Mechanism:** DGME computes optical flow, thresholds it, bins flow angles into histograms over a 3×3 grid, and concatenates this compact vector with the Transformer's feature via learnable α and LayerNorm.
- **Core assumption:** Optical flow extracts coherent motion vectors from archival footage despite noise, and these align with semantic camera movement classes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.2]: Proposes late fusion to overcome Transformer insensitivity to low-level directional motion cues.
  - [Section 5.2]: DGME-T improves Macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern data, reducing confusion between symmetric directions.
  - [corpus]: Related work confirms deep models struggle with generalization to historical footage.
- **Break condition:** If optical flow estimation fails completely due to extreme artifacts, the DGME vector becomes noise and the model relies entirely on the Transformer branch.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Domain alignment via z-score normalization is critical for transferring handcrafted motion features from modern to historical domains.
- **Mechanism:** Normalizes historical DGME features using modern training set mean and standard deviation before fusion, forcing historical inputs to match the classifier's learned feature space distribution.
- **Core assumption:** The difference in feature distribution is primarily scale and shift rather than fundamental inversion or distortion of motion semantics.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.3]: Anchoring historical features to modern scale ensures degraded motion cues are interpreted on the same range.
  - [Section 5.1]: Removing normalization reduces performance to 75.15% accuracy, a 10-point Macro F1 drop.
  - [corpus]: N/A (Mechanism is specific to this paper's implementation).
- **Break condition:** If historical footage exhibits systematic motion distortions not present in modern data, normalization may suppress unique identifying signals.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Intermediate fine-tuning on a large, clean modern corpus acts as a semantic booster for learning robust motion representations before adaptation to noisy historical data.
- **Mechanism:** Model is pre-trained on Kinetics-400, fine-tuned on consolidated modern corpus, then fine-tuned on HISTORIAN. Modern corpus provides high-quality gradient updates to distinguish subtle motion classes before encountering degraded historical data.
- **Core assumption:** Motion semantics in modern footage generalize sufficiently to historical footage despite domain gaps in visual quality.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: Cross-domain study shows intermediate fine-tuning on modern data increases historical performance by more than five percentage points.
  - [Section 5.1]: Macro F1 jumps from 75.13 (Kinetics-only) to 81.72 (Modern-Historical), with gains in difficult "zoom" class.
  - [corpus]: N/A.
- **Break condition:** Negative transfer occurs if modern motion patterns are distinct or contradictory to historical ones.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Optical Flow (Farneback Algorithm)**
  - **Why needed here:** DGME-T relies on optical flow as input to its motion head. Understanding that flow estimates pixel displacement is key to debugging why the grid histogram might fail on blur.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the Farneback algorithm estimate dense flow (every pixel) or sparse flow (key points), and how might film grain affect the resulting vector field?

- **Concept: Video Swin Transformer**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the backbone extracting $F_{swin}$. You must understand that it uses shifted windows for self-attention, capturing spatiotemporal context but potentially missing low-level directional bias.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a standard Transformer struggle to distinguish between "Pan Left" and "Pan Right" if it primarily attends to semantic objects rather than the background shift?

- **Concept: Late Fusion & Feature Normalization**
  - **Why needed here:** The core contribution is how the motion head is attached. Understanding that LayerNorm is applied specifically to the DGME branch to match the Transformer features' scale is critical.
  - **Quick check question:** If you concatenated $F_{DGME}$ directly without normalization or the learnable scalar $\alpha$, what would likely happen to the gradient updates for the Transformer backbone?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Input: 12-frame clip ($224 \times 224$)
  2. Branch A (Swin): Video Swin Base → Adaptive Global Pooling → Vector $F_{swin}$ ($C$ dimensions)
  3. Branch B (DGME): Farneback Flow → Magnitude Threshold → 3×3 Grid → Weighted Angle Histogram (12 bins + static) → L2-Norm → LayerNorm → Vector $F_{DGME}$ ($D$ dimensions)
  4. Fusion: Concat $[F_{swin}, \alpha \cdot F_{DGME}]$
  5. Head: Fully Connected Layer → Softmax

- **Critical path:** The extraction and normalization of the DGME features. While the backbone provides base accuracy, robustness and historical performance hinge on the stability of Branch B.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Handcrafted vs. Learned Flow:** Using Farneback (classic CV) is computationally cheaper than learned flow networks (like RAFT) but may be noisier on grainy footage.
  - **Late vs. Early Fusion:** Late fusion allows the backbone to remain unchanged (efficient transfer) but prevents motion features from influencing self-attention layers directly.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Class Confusion:** Model struggles with "Track" and "Zoom" on historical data. "Track" often fails because object motion contradicts camera motion in the flow field; "Zoom" fails when scale change is ambiguous.
  - **Normalization Drop:** If Macro F1 suddenly drops ~10 points, check if z-score normalization was accidentally disabled or applied using historical statistics instead of modern statistics.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce the Normalization Ablation: Train on Modern, test on HISTORIAN with z-score normalization enabled vs. disabled to verify the 10-point gap.
  2. Grid Sensitivity: Visualize the 3×3 DGME grid for failure cases (e.g., "Track" misclassified as "Pan") to see if foreground object motion is dominating the histogram.
  3. Alpha Analysis: Check the learned value of scalar $\alpha$. If $\alpha \to 0$, the model is ignoring the motion head; if $\alpha \gg 1$, it is over-relying on handcrafted cues.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Would alternative optical flow estimators (e.g., RAFT, PWC-Net) outperform Farneback on degraded historical footage?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Conclusion states "the framework can be extended by exploring alternative flow estimators."
  - **Why unresolved:** Authors use only Farneback, a traditional polynomial expansion method that may struggle with archival degradations.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparing DGME-T performance using learned flow methods versus Farneback on HISTORIAN, measuring accuracy changes per class.

- **Open Question 2:** Would mid-level or early fusion of motion features improve performance, particularly for track and zoom classes?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 5.2 states "With better domain calibration or mid-level fusion strategies, we expect the motion prior to yield further improvements."
  - **Why unresolved:** Current late fusion shows limited benefit for track and slightly hurts zoom on historical data; earlier integration could allow deeper interaction between motion cues and appearance features.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation comparing late, mid-level, and early fusion architectures on both modern and historical test sets.

- **Open Question 3:** Can learned domain adaptation techniques replace or augment simple z-score normalization for cross-domain transfer?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Removing z-score normalization causes a 10-point Macro F1 drop, yet this normalization relies on simple feature statistics.
  - **Why unresolved:** Authors demonstrate calibration is critical but only explore a basic statistical approach; domain adversarial training or distribution alignment methods may better handle diverse degradations in archival footage.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing z-score normalization against domain adversarial neural networks, MMD-based alignment, or learnable normalization layers in the fusion module.

## Limitations

- The paper does not specify the exact magnitude threshold for optical flow filtering or precise hyperparameters for the final training stage, which may affect reproducibility.
- Reliance on Farneback optical flow for degraded archival footage is a potential weakness if flow estimates are too noisy; the paper does not benchmark against learned flow methods.
- The normalization step is critical but may not generalize if historical footage has fundamentally different motion semantics.

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the improvement on modern footage (86.14% accuracy) and the ablation showing z-score normalization is essential (10-point Macro F1 drop when omitted).
- **Medium confidence** in the historical gains (84.62% accuracy) and the benefit of modern fine-tuning (+5 points), since these results depend on less thoroughly described training details and the robustness of optical flow on noisy data.
- **Low confidence** in cross-dataset robustness beyond the two studied domains (modern/Kinetics and WWII historical), as no other archival sources or video domains are tested.

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce the z-score normalization ablation on historical data to confirm the ~10-point Macro F1 drop when omitted.
2. Visualize the 3×3 DGME grid outputs for failure cases (e.g., "Track" vs. "Pan") to check if foreground object motion is corrupting the histograms.
3. Check the learned value of scalar α during training to ensure the motion head is contributing meaningfully and not being ignored or over-relied upon.
