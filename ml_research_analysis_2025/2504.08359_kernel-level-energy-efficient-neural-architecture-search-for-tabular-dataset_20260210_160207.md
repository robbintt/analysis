# Kernel-Level Energy-Efficient Neural Architecture Search for Tabular Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.08359
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08359
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Optimal architecture reduces energy consumption by up to 92% compared to conventional NAS

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of minimizing energy consumption in neural networks for tabular datasets through a kernel-level energy-efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method. Unlike previous approaches focused on vision and language tasks, this method specifically targets tabular datasets using a hardware-aware energy prediction system. The approach employs kernel-level decomposition to predict energy consumption and inference latency on NVIDIA GPUs, achieving significant energy savings while maintaining comparable accuracy to conventional NAS methods.

## Method Summary
The method uses a kernel-level energy consumption predictor inspired by nn-meter to accurately predict energy consumption and inference latency of neural networks on NVIDIA GPUs. It includes an enhanced algorithm that accounts for parallelism present in NVIDIA GPUs, making it compatible with both desktop and edge NVIDIA GPUs. The search employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent with a custom reward function that strictly penalizes architectures falling below an accuracy threshold while optimizing for minimal energy consumption. The approach uses one-shot NAS with weight-entanglement supernets across three search spaces (MLP, ResNet with FC layers, FTTransformer) and profiles latency and power for fused kernels on target devices.

## Key Results
- Energy consumption reduced by up to 92% compared to conventional NAS architectures
- Maintains comparable R2 scores to conventional NAS while achieving dramatic energy savings
- Successfully handles parallelism in NVIDIA GPUs through kernel merging algorithm

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Kernel-Level Decomposition for Energy Prediction
The system decomposes neural network graphs into fused kernels (e.g., Conv+BN+ReLU) and predicts latency and average power consumption for these kernels independently, calculating total energy as the sum of (Latency × Power) across all kernels. This approach provides higher accuracy than using proxy metrics like FLOPs by accounting for actual hardware execution patterns.

### Mechanism 2: Parallelism-Aware Kernel Merging
Standard sequential prediction methods overestimate latency and energy for architectures with parallel branches. The algorithm uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to detect kernels at the same graph depth that share configurations and merges these parallelizable kernels into a single virtual kernel with summed filter count, predicting performance for this merged entity rather than summing sequential executions.

### Mechanism 3: Accuracy-Constrained Energy Optimization
The search employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent with a custom reward function that strictly penalizes architectures falling below an accuracy threshold while optimizing for minimal energy consumption once the accuracy threshold is met. This decoupling of search objective from pure accuracy allows for significant energy trade-offs while maintaining practical performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Fused Kernels & Computation Graphs**
  - **Why needed:** Hardware executes layers in fused groups (e.g., Conv-BN-ReLU) as single kernels, not layer-by-layer
  - **Quick check:** If you define a network with Linear layer followed by ReLU, does the predictor see two separate energy costs or one?

- **Concept: Weight Entanglement in One-Shot NAS**
  - **Why needed:** The massive search space requires shared weights across architecture candidates
  - **Quick check:** How does the supernet share weights between a candidate block with 16 hidden units and one with 32 hidden units?

- **Concept: Power vs. Energy**
  - **Why needed:** The paper distinguishes these—sensors measure power (rate), optimization targets energy (power × time)
  - **Quick check:** If a kernel runs faster but draws double the power, does it necessarily consume more energy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Profiler -> Predictors -> Graph Analyzer -> Searcher
- **Critical path:**
  1. Kernel Rule Detection: Identify which layer patterns fuse on your specific hardware/backend
  2. Predictor Training: Profile thousands of these kernels to build Power/Latency lookup tables or regressors
  3. Search Loop: RL agent samples architecture → Graph Analyzer predicts energy → Supernet evaluates accuracy → Agent updates policy

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - *Latency vs. Accuracy:* Energy correlates with latency, so optimizing for energy often implicitly optimizes for speed
  - *Granularity:* Kernel-level prediction is more accurate than layer-level but requires profiling a large dictionary of kernel configurations

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Sensor Lag:** Power readings flat during inference indicates incorrect INA3221 kernel reconfiguration
  - **Prediction Drift:** 50% prediction error suggests parallel kernel merging is erroneously merging incompatible layers
  - **Collapse:** Accuracy drop indicates reward weight α is too lenient or supernet training failed

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Micro-benchmark Validation:** Recreate "Parallel vs. Sequential" kernel test (Figure 6) to verify graph-merging logic
  2. **End-to-End Profiling:** Take ResNet, predict energy using pipeline, compare against physical measurements to calculate prediction error (R2)
  3. **Ablation Search:** Run NAS on small tabular dataset twice—once optimizing for accuracy, once for energy—compare resulting architectural differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper explicitly states future work will leverage meta-learning techniques to streamline the cumbersome data collection process required for adapting to new hardware devices. The current method requires building a new kernel dataset and training predictors from scratch for every new target device, which is resource-intensive.

## Limitations
- Energy savings claims (up to 92%) primarily benchmarked against conventional NAS without comparison to other energy-aware approaches
- Method's effectiveness on classification tasks remains unexplored despite tabular datasets often being used for both regression and classification
- Computational overhead of kernel-level profiling and prediction may offset some energy gains during the search phase

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Kernel-level decomposition mechanism and parallel kernel merging algorithm are technically sound and empirically validated
- **Medium Confidence:** Energy prediction accuracy for tabular architectures is reasonable but may not generalize to other hardware platforms or model types
- **Medium Confidence:** RL-based search effectively finds energy-efficient architectures, though specific architectural differences could be more thoroughly analyzed

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Platform Generalization:** Test kernel-level prediction accuracy on different NVIDIA GPU (e.g., RTX series desktop GPU) to verify hardware transferability
2. **Architecture Pattern Analysis:** Compare specific architectural features (depth, width, layer types) of energy-optimized vs. conventional NAS models to identify systematic differences
3. **End-to-End Energy Accounting:** Measure total energy consumption including search phase itself to determine if kernel-level NAS provides net energy savings compared to simpler approaches
