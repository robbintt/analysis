# ImageInThat: Manipulating Images to Convey User Instructions to Robots

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.15500
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15500
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ImageInThat reduced instruction time by 64.8% compared to text-based methods

## Executive Summary
ImageInThat introduces a novel paradigm for instructing robots through direct manipulation of images. The system enables users to create robot instructions by manipulating images in a timeline-style interface, where they can directly modify objects and fixtures, order instructions chronologically, and receive visual feedback on changes. The approach leverages visual editing capabilities combined with language processing to translate image manipulations into actionable robot instructions. A comparative user study demonstrated that participants were significantly faster and more confident when using ImageInThat versus traditional text-based instruction methods for kitchen manipulation tasks.

## Method Summary
ImageInThat operates through a timeline-based interface where users manipulate images to create robot instructions. The system incorporates direct manipulation of objects and fixtures within images, a chronological timeline for ordering instructions, visual highlighting of modifications, language-based image editing capabilities, automatic captioning generation, and goal prediction features. Users interact with the system by making visual changes to images that represent desired robot actions, which are then translated into executable instructions. The system was evaluated against a text-based instruction method across four kitchen manipulation tasks, measuring completion time, error rates, and user confidence levels.

## Key Results
- Participants completed instruction-giving tasks 64.8% faster using ImageInThat compared to text-based methods
- Users showed higher confidence that robots would understand their instructions when using ImageInThat
- ImageInThat resulted in fewer errors, particularly missing steps, compared to text-based instruction methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of ImageInThat stems from leveraging humans' natural spatial reasoning and visual communication abilities. By allowing direct manipulation of visual representations rather than requiring translation into textual descriptions, the system reduces cognitive load and minimizes the gap between human intent and machine interpretation. The timeline interface provides an intuitive way to sequence actions, while visual feedback ensures users can verify their instructions match their intentions before execution.

## Foundational Learning
- Visual programming interfaces: Essential for understanding how graphical representations can encode complex instructions without requiring programming knowledge. Quick check: Can users create sequences without prior training?
- Human-robot interaction design: Critical for developing interfaces that bridge the communication gap between humans and robots. Quick check: Does the interface reduce ambiguity in instructions?
- Image-to-text translation: Fundamental for converting visual manipulations into executable robot instructions. Quick check: How accurately do generated captions represent intended actions?
- Timeline-based sequencing: Important for organizing multi-step processes in an intuitive manner. Quick check: Can users easily reorder and modify instruction sequences?
- Direct manipulation interfaces: Key principle for creating intuitive interaction paradigms. Quick check: Do users prefer direct manipulation over abstract controls?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Interface -> Image Processing Engine -> Natural Language Processing -> Robot Instruction Generator -> Execution Interface

**Critical Path:**
User manipulation actions → Image recognition and change detection → Caption generation → Instruction translation → Robot command output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Visual richness vs. processing speed: Higher resolution images provide better manipulation precision but increase processing time
- Automation vs. user control: More automatic features reduce user effort but may limit fine-grained control over instructions
- Interface simplicity vs. feature completeness: Simpler interfaces are easier to learn but may lack advanced capabilities

**Failure Signatures:**
- Misinterpretation of visual changes leading to incorrect instructions
- Timeline sequencing errors causing out-of-order robot actions
- Caption generation failures resulting in ambiguous or incorrect robot commands

**First Experiments:**
1. Test basic image manipulation features with simple object placement tasks
2. Evaluate timeline sequencing accuracy with multi-step instructions
3. Assess caption generation quality for various types of visual manipulations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focused on only four kitchen manipulation tasks, limiting generalizability
- Small sample size of 14 participants raises concerns about statistical power
- Did not evaluate long-term usability or learning curves for the interface
- No assessment of performance across diverse user populations or technical expertise levels

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| 64.8% reduction in instruction time | High |
| User preference for ImageInThat | High |
| Fewer errors with ImageInThat | High |
| Generalizability to complex tasks | Medium |
| Long-term usability assessment | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal study to assess learning curve and long-term usability across diverse user groups and task complexities
2. Expand user study with larger, more diverse participant pool testing wider range of robotic manipulation tasks beyond kitchen scenarios
3. Implement and evaluate translation of image instructions into actual robot actions in physical environment, assessing accuracy and efficiency
