# KAN-Matrix: Visualizing Nonlinear Pairwise and Multivariate Contributions for Physical Insight

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.15755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15755
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: PKAN and MKAN matrices use Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to characterize both strength and functional form of variable relationships, outperforming traditional methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PKAN (Pairwise KAN) and MKAN (Multivariate KAN) matrices that use Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to visualize nonlinear relationships between variables. The methods capture both association strength and functional form through color-coded visualizations, showing superior performance compared to Pearson correlation and Mutual Information on synthetic datasets with various nonlinearities and noise types. Applied to real-world hydrology data (CAMELS), MKAN-based feature selection achieved equivalent prediction performance with fewer attributes than traditional methods.

## Method Summary
The approach uses KANs to learn spline-based transformations on network edges, decomposing complex relationships into sums of univariate functions. PKAN analyzes pairwise associations by training single-input KAN models for each variable pair, while MKAN evaluates multivariate contributions by training multi-input models simultaneously. Association strength is calculated by multiplying normalized attribute scores with performance metrics (R²/NSE or KGE), scaled to 0-1 range. The method specifically addresses limitations of traditional correlation methods in capturing nonlinear functional forms and multivariate interactions.

## Key Results
- PKAN correctly identifies quadratic and cubic functional forms in synthetic data, with color intensity indicating association strength
- MKAN-based feature selection for CAMELS streamflow prediction required 12 attributes vs 14+ for traditional methods while achieving equivalent performance
- Heteroscedastic noise distorts recovered functional forms, making linear relationships appear logarithmic or square-root shaped
- Matrix asymmetry reveals non-injective relationships, where strong A→B associations may show weak B→A connections

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spline-Based Univariate Decomposition
If relationships can be decomposed into additive univariate functions, the model can visualize both association strength and exact functional geometry (e.g., quadratic, cubic). The architecture uses KANs to learn spline-based transformations on edges rather than fixed activation functions on nodes, allowing approximation of specific $y = f(x)$ shapes visually. Core assumption: The underlying relationship is fundamentally expressible as a composition of smooth univariate functions.

### Mechanism 2: Multivariate Contribution Scoring via Attribution
When multiple inputs are present, the model can suppress redundant variables better than pairwise correlation methods, provided a robust attribution metric is used. MKAN calculates an "attribute score" by propagating connectivity strength backward from output to input, then normalizes and multiplies by performance metric. Core assumption: Iterative backward propagation effectively disentangles unique contributions in presence of highly correlated inputs.

### Mechanism 3: Non-Injectivity Detection
The asymmetry of the matrix (where $A \to B$ is strong but $B \to A$ is weak) indicates non-injective relationships (many-to-one mappings), alerting users to irreversible information loss. Because the simplified KAN implementation uses only one function per cell, it fails to map inverse relationships, visually flagged as dropped strength scores. Core assumption: Restriction to single functional form per cell is a feature designed to explicitly reveal non-injectivity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - Why needed here: This theorem is the theoretical bedrock allowing the network to break down complex multivariate functions into sums of simpler univariate functions. Without this, the "functional form" visualization would not be mathematically justifiable.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a KAN places learnable functions on edges (connections) rather than inside nodes like a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)?

- **Heteroscedasticity vs. Homoscedasticity**
  - Why needed here: The paper specifically tests how noise types affect association recovery. Heteroscedastic noise (variance scales with magnitude) distorts functional forms differently than constant noise.
  - Quick check question: If you see a "fan-shaped" scatter plot where errors grow with the variable value, which type of noise are you dealing with, and how might this distort the recovered $\phi$ function in KAN?

- **Attribution/Contribution Metrics (L1 vs. Entropy)**
  - Why needed here: The paper moves beyond simple correlation to "contribution strength." Understanding how attribution is calculated (propagating standard deviations through edges) is necessary to interpret the color intensity in the matrices.
  - Quick check question: Why does the author multiply the attribution score by a performance metric (like R²) rather than just using the raw attribution score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Normalization -> Train KAN ($\phi$ functions) -> Calculate Attribute Score -> Multiply by Performance Metric (KGE/NSE) -> Render Matrix Cell

- **Critical path:** Normalize Data → Train KAN ($\phi$ functions) → Calculate Attribute Score → Multiply by Performance Metric (KGE/NSE) → Render Matrix Cell

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Interpretability vs. Accuracy: The implementation restricts the network to simple structures (e.g., one function per cell). This makes non-injective relationships fail (low score) rather than fitting them opaquely.
  - Metric Choice: The paper suggests both Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). NSE is more sensitive to peaks (conditional on the domain); KGE balances bias and correlation.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Logarithmic" distortion: If inputs are noisy (heteroscedastic), the recovered functional form may erroneously look logarithmic or square-root shaped
  - Zero-strength for known relationships: If $x_2$ is a quadratic function of $x_1$, trying to predict $x_1$ from $x_2$ will fail (non-injective). Do not interpret this as "no relationship," but rather "no injective function."

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Generate $y=x^2$ and $z=x^3$. Confirm that PKAN identifies the curves and that the inverse mapping ($y \to x$) fails as expected.
  2. Add heteroscedastic noise to a linear relationship. Verify that MKAN matrix prefers the noise-free variable (if available) and observe the distortion in the $\phi$ line.
  3. Train a Random Forest on a known dataset (like CAMELS) using the top $N$ features ranked by MKAN vs. Pearson. Check if MKAN achieves target accuracy with fewer features.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the KAN-matrix framework be extended to represent non-injective relationships using multiple functional forms per cell without compromising visual interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that the current implementation fails for non-injective mappings (e.g., inverse quadratic) and leave incorporating multiple functions per cell "for future extensions."
- Why unresolved: The current architecture is restricted to a single function per input-target pair to maintain a simple, interpretable visualization, causing it to miss complex inverse dependencies.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified KAN architecture that successfully visualizes superposed functions in a single matrix cell while retaining readable strength metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does increasing the number of hidden-layer nodes to capture complex interactions affect the balance between model performance and the simplicity of the matrix visualization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that increasing hidden layers addresses limitations but uses a simplified single-layer architecture to "maximize interpretability."
- Why unresolved: The trade-off curve between the granularity of physical interactions captured by deeper networks and the ease of human interpretation is unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking studies comparing single-layer vs. multi-layer KAN matrices on datasets with known synergistic variable interactions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the specific thresholds of signal-to-noise ratio required to recover accurate functional forms in the presence of heteroscedastic noise?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates that heteroscedastic noise distorts functional forms but does not establish precise limits for reliable recovery.
- Why unresolved: The results show qualitative degradation, but a quantitative boundary for robustness is missing.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic sensitivity analysis measuring the divergence between recovered and ground-truth functions across varying noise magnitudes and types.

## Limitations
- Reliance on single-layer KAN architectures may limit ability to capture highly complex multivariate relationships
- Exact attribution calculation algorithm requires clarification for faithful reproduction
- Claims about revealing "physical insights" in fluid dynamics simulations are largely qualitative without quantitative validation metrics

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core PKAN visualization mechanism for pairwise relationships is well-established through Liu et al.'s KAN work
- **Medium Confidence:** MKAN contribution attribution methodology and superiority in feature selection for CAMELS data supported by specific quantitative comparisons
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about revealing "physical insights" in fluid dynamics simulations lack quantitative validation metrics

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary spline grid resolution and KAN depth on synthetic datasets to quantify impact on recovered functional forms and association strengths
2. Construct synthetic datasets with varying degrees of multicollinearity among predictors to empirically test MKAN's advantage in disentangling redundant contributions
3. Apply PKAN/MKAN to benchmark datasets across diverse domains (biology, economics, engineering) to validate domain-agnostic interpretability and compare performance against established nonlinear association measures
