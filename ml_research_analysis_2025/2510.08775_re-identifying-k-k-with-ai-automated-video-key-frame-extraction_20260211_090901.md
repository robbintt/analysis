# Re-Identifying Kākā with AI-Automated Video Key Frame Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08775
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08775
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AI-automated pipeline extracts key frames from kākā videos, achieving up to 98.6% re-identification accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study introduces an AI-automated pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of kākā (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened New Zealand parrot, to improve individual animal re-identification. Traditional monitoring methods like leg banding are invasive and time-consuming, while existing wildlife re-ID approaches often neglect the importance of selecting informative frames from video footage. The proposed methodology integrates object detection using a fine-tuned YOLO model (Kākā-YOLO), optical flow blur detection, image embedding with DINOv2, and clustering techniques (k-means and k-medoids, with optional UMAP dimensionality reduction) to extract representative key frames. Evaluated across three video datasets collected at a custom feeder, the approach achieved high re-identification accuracy—up to 98.6% for individual kākā—demonstrating its effectiveness compared to heuristic methods. The pipeline offers a non-invasive, efficient alternative for wildlife monitoring and lays the groundwork for scalable re-ID in more complex environments.

## Method Summary
The pipeline processes wildlife feeder videos through four stages: (1) Object detection using a fine-tuned YOLO11m model (Kākā-YOLO) to identify and crop kākā birds, (2) Optical flow-based filtering to remove the top 20% highest-motion frames per video, reducing blur, (3) Embedding detected frames using DINOv2 ViT-S to generate 384-dimensional feature vectors, and (4) Clustering with k-means or k-medoids (k=5-20, selected via max silhouette score) to select representative key frames, optionally preceded by UMAP dimensionality reduction. Re-identification is performed by matching key frame embeddings to a database using cosine similarity with majority voting for video-level predictions.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 98.6% re-identification accuracy for individual kākā birds
- DINOv2 embeddings outperformed ResNet50 and AIMv2 baselines, particularly on lower-resolution Dataset A
- Clustering provided pose coverage but was statistically similar to random selection in controlled feeder environments
- Silhouette scores were often low or ambiguous, indicating clustering quality may not reliably indicate optimal key frame selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Discarding frames with high motion magnitude reduces noise and improves the quality of the candidate set for embedding.
- **Mechanism:** The pipeline calculates dense optical flow (Gunnar Farnebäck) between consecutive frames to estimate pixel displacement. Frames scoring in the top 20% of motion are discarded, as high displacement correlates with motion blur which degrades feature matching.
- **Core assumption:** High optical flow magnitude is a reliable proxy for image unusability in this specific feeder context.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section]: Section IV.C details the removal of the top 20% high-motion frames to "effectively reduce blurred images."
  - [figure]: Figure 6 visualizes the correlation between motion scores and bird activity (feeding vs. moving).
  - [corpus]: External literature on key frame extraction (e.g., *Efficient Retail Video Annotation*) supports filtering frames based on quality metrics, though specific optical flow thresholds are dataset-dependent.
- **Break condition:** Fast shutter speeds or high frame rates where motion blur is negligible, making flow-based filtering redundant.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Clustering image embeddings selects a diverse, representative subset of poses, mitigating the redundancy of extracting every frame.
- **Mechanism:** An image encoder (DINOv2) converts frames into vector embeddings. Clustering algorithms (k-means/k-medoids) group visually similar frames. Selecting the cluster centroids (or medoids) preserves the variance of the bird's poses found in the video while minimizing storage.
- **Core assumption:** The visual diversity of a video is best captured by partitioning the embedding space into discrete clusters; Assumption: Silhouette scores reliably indicate the optimal number of clusters for re-ID tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: Mentions using "image embedding with DINOv2, and clustering techniques... to extract representative key frames."
  - [section]: Section V.F notes that clustering helps ensure pose coverage, though in controlled environments, it performed statistically similarly to random selection.
  - [corpus]: Neighbors like *Spatio-temporal Graph Learning on Adaptive Mined Key Frames* validate the general principle that adaptive frame selection improves tracking/re-ID over uniform sampling.
- **Break condition:** Extremely short video clips where the number of valid frames is lower than the minimum cluster parameter $k$, forcing all frames to be kept.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Self-supervised Vision Transformer features enable robust individual distinction without species-specific training.
- **Mechanism:** The DINOv2 model, trained on generic images, generates embeddings that capture fine-grained semantic features (e.g., beak morphology). The pipeline identifies individuals by computing the cosine similarity between the key frame embeddings and a database of known birds.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-trained features of DINOv2 are sufficiently granular to distinguish between visually similar individuals of a species not seen during pre-training.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section]: Section IV.E describes using DINOv2 embeddings and cosine similarity for matching.
  - [table]: Table V shows DINOv2 outperforming ResNet50 and AIMv2 on Dataset A (lowest resolution), indicating robust feature extraction.
  - [corpus]: *Wildlife Target Re-Identification Using Self-supervised Learning* confirms that SSL is effective for non-human subjects, reducing the need for labeled data.
- **Break condition:** Significant domain shift where the pre-trained model's features are too generic to differentiate individuals with very subtle markings (e.g., uniform-colored species).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Dense Optical Flow
  - **Why needed here:** Used to quantify motion between frames to automate blur detection. Without understanding flow vectors, one cannot implement the noise-filtering stage of the pipeline.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the Farnebäck algorithm approximate pixel motion compared to sparse optical flow (e.g., Lucas-Kanabe)?

- **Concept:** Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in Vision (DINOv2)
  - **Why needed here:** The pipeline relies on pre-trained embeddings rather than training a classifier from scratch. Understanding SSL explains why the model works on Kākā without Kākā training labels.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does DINOv2 use a teacher-student architecture, and how does it prevent representational collapse without negative pairs?

- **Concept:** k-medoids Clustering
  - **Why needed here:** Used to select actual frames (medoids) rather than synthetic averages (centroids). This ensures the selected "key frame" is a real, valid image from the video.
  - **Quick check question:** How does k-medoids differ from k-means regarding outlier sensitivity and the interpretability of cluster centers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Ingest: Video → Frame Extraction → Filter: Kākā-YOLO + Farnebäck → Candidate Frames → Select: DINOv2 → UMAP → k-medoids → Key Frames → Match: DINOv2 → Cosine Similarity → Re-ID

- **Critical path:** The quality of the **Kākā-YOLO** model and the **blur threshold** are the strict bottlenecks. If YOLO fails to crop the bird correctly, or if the blur threshold is too permissive, the subsequent embedding and clustering steps will process garbage data.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **k-medoids vs. Random Selection:** The paper found that in controlled environments (feeder), random selection is statistically competitive with clustering (Section V.F). Clustering adds computational overhead (embedding *all* candidates before selection) that may not be justified if pose variation is low.
  - **UMAP:** Added to handle the "curse of dimensionality" for short videos, but UMAP parameters (n_neighbors) require tuning based on frame count.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Low Silhouette Scores:** If scores cluster near 0 or -1 (Figure 10e), the frames are too uniform or too noisy, making cluster-based selection arbitrary.
  - **Database Misses:** High anomaly scores or low cosine similarity indicate the "closed-set" assumption is violated (a new bird is present) or lighting conditions have drifted from the training setup.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate YOLO Generalization:** Run the fine-tuned Kākā-YOLO on a sample of the new "trail camera" footage mentioned in Future Work to verify detection rates before deploying the full pipeline.
  2. **Blur Threshold Calibration:** Plot the distribution of Farnebäck motion scores for a sample video. Verify that the "top 20% cutoff" actually corresponds to visually blurry frames in your specific hardware setup (Section IV.C).
  3. **Embedding Baseline:** Compare DINOv2 embeddings against the ResNet50 baseline on a small held-out set to confirm DINOv2's superiority holds for your specific data subset (replicating Table V).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the proposed key frame extraction pipeline maintain high re-identification accuracy when applied to unconstrained trail camera footage?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "Future work will entail expanding our datasets by collecting trail media," and explicitly note that extending the study to trail camera footage is necessary to evaluate effectiveness in more diverse environments.
- Why unresolved: The current study is limited to a controlled feeder environment with consistent lighting and minimal occlusion, which may not reflect the complexity of wild environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the pipeline on new datasets collected from trail cameras to compare accuracy against the controlled feeder results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does clustering-based selection provide a significant advantage over random selection specifically when high pose variability is present?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors found random selection surprisingly competitive, hypothesizing this was due to the feeder setup minimizing pose variation, suggesting clustering may only be superior in less controlled scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The controlled nature of the feeder data restricted the bird's range of motion, making it difficult to determine if clustering effectively captures diverse poses better than random sampling.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis on a dataset with high pose variance to test if clustering yields statistically significant improvements over random selection.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does supervised fine-tuning of the image embedding encoder improve re-identification performance compared to the unsupervised approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that "fine-tuning with a labelled dataset could further improve our encoders' performance and will be explored in later studies."
- Why unresolved: The study intentionally utilized an unsupervised framework using pre-trained models (DINOv2) to avoid reliance on labeled data, leaving the potential accuracy gains from fine-tuning unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training a loss head on the labeled kākā dataset and measuring the resulting change in re-identification accuracy.

## Limitations

- Optical flow threshold generalization: Fixed "top 20% highest motion" filter lacks dataset-agnostic calibration method
- Dataset specificity: Evaluation limited to controlled feeder videos with consistent lighting and background
- Silhouette score reliability: Often low or ambiguous scores suggest metric may not reliably indicate optimal key frame selection

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Pipeline's core architecture (detection → filtering → embedding → clustering) is technically sound and well-documented; DINOv2's effectiveness for re-ID is supported by external literature
- **Medium Confidence:** Optical flow-based blur detection works in feeder context but threshold not rigorously justified for broader application
- **Low Confidence:** Claim that clustering consistently outperforms random selection is weak; paper shows clustering statistically similar to random choice in controlled settings

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate YOLO Generalization:** Test the fine-tuned Kākā-YOLO detector on a small sample of unlabeled trail camera footage to verify detection performance before full pipeline deployment

2. **Calibrate Blur Threshold:** Plot the distribution of optical flow motion scores for a sample video and visually confirm that the "top 20%" cutoff corresponds to genuinely blurry frames in your specific hardware setup

3. **Validate UMAP Handling:** Test the pipeline on videos with fewer than 5 candidate frames to ensure the logic for bypassing dimensionality reduction (when frame count < n_components) is correctly implemented and doesn't introduce errors
