core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of enabling Large Language Models
  (LLMs) to accurately answer questions over proprietary enterprise documentation
  that is not part of their training data. The authors propose a KG-RAG system that
  builds a high-quality Knowledge Graph (KG) incrementally from enterprise documents
  using techniques including seed concept-based entity resolution, similarity-based
  deduplication, confidence scoring of entity-relation pairs, and provenance tracking.

# From Documents to Dialogue: Building KG-RAG Enhanced AI Assistants

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.15237
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15237
- **Reference count**: 26
- **Key outcome**: KG-RAG system reduces irrelevant answers by over 50% and increases fully relevant answers by 88% compared to vector similarity baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) system designed to enable Large Language Models to accurately answer questions using proprietary enterprise documentation. The system builds a high-quality knowledge graph incrementally from enterprise documents using entity resolution, deduplication, confidence scoring, and provenance tracking. By retrieving relevant knowledge graph tuples as context before generating responses with an LLM, the approach significantly improves answer quality compared to traditional vector similarity search methods.

## Method Summary
The KG-RAG system employs a multi-stage pipeline for constructing and utilizing a knowledge graph from enterprise documents. First, it performs entity resolution using seed concepts to identify and link entities across documents. The system then applies similarity-based deduplication to eliminate redundant information and assigns confidence scores to entity-relation pairs. Provenance tracking maintains document-to-knowledge-graph mappings for traceability. During query processing, the system retrieves relevant KG tuples as contextual information before passing them to an LLM for response generation. The incremental construction approach allows the knowledge graph to evolve as new documents become available while maintaining quality through continuous validation mechanisms.

## Key Results
- Reduced irrelevant answers by over 50% compared to vector similarity baseline
- Increased fully relevant answers by 88% over baseline system
- Achieved average cosine similarity of 0.89 between KG-RAG responses and ground-truth answers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The KG-RAG approach succeeds by creating a structured, interconnected representation of enterprise knowledge that captures relationships and context more effectively than simple document embeddings. By resolving entities to canonical forms and maintaining provenance information, the system ensures consistency and traceability. The confidence scoring mechanism filters out low-quality or uncertain knowledge, while the incremental construction allows the knowledge graph to adapt to evolving enterprise documentation without requiring complete rebuilds.

## Foundational Learning
- **Entity Resolution**: Why needed - to link mentions of the same real-world entity across different documents; Quick check - verify entities are correctly mapped to canonical forms using seed concepts
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Why needed - to capture structured relationships between entities rather than just document similarity; Quick check - validate that entity-relation pairs accurately represent document content
- **Provenance Tracking**: Why needed - to maintain traceability between knowledge graph entries and source documents; Quick check - confirm document-to-KG mappings are preserved and accessible
- **Incremental Construction**: Why needed - to allow knowledge graph to evolve with new documents without complete rebuilds; Quick check - test system performance across multiple construction cycles
- **Confidence Scoring**: Why needed - to filter uncertain or low-quality knowledge from the graph; Quick check - verify high-confidence entries correspond to accurate information
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Why needed - to provide relevant KG tuples as context for LLM response generation; Quick check - confirm retrieved tuples are semantically related to user queries

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Documents -> Entity Resolution -> Deduplication -> Confidence Scoring -> Knowledge Graph -> Retrieval Engine -> LLM -> Response
**Critical Path**: Document ingestion → Entity resolution → KG construction → Query retrieval → LLM generation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Structured knowledge graph provides better relationship capture but requires more processing overhead compared to simple vector embeddings
**Failure Signatures**: Incorrect entity resolution leads to knowledge fragmentation; poor confidence scoring introduces noise into the KG; inadequate provenance tracking breaks traceability
**First Experiments**:
1. Test entity resolution accuracy on sample documents with known entity mappings
2. Validate knowledge graph construction quality by checking entity-relation pair accuracy
3. Evaluate retrieval relevance by comparing retrieved KG tuples against ground-truth context

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on single dataset of 100 questions, limiting generalizability across domains
- Evaluation focuses on cosine similarity without addressing hallucination or factual consistency
- No details provided on documentation size or complexity for assessing real-world scalability
- Incremental construction performance over multiple cycles not extensively validated
- No benchmarking against advanced RAG approaches or commercial solutions

## Confidence
- High confidence in reported 88% improvement over vector similarity baseline
- Medium confidence in cosine similarity (0.89) as comprehensive quality measure
- Medium confidence in general KG-RAG construction methodology

## Next Checks
1. Test system on multiple diverse datasets across different domains to validate 50% reduction in irrelevant answers and 88% increase in fully relevant answers
2. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess factual consistency, hallucination rates, and practical usability beyond cosine similarity metrics
3. Benchmark against state-of-the-art RAG systems and commercial solutions to establish relative performance in enterprise settings
