## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.26353
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26353

- Primary result: Meta-labeling with reliability estimator improves precision to 70-83% while reducing execution rate to 2-6%

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the lack of transparency and reliability in large neural network models used for financial forecasting, which poses challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. The authors propose three approaches to improve explainability and reliability in AI-driven financial time series forecasting. First, they use Time-LLM with Prompt-as-Prefix to incorporate human-readable technical analysis cues, improving directional forecasting accuracy. Second, they combine foundation models with a reliability estimator (meta-labeling) to filter unreliable predictions, increasing precision while reducing false positives. Third, they introduce symbolic reasoning based on domain rules to provide transparent, rule-based justifications for execution decisions. Experiments on equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false positives and supports selective execution. The meta-labeling model with Chronos and a reliability estimator achieved higher precision (e.g., 70% up-trend, 83% down-trend) at the cost of lower recall and execution rate. The integration of predictive performance, reliability estimation, and rule-based reasoning advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a three-pronged approach to improve explainability and reliability in financial time series forecasting. First, they use Time-LLM with Prompt-as-Prefix to incorporate human-readable technical analysis cues into the forecasting process. Second, they implement meta-labeling with a reliability estimator to filter unreliable predictions, reducing false positives. Third, they incorporate symbolic reasoning with domain rules for transparent, auditable justifications. The architecture combines a primary forecasting model (M1, e.g., Chronos), a secondary reliability estimator (M2), and a symbolic reasoning layer that evaluates domain rules. Experiments on equity (SPY) and cryptocurrency (BTC) data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in improving precision while providing interpretable decision-making.

## Key Results
- Meta-labeling with reliability estimator improved precision to 70% (Up) and 83% (Down) for SPY, compared to 55% and 32% without filtering
- Execution rate dropped significantly to 2-6% due to conservative filtering of unreliable predictions
- Prompt-as-Prefix with Time-LLM improved directional forecasting accuracy by conditioning on technical analysis cues
- Symbolic reasoning layer provides transparent, rule-based justifications for execution decisions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prompt-as-Prefix with Time-LLM improves directional forecast accuracy by conditioning the model on domain context.
- Mechanism: Time series sequences are embedded into high-dimensional vectors, then concatenated with human-readable prompt vectors (containing domain notes, statistics, and geometric cues like support/resistance lines) before being input to a frozen LLM. The prompt activates the model's prior knowledge of technical indicators likely encountered in training.
- Core assumption: The LLM's pre-training corpus contains sufficient information about financial technical analysis concepts for prompt-based activation to be meaningful.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Time-LLM with Prompt-as-Prefix to provide human-readable prompts that guide model forecasts and improve accuracy"
  - [section 3]: "Figure 1 contrasts Time-LLM without Prompt-as-Prefix... with it (b), with the prompt yielding a clear improvement due to the prompt that alerts on the support and resistance lines"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; corpus neighbor "On Identifying Why and When Foundation Models Perform Well" addresses explainability but does not validate this specific prompting mechanism.
- Break condition: If the LLM was not exposed to financial technical analysis patterns during pre-training, prompt conditioning will not meaningfully shift forecasts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Meta-labeling with a secondary reliability estimator reduces false positives by filtering low-confidence predictions.
- Mechanism: A primary model (M1, e.g., Chronos) predicts price direction. A secondary model (M2, trained on M1's predictions with CTTS architecture enhanced by RevIn and learnable positional encoding) estimates whether M1's prediction is reliable. Only predictions endorsed by M2 are executed.
- Core assumption: The secondary model can learn to distinguish reliable from unreliable predictions based on patterns in M1's forecast behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "implementing meta-labeling with a reliability estimator to filter unreliable predictions, reducing false positives"
  - [section 4, Table 1]: Precision improves from 55% to 70% (Up) and 32% to 83% (Down) for SPY, though Recall drops substantially
  - [corpus]: Neighbor papers do not directly validate this specific meta-labeling architecture.
- Break condition: If M1's error patterns are not learnable or regime-dependent, M2 may over-filter (very low Execution Rate of 2-6%) or fail to generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Symbolic rule-based reasoning provides transparent, auditable justifications for execution decisions.
- Mechanism: Domain rules (e.g., candlestick patterns, support/resistance conditions) are encoded as logical predicates. These rules produce human-legible explanations for why a forecast was accepted or rejected, independent of neural model outputs.
- Core assumption: Financial domain expertise can be codified into formal rules that remain valid across market conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "incorporating symbolic reasoning with domain rules for transparent, auditable justifications"
  - [section 5]: Provides example rule `bottoming_tail_candle` with subordinate conditions; states rules can be encoded in stream-reasoning formalism like LARS
  - [corpus]: Neighbor "KASPER" mentions explainable regimes but does not validate this symbolic layer.
- Break condition: If market regime shifts invalidate encoded rules, the symbolic layer may reject valid forecasts or endorse poor ones.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Meta-labeling (Lopez de Prado)**
  - Why needed here: The architecture decouples "what direction" (M1) from "should we act" (M2). Understanding this separation is essential for interpreting Table 1's tradeoff between Precision and Recall.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why high precision with low execution rate is acceptable in trading contexts?

- Concept: **Time-LLM reprogramming**
  - Why needed here: The Prompt-as-Prefix method does not fine-tune the LLM; it reprograms input representations. Without this understanding, you may incorrectly assume fine-tuning is required.
  - Quick check question: How does concatenating prompt vectors with time series embeddings differ from standard fine-tuning approaches?

- Concept: **Neurosymbolic systems**
  - Why needed here: The paper proposes integrating neural forecasts with symbolic rules. You must understand how statistical confidence and logical justification can coexist in a single decision pipeline.
  - Quick check question: What happens when a neural model predicts "up" but the symbolic rule layer rejects based on volatility thresholds?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Time-LLM forecast -> Reliability estimation -> Rule evaluation -> Execution decision
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Time-LLM forecast → Reliability estimation → Rule evaluation → Execution decision. Each stage can veto execution.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Precision vs. Recall: Meta-labeling dramatically improves precision (70-83%) but reduces recall to 4-7% and execution rate to 2-6%
  - Transparency vs. flexibility: Symbolic rules are auditable but may not adapt to regime shifts without manual updates
  - Frozen LLM vs. fine-tuning: Prompt-as-Prefix avoids fine-tuning costs but may not achieve domain-specific gains
- Failure signatures:
  - Execution Rate drops below 1%: M2 is over-filtering; recalibrate reliability threshold
  - Rule layer rejects all forecasts: Rules may be too strict or inconsistent with current market regime
  - Prompt has no effect: Check that prompt content is actually being concatenated; verify embedding dimensions align
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate SPY meta-labeling results (Table 1) to validate M1 + M2 pipeline; confirm Precision gains and Execution Rate tradeoff
  2. Ablate the prompt prefix (remove support/resistance lines) to measure directional accuracy impact; compare to Figure 1 baseline
  3. Implement the `bottoming_tail_candle` rule on held-out BTC data; log acceptance rate and compare forecast accuracy for accepted vs. rejected predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the proposed framework be adapted to maintain reliability during sudden market regime shifts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that future work will explore "adaptive evaluation under regime shifts."
- Why unresolved: The current experiments validate the approach on historical data, but the reliability estimator ($M_2$) may fail to generalize when market dynamics (e.g., volatility patterns) change structurally, a common issue in financial time series.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics (Precision, Recall) analyzed specifically across distinct, labeled market regimes (e.g., high-volatility bear markets vs. low-volatility bull markets) rather than aggregate performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does integrating complex symbolic rules for justification outperform the neural reliability estimator regarding the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes in Section 5 that "one could complement them [neural predictors] with a symbolic, rule-based reasoning layer" and lists "richer rule-based reasoning" as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper "sketches" a knowledge-based system but relies primarily on the neural $M_2$ model (Chronos + CTTS) for quantitative results. The comparative effectiveness of the symbolic layer is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing the prediction accuracy and human-auditability of the neural $M_2$ filter against the proposed symbolic rule-based filter on the same test set.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the system's reliability thresholds be calibrated to improve the extremely low Recall and Execution Rate without negating the improvements in Precision?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 1 shows the meta-labeling approach increases Precision but crashes Recall to 4-7% and Execution Rate to 2-6%, implying the model is likely too conservative to be practically useful for active trading.
- Why unresolved: While reducing false positives is the stated goal, an execution rate of 2% suggests the model filters out the vast majority of profitable opportunities along with the bad ones.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments utilizing a cost function that penalizes false positives less severely, or analyzing the Profit-and-Loss (PnL) curve to see if the few executed trades generate sufficient return to justify the missed opportunities.

## Limitations
- Limited temporal generalization: The meta-labeling model (M2) performance drops when applied to cryptocurrency data (BTC), suggesting regime-dependent reliability patterns that may not transfer across asset classes or time periods.
- Prompt effectiveness unverified: While Figure 1 shows visual improvement with Prompt-as-Prefix, the paper lacks quantitative ablation studies comparing directional accuracy with and without prompts across multiple assets and time periods.
- Rule layer brittleness: The symbolic reasoning component is presented as transparent but not evaluated for false rejection rates or robustness to regime shifts.

## Confidence
- **High**: The meta-labeling framework's precision-recall tradeoff (Table 1) is well-documented and reproducible. The CTTS architecture with RevIn enhancement is clearly described.
- **Medium**: The Prompt-as-Prefix mechanism's effectiveness relies on the LLM having relevant financial pre-training, which is plausible but not directly validated in the paper.
- **Low**: The symbolic reasoning layer's practical effectiveness is claimed but not empirically validated beyond a single example rule.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-regime meta-labeling validation**: Apply the M2 reliability estimator trained on SPY to multiple time periods with different market conditions (bull, bear, volatile) and measure precision/recall degradation patterns.
2. **Prompt ablation across assets**: Systematically remove prompt components (support/resistance, moving averages, etc.) and measure directional accuracy impact on both SPY and BTC to quantify prompt contribution.
3. **Rule layer rejection analysis**: Track how often the symbolic rule layer rejects M1 predictions that M2 endorses, and measure whether rejected forecasts would have been profitable if executed.
