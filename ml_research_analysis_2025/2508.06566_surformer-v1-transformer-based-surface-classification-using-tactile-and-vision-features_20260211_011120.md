# Surformer v1: Transformer-Based Surface Classification Using Tactile and Vision Features

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.06566
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06566
- **Reference count**: 25
- **Primary result**: Surformer v1 achieves 99.4% accuracy with 0.77 ms inference time for multimodal surface classification

## Executive Summary
Surformer v1 introduces a transformer-based architecture for surface material classification using both tactile and visual sensory inputs. The model combines structured tactile features with PCA-reduced visual embeddings through modality-specific encoders and cross-modal attention layers. Experiments on the Touch and Go dataset demonstrate that Surformer v1 achieves 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, outperforming multimodal CNN approaches that achieve slightly higher accuracy but require significantly more computation time. The encoder-only Transformer for tactile-only classification achieves 97.4% accuracy with the fastest inference time (0.0085 ms) among evaluated models.

## Method Summary
Surformer v1 processes 7D tactile features and 64D visual embeddings (reduced from 2048D ResNet-50 embeddings via PCA) through modality-specific encoders that map inputs to a 128D latent space. Cross-modal fusion uses 2-head attention mechanisms operating on 64D subspaces, followed by a classification head with layers 256→128→64→32→5. The model is trained with Adam optimizer (lr=0.5e-5), batch size 32, and early stopping on validation accuracy. For tactile-only classification, an encoder-only Transformer is used with AdamW optimizer (lr=0.001), batch size 64, and weight decay of 0.01. The Touch and Go dataset contains 5,000 paired samples across 5 surface classes, balanced to 1,000 samples per class after augmentation.

## Key Results
- Surformer v1 achieves 99.4% accuracy with 0.77 ms inference time for multimodal classification
- Tactile-only encoder Transformer achieves 97.4% accuracy with 0.0085 ms inference time
- Outperforms multimodal CNN approaches in speed-accuracy tradeoff

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The transformer architecture effectively captures long-range dependencies in both tactile and visual feature spaces through self-attention mechanisms. The cross-modal attention layer enables the model to weigh the relative importance of tactile versus visual information for each surface class, allowing adaptive fusion based on which modality provides more discriminative information for specific materials. The modality-specific encoders preserve the unique statistical properties of each input type while projecting them into a common latent space where cross-modal interactions can occur effectively.

## Foundational Learning

**Self-Attention Mechanism**: Allows each feature dimension to attend to all others, capturing global dependencies in the data. Needed to model complex relationships between tactile pressure distributions and visual surface patterns. Quick check: Verify attention weights show meaningful patterns across different surface classes.

**Cross-Modal Fusion**: Enables information exchange between tactile and visual modalities through attention mechanisms. Required because surface materials exhibit different discriminative characteristics in tactile versus visual domains. Quick check: Compare performance with and without cross-modal attention to quantify contribution.

**PCA Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces high-dimensional visual embeddings from 2048D to 64D while preserving 90.7% variance. Necessary to reduce computational cost and prevent overfitting while maintaining essential visual information. Quick check: Verify cumulative explained variance curve shows appropriate elbow point at 64 components.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Tactile Features (7D) -> Tactile Encoder -> Latent Space (64D) -> Cross-Attention -> Visual Encoder (64D) -> Latent Space (128D) -> Classification Head (256→128→64→32→5)

**Critical Path**: Input features → modality-specific encoders → cross-modal attention fusion → classification head

**Design Tradeoffs**: The 2-head attention design balances computational efficiency with sufficient capacity for cross-modal interaction. Using PCA-reduced visual features reduces computational load while maintaining accuracy, though this may discard some fine-grained visual details.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor tactile feature extraction will manifest as reduced accuracy and degraded class separation in feature space visualizations. Inadequate cross-modal attention may show similar performance to single-modality models, indicating failed information fusion.

**First Experiments**:
1. Train tactile-only encoder Transformer to establish baseline performance without cross-modal fusion
2. Implement and visualize PCA reduction to verify 90.7% variance retention and appropriate feature space separation
3. Test cross-modal attention with varying numbers of heads (1, 2, 4) to find optimal balance between performance and efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Tactile feature extraction pipeline lacks explicit implementation details, requiring reverse-engineering of texture metrics and pressure distribution calculations
- Encoder-only Transformer architecture parameters (layers, heads, hidden sizes) are underspecified beyond basic configuration
- Single random seed reported without variance quantification across multiple training runs

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in reported accuracy and inference time rankings due to clear metrics and dataset description
- **Medium confidence** in absolute performance numbers due to unknown feature extraction reproducibility and potential data leakage risks
- **Low confidence** in direct architectural replication without complete tactile Transformer specifications

## Next Checks
1. Implement tactile feature extraction pipeline using standard texture analysis libraries and compare feature distributions to reported visualizations
2. Verify PCA fitting procedure uses only training data to prevent data leakage; document variance retained per class
3. Replicate encoder-only Transformer architecture with standard parameters (6 layers, 8 heads, 512 hidden units) as baseline and compare performance to reported 97.4% accuracy
