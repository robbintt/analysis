## Executive Summary
This work introduces Supervised Spike Agreement-Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a local, gradient-free learning rule for spiking neural networks that replaces precise spike-pair timing with population-level agreement metrics. Supervised SADP enables fast, biologically plausible learning without backpropagation, surrogate gradients, or teacher forcing. It integrates Cohen's kappa-based agreement updates in hidden layers with target-driven Hebbian learning at the output layer, preserving strict synaptic locality. The method is evaluated in hybrid CNN-SNN architectures, where convolutional encoders preprocess complex images into Poisson spike trains for agreement-driven learning. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and biomedical datasets show competitive accuracy, fast convergence, and robust performance across broad hyperparameter ranges. Device-inspired synaptic kernels demonstrate compatibility with hardware implementations. These results establish Supervised SADP as a scalable, efficient, and hardware-aligned learning paradigm for spiking neural networks.

## Method Summary
Supervised SADP combines Cohen's kappa-based agreement metrics in hidden layers with supervised Hebbian learning at the output layer. The method uses LIF neurons with membrane dynamics V(t)=λV(t-1)+I(t), where spike agreement between hidden neurons and the correct-class output neuron drives weight updates in hidden layers. Output layer weights are updated via supervised Hebbian learning based on the error signal. For complex datasets like CIFAR-10, a frozen pretrained CNN encoder converts images to 256-dimensional features that are then converted to Poisson spike trains. The system operates with strict locality—supervision enters only at output synapses without backpropagation. Weight updates use decay and normalization to maintain stability.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.1% accuracy on MNIST and 70.7% on CIFAR-10 without backpropagation
- Demonstrates robust performance across broad hyperparameter ranges with minimal tuning
- Shows competitive accuracy on biomedical datasets (LC25000, Brain MRI) with macro F1-scores
- Compatible with device-inspired synaptic kernels, validating hardware implementation potential

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Replacing precise spike-pair timing with population-level statistical agreement reduces computational complexity while maintaining learning efficacy.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of evaluating every pre-post spike pair (quadratic complexity), the system calculates Cohen's kappa (κ) over temporal windows. This metric quantifies the chance-corrected agreement between hidden neuron firing and the correct-class output neuron. Synapses are reinforced when pre- and post-synaptic activity aligns beyond random expectation, modulated by this κ coefficient.
- **Core assumption:** Statistical agreement over a window is a sufficient proxy for precise causal spike timing in driving synaptic plasticity for classification tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...replaces pairwise spike-timing comparisons with population-level agreement metrics such as Cohen's kappa."
  - [Section 3.5.2] "Cohen's kappa coefficient is computed as... κ(b)_j = (P^o - P^e) / (1 - P^e)."
  - [corpus] Related work (SADP, SSDP) supports the shift from pairwise STDP to population-level rules for scalability.
- **Break condition:** If firing rates are extremely low or saturated (e.g., P^e ≈ 1 or 0), the κ metric may become unstable or uninformative, failing to drive weight updates.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Hybridizing a frozen convolutional encoder with a spiking backend allows local learning rules to scale to complex visual domains without backpropagation.
- **Mechanism:** A standard CNN is pretrained on the dataset to extract compact features (dimensionality reduction). These features are converted into Poisson spike trains. This preprocessing provides structured, semantically meaningful input to the SNN, allowing the local SADP rule to classify complex images (CIFAR-10) that raw brightness-based encoding cannot handle.
- **Core assumption:** The feature space learned by the CNN (via backpropagation) aligns sufficiently with the decision boundary required by the spiking classifier, such that no fine-tuning of the frontend is needed.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.1.2] "The CNN encoder is pretrained... and remains frozen during spiking network training."
  - [Section 5.1] "For CIFAR-10... brightness-based Poisson encoding fails... CNN+Poisson led to significant performance improvements (0.23 to 0.70)."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence in corpus for this specific hybrid training decoupling; primarily anchored in paper text.
- **Break condition:** If the pretrained CNN features do not separate classes linearly or simply enough for the spiking layer (e.g., domain shift between CNN training and SNN deployment), the frozen pipeline will fail to adapt.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Injecting error signals strictly at the output layer enables supervised learning while preserving strict locality in hidden layers.
- **Mechanism:** The output layer uses Supervised Hebbian Learning where weights are updated based on the correlation between hidden-layer spikes and the instantaneous error (y - s_out). Crucially, this error is not backpropagated. Hidden layers self-organize using SADP based solely on the firing activity of the supervised output neurons (agreement-driven plasticity).
- **Core assumption:** Hidden neurons can learn useful representations by attempting to agree with the activity of output neurons, which are the only ones receiving direct error signals.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.5] "The supervision signal does not propagate across layers; it is applied only at the output synapses, preserving strict locality."
  - [Section 5.1] "Supervision enters the network exclusively through local mechanisms... without backpropagation."
- **Break condition:** In very deep networks (beyond the 1-2 layers tested), the indirect credit assignment via agreement statistics may degrade, preventing earlier layers from learning useful features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Cohen's Kappa (κ)
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core mathematical engine of SADP. You must understand how it measures "agreement beyond chance" to grasp how the network quantifies learning success without gradients.
  - **Quick check question:** If two neurons fire stochastically with 90% probability, and they happen to spike together 90% of the time, is the Kappa score high or low?

- **Concept:** Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neurons
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses LIF dynamics (V_l(t) = λ V_l(t-1) + I_l(t)). Understanding the leak factor λ and threshold θ is essential for tuning the temporal dynamics of the "agreement" window.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the leak factor λ affect the "memory" of the neuron regarding inputs received 10 timesteps ago?

- **Concept:** Poisson Spike Encoding
  - **Why needed here:** This is the bridge between static data (images/CNN features) and the temporal domain of the SNN. The paper claims success relies on generating "heterogeneous spike statistics."
  - **Quick check question:** If an input pixel value is 0.5 and the simulation runs for T=100 timesteps, approximately how many spikes should the encoder produce?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Image -> Pretrained CNN -> Global Average Pooling -> Dense(256) -> Poisson Encoder -> LIF Hidden Layer -> LIF Output Layer -> Spike Count Argmax

- **Critical path:** The calculation of Cohen's Kappa between the hidden layer spikes and the winning output neuron's spikes. This drives the weight update W_1 which constitutes the bulk of the feature learning.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Poisson-only vs. CNN+Poisson:** Poisson-only is fully local and "pure" but fails on complex datasets (CIFAR-10: 23% vs 70%). CNN+Poisson adds non-local pre-training but solves the complexity scaling issue.
  - **Depth vs. Stability:** The paper notes that adding a second hidden layer (2SADP) yields marginal gains and doesn't clearly improve over 1SADP, suggesting depth is not yet an advantage in this strictly local regime.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Homogeneity Collapse:** On complex datasets using raw Poisson encoding, spike statistics become homogeneous across classes. Accuracy drops to random guess levels (e.g., 23% on CIFAR-10).
  - **Hardware Drift:** When using "device-inspired" kernels (Appendix B), accuracy drops (e.g., MNIST 99% → 82%), indicating sensitivity to non-ideal synaptic update dynamics.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Implement 1SADP on MNIST using only raw Poisson encoding (no CNN). Verify if accuracy reaches the ~87-88% range reported in Table 2.
  2. **Ablation on Encoding:** Run 1SADP on CIFAR-10. Compare Raw Poisson vs. CNN+Poisson to empirically validate the "homogeneity collapse" failure mode described in Section 5.1.
  3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Run the Optuna sweep (Appendix A) to confirm that learning rate decay is the dominant factor (62% importance) and that the system is robust to timestep duration (T).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Under what specific conditions does increasing network depth provide consistent performance benefits in agreement-based plasticity frameworks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that the two-hidden-layer architecture (2SADP) showed only modest and dataset-dependent gains over the single-hidden-layer version, noting that "understanding when and how agreement-based plasticity benefits from additional depth remains an open question."
- **Why unresolved:** The current feedforward implementation lacks explicit mechanisms for hierarchical credit assignment or inter-layer coordination beyond local spike agreement, potentially limiting the utility of deeper layers.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical results demonstrating that modified inter-layer coordination rules or specific hyperparameter regimes allow deep SADP networks to consistently and significantly outperform single-layer variants across diverse datasets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can supervised SADP be integrated with a spike-native sensory front-end to enable fully local, end-to-end on-chip learning without reliance on off-chip pretraining?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper identifies the reliance on a frozen, pretrained CNN encoder as a limitation, stating, "Developing fully spike-native or co-trained sensory front-ends remains an important direction for future work."
- **Why unresolved:** The current methodology decouples feature extraction (CNN) from spike-based learning (SNN), meaning the system is not entirely biologically plausible or compatible with autonomous neuromorphic deployment.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A demonstration of a hybrid system where the feature extraction layer is trained in situ using local SADP rules, achieving accuracy comparable to the frozen CNN+Poisson baseline.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What stabilization mechanisms are required to successfully apply supervised SADP to recurrent architectures and temporally structured sequence learning tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that extensions to recurrent architectures may require "additional stabilization mechanisms or modified agreement metrics to prevent spurious synchronization or vanishing agreement signals."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study is restricted to feedforward architectures with static image inputs, leaving the dynamics of agreement metrics over long temporal dependencies unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful application of the learning rule to temporal tasks (e.g., audio or video streams) showing that the modified rule prevents agreement signal degradation over time.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Can variability-aware learning rules or improved device calibration close the performance gap between device-inspired synaptic kernels and idealized update functions?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper reports that "device-inspired kernels yield slightly lower accuracy compared to idealized update functions," explicitly calling for "improved device calibration and variability-aware learning rules."
- **Why unresolved:** While the algorithm is compatible with device dynamics, the non-ideal, asymmetric nature of current hardware measurements introduces a performance penalty compared to software simulations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmark results showing that SADP implemented on physical neuromorphic hardware or using variability-corrected kernels matches the accuracy of the idealized software model.

## Limitations
- **Hardware Compatibility Gap:** Performance drops significantly (e.g., MNIST 99% → 82%) when using non-ideal hardware constraints, raising questions about practical scalability to real neuromorphic systems.
- **Depth Scalability Question:** The marginal gains from adding a second hidden layer suggest the current SADP formulation may not effectively scale to deeper architectures.
- **Hybrid Architecture Dependence:** The reliance on pretrained CNN encoders for complex datasets introduces a fundamental tension with the goal of fully local learning.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core SADP mechanism using Cohen's kappa for hidden layer updates; supervised Hebbian learning at output layer; hybrid CNN-SNN architecture for complex datasets.
- **Medium Confidence:** Claims about fast convergence and robustness across hyperparameters; hardware compatibility demonstrations.
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about biological plausibility of the kappa-based learning rule compared to STDP; effectiveness of SADP in deeper networks beyond two layers.

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness to Hardware Constraints:** Systematically test SADP performance across different device-inspired synaptic kernel implementations to identify which hardware constraints most impact accuracy and determine if performance can be maintained through parameter tuning.

2. **Depth Scaling Investigation:** Implement and evaluate SADP in networks with 3+ hidden layers on standard datasets to determine if the agreement-based learning mechanism degrades with depth, and if so, identify potential modifications to enable effective credit assignment.

3. **Biological Plausibility Assessment:** Compare the computational and biological realism of SADP's kappa-based updates against biological STDP mechanisms through quantitative analysis of spike timing statistics and energy efficiency metrics.
