# An Empirical Study of Reducing AV1 Decoder Complexity and Energy Consumption via Encoder Parameter Tuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12380
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12380
- Reference count: 25
- Authors: Vibhoothi Vibhoothi; Julien Zouein; Shanker Shreejith; Jean-Baptiste Kempf; Anil Kokaram
- One-line primary result: Encoder parameter tuning can reduce AV1 decoder complexity by 10-24% with minimal perceptual quality degradation.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates how encoder parameter tuning affects AV1 decoder complexity and energy consumption. Using a "tool-off" methodology, the authors disable individual coding tools in libaom-av1 and SVT-AV1 encoders, then measure the impact on decoding cycles, energy consumption, and quality metrics using both CPU-centric (RAPL) and system-level (SoC Watch) measurements. The study reveals that specific encoder configurations can substantially reduce decoding complexity while maintaining acceptable quality, with findings showing up to 24% reduction in decoding cycles. These results provide practical strategies for content providers to optimize energy efficiency in AV1 video streaming.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic "tool-off" analysis where individual coding tools are disabled in libaom-av1 v3.11.0 and SVT-AV1 v2.3.0 encoders. The authors encode 20 UGC videos at two target bitrates using these modified configurations, then decode them with dav1d 1.5.0 single-threaded decoder while measuring CPU cycles, decode time, RAPL power, and SoC Watch power. Quality metrics including VMAF, PSNR-Y, and UVQ are evaluated for each configuration. The study compares results against a baseline where all tools are enabled, providing quantitative trade-offs between complexity reduction and quality preservation across different encoder settings.

## Key Results
- Disabling CDEF in libaom-av1 reduces decoding cycles by approximately 10% with zero VMAF quality loss
- SVT-AV1's fast-decode=2 preset achieves a 24% reduction in decoding cycles
- System-level measurements (SoC Watch) reveal that CPU-centric metrics (RAPL) can be misleading, with some configurations showing CPU energy reduction but system energy increase
- enable-obmc=0 in libaom-av1 provides the best system-level power savings (2.32%) with neutral quality metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Disabling computationally expensive in-loop filters at encode time reduces decoder processing load without proportional quality loss.
- Mechanism: The Constrained Directional Enhancement Filter (CDEF) requires significant computational cycles during decoding to perform directional filtering operations. When disabled at encode time (`enable-cdef=0`), the decoder skips this entire processing stage, directly reducing cycle count and energy consumption. The bitstream signals the absence of this tool, so the decoder does not allocate resources to it.
- Core assumption: The quality degradation from removing CDEF remains within acceptable perceptual thresholds for the target use case.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "For libaom-av1, disabling CDEF, an in-loop filter gives us a mean reduction in decoding cycles by ≈10%."
  - [Table I] Shows enable-cdef=0 yielding -9.67% cycle reduction, -11.62% decode time, and -2.05% RAPL power gain with 0 VMAF loss.
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; related papers focus on encoder control networks and multi-modal fusion rather than in-loop filter energy analysis.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Coordinated multi-parameter presets achieve larger complexity reductions than single-tool disabling because they optimize interdependent coding tools simultaneously.
- Mechanism: The `fast-decode=2` preset in SVT-AV1 adjusts multiple encoder behaviors together: motion search accuracy, reference frame count in prediction hierarchy, and in-loop filter strength. These parameters are interdependent—reducing reference frames changes the motion compensation workload, which affects how beneficial certain filters are. Coordinated adjustment prevents contradictory optimizations and compounds energy savings.
- Core assumption: The preset designers correctly identified the parameter combinations that yield maximum decode speedup with minimum compression efficiency loss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "For SVT-AV1, using the in-built, fast-decode=2 preset achieves a more substantial 24% reduction in decoding cycles."
  - [Section V.A] "The fast-decode preset adjusts multiple encoder settings like motion search accuracy, number of reference frames in prediction hierarchy, and in-loop filter strength."
  - [Table I] fast-decode=2 shows -23.79% cycle reduction vs. -16.22% for single-tool CDEF disable.
  - [corpus] LiteVPNet paper mentions encoder control in quality-critical applications but doesn't address decode-energy-aware presets.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: System-level energy measurement (SoC Watch) captures optimization effects that CPU-centric metrics (RAPL) miss, particularly when optimizations shift workload between CPU and memory subsystems.
- Mechanism: RAPL primarily monitors the CPU package power domain. Some encoder optimizations reduce CPU instruction count but increase memory controller activity (e.g., different coefficient update frequencies may change memory access patterns). SoC Watch aggregates RAPL data with platform metrics including memory controller activity, C-states, and P-states, revealing the full system energy impact.
- Core assumption: The goal is minimizing total system energy, not just CPU energy; memory subsystem energy matters significantly for video decoding workloads.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section V.A] "For instance, mode-cost-upd-freq=3 yields a 0.88% reduction in CPU cycles and a 1.62% power gain at the CPU level (as measured by RAPL). Our more generalised measurements with SoC Watch reveal a contrasting 2.48% increase in overall system power."
  - [Section V.A] "This underscores that relying solely on CPU-centric data can be misleading."
  - [Section III.B] "SoC Watch aggregates samples via its driver at a specific minimum sampling interval (≈1 ms) and can account for samples which can be missed due to the average."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; neighbor papers don't address measurement methodology for decoder energy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: In-loop filtering in modern video codecs**
  - Why needed here: Understanding what CDEF, deblocking filters, and restoration filters do explains why disabling them saves decode energy but risks quality loss. These filters operate on reconstructed frames to reduce compression artifacts but require significant computation.
  - Quick check question: If a video has severe blocking artifacts after disabling CDEF, what content characteristics might explain this? (Answer: High quantization, complex textures, or edge-heavy content where the directional filtering was providing substantial correction.)

- **Concept: Energy measurement domains (CPU package vs. SoC vs. system)**
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates that different measurement tools capture different energy scopes. RAPL measures CPU package; SoC Watch adds memory controller and platform components. Understanding this prevents misinterpretation of optimization results.
  - Quick check question: Why might an optimization show CPU energy reduction but system energy increase? (Answer: The optimization may have shifted workload from CPU to memory subsystem or other SoC components not captured by CPU-only metrics.)

- **Concept: Compression efficiency vs. decoding complexity trade-off**
  - Why needed here: Every encoder parameter change affects both the bitrate required for a given quality and the decoder workload. The paper quantifies this trade-off; understanding it is essential for making informed configuration decisions.
  - Quick check question: If reducing decoding complexity by 24% costs 0.55 VMAF points, how would you decide if this is acceptable for a mobile streaming service? (Answer: Consider the target device's battery constraints, user sensitivity to the quality difference, and whether adaptive streaming could compensate by serving a slightly higher bitrate variant.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Encoder (libaom-av1 / SVT-AV1) -> Bitstream -> Decoder (dav1d) -> Energy measurement layer (RAPL/SoC Watch) -> Analysis framework

- **Critical path:**
  1. Identify target encoder (libaom-av1 for granular control, SVT-AV1 for preset-based optimization)
  2. Select optimization goal (maximum decode speed vs. quality preservation vs. system energy efficiency)
  3. Configure encoder flags based on Table I results (e.g., `enable-cdef=0` for speed, `enable-obmc=0` for quality-preserving power savings)
  4. Encode test content at target bitrate
  5. Measure decode energy using both RAPL and SoC Watch
  6. Evaluate quality metrics (VMAF, PSNR-Y, UVQ) against acceptable thresholds

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **libaom-av1 `enable-cdef=0`**: Maximum speed gain (~12% decode time reduction) with neutral VMAF but some UVQ degradation. Best for short-form content or performance-critical scenarios.
  - **libaom-av1 `enable-obmc=0`**: Best system-level power savings (2.32% SoC Watch) with neutral quality metrics. Best for battery-life optimization without quality compromise.
  - **SVT-AV1 `fast-decode=2`**: Largest complexity reduction (24%) but highest quality cost (-0.55 VMAF). Best when decode speed is the primary constraint.
  - **CPU-only vs. system-level measurement**: CPU metrics may mislead if memory subsystem effects matter. Always measure both for production decisions.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Quality metrics drop unexpectedly: Content characteristics (high motion, complex textures) may be sensitive to disabled tools. Re-enable tool or use less aggressive preset.
  - System power increases despite CPU power decrease: Optimization shifted workload to memory. Use SoC Watch to detect; consider alternative flags.
  - Initial power savings diminish over time: The paper shows power gains are highest in first decode loop and stabilize. This is expected behavior; plan for steady-state gains (~1.5% vs. 6.9% initial for CDEF disable).
  - Inconsistent results across videos: UGC content variability means no single configuration is optimal for all content. Consider content-adaptive encoding.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline measurement**: Decode your typical content (5-10 representative clips) with default encoder settings. Measure CPU cycles, RAPL power, SoC Watch power, decode time, VMAF, PSNR-Y, and UVQ. This establishes your reference point.
  2. **Single-flag impact analysis**: Encode the same content with `enable-cdef=0` (libaom-av1) or `fast-decode=1` (SVT-AV1). Measure all metrics. Compare against baseline to verify the paper's findings apply to your content. Expected: ~10% cycle reduction for libaom-av1 CDEF disable, ~16% for SVT-AV1 fast-decode=1.
  3. **System-level validation**: Run extended decode sessions (30+ seconds, ~20 loops) with the best-performing flag from experiment 2. Use both RAPL and SoC Watch to verify that CPU-level gains translate to system-level gains. If they diverge (CPU saves energy but system doesn't), investigate memory access patterns or try the quality-preserving `enable-obmc=0` flag instead.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the energy savings achieved via encoder parameter tuning persist on ARM-based mobile platforms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "Future work will analyse the impact on ARM-based mobile platforms via battery drain analysis."
- Why unresolved: The current study was limited to an x64 workstation (Intel i7-12700K) using RAPL and SoC Watch, which have different power management architectures than the ARM-based System-on-Chips (SoC) used in mobile devices.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the decoding experiments on Android/iOS devices and measuring actual battery discharge rates or system-level power consumption.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of these encoder configurations on dedicated hardware AV1 decoders?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors state that while principles should translate, "a dedicated hardware analysis would be needed to quantify the precise magnitude."
- Why unresolved: Software decoders (like dav1d) run general-purpose instructions on a CPU. Hardware decoders use fixed-function logic; disabling a tool like CDEF might not yield the same power savings if the hardware logic remains active or bypasses differently.
- What evidence would resolve it: Measuring power consumption of the video decode IP block on SoCs that support AV1 hardware decoding while playing the "tool-off" bitstreams.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does enabling tiling and multi-threaded decoding affect the energy trade-offs of these parameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper lists "investigate more granular multi-parameter optimisations, including tiling behaviour" as future work.
- Why unresolved: The study explicitly disabled tiling to reduce multi-CPU overhead and context switching to isolate the core algorithmic cost. Real-world streaming often uses tiling for parallelism, which introduces threading overhead that may alter the energy equation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-running the "tool-off" analysis with tiling enabled (e.g., 2x2 or 4x4 tiles) and comparing the multi-threaded energy consumption against the single-threaded baseline.

## Limitations
- Dataset representativeness: The study uses 20 UGC videos, which may not capture all content types (e.g., gaming, sports, animation) that have different sensitivity to coding tool removal.
- Measurement methodology boundaries: While SoC Watch provides more comprehensive system-level measurements than RAPL, it still may not capture all energy consumption aspects (e.g., display power, network transmission).
- Encoder version specificity: Results are tied to specific encoder versions (libaom-av1 v3.11.0, SVT-AV1 v2.3.0). Future encoder versions may implement tools more efficiently, changing the energy-complexity trade-offs.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The systematic tool-off methodology and empirical measurements are methodologically sound. The quantitative findings (cycle reductions of 10-24%, quality metric changes) are directly measurable and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: The generalizability of findings across diverse content types and real-world streaming scenarios. While the methodology is robust, content-specific variations may yield different optimal configurations.
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that CPU-centric metrics can be misleading. While the paper demonstrates this with specific examples, broader validation across different workloads and platforms would strengthen this claim.

## Next Checks
1. **Content sensitivity validation**: Test the recommended configurations (enable-cdef=0, enable-obmc=0, fast-decode=2) across diverse content types (gaming, sports, animation, talking head) to identify content-dependent optimal configurations.
2. **Extended measurement validation**: Run decode sessions for 5+ minutes across multiple content clips to verify that the initial power savings stabilization pattern (highest in first loop) holds consistently and to measure steady-state gains more accurately.
3. **Cross-platform validation**: Replicate the study on different hardware platforms (including non-Intel CPUs and mobile devices) to verify whether the CPU-centric vs. system-level measurement discrepancy persists and whether the optimal configurations generalize across platforms.
