# Ranking of Bangla Word Graph using Graph-based Ranking Algorithms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.01011
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01011
- Authors: S M Rafiuddin
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Graph-based ranking algorithms tested on Bangla POS-tagged corpora, with HITS achieving highest F1 score of 0.32 and Min/Max Prefix scoring 0.37

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates graph-based ranking algorithms for Bangla word graphs in information retrieval and text summarization tasks. The research uses the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora containing 895 Bangla sentences, applying preprocessing steps including tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal before constructing word graphs. Five ranking algorithms are tested: minimum/maximum prefix score, reference score, HITS, positional power function, and PageRank. The results show HITS achieving the highest F1 score of 0.32, while PageRank ranks the highest number of words (1546) but with lower precision. The study demonstrates the feasibility of applying graph-based ranking to Bangla text processing despite limited standard datasets.

## Method Summary
The research methodology involves constructing word graphs from Bangla text and applying five different graph-based ranking algorithms. The dataset consists of 895 Bangla sentences from the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora. Text preprocessing includes tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal. The constructed word graphs are then processed using five ranking algorithms: minimum/maximum prefix score, reference score, HITS, positional power function, and PageRank. Performance is evaluated using F1 score, precision, and recall metrics. The study compares the effectiveness of these algorithms in identifying important words for information retrieval and text summarization tasks.

## Key Results
- HITS algorithm achieved the highest F1 score of 0.32 among all tested algorithms
- Minimum/Maximum Prefix scoring method achieved F1 score of 0.37, outperforming PageRank
- PageRank ranked the highest number of words (1546) but showed lower precision (0.29) and F1 score (0.31)
- The study establishes baseline performance for graph-based ranking algorithms on Bangla word graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Graph-based ranking algorithms work by analyzing the link structure of word graphs to identify important nodes. In the context of Bangla text processing, words are represented as nodes and their relationships as edges, creating a network where the importance of each word can be determined by its connectivity patterns. The algorithms leverage the principle that words connected to many other important words are likely to be significant themselves. This approach captures semantic relationships between words that traditional frequency-based methods might miss, particularly valuable for languages like Bangla with complex morphology and rich vocabulary.

## Foundational Learning
- Graph-based ranking algorithms: Mathematical methods for determining node importance in networks by analyzing link structures
  - Why needed: Essential for identifying important words in word graphs for text summarization and information retrieval
  - Quick check: Verify that the algorithm converges and produces stable rankings

- POS-tagged corpora: Text datasets where words are annotated with their part-of-speech information
  - Why needed: Provides linguistic context necessary for constructing meaningful word graphs
  - Quick check: Confirm POS tags are correctly assigned and cover all necessary grammatical categories

- Word graph construction: Process of creating graph structures where nodes represent words and edges represent relationships
  - Why needed: Transforms text into network structure amenable to graph-based analysis
  - Quick check: Validate that the graph captures meaningful linguistic relationships between words

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal): Cleaning and normalizing text data
  - Why needed: Reduces noise and dimensionality while preserving semantic content
  - Quick check: Ensure preprocessing doesn't remove contextually important words

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Text corpus -> Preprocessing pipeline -> Word graph construction -> Ranking algorithms -> Performance evaluation

Critical path: Corpus → Preprocessing → Graph Construction → Algorithm Execution → Evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Simple algorithms (Min/Max Prefix) perform better than complex ones (PageRank) on small datasets, suggesting dataset size impacts algorithm effectiveness

Failure signatures: Poor performance indicates either inadequate preprocessing, graph construction issues, or algorithm mismatch with data characteristics

First experiments:
1. Test algorithms on progressively larger subsets of the corpus to identify scaling behavior
2. Compare results with baseline TF-IDF ranking on identical datasets
3. Analyze graph structure (degree distribution, edge density) to understand algorithm performance differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How can graph-based ranking algorithms be specifically optimized to improve the F1 score for Bangla word ranking beyond the baseline of 0.37?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion states, "The future work of this research is to optimize the ranking algorithm up to a certain level and to improve these algorithm for the Bangla word ranking process."
- Why unresolved: The current study only establishes a baseline comparison of standard algorithms without proposing modifications to the core calculations or weighting schemes to better suit Bangla morphology.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified algorithm tailored for Bangla that achieves a statistically significant higher F1 score on the same or similar POS-tagged corpora.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance hierarchy of these ranking algorithms change when applied to larger, more diverse Bangla datasets?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly note the "scarcity of standard datasets" and the limited size of the sample (895 sentences), implying the results may not generalize to the "huge amounts of unstructured data" available on the web.
- Why unresolved: The relative success of the simple Min/Max Prefix method over complex iterative algorithms like PageRank might be an artifact of the small corpus size or specific domain, which is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results replicating this methodology on a larger Bangla corpus (e.g., >10,000 documents) to see if PageRank or HITS surpass the Prefix scoring methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific structural properties of the Bangla word graph cause PageRank to underperform significantly compared to the simpler Minimum/Maximum Prefix scoring method?
- Basis in paper: The results (Table 1) show PageRank ranking the highest number of words (1546) but achieving the lowest precision (0.29) and F1 score (0.31), suggesting it assigns importance poorly in this specific graph structure compared to the Min/Max Prefix method (F1 0.37).
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the performance metrics but does not provide a linguistic or graph-theoretical analysis explaining why the link-analysis logic of PageRank fails to identify relevant terms in Bangla word graphs.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of edge densities and node degree distributions in Bangla graphs compared to English graphs, correlating these metrics with ranking accuracy.

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (895 sentences) may not represent Bangla language complexity and diversity
- Limited comparative analysis against established text ranking baselines like TF-IDF or TextRank
- Lack of statistical validation to determine significance of performance differences between algorithms

## Confidence
High confidence: Graph-based ranking is technically feasible for Bangla text processing - algorithms successfully processed dataset and generated ranked word lists

Medium confidence: The core finding that HITS achieves highest F1 score of 0.32 on this specific dataset, limited by small dataset size and lack of comparative baselines

Low confidence: Specific ranking performance claims (F1 scores of 0.32-0.37) due to insufficient baseline comparisons and limited dataset size

## Next Checks
1. Expand dataset testing to include at least 10,000 Bangla sentences from multiple domains (news, literature, social media) to assess algorithm robustness across different text types and improve statistical power

2. Implement cross-validation with multiple random splits of the existing dataset to determine whether the reported F1 scores and ranking performance are consistent across different data subsets

3. Conduct comparative analysis against established text ranking baselines (TF-IDF, TextRank, and language-specific methods) using identical preprocessing and evaluation metrics to establish relative algorithm performance
