# BITS for GAPS: Bayesian Information-Theoretic Sampling for hierarchical GAussian Process Surrogates

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16815
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16815
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces BITS for GAPS, a framework for training hierarchical Gaussian process surrogates using Bayesian information-theoretic sampling, demonstrated by modeling activity coefficients in a binary H2O–PrOH system for distillation design.

## Executive Summary
This work presents BITS for GAPS (Bayesian Information-Theoretic Sampling for hierarchical Gaussian Process Surrogates), a sequential experimental design framework that leverages differential entropy as an acquisition function to guide data collection for hierarchical GP models. The method uses a GMM approximation of the posterior predictive distribution to compute a tractable lower bound on differential entropy, then maximizes this bound to select new experimental points. Applied to modeling activity coefficients in a binary H2O–PrOH system using the Wilson equation as ground truth, the approach demonstrates improved sample efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to random sampling, with results suitable for distillation column design via McCabe-Thiele analysis.

## Method Summary
BITS for GAPS employs a hierarchical GP surrogate trained on activity coefficient data from a binary H2O–PrOH system, using Wilson equation predictions as ground truth. The framework uses differential entropy of the posterior predictive distribution as an acquisition function, computed via a GMM approximation using 15 posterior hyperparameter samples from HMC inference. Sequential design iteratively maximizes this entropy bound (using L-BFGS-B with Sobol restarts) to select new design points, then refits the model. The trained surrogate is embedded into extended Raoult's law, with Gibbs-Duhem integration ensuring thermodynamic consistency, to generate VLE data for distillation design. The method demonstrates improved sample efficiency and predictive accuracy over random sampling.

## Key Results
- Entropy-guided sampling achieves improved sample efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to random sampling
- The framework produces physically consistent VLE predictions suitable for distillation column design
- Systematic bias in activity coefficient predictions is reduced through targeted data collection in high-uncertainty regions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by using differential entropy as an acquisition function to guide data collection toward regions of high uncertainty in the surrogate model. By maximizing posterior entropy through a GMM lower bound, the method efficiently explores the design space and reduces uncertainty where it matters most for prediction accuracy. The hierarchical GP structure with informative priors captures the underlying physics of the system, while the entropy-based selection ensures that new data points maximally reduce overall predictive uncertainty.

## Foundational Learning
- **Gibbs-Duhem equation**: Why needed - Ensures thermodynamic consistency between activity coefficients of the two components in a binary mixture; Quick check - Verify that γ₁ and γ₂ satisfy the integration at boundary conditions
- **GMM entropy approximation**: Why needed - Provides tractable lower bound on differential entropy for acquisition function; Quick check - Compare bound values across different S sample sizes
- **Hierarchical GP priors**: Why needed - Encodes physical knowledge and regularizes the model; Quick check - Inspect posterior hyperparameter distributions for reasonableness
- **Sequential experimental design**: Why needed - Iteratively improves model by targeting high-uncertainty regions; Quick check - Monitor training/test RMSE convergence across iterations
- **Extended Raoult's law**: Why needed - Connects activity coefficient models to vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations; Quick check - Validate VLE predictions against Wilson equation at test points
- **McCabe-Thiele method**: Why needed - Translates VLE predictions into practical distillation design metrics; Quick check - Confirm stage count stability across posterior samples

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Clapeyron.jl (Wilson evaluator) -> BITS for GAPS framework (GP + HMC + entropy acquisition) -> VLE calculations (extended Raoult's + Gibbs-Duhem) -> McCabe-Thiele distillation design

**Critical Path:**
Initial LHS data generation → HMC posterior sampling → GMM entropy computation → Acquisition optimization → Data augmentation → Model refit → Convergence check → VLE construction → Distillation calculation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- MCMC sampling provides accurate posteriors but is computationally expensive vs. variational inference
- GMM approximation enables tractable entropy computation but may underestimate true uncertainty
- Sequential one-at-a-time acquisition is simple but less efficient than batch selection
- Truncation in Gibbs-Duhem integration avoids numerical divergence but introduces arbitrary bias

**Failure Signatures:**
- MCMC chains fail to converge (R̂ > 1.2) → poor mixing or inadequate priors
- Entropy optimization stuck at boundaries → insufficient Sobol restarts or numerical issues
- Gibbs-Duhem integral divergence → inadequate truncation parameter ε
- Test RMSE increases during sequential design → acquisition function not aligned with prediction accuracy

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Generate 10-point LHS, run 5 iterations of sequential design, plot train/test RMSE convergence
2. Compare final model predictions against Wilson equation across full design space
3. Generate VLE diagrams and McCabe-Thiele stage counts for both entropy-guided and random sampling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How tight is the GMM entropy acquisition lower bound compared to the true differential entropy, and under what conditions does maximizing the bound lead to suboptimal sampling decisions?
- Can BITS for GAPS be extended to parallel (batch) acquisition that selects multiple design points simultaneously while accounting for inter-point information redundancy?
- Does variational inference provide sufficient accuracy for hierarchical GP posteriors while reducing the computational cost of iterative MCMC sampling?
- How does the truncation at z₁ = 1 - ε in the Gibbs-Duhem integral affect thermodynamic consistency and propagated uncertainty in the inferred second-component activity coefficient?

## Limitations
- Jitter magnitude is unspecified, introducing potential variability in numerical stability
- No explicit stopping criterion is given, requiring assumptions about convergence tolerance
- Input normalization is not fully specified, requiring assumptions about standardization parameters
- Computational cost of the full Bayesian framework is not reported, limiting scalability assessment

## Confidence
- High confidence in the methodological framework and its theoretical underpinnings
- Medium confidence in the specific implementation details due to missing parameters
- Medium confidence in the distillation column design results due to unspecified McCabe-Thiele parameters

## Next Checks
1. Verify MCMC convergence with trace plots and Gelman-Rubin statistics for all four chains across multiple iterations; ensure R̂ < 1.2
2. Perform sensitivity analysis on jitter magnitude (e.g., [1e-6, 1e-5, 1e-4]) to assess impact on predictive accuracy and numerical stability
3. Test the numerical integration of the Gibbs-Duhem equation across the composition range; confirm γ_H2O remains bounded and consistent with γ_PrOH at z_PrOH = 0
