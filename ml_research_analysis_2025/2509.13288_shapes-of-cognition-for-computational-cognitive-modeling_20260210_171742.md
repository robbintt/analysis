# Shapes of Cognition for Computational Cognitive Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13288
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13288
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for computational cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs)

## Executive Summary
Shapes of cognition introduces a novel conceptual framework for computational cognitive modeling that prioritizes modeling typical cases while using recovery strategies for atypical outcomes. This approach minimizes cognitive load by enabling LEIAs to recognize patterns, act by habit, reason by analogy, and satisfice. The paradigm is implemented within the HARMONIC cognitive-robotic architecture and uses ontological concepts to represent knowledge, providing a framework for building explainable, extensible, and trustworthy agent systems in critical domains.

## Method Summary
The Shapes-based modeling approach focuses on first modeling typical cases in cognitive processing, then employing recovery strategies when encountering atypical outcomes. This paradigm is implemented within the HARMONIC cognitive-robotic architecture, which uses ontological concepts to represent knowledge. The approach enables LEIAs to learn on the fly and seek human help when needed, supporting explainability and trustworthiness in agent systems.

## Key Results
- Enables LEIAs to recognize patterns, act by habit, reason by analogy, and satisfice
- Minimizes cognitive load through typical-case-first modeling with recovery strategies
- Provides framework for building explainable, extensible, and trustworthy agent systems in critical domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paradigm works by leveraging cognitive science principles that humans naturally use - recognizing patterns and acting by habit for routine situations, while maintaining flexible recovery strategies for edge cases. By focusing computational resources on typical scenarios first, the system reduces unnecessary cognitive load. The use of ontological concepts for knowledge representation enables semantic understanding and supports analogical reasoning, while the architecture's ability to learn on the fly and seek human assistance when needed ensures robustness and trustworthiness.

## Foundational Learning
- Ontological concepts: Represent knowledge in structured, semantic form - needed for meaningful reasoning and explainability
- Recovery strategies: Fallback mechanisms for handling atypical outcomes - needed to ensure system robustness
- Cognitive load minimization: Focus on typical cases first - needed to improve efficiency and reduce computational overhead
- Analogical reasoning: Draw parallels from similar situations - needed for flexible problem-solving
- Satisficing behavior: "Good enough" solutions over optimal ones - needed for practical, real-world performance
- Human-agent collaboration: Seeking help when needed - needed for handling complex or uncertain situations

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: HARMONIC architecture -> Ontological knowledge base -> Pattern recognition module -> Recovery strategy engine -> Human interaction interface
Critical path: Pattern recognition → Action execution → Outcome evaluation → (if atypical) Recovery strategy activation
Design tradeoffs: Simplicity and efficiency vs. completeness; explainability vs. computational complexity
Failure signatures: Atypical outcomes, pattern recognition failures, recovery strategy ineffectiveness
First experiments:
1. Benchmark cognitive task performance comparison between Shapes-based and traditional approaches
2. User study evaluating explainability of LEIA decision-making
3. Stress testing of recovery strategies under various failure modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of empirical validation with no concrete experimental results
- Claims about effectiveness remain theoretical assertions without quantitative evidence
- No implementation details or performance metrics provided

## Confidence
High: Theoretical soundness of the paradigm and its alignment with cognitive science principles
Medium: Potential benefits and practical viability of the approach
Low: Effectiveness of recovery strategies and real-world performance

## Next Checks
1. Implement benchmark cognitive tasks to compare Shapes-based modeling against traditional approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy
2. Conduct user studies with domain experts to evaluate explainability and trustworthiness of Shapes-based LEIAs in critical applications
3. Perform stress testing of recovery strategies for atypical outcomes to quantify effectiveness under various failure modes
