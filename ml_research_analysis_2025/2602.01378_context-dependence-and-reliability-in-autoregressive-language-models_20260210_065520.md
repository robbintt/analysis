core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of attribution stability in large
  language models under redundant or overlapping context, which undermines trustworthiness
  and increases vulnerability to prompt injection. The authors introduce RISE (Redundancy-Insensitive
  Scoring of Explanation), a method that computes the conditional unique dependence
  of each context unit by measuring how much unique information it provides about
  the next-token distribution conditioned on the remaining context.

- Primary result: Introduces RISE method to suppress redundant context attribution in LLMs, achieving near-zero redundancy sensitivity (Dup-Split) in controlled tests.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses attribution instability in autoregressive language models when context contains redundant or overlapping information. RISE (Redundancy-Insensitive Scoring of Explanation) computes conditional unique dependence by measuring how much each context unit uniquely predicts the next-token distribution given the remaining context. The method normalizes these scores to suppress redundant units while maintaining stable rankings. Experiments show RISE achieves significantly lower redundancy sensitivity than attention-based and perturbation baselines while maintaining comparable rank stability, offering a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for reliable context attribution in deployed systems.

## Method Summary
RISE quantifies the unique influence of each context unit by computing Conditional Unique Dependence (CUD) as the conditional mutual information between a unit and the next-token distribution given all other units. The method segments context into structured units (sentences, chunks, turns), estimates CUD using lightweight estimators, normalizes scores to sum to one, and optionally selects top-K units to reduce context length. The lightweight selector retains a recent window for fast dynamics and sparsely selects uniquely informative long-range anchors, providing a practical inference-time optimization.

## Key Results
- Achieves near-zero redundancy sensitivity (Dup-Split scores approaching zero) on duplication, paraphrasing, and reordering tests
- Maintains comparable Spearman rank stability to perturbation baselines while avoiding structural dominance issues
- Lightweight selector reduces context dimension while preserving essential information for downstream tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** RISE suppresses attribution scores for context units that are duplicates or near-duplicates of existing information.
- **Mechanism:** The method computes the Conditional Unique Dependence (CUD), defined as the conditional mutual information $I(C_i; \hat{T} | C_{\setminus i})$. If a context unit $C_i$ is fully determined by or redundant with the remaining context $C_{\setminus i}$, the conditional dependence approaches zero, effectively nullifying its attribution score regardless of its raw marginal correlation with the output.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes that conditional mutual information can be reliably estimated from the model's next-token distribution and that redundancy manifests as conditional independence given the remaining context.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "quantifies the unique influence of each input relative to others, minimizing the impact of redundancies."
  - [section 4, Lemma 1]: "If a context unit $C_i$ satisfies $C_i \perp \!\!\! \perp \hat{T} | C_{\setminus i}$, then $\Delta_i = 0$ and hence RISE($C_i$) = 0."
  - [corpus]: Corpus signals regarding feature attribution (e.g., SPEX) emphasize distinguishing marginal vs. interaction importance, aligning with the need for conditional separation, though specific CMI mechanisms are unique to this paper.
- **Break condition:** Fails if the estimator for conditional mutual information has high variance or bias in low-data regimes, causing non-zero scores for truly redundant units.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** RISE avoids the "structural dominance" failure mode where perturbation-based methods over-credit structurally necessary but semantically low-information units (e.g., the question in a QA task).
- **Mechanism:** Perturbation methods (like Leave-One-Out) observe large output shifts when removing essential structure (e.g., the query). RISE conditions on the rest of the context; if the "Question" unit is already present, RISE evaluates if other units (Context) add *unique* predictive information. It attributes based on residual information, not just removal sensitivity.
- **Core assumption:** Assumption: The model's reasoning can be localized to unique contributions rather than distributed structural necessity.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 7, Table 6]: Shows Perturbation assigning 0.92 score to the Question (structural) vs RISE-Lite assigning $\approx 0.00$, reallocating mass to informative Context.
  - [section 7]: "Perturbation-based attribution often achieves higher Spearman rank stability, but this can be misleading because perturbation is vulnerable to structural dominance."
  - [corpus]: Related work on reliability (e.g., "On the reliability of feature attribution methods") highlights sensitivity to input properties, which RISE mitigates via conditioning.
- **Break condition:** If a unit is structurally required *and* contains unique semantic info not found elsewhere, it will correctly receive high credit; the mechanism only fails if the "uniqueness" is incorrectly estimated due to noise.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A lightweight selector using RISE can reduce context length while preserving responsiveness to new information.
- **Mechanism:** By selecting a mandatory recent window $R$ and top-$K$ anchors from history $H$ based on $\Delta^{(R)}_i = I(C_i; \hat{T} | R)$, the system retains fast-changing dynamics (via $R$) and long-range unique dependencies (via $H$), discarding redundant history.
- **Core assumption:** Assumes the "recent" window captures immediate dynamics and that long-range dependencies are sparse (only $K$ units matter).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4, Algorithm 1]: "Retain recent context for fast dynamics and sparsely select uniquely informative long-range anchors."
  - [section 5, Proposition 3]: "Retaining $R$ guarantees responsiveness to fast-changing dynamics... while conditional selection... isolates... long-range anchors."
  - [corpus]: "Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction" (arXiv:2502.07490) discusses enhancing key information retrieval, paralleling the goal of context reduction, though using different masking techniques.
- **Break condition:** If critical long-range information is subtle and statistically indistinguishable from noise in the $I(C_i; \hat{T} | R)$ estimate, it will be discarded by the selector.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Conditional Mutual Information (CMI)**
  - **Why needed here:** RISE is mathematically grounded in CMI ($I(X;Y|Z)$). Understanding that this measures the information $X$ provides about $Y$ *given* $Z$ is crucial to grasping how RISE filters redundancy.
  - **Quick check question:** If context unit A is a duplicate of unit B, what is $I(A; \text{Output} | B)$? (Answer: Ideally zero).

- **Concept: Autoregressive Next-Token Distribution**
  - **Why needed here:** The "explanation target" $\hat{T}$ is typically the distribution of the next token. You must understand that we are explaining the probability distribution over vocabulary, not just a single decoded token.
  - **Quick check question:** Does RISE explain the gradient of the loss or the entropy of the predicted distribution?

- **Concept: Context Units vs. Tokens**
  - **Why needed here:** RISE operates on "structured context units" (e.g., a sentence, a retrieved chunk), not individual tokens. This aggregation is a design choice for stability and interpretability.
  - **Quick check question:** How does defining a context unit as a "paragraph" vs a "sentence" change the resolution of the RISE attribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Context Segmenter -> Forward Pass -> CUD Estimator -> Normalizer -> Selector (Optional)
- **Critical path:** The CUD Estimator. The paper uses lightweight estimators (referenced in Appendix/Complexity section) to avoid re-running the LLM per unit. Efficient estimation of conditional mutual information here determines if the method is usable at inference time.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - *Granularity:* Coarser units (chunks) = faster but lower resolution. Finer units (tokens) = expensive and noisier.
  - *Estimation Accuracy:* Simple KNN or variational estimators for CMI are fast but may be noisy; precise calculation is intractable.
  - *Selector vs. Scorer:* RISE-Lite is model-agnostic (post-hoc). The Integrated Selector requires training a gating network but amortizes cost.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Score Collapse:** All scores approach zero if the denominator in normalization is small or if estimation variance is too high.
  - **Retrieval Collapse:** If retrieval chunks are highly overlapping, RISE correctly suppresses them, potentially leaving only the query with high score. This is a feature, but may look like a "failure" if one expects retrieved text to be cited.
  - **Structural Dominance (Baseline):** If implementing perturbation baselines, watch for high scores on prompt formatting/tags.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Duplication Sensitivity Test:** Create a prompt with a clear answer, duplicate a critical context sentence 3 times. Verify RISE assigns high score to only one copy and near-zero to duplicates (compare vs Attention which splits credit).
  2. **Structural Ablation:** Run RISE on a standard QA prompt. Compare the score of the "Question" block vs RISE-Lite. Verify RISE down-weights the question relative to perturbation baselines.
  3. **Selector Efficiency:** Implement the lightweight selector (Algorithm 1) on a long-context RAG task. Measure latency reduction vs. quality drop (if any) when keeping only top-K anchors.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How sensitive are RISE attribution scores to the choice of conditional mutual information (CMI) estimator, and what is the quantitative impact of approximation error on explanation reliability?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "Future work will develop improved estimators, quantify approximation error..."
- **Why unresolved:** CMI estimation in high-dimensional continuous spaces is prone to bias and variance, yet the paper relies on specific estimator choices without analyzing their error bounds or failure modes.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis of RISE using different CMI estimators (e.g., kNN vs. variational) on synthetic data with known ground-truth dependencies to quantify the deviation from theoretical redundancy suppression.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the RISE framework be effectively extended to token-level granularity without compromising the robustness guarantees observed at the context-unit level?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper identifies as a limitation that RISE "operates over structured context units... rather than individual tokens, improving interpretability... at the cost of token-level granularity."
- **Why unresolved:** Moving to token-level analysis exponentially increases the size of the conditioning set ($C_{\setminus i}$), potentially making the conditional dependence estimation intractable or statistically unstable.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An implementation of token-level RISE evaluated on the same duplication/overlap tasks, reporting the trade-off between computational cost and fine-grained attribution stability.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the integration of the RISE-based context selector into the generation pipeline degrade downstream task performance (e.g., accuracy) compared to using the full context?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper proposes a "lightweight context selector" to "reduce effective input dimension" while "preserving essential information," but the experimental evaluation focuses primarily on explanation stability metrics (Dup-Split, Spearman) rather than the causal impact on task accuracy (e.g., Exact Match).
- **Why unresolved:** While RISE suppresses redundancy, aggressively selecting unique context might inadvertently discard marginally informative or "backup" evidence that supports correct generation in edge cases.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks on standard RAG tasks (like SQuAD or HotpotQA) comparing the F1/EM scores of models using full context versus RISE-selected context subsets.

## Limitations

- **Estimator Reliability Uncertainty:** The paper does not specify which CMI estimator was used or provide quantitative validation of estimator accuracy, which is critical for practical deployment.
- **Context Unit Granularity Trade-off:** RISE operates on structured context units rather than individual tokens, potentially masking within-unit redundancy while reducing attribution resolution.
- **Out-of-Distribution Validation Gap:** Experiments focus on controlled transformations; performance with naturally occurring redundancy in real-world scenarios remains unvalidated.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The theoretical framework for measuring conditional unique dependence is sound, and the controlled experiments demonstrating reduced redundancy sensitivity (Dup-Split scores near zero) are well-executed and convincing.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that RISE maintains comparable rank stability while achieving better redundancy suppression is supported, but the faithfulness gap analysis is limited. The method appears to produce more stable rankings under output-preserving transformations, but the absolute quality of attributions requires further validation.
- **Low Confidence:** The lightweight selector's practical utility for inference-time context reduction is demonstrated only in limited experiments. Claims about "superior retrieval quality" and significant latency reduction need broader validation across diverse RAG scenarios and longer contexts.

## Next Checks

1. **Estimator Robustness Test:** Implement RISE with at least two different CMI estimators (e.g., kNN and variational). Evaluate attribution stability when adding Gaussian noise to context representations and measure variance in RISE scores across multiple runs. This directly tests the claim that RISE is "lightweight and model-agnostic" by verifying estimator consistency.

2. **Natural Redundancy Benchmark:** Create a realistic multi-source RAG evaluation where context comes from diverse but overlapping sources (e.g., multiple documents about the same event). Compare RISE's ability to identify truly unique information versus baselines, measuring both retrieval quality (answer accuracy) and attribution quality (whether RISE correctly identifies which source contributed unique information).

3. **Context Length Scaling:** Implement the lightweight selector on prompts of increasing length (100, 500, 1000 tokens of context). Measure: (a) computation time per inference, (b) quality retention when keeping only top-K anchors (using answer accuracy as proxy), and (c) whether RISE's selection remains stable as context grows. This tests the practical deployment viability claimed in the paper.
