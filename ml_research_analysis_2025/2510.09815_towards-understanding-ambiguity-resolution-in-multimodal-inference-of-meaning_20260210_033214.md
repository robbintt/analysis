# Towards Understanding Ambiguity Resolution in Multimodal Inference of Meaning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.09815
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09815
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: This paper investigates how learners infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context combining images and text. The authors conduct two human participant studies using Spanish, French, German, Korean, and Turkish sentence-image pairs, where participants guess the meaning of a masked word. They analyze factors such as sentence length, number of objects, language background, and the strategies participants use (e.g., exclusion principle, grammar analysis, and word similarity). They find that sentence length and number of objects significantly correlate with task difficulty, while language background correlations vary by language. Additionally, they explore the ability of AI systems (InternVL and InternLM) to predict human performance, finding that using a summary of strategies improves prediction accuracy. Overall, the study highlights the complexity of word meaning inference in multimodal contexts and identifies areas for future research to improve AI-driven language learning support.

## Executive Summary
This study explores how humans infer the meaning of unfamiliar words when presented with image-text pairs in a foreign language. Through two human participant studies across five languages (Spanish, French, German, Korean, Turkish), the authors identify key factors affecting word meaning inference, including sentence length, number of objects in images, and participant language background. They also evaluate whether AI systems can predict human performance on this task, finding that incorporating summaries of human strategies significantly improves prediction accuracy. The research provides insights into the cognitive processes underlying multimodal language learning and points to promising directions for developing AI tools to support vocabulary acquisition.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted two human participant studies using sentence-image pairs from the XM3600 dataset. In Study 1, 50 Spanish participants guessed masked nouns in sentences paired with images. In Study 2, 10 curated pairs were translated into Spanish, French, German, Korean, and Turkish for additional participants. Participants reported their language background and the strategies they used. For AI prediction, the authors used two models: InternVL (vision-language) and InternLM (text-only). They formatted prompts with participant background, recognized words, and strategy summaries, then queried models for likelihood estimates of correct guesses. The binary scoring metric evaluated predictions as correct if likelihood ≥75% with human success, or ≤50% with human failure.

## Key Results
- Sentence length and number of objects significantly correlate with task difficulty, with longer sentences and more objects making word inference harder
- Language background correlations with success vary by language, with native language having mixed effects across different target languages
- Using strategy summaries improves AI prediction accuracy by 19-20% compared to using participant background alone
- AI models' own performance on the task does not align well with human difficulty levels (Spearman correlation 0.529, p=0.359)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reducing candidate meanings through cross-modal constraint satisfaction improves word inference accuracy.
- Mechanism: Learners map known words to visible objects, then apply exclusion to reduce possibilities for the masked word. Sentence grammar (e.g., determiners, prepositions) further constrains which objects are plausible targets.
- Core assumption: Participants can reliably ground at least some known nouns to image regions; errors cascade if initial mappings are wrong.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "analyze factors such as sentence length, number of objects, language background, and the strategies participants use (e.g., exclusion principle, grammar analysis, and word similarity)"
  - [section IV-E]: "One is the exclusion principle: if participants are familiar with an object term that is not the target word, they can map this to an object in the image, thus reducing the number of possibilities"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct corpus support; related work on referential uncertainty in children (cite 39) discusses similar constraint mechanisms but in first-language acquisition.
- Break condition: When images contain many objects with similar salience, or sentences have low noun density, exclusion provides weak constraints.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Shorter sentences and fewer objects reduce cognitive load and referential ambiguity, correlating with higher inference success.
- Mechanism: Fewer words reduce parsing complexity and competition among candidate referents; fewer objects reduce visual search and matching uncertainty. Both factors limit the hypothesis space for the masked word.
- Core assumption: Sentence length and object count are proxies for task difficulty; other unmeasured factors (object distinctiveness, word frequency) may mediate this relationship.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "find that sentence length and number of objects significantly correlate with task difficulty"
  - [section IV-B, Table I]: "Number of objects was significantly negatively correlated with success... Sentence length was also significantly negatively correlated"
  - [corpus]: MUCAR (cite 104734) addresses multimodal ambiguity resolution but focuses on model benchmarks, not human cognitive load correlations.
- Break condition: Assumption is correlational, not causal—longer sentences may sometimes provide more disambiguating context, reversing the effect.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Providing AI systems with strategy summaries improves their ability to predict human inference performance.
- Mechanism: Strategy summaries (e.g., recognizing cognates, using image context, sentence structure analysis) give the model a prior over human reasoning patterns, enabling better alignment between model predictions and actual participant behavior.
- Core assumption: The summary captures generalizable strategies across participants and languages; individual variation is secondary.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "finding that using a summary of strategies improves prediction accuracy"
  - [section V, Table III]: "B+SS improves accuracy by 19% (from 0.476 to 0.568) comparing to B" for InternVL; similar gains for InternLM
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus support; related work on implicature in human-LLM interaction (cite 70041) suggests context improves alignment but does not address strategy summarization.
- Break condition: Summary effectiveness may degrade with novel strategies not represented in the training or summary set, or across cultures with different inferential norms.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Ambiguity tolerance**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames word inference as managing uncertainty; learners must persist despite incomplete information. Tolerance affects motivation and strategy selection.
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish between ambiguity (multiple valid interpretations) and noise (irrelevant distractors)?

- Concept: **Cross-modal grounding**
  - Why needed here: The task requires mapping linguistic tokens to visual regions; understanding this binding is essential for interpreting why certain image-text features predict success.
  - Quick check question: Given an image of a kitchen and the sentence "The chef holds a ___, can you identify which objects are plausible referents and why?

- Concept: **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**
  - Why needed here: The paper envisions AI systems curating progressively harder examples; ZPD defines the difficulty band where learners can succeed with scaffolding.
  - Quick check question: How would you adjust task difficulty (sentence length, object count) for a learner who succeeds on 70% of current items?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - InternVL -> InternLM -> CLIP -> GPT-4o

- Critical path:
  1. Load image-text pairs from XM3600 dataset (multilingual captions).
  2. Mask target noun in caption; present to participant or model.
  3. For human studies: collect guesses, self-reported strategies, language background.
  4. For AI prediction: encode participant background + (optional) strategy summary; query model for likelihood of correct guess.
  5. Evaluate: compare model confidence (thresholded at 50/75%) to actual outcomes.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **InternVL vs. InternLM**: InternVL has direct visual access but performed worse than InternLM with text descriptions in some settings—suggesting vision features may not align with human attention patterns.
  - **Specific strategy vs. summary**: Specific strategies leak problem-specific info, inflating performance; summaries generalize but may lose precision.
  - **Binary vs. graded scoring**: Paper uses binary success (exact/close match); ignores near-miss reasoning that may be pedagogically valuable.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Low correlation between CLIP scores and human success** (Table I: 0.0348 Spanish, 0.0794 English) indicates model-learned similarity does not match human difficulty judgments.
  - **AI-human difficulty mismatch**: Spearman correlation 0.529 (p=0.359) between model and human accuracy per example—statistically insignificant, suggesting models fail to capture human-relevant features.
  - **Turkish predictions consistently worst**: May indicate insufficient multilingual pretraining data or strategy summary not covering Turkish-specific cues.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Feature ablation**: Remove strategy summary; re-run InternLM-Text on all languages. Quantify drop in prediction accuracy to isolate summary contribution.
  2. **Cross-language transfer**: Train/prompt on Spanish participant data only; predict Turkish performance. Test whether strategies generalize across language families.
  3. **Error analysis by object count**: Bin examples by number of objects (low/medium/high); compute per-bin prediction accuracy. Identify if models fail disproportionately on complex scenes vs. humans.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What visual and textual features, beyond sentence length and object count, serve as robust predictors of learner success in multimodal word inference tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The abstract states the findings "prompt[] the need for further investigating of predictive features," and Section IV-B notes that "predicting guessing success requires further research" because most extracted features (e.g., object size, CLIP score) showed no significant correlation.
- Why unresolved: The study found that intuitive metrics like CLIP scores and object location did not correlate with performance, leaving a gap in understanding what data characteristics actually drive difficulty.
- What evidence would resolve it: The identification of new features (e.g., semantic density, visual clutter, or syntactic complexity) that show statistically significant correlations with human guessing accuracy in a larger dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the alignment between AI difficulty prediction and human difficulty be improved for multimodal language learning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The abstract mentions "promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability," and Section V concludes there is "significant potential to improve AI system ability to reason about, anticipate or mimic human performance" after finding AI and human difficulty were uncorrelated (Spearman 0.529, p=0.359).
- Why unresolved: Current AI systems (InternVL/InternLM) performed near chance levels in predicting human success, and their own performance on the task did not reflect the difficulty humans experienced.
- What evidence would resolve it: A model fine-tuned or prompted to predict human error rates with a significantly higher correlation coefficient than the reported baseline.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the use of AI to dynamically curate progressively challenging examples result in superior vocabulary retention compared to non-adaptive methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The introduction asks, "How well can artificial intelligence support human learning... [to] curate a progressively more challenging sequence of examples?" as a primary motivation for the work.
- Why unresolved: The paper validated feature correlations and AI prediction capabilities but did not conduct a longitudinal study to test if these predictions effectively support the "Zone of Proximal Development" (ZPD) in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative user study demonstrating that learners exposed to AI-curated sequences achieve higher long-term retention rates than those exposed to random or static sequences.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the inference of word meaning change when learners are presented with free-form, naturalistic captions (e.g., social media text) versus the descriptive captions used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly lists the limitation that the authors "do not examine more free-form captions, such as those users might use on social media."
- Why unresolved: The study relied on descriptive datasets (XM3600/COCO-style) which closely follow image content; naturalistic language often contains colloquialisms or indirect references that may alter the difficulty and strategies required.
- What evidence would resolve it: A replication of the participant studies using datasets like RedCaps, comparing success rates and strategy usage against the descriptive caption baseline.

## Limitations

- Small sample sizes (50 Spanish participants, 10 curated multilingual pairs) limit generalizability across languages and cultures
- Extrapolation from Spanish strategy data to predict performance in other languages assumes strategy transferability without empirical validation
- Binary success metric may not capture nuanced partial understanding that occurs in language learning

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Finding that sentence length and object count correlate with task difficulty (statistically significant results)
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of strategy summaries for improving AI predictions (substantial performance gains but limited sample sizes)
- **Low confidence**: Cross-language applicability of strategies (extrapolated from Spanish results without sufficient multilingual validation)

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-language strategy validation**: Test whether the Spanish-derived strategy summary improves predictions for Korean and Turkish participants as effectively as for French and German, to identify potential language-family dependencies.

2. **Scale-up replication**: Replicate the human study with 200+ participants per language and 50+ sentence-image pairs to establish robust statistical patterns and reduce sampling error.

3. **Strategy discovery analysis**: Compare prediction accuracy when using specific strategies versus strategy summaries across different participant subgroups (e.g., by native language, proficiency level) to determine which approach works best under varying conditions.
