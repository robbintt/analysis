## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TRANSIENT TABLES, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to reason over temporally evolving semi-structured tables. The dataset contains 3,971 questions derived from over 14,000 Wikipedia infoboxes across 1,238 entities, requiring models to understand and reason across multiple time periods. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs show significant performance gaps compared to human baselines (63 F1 vs 93 F1), highlighting fundamental challenges in temporal reasoning. The authors demonstrate that task decomposition strategies and oracle-based evidence retrieval improve performance, but models still struggle with complex temporal queries. Fine-tuning on subsets of the data further enhances performance, suggesting the need for more temporal reasoning training data.

## Method Summary
The authors create TRANSIENTTABLES by extracting Wikipedia infoboxes from revision histories, filtering entities based on temporal changes, and generating template-based questions with GPT-4o refinement. They evaluate LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama3-70B, Gemini-1.5-flash) across three context variations (closed-book, single table, full timeline, oracle tables), three decomposition strategies (WD, IR, IE, IRE), and three prompting methods (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT). Tables are converted to JSON format and provided as context. Fine-tuning experiments test 100 vs 1,000 samples to assess data efficiency. Primary metrics are F1 and Exact Match scores.

## Key Results
- Human baseline achieves 93 F1 and 88 EM on the dataset
- Best LLM (GPT-4o with CoT) achieves only 63 F1 and 58 EM
- Task decomposition improves performance by 10-20% across all models
- Fine-tuning on 1,000 samples achieves F1 > 70, exceeding performance of prompting strategies
- Oracle tables (perfect retrieval) still show significant reasoning gaps, indicating retrieval is not the only bottleneck

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Task Decomposition for Temporal Reasoning
Decomposing temporal QA into sequential sub-tasks (temporal grounding, attribute selection, analytical reasoning) reduces compounded errors by allowing models to focus on single tasks sequentially. Sequential LLM requests for individual tasks outperform single combined requests, improving performance from 50 to 52 on F1 and EM metrics.

### Mechanism 2: Oracle Context Isolation for Diagnosing Retrieval vs. Reasoning Failures
Providing only the most relevant tables (oracle) isolates reasoning capability from retrieval challenges, revealing that models still struggle even with perfect evidence. The 11.5% F1 gap between full timeline and oracle indicates retrieval is a bottleneck; the remaining gap after decomposition indicates reasoning limitations.

### Mechanism 3: Fine-Tuning on Temporal Reasoning Data Reduces Need for Explicit Decomposition
Fine-tuning GPT-4o-mini on 1,000 samples achieved F1 > 70 across all decomposition strategies, suggesting the model learned the underlying temporal reasoning patterns. Once fine-tuned, prompt-based granular task decomposition may not be necessary, as models internalize the decomposition.

## Foundational Learning

- **Semi-structured tables (Infoboxes)**: Wikipedia infoboxes have implicit structure, missing keys, and temporal evolution, differing from relational databases and unstructured text. Quick check: Can you explain why a table with "missing keys" and "incorrect values" still contains useful temporal information?

- **Explicit vs. Implicit Temporal Queries**: Questions are classified into explicit (direct time references) and implicit (require temporal grounding without cues). Models must first establish temporal grounding for implicit queries. Quick check: Given "Who was the captain before Rohit Sharma?", identify what temporal grounding step is required before answering.

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: CoT consistently outperformed zero-shot and few-shot across all models and settings. Understanding why explicit reasoning steps help LLMs is critical. Quick check: Why might CoT prompting be particularly beneficial for multi-table temporal reasoning versus single-table extraction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Wikipedia revision history → Entity timeline extraction → Threshold-based pruning → Template-based QA generation → LLM refinement → Evaluation framework (context × decomposition × prompting)

- **Critical path**: 1. Convert tables to JSON format 2. Apply chosen context setting 3. Execute decomposition (if using) 4. Evaluate with F1/EM against ground truth

- **Design tradeoffs**: Context length vs. completeness (full timeline vs. oracle); single-stage vs. multi-stage inference (accuracy vs. latency); fine-tuning vs. prompting (performance vs. flexibility)

- **Failure signatures**: Temporal grounding failure (high oracle, low full-timeline); reasoning failure (low oracle even with correct evidence); spurious correlation (random table performs similarly to latest table)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Baseline with full timeline, zero-shot, no decomposition; 2. Oracle tables with IRE decomposition, CoT; 3. Fine-tune GPT-4o-mini on 100 samples, evaluate zero-shot

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open-world retrieval**: How does performance change in open-world retrieval settings compared to the closed-world setting where tables are pre-associated with queries?

- **Parametric knowledge reliance**: To what extent do LLMs rely on pre-trained parametric knowledge versus in-context reasoning when answering questions about post-cutoff data?

- **Neuro-symbolic approaches**: Can neuro-symbolic approaches significantly enhance accuracy and interpretability of temporal reasoning compared to standard LLM prompting?

- **Diverse data structures**: How do LLMs perform on temporal reasoning tasks involving diverse or hybrid data structures (text, images, graphs) beyond standard Wikipedia Infoboxes?

## Limitations

- Template-based generation may not capture full complexity of naturally occurring temporal questions
- Closed-domain retrieval (pre-extracted tables) rather than open-domain retrieval from large corpora limits real-world applicability
- Performance improvements from fine-tuning on 1,000 samples may not scale proportionally to larger datasets or different table categories

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Task decomposition consistently improves performance across all models and settings (10-20% F1 gains)
- **Medium Confidence**: Fine-tuning on 1,000 samples achieves F1 > 70, suggesting data-driven solutions may be more effective than prompting innovations
- **Low Confidence**: Oracle context isolation cleanly separates retrieval from reasoning failures, though artificial nature limits real-world relevance

## Next Checks

1. **Open-domain retrieval validation**: Implement retrieval system that searches Wikipedia infoboxes from scratch rather than using pre-extracted tables to measure performance with imperfect retrieval

2. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Apply best-performing fine-tuned model to temporally evolving tables from entirely different domains (financial reports, medical records) without additional fine-tuning

3. **Error propagation analysis**: Instrument decomposition pipeline to measure error rates at each stage and compare performance when intermediate outputs are perturbed with realistic noise levels
