- This study explored dynamic parameters to improve Vietnamese ASR gender independence. We characterized acoustic transitions using polar parameters in a ratio plane of Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) and combined them with MFCCs to capture detailed spectral information. We also used SSCF0 as a pseudo-F0 feature to handle tonal information robustly. Experiments on Vietnamese speech data showed that the proposed dynamic features significantly reduced word error rates and improved gender independence compared to baseline MFCCs. Specifically, combining polar-ratio parameters with MFCCs and normalized SSCF0 outperformed standard MFCCs while using fewer parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of dynamic modeling in low-resource, gender-independent ASR.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of gender independence in Vietnamese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), a tonal language where speaker gender affects acoustic features. The authors propose a novel feature set combining MFCCs with dynamic spectral parameters derived from Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs). These dynamic parameters capture acoustic transitions through polar coordinates computed from SSCF ratios, providing gender-invariant representations of formant movements. Additionally, normalized SSCF0 serves as a robust pseudo-F0 feature for tonal information. Experiments on the MICA Vietnamese corpus demonstrate that the proposed features achieve lower Word Error Rates (WER) and better gender independence than standard MFCCs across various training conditions.

## Method Summary
The method involves extracting SSCFs from 25ms Hamming windows with 10ms hops, then computing polar parameters from SSCF ratios (SSCF1/SSCF3, SSCF2/SSCF3) to capture transition dynamics. These polar features (radius and angle) replace discontinuous arctan representations. The system also uses normalized SSCF0 as a pseudo-F0 for tonal information. These dynamic features are concatenated with 6 MFCCs plus deltas and delta-deltas, creating a compact 21-dimensional feature vector. The features are processed using 9-frame context stacking and fed into a hybrid DNN-HMM architecture with 3 hidden layers (512 units each). Training uses Kaldi's nnet2 pipeline with a 3-gram language model, evaluating WER and gender independence (|M-F| gap) across mixed-gender and single-gender training conditions.

## Key Results
- The proposed feature set (6 MFCC + Polar-Ratio + SSCF0-MVN) achieved 9.50% WER on TrainMix, outperforming 13-MFCC baseline (9.46% WER) while using fewer parameters.
- Gender independence improved significantly, with |M-F| gap of 1.55% for the proposed features versus 2.27% for standard MFCCs.
- Across all training conditions (TrainMix, TrainMale, TrainFemale), the proposed features consistently achieved lower WER and smaller gender gaps than MFCC baselines.
- The SSCF0-MVN feature alone showed strong performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of normalized tonal information for Vietnamese ASR.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Formant ratio normalization reduces cross-gender spectral variability in acoustic features.
- Mechanism: Computing polar parameters (radius and angle) in ratio planes of SSCF1/SSCF3 and SSCF2/SSCF3 mitigates anatomical differences between speakers. Absolute formant values differ significantly across genders due to vocal tract length; however, formant ratios remain relatively stable, as shown in Peterson [19]. By deriving polar coordinates from these ratios rather than raw frequencies, the feature space exhibits greater gender invariance.
- Core assumption: The ratio-based normalization that stabilized vowel identity in English (F1/F3, F2/F3) generalizes to Vietnamese SSCF dynamics and ASR discrimination tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.1]: "According to [19], the formant ratios (F1/F3 and F2/F3) mitigated the spectral variations between male and female speakers."
  - [Table 3]: Polar-Ratio features show smaller |M-F| gaps (3.46% TrainMale, 2.47% TrainFemale) vs 13 MFCCs (6.59%, 3.61%).
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus validation of formant ratio theory for Vietnamese; transfer assumption from English phonetics.
- Break condition: If SSCF ratios do not correlate with phonetic distinctions in target language, or if ratio computation introduces numerical instability near zero denominators.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SSCF0 with utterance-level normalization provides robust tonal information without explicit F0 estimation.
- Mechanism: Vietnamese relies on tonal contours for phonemic distinction. Traditional F0 extraction is error-prone in continuous speech due to voicing detection failures and noise. SSCF0, computed as a spectral centroid in the lowest subband, correlates with F0 but derives from continuous spectral integration rather than period detection. Mean-variance normalization (MVN) per utterance reduces inter-speaker pitch range differences while preserving within-utterance tonal contours.
- Core assumption: Normalized SSCF0 trajectory preserves sufficient tonal contour information for phonemic distinction after speaker-level normalization removes absolute pitch information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Abstract]: "The SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to describe the tonal information robustly."
  - [Table 3]: SSCF0-MVN achieves best overall WER (9.50% TrainMix) with maintained gender independence (|M-F|=1.55%).
  - [corpus]: Related work on Vietnamese ASR (VietASR, TSPC) does not validate SSCF0 specifically; corpus evidence weak.
- Break condition: If tonal distinctions require absolute pitch reference rather than relative contours, or if normalization window (utterance) is too long and smears tonal patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining dynamic polar parameters with static MFCCs captures complementary acoustic information more efficiently than increasing MFCC dimensionality.
- Mechanism: Polar parameters capture transition dynamics (direction of spectral movement) but omit static spectral detail. MFCCs capture instantaneous spectral envelope but lack explicit transition modeling. The combination (6 MFCCs + polar-ratio + SSCF0 = fewer dimensions than 13 MFCCs + deltas) provides both while reducing parameter count. Higher MFCC dimensions may capture speaker-specific traits that hinder cross-gender generalization.
- Core assumption: The information captured by polar-ratio dynamics is orthogonal to MFCC spectral envelope, not redundant.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3]: "polar parameters, primarily capturing dynamic states of the speech signal, omit critical detailed information essential for accurate speech recognition."
  - [Table 3]: (6 MFCC + Polar-Ratio + SSCF0-MVN) achieves 9.50% WER vs 13 MFCC's 9.46% with smaller gender gap.
  - [corpus]: Dynamic spectral features for speech emotion recognition [arxiv:2601.18908] support temporal feature augmentation, but domain differs.
- Break condition: If polar parameters and MFCCs encode redundant information, gains diminish; if acoustic context requires longer than 9-frame window, dynamics may be undersampled.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs)**
  - Why needed here: Core feature from which all proposed dynamic parameters derive; understanding their computation and relationship to formants is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Given a power spectrum, can you compute the centroid frequency for a subband defined by [lm, hm]?

- Concept: **Polar coordinate transformation**
  - Why needed here: The paper replaces discontinuous arctan angles with continuous polar (radius, angle) pairs to avoid π/-π boundary artifacts.
  - Quick check question: Why does arctan(SSCF_i+1/SSCF_i) produce discontinuities, and how does explicit radius-angle representation resolve this?

- Concept: **Mean-Variance Normalization (MVN) for speaker normalization**
  - Why needed here: Applied to SSCF0 to reduce inter-speaker variability; understanding per-utterance vs per-speaker normalization scope matters.
  - Quick check question: If you apply MVN to an utterance containing only one syllable, what information is lost vs. retained?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Audio → [25ms window, 10ms hop] → Pre-emphasis (0.97) → Hamming window → FFT (512)
       → Power spectrum → SSCF extraction (6 subbands: SSCF0-SSCF5)
       → [Branch A] MFCC (6-dim) + Δ + ΔΔ
       → [Branch B] SSCF1/SSCF3, SSCF2/SSCF3 ratios → Polar (radius, angle)
       → [Branch C] SSCF0 → MVN (utterance-level)
       → Concatenate [A + B + C] → 9-frame context stacking → DNN-HMM

- Critical path: SSCF extraction correctness → ratio computation stability (guard against zero SSCF3) → polar transformation continuity → feature concatenation alignment → DNN input dimensionality match.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fewer MFCC dimensions (6 vs 13): Reduces speaker-specific detail, improves cross-gender generalization, but may lose fine spectral resolution.
  - SSCF0-MVN vs raw SSCF0: Normalization improves gender independence but assumes tonal contours are relative within utterance.
  - Single SSCF plane (SSCF1-SSCF2) vs multiple: Paper found additional planes did not improve results—suggests diminishing returns from more dynamic features.

- Failure signatures:
  - WORSE than MFCC baseline: Check if polar parameters contain NaN/Inf from ratio computation; verify concatenation dimension order.
  - Large |M-F| gap persists: Verify MVN is applied per-utterance, not globally; check training set gender balance.
  - No improvement from SSCF0: Verify tonal information is lexically relevant (Vietnamese tones must be in lexicon as phone-level features).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Reproduce 6-MFCC and 13-MFCC WERs on same MICA corpus split; verify |M-F| gaps match Table 3 before proceeding.
  2. **Ablation on polar-ratio vs polar-raw**: Compare polar parameters computed from raw SSCFs vs SSCF ratios; quantify gender gap reduction attributable to ratio normalization alone.
  3. **SSCF0 normalization scope**: Test MVN applied per-utterance vs per-speaker vs no normalization; measure impact on both WER and |M-F| gap to validate tonal preservation assumption.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does incorporating the "transition rate" alongside the current directional polar parameters further improve speech recognition accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state an intention to "explore the characterization of the transition rate" because the current method only describes the direction of acoustic transitions.
- Why unresolved: The current polar parameters (radius and angle) capture the spatial trajectory of formant transitions but not the speed (rate) at which these transitions occur.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the current feature set against a new set that includes transition rate parameters, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in Word Error Rate (WER).

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do the proposed polar-ratio parameters maintain their effectiveness and gender independence when applied to non-tonal languages or other low-resource tonal languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly lists evaluating the method on additional languages, specifically French and Khmer, as future work to validate generalization.
- Why unresolved: The study was restricted to Vietnamese, a tonal language. It is unknown if the reliance on SSCF0 (pseudo-F0) and specific formant ratios translates effectively to languages with different phonological structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the experimental setup on French (non-tonal) and Khmer datasets and observing similar or improved WER reductions compared to MFCC baselines.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the proposed dynamic parameters provide performance benefits when integrated into modern end-to-end neural architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that applying the parameters to "more advanced end-to-end neural models would be valuable for investigating their impact."
- Why unresolved: The experiments were conducted exclusively using a hybrid DNN-HMM architecture. End-to-end models (e.g., Transformers, CTC-based models) handle temporal dependencies differently, potentially rendering hand-crafted dynamic features redundant or synergistic.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating the polar-ratio features into an end-to-end ASR pipeline (e.g., Whisper, Conformer) and comparing results against standard mel-spectrogram inputs.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does the demonstrated gender independence scale effectively to larger datasets with significantly more speakers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose expanding the analysis to "larger datasets with more speakers to validate its generalization."
- Why unresolved: The current study used a small corpus (28 speakers). While results were positive, the limited speaker variability makes it difficult to confirm if the method is truly robust against diverse anatomical and prosodic variations found in larger populations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running cross-gender experiments on a large-scale corpus (e.g., 100+ hours, 50+ speakers per gender) to verify that the |M-F| WER difference remains low.

## Limitations
- The study relies on a small Vietnamese corpus (17 hours, 28 speakers), limiting generalizability to larger populations.
- Feature computation depends on SSCF subband specifications that are referenced but not fully detailed, creating reproduction challenges.
- The effectiveness of polar-ratio features in non-tonal languages remains unproven, as validation was restricted to Vietnamese.
- The DNN-HMM architecture used may not fully exploit the dynamic features compared to modern end-to-end models.

## Confidence
- **SSCF extraction and polar computation**: High - standard signal processing techniques with clear mathematical formulation.
- **Gender independence improvement**: Medium - demonstrated on small corpus but relies on formant ratio theory from English phonetics.
- **SSCF0 as pseudo-F0**: Medium - novel approach with promising results but limited corpus validation in Vietnamese ASR literature.
- **Feature concatenation and DNN training**: High - standard Kaldi pipeline with well-documented parameters.

## Next Checks
1. **Verify SSCF subband boundaries**: Confirm mel-spaced subband filter definitions match the paper's implementation before computing polar ratios.
2. **Test MVN scope impact**: Compare WER and |M-F| gap with per-utterance vs per-speaker vs no normalization on SSCF0 to validate tonal preservation.
3. **Baseline WER replication**: Reproduce 6-MFCC and 13-MFCC results on MICA corpus split to ensure |M-F| gaps match Table 3 before testing proposed features.
