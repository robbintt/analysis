# Latency-Response Theory Model: Evaluating Large Language Models via Response Accuracy and Chain-of-Thought Length

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.07019
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07019
- Authors: Zhiyu Xu; Jia Liu; Yixin Wang; Yuqi Gu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LaRT jointly models response accuracy and CoT length, revealing strong negative correlation between ability and speed, outperforming IRT on predictive power, efficiency, validity, and LLM efficiency.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Latency-Response Theory (LaRT), a novel evaluation framework for large language models that extends Item Response Theory by jointly modeling response accuracy and chain-of-thought length. LaRT treats CoT length analogously to response time in cognitive assessment, estimating latent ability and latent speed under a correlated bivariate normal distribution. The framework demonstrates superior estimation precision when ability and speed are correlated, and reveals that higher reasoning ability correlates with longer CoT, particularly on harder benchmarks. Applied to four math benchmarks with 80+ open-source LLMs, LaRT provides more discriminative and reliable model rankings than accuracy-only IRT.

## Method Summary
LaRT extends 2-parameter IRT by incorporating CoT length as a log-normal response time model. The framework uses a probit link for binary accuracy and log-normal distribution for CoT length, estimating latent ability (θ) and latent speed (τ) via Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization (SAEM) with spectral initialization. The spectral initialization uses SVD on centered response and log-CoT matrices to provide data-driven starting values, eliminating the need for burn-in phases. The algorithm iterates between sampling latent traits (via Unified Skew-Normal and truncated normal distributions), stochastic approximation of the Q-function, and M-step optimization using L-BFGS.

## Key Results
- LaRT achieves higher estimation precision than IRT when latent ability and speed are correlated, with precision gains increasing as |ρ| increases
- Strong negative correlation found between latent ability and latent speed across all benchmarks, stronger for more difficult benchmarks (MATH500 vs. AIME25)
- LaRT outperforms IRT on predictive power (MAE 0.183 vs. 0.269), item efficiency (fewer questions needed), validity (lower variance across subsets), and LLM efficiency (better estimates with fewer models)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Joint modeling of response accuracy and CoT length improves estimation precision compared to accuracy-only IRT when latent ability and speed are correlated.
- Mechanism: The Fisher information for latent ability θ is augmented by a term depending on ρ²/(1-ρ²). Per Equation (10), precision = 1/(1-ρ²) + Σ information terms. When |ρ| > 0, the variance shrinks relative to IRT (which assumes ρ = 0).
- Core assumption: Ability and speed share a bivariate normal distribution with non-zero correlation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "asymptotic estimation precision of the latent ability under LaRT exceeds that of IRT whenever the latent ability and latent speed are correlated"
  - [section 4.2] "˜IJ(θ) increases as |ρ| increases, implying that the variance decreases as |ρ| increases and is maximized at ρ = 0, which corresponds to the IRT case"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; neighbor papers discuss IRT for LLMs but not CoT-latency joint models
- Break condition: If ρ ≈ 0 in the target domain, LaRT reduces to IRT with no precision gain.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Higher reasoning ability correlates with longer CoT (negative correlation between θ and τ), and this effect strengthens on harder benchmarks.
- Mechanism: Complex reasoning tasks require more test-time compute. LaRT captures this via the log-normal CoT model where τ (speed) inversely relates to CoT length; higher θ leads to systematically longer reasoning chains.
- Core assumption: CoT length is a valid proxy for reasoning effort; LLMs do not produce long but vacuous chains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "strong negative correlation between latent ability and latent speed, stronger for more difficult benchmarks"
  - [section 6.1] "ρ is strongly negative, confirming that LLMs with stronger math reasoning ability have longer CoT... |ρ| increases as the questions in the dataset becomes more difficult"
  - [corpus] No corpus papers directly validate this correlation; it remains an empirical pattern in this study
- Break condition: If models learn to answer correctly with shorter CoT (e.g., through training for efficiency), the correlation may weaken or flip.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Spectral initialization enables faster, more stable SAEM convergence than traditional burn-in phases.
- Mechanism: SVD on the response matrix and log-CoT matrix provides data-driven initial estimates close to the optimum, allowing decaying step sizes (α_t = 1/t) from iteration 1. This avoids instability from random initialization.
- Core assumption: The probit link and log-normal specification permit spectral approximations to latent factor structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "This initialization strategy bypasses this burn-in phase entirely... yielding both faster convergence and improved estimation accuracy"
  - [appendix D] Simulation shows informed initialization reduces RMSE and eliminates outliers seen in traditional SAEM
  - [corpus] No corpus papers use this specific spectral-SAEM combination for IRT-RT models
- Break condition: If items have near-zero discrimination or data is extremely sparse, spectral estimates may be unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- **Item Response Theory (2PL model)**
  - Why needed here: LaRT extends IRT; understanding how discrimination (a_j) and difficulty (b_j) interact with latent ability (θ_i) is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Given P(correct) = Φ(aθ + b), what happens to the item characteristic curve as a increases?

- **Probit link and latent variable formulation**
  - Why needed here: LaRT uses probit (not logit) for theoretical tractability in identifiability proofs and SUN-distribution sampling.
  - Quick check question: Why does the probit link admit a closed-form connection to truncated normal distributions while logit does not?

- **Expectation-Maximization and Stochastic Approximation EM**
  - Why needed here: The SAEM algorithm is the core estimation procedure; understanding E-step, M-step, and Robbins-Monro step-size decay is essential.
  - Quick check question: In SAEM, why must step sizes satisfy Σα_t = ∞ and Σα_t² < ∞?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: R (accuracy matrix) → Spectral initialization (SVD) → SAEM loop (S-step, SA-step, M-step) → Ω (population parameters) → θ_i, τ_i (individual latent traits)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Validate identifiability conditions (≥2 non-zero entries in a and φ; sign constraints)
  2. Run spectral initialization (Algorithm 2)
  3. Iterate SAEM (Algorithm 1) with C=1 sample per iteration, α_t = 1/t
  4. Extract MAP estimates of (θ_i, τ_i) via convex optimization

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Probit vs. logit: Probit enables SUN sampling and identifiability proofs but may fit binary data slightly worse
  - C=1 samples per iteration: Faster but noisier; increase C if variance is high
  - Max CoT token limit (10,240 in paper): Too low truncates reasoning; too high increases cost without benefit

- **Failure signatures**:
  - a_j or φ_j estimates near zero: Item provides no discrimination; check item quality
  - ρ estimate stuck at boundary (±1): Possible identifiability issues or insufficient item/person variance
  - MAE on held-out items not improving: Model misspecification or initialization failure

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate simulation study (Section 5) with N=200, J=50, ρ=-0.8 to validate SAEM recovery
  2. Apply LaRT to a single benchmark (e.g., MATH500) with 20+ LLMs; verify negative ρ and compare θ rankings to raw accuracy
  3. Ablate spectral initialization: Compare convergence speed and RMSE against random initialization with 20-iteration burn-in

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does LaRT's advantage over IRT change as benchmark saturation increases, specifically when most LLMs correctly answer most items?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "While we only considered open-source small-to-medium size LLMs for evaluation, it will be a fruitful direction to explore LaRT's performance in saturated dataset in the future."
- Why unresolved: Current experiments use small-to-medium LLMs on benchmarks where many items remain unsolved; saturation regime where advanced models solve most items is unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison of LaRT vs. IRT discrimination power on benchmarks where top LLMs achieve >90% accuracy, measuring variance in latent ability estimates among high-performing models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What performance gains does a multidimensional extension of LaRT provide for predicting responses to unseen items compared to the unidimensional model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "extending a, θ, φ, τ from one dimension to multiple dimensions can help extract more information from the data... we believe extending LaRT to multiple dimensions will achieve even better predictive performance."
- Why unresolved: Theoretical and algorithmic extensions to multidimensional latent abilities are discussed but not implemented or evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of multidimensional LaRT with comparison to unidimensional LaRT on held-out item prediction accuracy (MAE) and ability estimation precision across multiple skill dimensions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can incorporating CoT content quality (beyond length) into LaRT improve model ranking validity compared to length-only modeling?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "LaRT's flexibility allows incorporating other covariates that are highly correlated with latent ability... The step-by-step grading can serve as another summary of the information contained in the CoT."
- Why unresolved: CoT length is modeled but richer information (reasoning step correctness, logical coherence) is not yet integrated into the framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extended LaRT model incorporating binary step-by-step grading scores, compared on ranking consistency across benchmark subsets (validity metric) and ranking agreement with human expert judgments.

## Limitations

- LaRT's correlation-based advantage disappears when ability and speed are uncorrelated, reducing to standard IRT performance
- The framework assumes CoT length is a valid proxy for reasoning effort, which may not hold for models trained for efficiency or those producing vacuous long chains
- Current implementation uses single log-normal distribution for CoT length regardless of correctness, potentially violating assumptions when incorrect reasoning chains are systematically longer

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Precision gain from joint modeling): **High** - Theoretical derivation is complete and simulation supports the claim under the stated conditions.
- Mechanism 2 (Ability-speed correlation via CoT): **Medium** - Empirically observed but not yet independently validated; depends on CoT quality assumptions.
- Mechanism 3 (Spectral initialization efficiency): **Medium** - Algorithm is well-specified and simulation shows improvement, but no ablation against other initialization schemes is provided.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the simulation study with varying ρ values (including ρ≈0) to confirm that LaRT only outperforms IRT when correlation is non-zero.
2. Apply LaRT to a benchmark where models are explicitly trained for efficiency (e.g., Gemini's "thinking budget" variants) to test whether the ability-speed correlation breaks down.
3. Perform an ablation study comparing spectral initialization against 20-iteration burn-in with random initialization on the same synthetic data used in Section 5.
