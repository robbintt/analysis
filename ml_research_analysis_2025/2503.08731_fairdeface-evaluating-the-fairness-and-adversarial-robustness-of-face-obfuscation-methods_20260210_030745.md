# FairDeFace: Evaluating the Fairness and Adversarial Robustness of Face Obfuscation Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.08731
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08731
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive framework evaluating seven face obfuscation methods across 500+ experiments, finding GAN-based methods (especially DeepPrivacy2) achieve highest privacy-utility balance with minimal demographic bias

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FairDeFace, a framework for evaluating the fairness and adversarial robustness of face obfuscation methods. The authors tested seven obfuscation methods (Pixelation, K-Same, DP-Snow, Fawkes, DeepPrivacy, DeepPrivacy2, CIAGAN) across four benchmark datasets using multiple face recognition systems. The framework measures privacy preservation (OSR), utility preservation (attribute detection), and demographic fairness through Equality of Opportunity metrics. Key findings reveal that GAN-based methods like DeepPrivacy2 outperform adversarial approaches, while demographic biases consistently affect Asian Females and Black Males across multiple methods.

## Method Summary
FairDeFace evaluates face obfuscation methods through a four-stage pipeline: 1) Generate obfuscated faces using seven diverse methods, 2) Run Quality Analysis (face detection passing rates), 3) Run Privacy Analysis (verification and identification attacks using ArcFace/FaceNet), and 4) Run Utility Analysis (attribute preservation for age, gender, emotion). The framework computes fairness metrics using Equality of Opportunity with epsilon thresholds ranging from 0.02 to 0.2, and incorporates novel saliency map analysis to identify which facial features each method modifies. Experiments were conducted across four datasets (BFW, DemogPairs, RFW, CelebA) with more than 500 total evaluations.

## Key Results
- DeepPrivacy2 achieves 100% passing rate, 100% detection rate, and 76% OSR, outperforming all other methods
- Fawkes shows near-zero effectiveness (2% OSR with ArcFace) despite being optimized for FaceNet
- Consistent demographic bias against Asian Females and Black Males across multiple methods, with Fawkes failing on 16-51% of photos for these groups
- GAN-based methods preserve utility attributes better than traditional or adversarial approaches while maintaining privacy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
GAN-based methods (particularly DeepPrivacy2) achieve higher privacy-utility balance by replacing entire facial regions with synthetically generated faces rather than making localized imperceptible changes. Conditional GANs receive background context and pose information, inpaint a new facial region that is perceptually realistic but identity-divergent from the original. This produces faces that remain detectable while breaking identity linkage in embedding space. Core assumption: Face recognition systems rely primarily on learned identity embeddings; realistic synthetic faces with different underlying geometry will produce sufficiently different embeddings. Break condition: If face recognition systems begin using biological markers not captured in synthetic face generation.

### Mechanism 2
Fawkes achieves low obfuscation success because adversarial perturbations focus on limited facial features while robust recognition systems analyze faces holistically. Fawkes applies gradient-based perturbations optimized against specific recognition models, targeting features most influential for those models' predictions. However, when evaluated against different architectures (ArcFace), these perturbations fail because the target features have low importance in the new model's decision process. Core assumption: Adversarial perturbations transfer poorly across architectures with different attention patterns. Break condition: If supervised perturbation methods are designed with multi-model optimization or if recognition systems share identical attention patterns.

### Mechanism 3
Demographic bias stems from both upstream face detector failures and differential focus patterns during obfuscation. Face detectors (MTCNN in Fawkes, Dlib in CIAGAN) fail more frequently on certain demographics (Asian Females, Black Males), causing lower passing rates. Additionally, saliency analysis shows obfuscation methods apply different modification intensities to different demographics—Fawkes focuses more on nose regions for females and forehead for males. Core assumption: Bias is partially inherited from face detection bias and partially from learned generation patterns. Break condition: If face detection achieves demographic parity or if obfuscation methods constrain modification patterns uniformly across demographics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Generative Adversarial Networks for Conditional Image Synthesis**: Understanding how DeepPrivacy2 and CIAGAN generate realistic faces while preserving pose/background requires knowledge of conditional GANs, encoder-decoder architectures, and how conditioning signals guide generation. Quick check: Given an input face image with detected landmarks, how would a conditional GAN use pose information at the bottleneck layer to guide face inpainting?

- **Adversarial Examples and Transferability**: Fawkes is a poisoning-based adversarial attack; understanding why it fails requires grasping gradient-based perturbation, the white-box threat model, and why perturbations optimized for one model fail on others. Quick check: If a perturbation is optimized to maximize loss against Model A, why might it have minimal effect on Model B that uses different feature extractors?

- **Equality of Opportunity as a Fairness Metric**: The paper uses EO with varying epsilon thresholds to measure bias across demographic groups in detection, verification, and obfuscation success rates. Quick check: For two demographic groups with obfuscation success rates of 85% and 75%, what is the EO ratio and does it indicate bias at epsilon = 0.15?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Image → Face Detector (MTCNN/Dlib) → Obfuscation Method → Obfuscated Image → Quality Analysis (Face Detection Rate) → Privacy Analysis (Verification/Identification) → Utility Analysis (Attribute Preserving) → Fairness Metrics (EO, Average Bias) → Visualization (Saliency + MediaPipe)

- **Critical path**: Face detection accuracy determines whether obfuscation succeeds (passing rate) → Obfuscation method quality determines detectability of output → Recognition system strength determines OSR → Fairness computed across demographics

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Pixelation: Highest OSR (93%) but destroys all utility attributes
  - GAN-based (DP2): Balanced privacy (76% OSR), quality (100% detection), and utility preservation
  - Adversarial (Fawkes): Imperceptible changes but near-zero effectiveness (2% OSR) against robust FR
  - Threshold selection: Lower epsilon (0.02-0.05) needed for high-performance systems; higher epsilon (0.15-0.20) acceptable for lower-performing systems

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Passing rate < 100% indicates face detector bias (check which demographics fail most)
  - OSR near 50% indicates obfuscation is no better than random chance
  - High correlation (>0.5) between obfuscation focus and recognition focus suggests vulnerability to targeted attacks
  - Inconsistent bias patterns across datasets may indicate dataset quality issues

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run face detection (MTCNN) on your target dataset and compute FDR per demographic to establish baseline detector bias
  2. Generate obfuscated faces using at least one method from each class (traditional pixelation, GAN-based like DP2, adversarial like Fawkes) and compute passing rates
  3. Run verification attacks using ArcFace on the obfuscated outputs, compute OSR and EO for each demographic pair at epsilon = 0.1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Can incorporating an average heatmap mask constraint into the cost functions of obfuscation methods enforce uniform feature modifications across demographics to reduce bias?

2. Does increasing the overlap between the facial regions targeted by adversarial obfuscation methods and those relied upon by robust face recognition systems improve obfuscation effectiveness?

3. How does the privacy-utility trade-off differ when evaluating "whole utility" concepts (e.g., scene context, activity) versus the specific attribute preservation analyzed in this study?

## Limitations
- The study primarily evaluates seven specific obfuscation methods against two face recognition systems, limiting generalizability to newer architectures
- Saliency-based focus analysis relies on MediaPipe landmark detection which could introduce its own demographic biases
- The paper does not address potential attacks that combine multiple obfuscation methods or adaptive recognition systems

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Comparative performance ranking of obfuscation methods (DeepPrivacy2 > K-Same > CIAGAN > others) is well-supported by consistent results across multiple datasets
- **Medium Confidence**: Mechanism explaining why GAN-based methods outperform adversarial approaches is logically sound but requires additional empirical validation
- **Low Confidence**: Novel saliency-based analysis linking obfuscation focus regions to demographic bias is promising but has limited external validation

## Next Checks
1. Test whether DeepPrivacy2's privacy preservation remains effective against recognition systems not used in the original evaluation (e.g., Amazon Rekognition, Microsoft Face API)

2. Vary face detection thresholds systematically to determine the minimum accuracy required to reliably detect demographic bias in obfuscation methods

3. Evaluate whether ensemble or adaptive adversarial attacks that combine multiple perturbation strategies can overcome the identified limitations of single-method approaches like Fawkes
