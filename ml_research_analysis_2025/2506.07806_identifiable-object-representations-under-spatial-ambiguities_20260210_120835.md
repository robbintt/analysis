# Identifiable Object Representations under Spatial Ambiguities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07806
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07806

- Key outcome: VISA achieves 0.67±0.01 SMCC on CLEVR-MV, outperforming OCLOC (0.63±0.02) while learning view-invariant content without viewpoint annotations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses multi-view object-centric representation learning under spatial ambiguities like occlusions and viewpoint variations. The proposed VISA method learns view-invariant content representations while disentangling viewpoint information without requiring viewpoint annotations. The approach aggregates slot representations from multiple views using a probabilistic slot attention mechanism with Hungarian matching alignment. Theoretical analysis proves identifiability of the learned representations under a viewpoint sufficiency assumption. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and new complex datasets demonstrate VISA's robustness and scalability, with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
VISA resolves spatial ambiguities in multi-view object-centric representation learning by aggregating view-specific slot representations to learn invariant content information while disentangling global viewpoint-level information. The method employs a spatial transformer to predict view-specific parameters, applies inverse transforms before slot attention, and uses Hungarian matching to align slots across views. View-invariant content is obtained through convex combination of aligned slots. The model is trained using an ELBO objective combining reconstruction loss and KL divergence on view-specific representations. View warmup is implemented in the first 100K iterations, using view-specific slots with p=0.5 probability. The architecture uses probabilistic slot attention with EM updates, GMM posteriors for views, and weak injective decoders with LeakyReLU activations.

## Key Results
- Achieves SMCC score of 0.67±0.01 on CLEVR-MV compared to 0.63±0.02 for OCLOC
- Demonstrates improved generalization in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations on new MV-MOVI datasets
- Shows robustness across synthetic benchmarks (CLEVR-AUG, GQN, GSO) and complex datasets (MV-MOVIC, MV-MOVID) with 72K scenes and 5 views each
- View warmup and view-specific slots significantly improve performance and stability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
VISA works by explicitly modeling the relationship between viewpoints and object representations. The spatial transformer predicts viewpoint-specific parameters that are inverted before slot attention, allowing the model to learn content-invariant features. Hungarian matching aligns corresponding slots across views, and convex combination aggregates these aligned slots to obtain view-invariant content. The view warmup phase stabilizes training by initially learning view-specific representations before transitioning to the aggregated approach. The theoretical identifiability proof under viewpoint sufficiency ensures that the learned representations can be uniquely recovered from sufficient viewpoints.

## Foundational Learning
- **Probabilistic slot attention**: EM-based iterative update mechanism for object-centric representations; needed for handling uncertainty in object detection and segmentation across views
- **Spatial transformer networks**: Learn viewpoint-specific transformation parameters; needed to handle viewpoint variations and occlusions
- **Hungarian matching**: Optimal assignment algorithm for aligning slots across views; needed to ensure consistent object correspondence
- **GMM posteriors for views**: Mixture model for representing view distributions; needed to capture uncertainty in viewpoint modeling
- **Weak injectivity**: Property ensuring decoder functions preserve distinguishability; needed for theoretical identifiability guarantees
- **View sufficiency**: Assumption that sufficient viewpoints enable unique object reconstruction; needed for theoretical identifiability proof

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input images -> View encoder -> GMM posterior -> Spatial transformer -> Inverse transform -> Probabilistic slot attention -> Hungarian matching -> Convex combination -> View-invariant content -> Decoder

**Critical Path:** View encoder → GMM posterior → Spatial transformer → Inverse transform → Probabilistic slot attention → Hungarian matching → Convex combination → Decoder

**Design Tradeoffs:** The paper uses 7 slots as a design choice, but the optimal number is not explored systematically. View warmup provides stability but adds complexity to training. The choice between MLP, spatial broadcast CNN, or transformer decoder involves balancing reconstruction quality against computational cost.

**Failure Signatures:** Slot permutation mismatch across views during aggregation, content collapse (all slots identical), viewpoint sufficiency violations leading to ambiguous representations, and spatial transformer instability under extreme viewpoint variations.

**First Experiments:** 1) Train on CLEVR-MV with 3+ views, batch size 32, 7 slots, evaluate SMCC across seeds; 2) Test view warmup ablation by training with and without warmup phase; 3) Evaluate sensitivity to slot number by training with 5, 7, and 9 slots.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the viewpoint sufficiency assumption affect model performance when systematically violated in real-world scenarios with partial object visibility? The authors acknowledge this assumption may not hold in practice and requires more extensive analysis.
- Does the weak injectivity assumption hold for alternative decoder architectures beyond piecewise-affine functions? The theoretical guarantees depend on this assumption, but validation is limited to tested decoder classes.
- Can VISA representations support downstream tasks such as world modeling, planning, and causal reasoning? The paper focuses on representation learning and identifiability, leaving utility for downstream reasoning unexplored.

## Limitations
- Theoretical identifiability relies on a viewpoint sufficiency assumption that may not hold in real-world scenarios with limited viewpoint coverage
- Exact architectural details for spatial transformer and encoder components are underspecified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Choice of 7 slots appears arbitrary without systematic analysis of how slot number affects performance
- New MV-MOVI datasets may still lack complexity of real-world multi-view scenarios with dynamic objects and varying lighting conditions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Experimental methodology and evaluation metrics (SMCC, INV-SMCC, MCC) are well-defined and reproducible; ablation studies on view warmup provide strong evidence
- **Medium Confidence**: Theoretical identifiability proof assumptions (viewpoint sufficiency, weak injectivity) are supported by experimental results but lack extensive validation
- **Low Confidence**: Exact architectural details for spatial transformer and encoder components are underspecified; convergence properties and stability of Hungarian matching are not thoroughly analyzed

## Next Checks
1. **Architecture Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the number of slots (5, 7, 9) and evaluate SMCC scores to determine optimal slot count and assess sensitivity to this hyperparameter
2. **View Sufficiency Analysis**: Conduct controlled experiments by training VISA with varying numbers of viewpoints per scene to empirically test the viewpoint sufficiency assumption and identify the minimum number of views required for stable performance
3. **Spatial Transformer Robustness**: Evaluate VISA's performance under synthetic viewpoint perturbations (small rotations/translations not seen during training) to assess the robustness of the spatial transformer component and the overall method's generalization to unseen viewpoints
