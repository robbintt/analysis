# CLAD-Net: Continual Activity Recognition in Multi-Sensor Wearable Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.23077
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23077
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves 91.36% final accuracy with 8.78% forgetting on PAMAP2 dataset

## Executive Summary
CLAD-Net addresses catastrophic forgetting in human activity recognition using multi-sensor wearable data. It combines a self-supervised transformer for long-term memory (via cross-attention across body-mounted sensors) with a CNN for activity classification (trained with knowledge distillation). This dual architecture enables the model to continuously adapt to new subjects without losing performance on previously seen ones. Evaluated on PAMAP2 and Daily and Sports Activities datasets, CLAD-Net outperforms baselines like Experience Replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation while maintaining robustness under low label availability.

## Method Summary
CLAD-Net employs a dual-stream architecture: a self-supervised transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across body-mounted sensors, and a CNN performs supervised classification with knowledge distillation. The transformer learns generalizable representations without labels using Barlow Twins contrastive learning, while the CNN incorporates knowledge distillation to retain past knowledge during subject-wise fine-tuning. This design enables continual adaptation to new subjects while preserving performance on previous ones, without requiring memory replay or task boundaries.

## Key Results
- Achieved 91.36% final accuracy and 8.78% forgetting on PAMAP2 dataset
- Outperformed baselines: Experience Replay (86.84% FA, 11.28% FM) and Elastic Weight Consolidation (88.46% FA, 10.82% FM)
- Demonstrated robustness with only 10-20% labeled data availability
- Cross-attention mechanism provided ~4% accuracy improvement over self-attention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Self-supervised transformer provides stable long-term memory
The transformer learns task-agnostic representations through Barlow Twins contrastive learning, capturing global activity patterns invariant to subject-specific variations. Cross-sensor relationships encode transferable information that single-sensor models miss.

### Mechanism 2: Knowledge distillation preserves prior decision boundaries
The model uses KL divergence between current and frozen model outputs to penalize changes affecting previous task predictions. This anchors the model to past knowledge through output consistency rather than parameter rigidity.

### Mechanism 3: Cross-attention captures transferable inter-sensor dependencies
Each body part's sensor stream attends to all others via multi-head attention, creating representations that model how movements propagate across the body. These structural patterns generalize across subjects better than raw signal magnitudes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks**
  - **Why needed here**: CLAD-Net's entire purpose is mitigating this phenomenon. Sequential gradient updates on new tasks can overwrite weights critical for old tasks.
  - **Quick check**: If a model achieves 99% on task A, then 99% on task B, what accuracy would you expect on task A if trained sequentially without continual learning mechanisms? (Answer: often drops below 50% in HAR contexts)

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation (Hinton/LwF style)**
  - **Why needed here**: The CNN module uses distillation to preserve old knowledge. Soft targets contain richer information than hard labels.
  - **Quick check**: Why might KL divergence between current and frozen model outputs preserve more information than storing a few exemplar samples? (Answer: Soft targets encode relationships between classes; exemplars are limited by memory budget)

- **Concept: Barlow Twins / Self-Supervised Representation Learning**
  - **Why needed here**: The transformer's ability to learn without labels hinges on contrastive learning objectives that don't require negative pairs.
  - **Quick check**: What does the Barlow Twins loss optimize for, and why does avoiding negative pairs matter for small-batch scenarios? (Answer: Decorrelates feature dimensions while maximizing agreement between augmented views; more stable than SimCLR with small batches)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Input (L×d time-series) → Body-part partitioning (n subsets) → [Transformer branch] Embedding + Positional Encoding → Cross-Attention (n branches) → 3× FF blocks → Representation r → [CNN branch] 3× Conv blocks (4 conv layers + pooling each) → Features h → Concat(r, h) → Linear classifier → Activity prediction

**Critical path:**
1. **Data preprocessing**: Per-subject standardization is essential—skip this and inter-subject variance will overwhelm the model.
2. **Cross-attention query selection**: Paper uses dominant hand as query. If your sensor setup differs, identify the most informative body part empirically.
3. **Augmentation for SSL**: Crop-and-resize performed best. Implementation matters—randomly crop 50% of time-series, then interpolate back.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Barlow Twins vs SimCLR/BYOL**: Paper shows Barlow Twins wins, likely due to no negative pair dependency. Trade-off: requires careful augmentation design.
- **Cross-attention vs Self-attention**: Cross-attention adds ~n× attention computation but provides ~4% FA gain on PAMAP2. Worth it for multi-sensor setups.
- **Memory vs Distillation**: No exemplar storage means constant memory footprint, but distillation alone underperforms vs ER on some metrics.

**Failure signatures:**
- **FA plateaus while LA remains high**: Distillation weight too low—model overfits to current subject. Increase λ_distill.
- **High forgetting despite both modules**: Check augmentation strategy—poor SSL representations won't transfer.
- **Cross-attention helps minimally**: Likely sensor placement doesn't capture coordinated movements. Consider self-attention variant.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Baseline sanity check**: Train standard CNN sequentially on your subjects without any CL mechanisms. Measure forgetting—should be severe (>15% FM).
2. **Ablation replication**: Implement CLAD-Net, then remove distillation loss. Confirm FM increases substantially (paper shows ~8% increase on PAMAP2).
3. **Sensor ablation**: If you have different sensor configurations, test cross-attention with different query body parts. Paper assumes hand; validate this holds for your setup.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Scalability to many tasks**: How does CLAD-Net's performance and stability scale when the number of sequential tasks (subjects) increases significantly beyond the eight subjects used in current benchmarks?
- **Class-incremental extension**: Can the current architecture be effectively adapted to support fully class-incremental learning where new activity classes are introduced dynamically?
- **Additional sensor modalities**: How does the cross-attention mechanism perform when extended to additional sensor modalities beyond the IMU accelerometers and gyroscopes tested in this work?
- **Computational efficiency**: Is the dual-architecture approach computationally efficient enough for deployment on resource-constrained wearable devices compared to memory-replay baselines?

## Limitations
- **Unknown hyperparameters**: Critical architectural dimensions (embedding size, number of heads, CNN filter sizes) are not explicitly defined in the paper.
- **Dataset-specific validation**: Performance claims are based on two specific datasets with controlled sensor placements and may not generalize to arbitrary wearable setups.
- **Computational overhead**: Maintaining two parallel architectures with distillation likely imposes heavier computational burden than single-backbone methods.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Knowledge distillation effectively reduces forgetting (proven by ablation showing 16.42%→8.78% FM improvement). Cross-attention provides consistent FA gains over self-attention.
- **Medium confidence**: Transformer representations transfer across subjects due to cross-sensor signatures (evidence is indirect). The 8.78% final forgetting rate represents strong CL performance.
- **Low confidence**: Barlow Twins vs alternative SSL methods (only compared within this paper). The assumption that hand-as-query generalizes to arbitrary sensor setups.

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter sensitivity sweep**: Systematically vary λ_distill (0.1→10) and λ_BT (0.1→10) to identify optimal values and verify that λ_distill=1 isn't dataset-specific.
2. **Domain shift robustness**: Test CLAD-Net when subjects have non-overlapping activity sets or significantly different sensor placements to validate cross-attention's domain invariance claims.
3. **Memory-augmented baseline**: Implement Experience Replay with minimal exemplars (e.g., 10 per class) to directly compare against distillation's memory efficiency while controlling for performance.
