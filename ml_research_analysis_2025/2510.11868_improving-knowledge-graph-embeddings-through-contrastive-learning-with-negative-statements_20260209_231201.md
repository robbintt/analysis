# Improving Knowledge Graph Embeddings through Contrastive Learning with Negative Statements

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11868
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11868
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Dual-model contrastive learning architecture achieves 10.07% MRR improvement in link prediction on Wikidata by incorporating negative statements

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating negative statements into knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). Traditional KGE methods often ignore negative knowledge, treating missing information as unknown. The proposed solution introduces a dual-model architecture that trains separate embeddings for positive and negative statements, using contrastive learning to generate more challenging negative samples. The approach significantly improves link prediction performance on Wikidata and enhances triple classification accuracy on the Gene Ontology knowledge graph.

## Method Summary
The approach builds two knowledge graphs - one from positive statements and one from explicitly defined negative statements - and trains separate KGE models on each. During training, negative samples are generated by corrupting positive triples and selecting the most plausible candidates based on scores from the opposing model. This contrastive learning strategy iteratively refines negative samples, leading to more meaningful negatives. The method demonstrates substantial improvements in both link prediction (Wikidata) and triple classification (Gene Ontology) tasks.

## Key Results
- Link prediction on Wikidata: MRR improved from 4.66% to 10.07%
- Link prediction on Wikidata: Hits@10 increased from 10.32% to 20.80%
- Triple classification on GO KG: F1 scores improved from 58.5% to 67.3%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-model architecture works by creating a feedback loop between positive and negative embeddings. When generating negative samples, the model uses the negative KGE to identify which corrupted triples are most likely to be plausible negatives. This contrastive learning approach ensures that the negative samples are challenging and informative, rather than random corruptions. By maintaining separate models for positive and negative knowledge, the system can learn distinct representations that capture the semantic differences between what is true and what is explicitly false in the knowledge graph.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs)**: Why needed - To represent entities and relations in continuous vector spaces for machine learning tasks. Quick check - Can the model compute similarity between entities and predict missing links?

2. **Negative Sampling in KGEs**: Why needed - To provide contrastive examples that help the model distinguish between true and false statements. Quick check - Does the model generate corrupted triples that challenge the current embeddings?

3. **Contrastive Learning**: Why needed - To iteratively improve the quality of negative samples by learning from the interaction between positive and negative models. Quick check - Does the negative sampling process adapt based on the learned embeddings?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Positive KGE Model -> Negative KGE Model -> Negative Sampling -> Contrastive Training

**Critical Path**: 1) Build separate positive and negative KGs 2) Initialize dual KGE models 3) Generate negative samples via corruption 4) Select challenging negatives using opposing model scores 5) Train models with contrastive objectives 6) Iterate negative sampling

**Design Tradeoffs**: Requires explicit negative statements (limiting applicability) vs. gains in embedding quality; separate models increase parameter count but enable distinct representations; iterative sampling adds computational cost but improves sample quality.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on link prediction suggests ineffective negative sampling; convergence issues may indicate improper balance between positive and negative model training; degraded clustering suggests loss of semantic structure.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify dual-model training on synthetic KGs with known negatives 2) Test negative sampling quality by manual inspection of generated samples 3) Compare single vs. dual model performance on small benchmark KGs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Requires explicit negative statements, limiting applicability to knowledge graphs lacking such annotations
- Iterative corruption process may introduce computational overhead that scales poorly with larger knowledge graphs
- Limited evaluation scope on triple classification task lacks comparison with state-of-the-art methods

## Confidence
- Link prediction results: High
- Triple classification results: Medium
- Clustering performance improvements: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Scalability Testing: Evaluate the approach on larger knowledge graphs (e.g., DBpedia, YAGO) to assess computational efficiency and performance degradation with increasing graph size.

2. Negative Sampling Ablation: Conduct experiments comparing the proposed contrastive negative sampling strategy against alternative negative sampling methods to isolate the contribution of the dual-model approach.

3. Generalization Across Domains: Test the method on diverse knowledge graph domains beyond Wikidata and GO to assess robustness and identify domain-specific limitations.
