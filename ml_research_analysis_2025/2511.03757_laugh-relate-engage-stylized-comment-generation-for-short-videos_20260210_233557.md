# Laugh, Relate, Engage: Stylized Comment Generation for Short Videos

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.03757
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03757
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Modular multi-agent system achieves 90%+ human preference on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube for stylized short video comments

## Executive Summary
LOLGORITHM introduces a modular multi-agent system for generating platform-specific, stylized comments on short videos. The system processes video content through segmentation, contextual analysis, and style-aware prompt construction, supporting six distinct styles (puns, rhyming, memes, sarcasm, plain humor, and content extraction) using a multimodal large language model. A bilingual dataset of 1,000 comments from Douyin (Chinese) and YouTube (English) across five video genres was constructed for training and evaluation.

The system achieved preference rates exceeding 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube in human evaluation, significantly outperforming baseline methods in automated metrics (originality, relevance, style conformity) and demonstrating superior platform-specific cultural adaptation and engagement potential. The modular architecture enables fine-grained style control through explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples.

## Method Summary
LOLGORITHM processes short videos through a pipeline that begins with data preprocessing (downloading, highlight detection, frame extraction, ASR) to extract key multimodal features. A multimodal large language model generates a video description from the extracted audio and visual features. The system then classifies the video and retrieves a style template comment from a database using semantic matching and multi-layer voting. The final comment is generated by combining the video description with the style template, followed by post-processing and ranking to produce the output.

## Key Results
- Achieved 90%+ human preference rates on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube in platform-specific evaluations
- Outperformed baseline methods in automated metrics: originality, relevance, and style conformity
- Demonstrated effective platform-specific cultural adaptation with case studies showing concise slang for Douyin vs. standard humor for YouTube

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Highlight-Guided Context Extraction
The system isolates high-value temporal segments using audio-visual peaks, feeding focused "punchline" context to the language model rather than dead time. It calculates a highlight score $H(t)$ based on audio amplitude and light intensity derivatives, applying variable frame extraction rates (10fps for highlights vs. 0.5fps for normal segments) to maximize information density where it matters most.

### Mechanism 2: Structure-Based Style Transfer
The system retrieves a "style template" (high-performing comment from similar video) and explicitly instructs the LLM to adopt its structure while swapping content. A multi-layer voting mechanism selects a representative comment $c^*$ from the dataset, which is passed to the LLM as a structural scaffold rather than content to copy.

### Mechanism 3: Platform-Specific Length & Sentiment Priors
The evaluation and generation pipeline enforces platform-specific constraints (length limits, sentiment alignment) to match local user expectations. The system uses custom "Style Conformity" scores that penalize outputs deviating from observed platform norms (25-35 characters for Chinese Douyin comments, sentiment matching).

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Multimodal Feature Fusion**
- Why needed here: Short video humor is often multimodal (visual gag + audio punchline). The system must fuse ASR text $T$ and Frame features $F$ into a unified description $D$.
- Quick check question: How does the system weight audio vs. visual input when generating a description for a silent comedy vs. a talk show?

**Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Why needed here: Pure LLMs struggle with specific "internet culture" styles. The system uses retrieval (finding a template comment) to ground the generation in actual platform data.
- Quick check question: In Equation 14, how does the prompt $I$ distinguish between "copying the template's topic" and "copying the template's vibe"?

**Concept: Semantic Similarity Search**
- Why needed here: To find the "Style Template," the system must map the input video to the most similar video in its database using vector embeddings.
- Quick check question: What happens if the target video $v_{target}$ has no close neighbors in the existing dataset (low cosine similarity)?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Video URL -> Data Preprocessing (Downloader, Highlight Detector, Frame Extractor, ASR) -> MLLM (Video Description) -> Video Classifier (Semantic Matching) -> Comment Pool -> Multi-layer Voting -> Style Template -> LLM (Description + Style Template) -> Post-Processing (Ranking) -> Final Comment

**Critical path:** Highlight Detection -> Frame Extraction. If the highlight detector (Eq 1) misses the key moment, the frame extractor saves frames at 0.5fps (low density), potentially omitting the visual context necessary for the joke.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Fixed vs. Dynamic Sampling: Using 10fps for highlights ensures detail but increases token cost/latency
- Generic vs. Stylized: The use of a template ensures style but risks "format fatigue" (comments sounding repetitive)

**Failure signatures:**
- "Just a summary": Indicates the model prioritized content extraction over style injection
- "Too lengthy/formal": Indicates the "Style Template" retrieval or enforcement failed
- Irrelevance: Suggests the Video Description $D$ missed the context, likely due to poor highlight detection

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Highlight Ablation: Run the system with fixed 1fps sampling vs. the dynamic $H(t)$ method. Compare "Relevance" scores to validate the cost/accuracy tradeoff.
2. Template Influence Test: Generate comments with *no* template vs. *random* template vs. *selected* template to isolate the impact of the voting mechanism (Eq 11).
3. Cross-Platform Zero-Shot: Train the retriever on Douyin data only, then test on YouTube videos to see if the "style priors" transfer or break.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. **LLM Generalization:** How well does the LOLGORITHM framework generalize to multimodal large language models other than GPT-4o? Only GPT-4o was tested; the modular architecture may behave differently with models having varied visual encoders, reasoning capabilities, or instruction-following strengths.

2. **Cross-Lingual/Platform Expansion:** Can LOLGORITHM maintain its performance when expanded to additional languages and short-video platforms beyond Douyin and YouTube? Current bilingual dataset and style templates are tailored to Chinese and English platform cultures.

3. **Personalization Integration:** How can personalized style adaptation be integrated into LOLGORITHM to align comments with individual user preferences? The current system uses platform-level style templates; it lacks user profiling mechanisms.

4. **Scalability Validation:** Does LOLGORITHM's performance scale robustly to larger, more diverse video datasets beyond the current 200-video, 1,000-comment evaluation set? The dataset size is modest, and the multi-layer voting mechanism may face efficiency or quality degradation at scale.

## Limitations
- Highlight detection mechanism assumes audio-visual peaks correlate with humorous moments without empirical validation
- Structure-based style transfer claims LLM can decouple semantic content from linguistic structure without ablation studies
- Platform-specific length priors assume user engagement correlates with strict adherence to observed patterns without testing causality

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Highlight detection improves information density for LLMs; platform-specific length constraints affect user preference; modular architecture enables fine-grained style control

**Medium Confidence:** Style template retrieval improves style conformity over zero-shot generation; multimodal fusion captures comedic context better than single-modality approaches

**Low Confidence:** The system generalizes to rapidly evolving internet culture; semantic structure decoupling works reliably across all six styles; platform priors are causally linked to engagement

## Next Checks
1. Deadpan Humor Test: Evaluate LOLGORITHM on 50 silent/comedy videos where audio peaks don't indicate humor. Compare relevance scores to baseline methods to validate highlight detection robustness.

2. Template Structure Ablation: Generate comments using (a) selected template, (b) random template, and (c) no template for identical videos. Measure style conformity scores to isolate template retrieval impact.

3. Cross-Platform Transfer Test: Train the video classifier and template retriever on Douyin data exclusively, then test on YouTube videos. Measure style conformity and relevance to assess platform-specific adaptation limits.
