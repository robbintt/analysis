# FanarGuard: A Culturally-Aware Moderation Filter for Arabic Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18852
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18852
- Reference count: 40
- FanarGuard is a bilingual moderation filter that evaluates both safety and cultural alignment in Arabic and English language models, achieving strong agreement with human annotators and outperforming inference-time system prompting while using only a quarter of the parameters of top-performing filters.

## Executive Summary
FanarGuard is a bilingual moderation filter designed to evaluate both safety and cultural alignment in Arabic and English language models. It addresses the gap in existing moderation tools by incorporating cultural context into safety assessments. The filter is trained on a large dataset of 468K prompt-response pairs, annotated for harmlessness and cultural alignment, and uses LLM judges with a regression-based approach to enable adjustable sensitivity thresholds.

## Method Summary
FanarGuard is trained on a dataset of 468K prompt-response pairs annotated for harmlessness and cultural alignment. It employs LLM judges and a regression-based approach to enable adjustable sensitivity thresholds. The model is designed to be culturally aware, addressing the gap in existing moderation tools that overlook cultural context. Evaluation includes comparisons with human annotators and top-performing filters on public safety benchmarks.

## Key Results
- FanarGuard achieves strong agreement with human annotators on cultural safety tasks (MAE of 0.79), matching human inter-annotator reliability.
- It outperforms inference-time system prompting and closely matches top-performing filters on public safety benchmarks.
- FanarGuard uses only a quarter of the parameters of top-performing filters, demonstrating both cultural sensitivity and parameter efficiency.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FanarGuard works by training on a large, culturally annotated dataset and using LLM judges to evaluate both safety and cultural alignment. The regression-based approach allows for adjustable sensitivity thresholds, making it adaptable to different moderation needs. By incorporating cultural context, it addresses the limitations of existing tools that focus solely on harmlessness.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cultural Alignment Annotation**: Why needed: To capture cultural nuances in moderation. Quick check: Ensure annotations reflect diverse Arabic cultural perspectives.
- **LLM Judges**: Why needed: To automate the evaluation of cultural alignment and harmlessness. Quick check: Validate LLM judgments against human annotations.
- **Regression-Based Approach**: Why needed: To enable adjustable sensitivity thresholds for different moderation contexts. Quick check: Test threshold adjustments on sample data.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Training Data -> LLM Judges -> Regression Model -> FanarGuard Filter
- **Critical Path**: Training Data Annotation -> LLM Judge Evaluation -> Regression Model Training -> Filter Deployment
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing cultural sensitivity with computational efficiency; using fewer parameters while maintaining performance.
- **Failure Signatures**: Potential biases in training data; limited generalizability to unseen cultural contexts.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Evaluate FanarGuard's performance on a held-out test set of culturally diverse prompts.
  2. Compare FanarGuard's judgments with those of human annotators from different cultural backgrounds.
  3. Test FanarGuard's robustness by applying it to languages and cultural contexts outside its training domain.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but raises concerns about the generalizability of FanarGuard's cultural alignment capabilities beyond the specific Arabic cultural contexts represented in its training data.

## Limitations
- Generalizability of cultural alignment capabilities beyond the specific Arabic cultural contexts in the training data.
- Lack of detailed demographic information about human annotators, raising concerns about potential biases in cultural judgments.
- Small sample size (50 annotations) for comparing FanarGuard's performance with human inter-annotator reliability.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: FanarGuard achieves strong agreement with human annotators on cultural safety tasks within the tested sample.
- **Medium confidence**: FanarGuard matches or exceeds the performance of existing moderation filters on public safety benchmarks.
- **Low confidence**: FanarGuard's cultural alignment judgments are representative of diverse Arabic cultural perspectives and generalize to new, unseen contexts.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale human evaluation with diverse annotator demographics to verify cultural alignment judgments across a broader range of Arabic cultural contexts.
2. Benchmark FanarGuard against publicly available, named moderation filters on standard safety datasets to substantiate claims of parameter efficiency and performance parity.
3. Test FanarGuard's robustness and generalization by evaluating its performance on languages and cultural contexts not present in its training data, and assess degradation in sensitivity or accuracy.
