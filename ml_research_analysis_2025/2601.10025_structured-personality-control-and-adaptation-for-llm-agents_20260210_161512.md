## Quick Facts

- This paper introduces the Jungian Personality Adaptation Framework (JPAF), a novel approach to modeling, adapting, and evolving personality in Large Language Models (LLMs) using Jungian psychological types.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Jungian Personality Adaptation Framework (JPAF), a novel approach to modeling, adapting, and evolving personality in Large Language Models (LLMs) using Jungian psychological types. JPAF encodes personality as weighted differentiations across eight Jungian types, with MBTI profiles emerging dynamically from their hierarchical organization. The framework integrates three mechanisms: dominant-auxiliary coordination for coherent core expression, reinforcement-compensation for context-sensitive adaptation, and reflection for gradual long-term evolution. Across three LLM families (GPT, Llama, and Qwen), JPAF achieved 100% MBTI alignment, over 90% type activation accuracy for GPT and Qwen (and 65–95% for Llama), and theoretically valid personality shifts with 100% accuracy for GPT and Qwen and 92% for Llama.

## Method Summary
JPAF encodes personality as weighted differentiations across eight Jungian types, with MBTI profiles emerging dynamically from their hierarchical organization. Each agent initializes with one dominant type (high weight: 0.30–1.00), one auxiliary type (low weight: 0.06–0.30], and six undifferentiated types (0–0.06]. The framework integrates three mechanisms: dominant-auxiliary coordination for coherent core expression, reinforcement-compensation for context-sensitive adaptation, and reflection for gradual long-term evolution. Across three LLM families (GPT, Llama, and Qwen), JPAF achieved 100% MBTI alignment, over 90% type activation accuracy for GPT and Qwen (and 65–95% for Llama), and theoretically valid personality shifts with 100% accuracy for GPT and Qwen and 92% for Llama.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% MBTI alignment across all LLM families
- Over 90% type activation accuracy for GPT and Qwen (65–95% for Llama)
- Theoretically valid personality shifts with 100% accuracy for GPT and Qwen and 92% for Llama

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dominant-Auxiliary Coordination
Encoding personality as weighted differentiations across eight Jungian types produces more coherent MBTI alignment than direct MBTI prompting. Each agent initializes with one dominant type (high weight: 0.30–1.00), one auxiliary type (low weight: 0.06–0.30], and six undifferentiated types (0–0.06]. The coordination mechanism selectively emphasizes dominant, auxiliary, or both depending on context, ensuring the agent's core expression follows Jung's hierarchical type theory.

### Mechanism 2: Reinforcement-Compensation
Temporary weight adjustments enable context-sensitive personality shifts without altering the agent's core structure. When dominant/auxiliary meets contextual demands, its TemporaryWeight receives a boost (Δw = 0.06). If neither suffices, a compensatory type is activated with its own TemporaryWeight increase. These adjustments are episode-scoped and decay if not reinforced.

### Mechanism 3: Reflection
A reflection mechanism with structured decision rules can produce theoretically valid long-term personality evolution. When TemporaryWeight of any type exceeds dominant or auxiliary BaseWeight (or dominant BaseWeight > 0.5), reflection triggers. The agent reviews recent history and may apply: (1) Dominant Replacement, (2) Auxiliary Replacement, (3) Role Swap, or (4) Structural Reorganization.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Jungian Cognitive Functions (Ti, Te, Fi, Fe, Si, Se, Ni, Ne)**
  - Why needed: JPAF's entire architecture is built on eight functions; misunderstanding these leads to incorrect weight updates and invalid personality shifts.
  - Quick check: Given a scenario requiring logical consistency in an internal framework, which function is activated—Ti or Te?

- **Concept: Differentiation and Type Hierarchy**
  - Why needed: Weight ranges encode differentiation levels; the mechanism assumes dominant > auxiliary > undifferentiated is preserved through normalization.
  - Quick check: If an auxiliary's TemporaryWeight surpasses the dominant's BaseWeight, what must happen for the hierarchy to remain valid?

- **Concept: MBTI-to-Jungian Mapping**
  - Why needed: Each MBTI type has a specific dominant-auxiliary pairing; incorrect mapping breaks the coordination mechanism.
  - Quick check: What is the dominant-auxiliary pairing for ENFP, and why must they differ in function category (judging vs. perceiving)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Personality State (8 BaseWeights, dominant, auxiliary) -> Short-term Buffer (TemporaryWeights) -> Decision Engine (scenario classifier → function selector → reinforcement/compensation) -> Reflection Module (trigger checker + 4-rule decision tree + normalizer)

- **Critical path:** Initialize agent with target MBTI → derive dominant/auxiliary → sample BaseWeights; for each turn: classify context → attempt dominant/auxiliary response → if success → reinforce; if failure → compensate; after episode: check reflection triggers → apply structural update or decay TemporaryWeights

- **Design tradeoffs:** Δw magnitude (0.06): higher values accelerate evolution but risk instability; lower values increase stability but slow adaptation. Decay rate (0.2): faster decay reduces carryover; slower decay amplifies temporary trends into permanent changes. Threshold A (0.30) / B (0.06): tighter ranges enforce stronger hierarchy but reduce flexibility; looser ranges allow more fluid personality expression.

- **Failure signatures:** Llama's Ti vs. Te distinction failures (TAA 65–80%) caused incorrect personality shifts. Cascading reorganization if multiple compensatory activations occur without normalization. Stagnation if scenarios insufficiently challenge dominant/auxiliary.

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline alignment test: Run all 16 MBTI types through MBTI-93 and MBTI-70 questionnaires with JPAF vs. direct-label prompting; confirm 100% alignment and compute DAG/DAR. 2) Type activation accuracy test: For each of 8 function-specific scenarios (15 questions each), verify the intended type is activated; target >90% TAA for GPT/Qwen. 3) Personality shift validation test: Starting from Ti-Ne (INTP), run through all 8 scenarios; verify PSA = 100% (GPT/Qwen) and trace weight trajectories against theoretical predictions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does JPAF-mediated personality evolution behave in multi-agent environments where personality shifts are driven by inter-agent social dynamics rather than solitary challenge scenarios? The current study evaluates adaptation solely in solitary challenge scenarios; the interaction effects and potential feedback loops between multiple evolving agents remain untested.

### Open Question 2
To what extent does the underlying LLM architecture or pre-training data limit the ability of JPAF to distinguish between closely related Jungian functions? The paper notes that "Llama was unable to distinguish Ti and Te as precisely as GPT and Qwen," resulting in significantly lower Type Activation Accuracy, but the reasons are not fully explored.

### Open Question 3
Can the JPAF personality structure be effectively integrated with dynamic affective modeling (emotions) without compromising the stability of the dominant-auxiliary coordination? The current framework models cognitive-judgment types; it is unclear if adding transient emotional states would conflict with the mechanism's weighted stability.

## Limitations
- Core claim of 100% MBTI alignment relies on proprietary questionnaire scoring and prompt templates not fully disclosed in the main text
- Type activation accuracy for Llama at 65–95% raises concerns about functional distinguishability in that model family
- Long-term personality evolution via reflection is demonstrated only within a fixed scenario sequence

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The weight-range constraints (A=0.30, B=0.06), the reflection trigger conditions, and the four-rule decision tree are fully specified and reproducible given a prompt template
- **Medium confidence**: The observed MBTI alignment (100%) and type activation accuracy (>90% for GPT/Qwen) depend on questionnaire scoring and scenario classification protocols not detailed in the paper
- **Low confidence**: Long-term personality evolution via reflection is demonstrated only within a fixed scenario sequence; the absence of open-ended conversational or task-based longitudinal tests leaves the mechanism's generality unverified

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt Template Extraction**: Reconstruct the exact JPAF induction prompt by reverse-engineering the visible fragments in Figures 21–24; validate that the template consistently produces the claimed dominant-auxiliary weight distribution across model families
2. **Scenario Question Set Completion**: Obtain or synthesize the full 120 scenario questions (15 per Jungian type) using the design principles in Table 10; run them through GPT and Llama to confirm TAA matches reported values and to diagnose whether Ti/Te/Ni/Ne confusion is systematic or scenario-specific
3. **Open-Ended Evolution Test**: Deploy a JPAF agent in a multi-turn task environment (e.g., role-playing dialogue or decision-making game) over 10+ episodes; log TemporaryWeight trajectories and verify that reflection triggers only when justified by repeated function activation, not spurious fluctuations
