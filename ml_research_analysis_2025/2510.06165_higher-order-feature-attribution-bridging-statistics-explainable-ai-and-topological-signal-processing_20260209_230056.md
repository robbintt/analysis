# Higher-Order Feature Attribution: Bridging Statistics, Explainable AI, and Topological Signal Processing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.06165
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06165
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Introduces higher-order feature attribution via IG operator composition, capturing feature interactions with connections to statistics and topological signal processing

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for computing higher-order feature attributions by composing Integrated Gradients (IG) operators. The approach extends traditional first-order attributions to capture feature interactions, representing them naturally as graph signals or simplicial complex structures. The framework establishes theoretical connections between explainability methods and topological signal processing, while generalizing Integrated Hessians. Experiments demonstrate the method's ability to recover ground-truth interaction structures in synthetic data and reveal joint feature contributions in real estate valuation data.

## Method Summary
The method computes higher-order feature attributions by composing Integrated Gradients operators. For a model f, the first-order attribution is the standard IG integral over the path from baseline x̃ to input x. Higher-order attributions are obtained through operator composition: the second-order attribution between features i and j is AᵢAⱼf(x), where Aᵢ represents the IG operator for feature i. This composition naturally captures feature interactions beyond pairwise effects. The framework represents these attributions as graph signals or simplicial complexes, enabling topological analysis of feature interactions.

## Key Results
- Successfully recovers ground-truth interaction structures in synthetic data with known feature interactions
- Demonstrates marginalization property: summing second-order attributions over one feature recovers first-order attributions
- Reveals joint feature contributions in real estate valuation data, showing how multiple features interact in model predictions
- Provides a principled algebraic foundation that generalizes Integrated Hessians to arbitrary orders

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by exploiting the compositional structure of Integrated Gradients operators. Since IG computes path integrals of gradients, composing these operators corresponds to nested integrals that capture how features interact along paths. This algebraic structure naturally extends to higher dimensions, where feature interactions form simplicial complexes that can be analyzed using topological methods.

## Foundational Learning

**Integrated Gradients (IG)** - Path integral method for feature attribution that satisfies completeness axiom; needed as the base operator for composition; quick check: verify IG recovers input for linear models.

**Simplicial Complexes** - Mathematical structures representing multi-way interactions; needed to naturally encode higher-order feature interactions; quick check: verify edge and triangle counts match expected interactions.

**Operator Composition** - Mathematical framework for combining attribution operators; needed to build higher-order attributions from first-order ones; quick check: verify second-order equals double integral of gradients.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Data Generation -> Model Fitting -> IG Computation -> Operator Composition -> Attribution Representation

**Critical path:** The sequence from computing first-order IG attributions through operator composition to higher-order attributions represents the essential computational pipeline.

**Design tradeoffs:** Second-order attributions can be computed via either Hessian-based formulas (requiring second derivatives) or direct operator composition (requiring nested integrals); composition is more general but potentially more computationally intensive.

**Failure signatures:** Marginalization property violations indicate numerical integration errors; inconsistent results between Hessian and composition methods suggest implementation bugs in gradient computations.

**First experiments:**
1. Verify first-order IG attributions on linear model (should equal coefficients)
2. Test marginalization property numerically on synthetic data
3. Compare second-order attributions from Hessian vs. composition methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can operator theories analogous to the IG-based framework be developed for other feature attribution methods such as Shapley values or LIME? The analysis is limited to IG attribution operators, but operator theories for other feature attribution definitions are topics left for future work.

**Open Question 2:** What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of different topological representations (simplicial complexes with multiplicity encodings vs. aggregated edge representations) for visualizing third-order and higher attributions? Exploring the advantages or disadvantages of each representation is left as a topic for future work.

**Open Question 3:** How does the computational cost of higher-order attribution scale with feature dimensionality and model complexity, and can efficient approximations be developed? The experiments use only 6–8 features; no analysis of scalability to high-dimensional settings is provided.

**Open Question 4:** How sensitive are higher-order attributions to the choice of baseline reference point, and does this sensitivity compound at higher orders? IG-based methods are baseline-dependent, yet the paper does not examine how baseline choice affects second- and third-order attributions.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity grows combinatorially with feature dimensionality, limiting scalability
- Implementation details for second-order attribution computation are underspecified
- Real estate dataset characteristics and preprocessing are not fully documented

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The theoretical framework connecting IG composition to higher-order attributions, and the marginalization property (Eq. 8)

**Medium confidence:** The synthetic experiment methodology and expected outcomes, given clear ground truth

**Low confidence:** The real estate experiment interpretation and the specific topological signal processing applications

## Next Checks

1. Implement both Hessian and composition methods for second-order attributions and verify numerical equivalence on the synthetic dataset
2. Test attribution robustness to different baselines (zero vs. mean vs. uniform) and quantify baseline sensitivity
3. Apply the framework to a simple neural network with known feature interactions and verify recovered attributions match analytical expectations
