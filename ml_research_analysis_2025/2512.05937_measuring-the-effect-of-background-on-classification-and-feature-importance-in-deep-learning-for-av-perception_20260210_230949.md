# Measuring the Effect of Background on Classification and Feature Importance in Deep Learning for AV Perception

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05937
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05937
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Background attention can be beneficial rather than problematic, challenging assumptions about healthy classifiers

## Executive Summary
This study systematically investigates how background features influence deep neural network performance and feature importance attribution in traffic sign recognition. Using six synthetic datasets varying background correlation and camera variation levels, the authors demonstrate that correlated training data leads to higher background feature importance and, counterintuitively, improved classification accuracy when tested on correlated data. Convolutional architectures show greater background dependence than ResNet50, and shape-based analysis reveals rectangular signs receive the highest background attention. The work challenges the assumption that low background attention indicates healthy classifiers, showing instead that background attention can be beneficial and context-dependent.

## Method Summary
The study uses six synthetic datasets (41,000 train + 49,200 test each) varying background correlation (correlated/uncorrelated) and camera variation (frontal/medium/high). Three architectures (ConvNeXt-Small, ConvNeXt-Tiny, ResNet50) are trained using MMPreTrain with learning rate 10^-3 for 100 epochs. Feature attributions are computed using Kernel SHAP (7×7 resolution via 32×32 superpixels) and GradCAM. Pixel ratio, the core metric, measures background vs. foreground attention by comparing positive attribution within traffic sign masks to total positive attribution. Statistical comparison uses 95% confidence intervals across 54 pairs for performance analysis.

## Key Results
- Correlated training data leads to higher background feature importance (pixel ratio difference: 0.0049-0.0257) compared to uncorrelated training
- Convolutional architectures (ConvNeXt) show greater background dependence than ResNet50
- Shape-based analysis reveals rectangular signs receive highest background attention, triangular signs receive least
- Counterintuitively, correlated training data improves classification accuracy (99.80-99.89%) when tested on correlated data
- Background attention can be beneficial rather than problematic, challenging assumptions about healthy classifiers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** DNNs trained on datasets with correlated background-to-class relationships assign measurably higher importance to background features compared to those trained on uncorrelated data.
- **Mechanism:** When background context systematically co-occurs with specific traffic sign classes, the network learns background features as valid classification signals rather than noise, exploiting genuine statistical structure.
- **Core assumption:** The background correlation represents legitimate domain structure that persists into deployment.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "correlated training data leads to higher background feature importance...background attention ranging from 0.0049 to 0.0257 higher for correlated datasets"; [Section V-B] Pixel ratios for uncorrelated training were consistently higher across architectures; 95% CI ±0.0035 confirms significance.
- **Break condition:** When test-time background distributions diverge from training correlations, accuracy degrades—worst results in 16/18 cases occurred under this condition.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Classification tasks requiring shape discrimination increase background attention because networks must actively distinguish foreground boundaries from background.
- **Mechanism:** When multiple sign shapes share the same classification task, the network learns to detect object boundaries as a preliminary step, necessarily involving processing the transition between foreground and background regions.
- **Core assumption:** Shape serves as a discriminative feature in the classification task.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section V-B, Table VI] Networks trained exclusively on single-shape subsets showed notably increased pixel ratios (+0.0304 to +0.0740) compared to mixed-shape training; [Section III] "identifying the traffic sign shape...can be advantageous as it is a discriminative feature."
- **Break condition:** When shape is not task-relevant, boundary-based attention provides no discriminative value.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Modern convolutional architectures (ConvNeXt) exploit background correlations more effectively than older architectures (ResNet50), achieving higher accuracy on correlated test data despite higher background attention.
- **Mechanism:** Architectures with more trainable parameters can learn more complex feature representations that integrate both foreground and contextual background features.
- **Core assumption:** Higher parameter count enables more sophisticated feature integration rather than mere overfitting.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section V-B] "with a rising number of trainable parameters, the average pixel ratio decreases, so the background attention rises"; [Section V-B] ResNet50 showed minimal pixel ratio differences between correlated/uncorrelated training.
- **Break condition:** When background features provide no predictive value, higher-capacity architectures may still attend to background without performance benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Feature attribution via saliency methods (Kernel SHAP, GradCAM)
  - **Why needed here:** The entire methodology depends on correctly computing and interpreting what spatial regions contribute to classification.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why Kernel SHAP uses superpixels (32×32 groupings) and how this affects the spatial precision of the resulting attribution map?

- **Concept:** Pixel ratio as a metric for background vs. foreground attention
  - **Why needed here:** This is the paper's core quantitative measure. Pixel ratio = (sum of positive attributions within object mask) / (sum of all positive attributions).
  - **Quick check question:** Given a pixel ratio of 0.65, what proportion of the model's positive attribution is assigned to background pixels?

- **Concept:** Controlled synthetic data for causal inference in ML
  - **Why needed here:** The study's strength comes from generating datasets that differ only in specific dimensions (correlation, camera variation), enabling isolation of causal factors impossible with real-world data.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is maintaining i.i.d. conditions between train and test splits essential for isolating the effect of background correlation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** OCTAS® rendering pipeline + GAN-based texture synthesis → 6 datasets (2 correlation levels × 3 camera variation levels) → OpenMMLab MMPreTrain → ConvNeXt-Small, ConvNeXt-Tiny, ResNet50 → Captum library → Kernel SHAP (7×7 resolution via 32×32 superpixels), GradCAM → Pixel ratio computation using binary masks → Statistical comparison with 95% CI

- **Critical path:** 1) Generate dataset variants with controlled correlation/camera parameters 2) Train 9 network instances per architecture (6 full datasets + 3 shape-specific subsets) 3) Compute feature attributions on 1/3CF test subset (200 images/class × 82 classes) 4) Calculate pixel ratios using ground truth masks 5) Compare means with permutation testing (n=54 pairs for performance analysis)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - KS resolution vs. computation: 7×7 superpixel resolution balances interpretability with ~1000 samples per image computational cost
  - Correlated test set selection: Authors chose correlated frontal test set for evaluation because "real world is assumed to be correlated"
  - Architecture selection: ConvNeXt vs. ResNet50 enables architectural comparison but limits generalizability

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Training on correlated data + testing on uncorrelated → worst accuracy in 16/18 cases
  - High camera variation (H) → all architectures perform worse (99.15-99.37%) regardless of correlation
  - Very low pixel ratios (<0.5) on GradCAM for ConvNeXt-Small on correlated frontal training → potential over-reliance on background

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce baseline pixel ratio comparison:** Train ConvNeXt-Small on UF and CF datasets, compute Kernel SHAP pixel ratios on CF test. Verify ~0.025 difference reproduces within CI bounds.
  2. **Cross-domain generalization test:** Train on CF, test on UF (and reverse). Measure accuracy delta. Expect ~0.02-0.08% degradation when training on correlated and testing on uncorrelated.
  3. **Shape-specific training validation:** Train ConvNeXt-Small on CMC (circular only), CMT (triangular only), CMR (rectangular only) subsets. Verify pixel ratio increases of +0.03 to +0.07 on corresponding test sets compared to full CM training.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the inclusion of environmental corner cases (e.g., adverse weather, occlusions) alter the relationship between background correlation and classification accuracy?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states that future work must include more corner cases (rain, snow, fog) in the data to increase dataset difficulty and potentially highlight performance differences.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study utilized synthetic datasets that controlled for variation but did not include these extreme "corner case" environmental factors.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Replicating the experimental pipeline using test datasets enriched with severe weather and occlusion data.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Do the observed effects of background correlation on feature importance and classification performance generalize to other use cases, architectures, and saliency methods?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state that "to widen the view, it would certainly be necessary to investigate more use cases, a greater variety of DNN architectures, and a larger selection of saliency methods."
- **Why unresolved:** This study focused exclusively on traffic sign recognition and was limited to ConvNeXt and ResNet architectures alongside Kernel SHAP and GradCAM.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying the same systematic synthetic data methodology to unrelated computer vision tasks or utilizing different XAI techniques.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Why does the degree of camera variation fail to produce a clear trend in background feature importance, contrary to the initial hypothesis?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section V-B states that "in contrast to our assumptions, no clear tendency can be identified concerning the different stages of camera variation."
- **Why unresolved:** The authors hypothesized that higher camera variation would encourage DNNs to focus on border areas for optical distortion, but the empirical results did not support this consistently.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A detailed ablation study analyzing the spatial distribution of feature attribution specifically around sign borders relative to camera pose angles.

## Limitations

- Controlled synthetic environment may limit generalizability to real-world scenarios where background correlations are more complex and interdependent
- Evaluation on correlated test data biases findings toward finding benefits of correlation, potentially understating scenarios where low background attention is preferable
- Architecture comparisons rely on only two families (ConvNeXt and ResNet50), limiting broader claims about modern convolutional networks

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The finding that correlated training data increases background feature importance compared to uncorrelated training (pixel ratio difference: 0.0049-0.0257). This is directly measured with statistical validation (95% CI ±0.0035) across multiple architectures and conditions.

**Medium confidence:** The claim that higher parameter count enables more sophisticated background feature integration. While pixel ratios support this, the mechanism assumes these correlations are genuinely useful rather than overfitting to dataset artifacts.

**Low confidence:** The interpretation that background attention can be beneficial rather than problematic. This conclusion depends on evaluating only correlated test data and assumes real-world conditions mirror the correlated dataset structure.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization:** Train on the correlated dataset and test on real-world traffic sign datasets (GTSRB, LISA). Measure accuracy and pixel ratios to verify whether benefits persist outside the synthetic environment.

2. **Domain shift robustness:** Systematically vary test-time background distributions (e.g., train on correlated data, test on uncorrelated) and measure accuracy degradation. Quantify the cost of background reliance under distribution shift.

3. **Real-world correlation analysis:** Apply the methodology to real traffic sign datasets where background-class correlations exist naturally. Compare pixel ratios and accuracy to synthetic results to validate whether synthetic findings generalize.
