- Primary result: 27% improvement in Brier score and halved calibration error using outcome-based supervision

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Foresight Learning, a method that trains language models using outcomes of real-world events as supervision rather than human-annotated labels. The key insight is that time provides free supervision: future events resolve into verifiable outcomes that can be used to train models. The method works by having models make probabilistic forecasts based on information available at prediction time, then using proper scoring rules (like log-score) as rewards once events resolve. This is implemented as a reinforcement learning problem where the model samples reasoning trajectories and receives rewards only after external outcome verification.

Experiments show that a Qwen3-32B model trained with Foresight Learning achieves 27% improvement in Brier score and halves calibration error compared to its pretrained baseline. Remarkably, this smaller model outperforms a 7x larger Qwen3-235B model on both synthetic future-event prediction tasks and the Metaculus benchmark, demonstrating that outcome-based supervision can be more effective than model scale alone for forecasting tasks.

## Method Summary
Foresight Learning fine-tunes a language model (Qwen3-32B) to make probabilistic forecasts by sampling reasoning trajectories and receiving rewards based on proper scoring rules (log-score) after real-world outcomes resolve. The model operates under strict temporal masking, using only information available at prediction time, while a frozen resolver model determines outcomes after resolution time. Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reduces variance by comparing trajectories within groups generated under identical information. The method uses 5,120 training examples from a news corpus (July 2024–Jan 2025), with outcomes resolved by Gemini-2.5-Flash. Training involves sampling K=4 trajectories per event, computing log-score rewards, and updating via GRPO.

## Key Results
- 27% improvement in Brier score and halved calibration error (ECE drops from 0.2175 to 0.1042) on Metaculus benchmark
- Qwen3-32B (Foresight Learning) outperforms Qwen3-235B (7x larger) on synthetic future-event prediction tasks
- Demonstrated scalability to real-world outcomes without human annotation
- Effective transfer from outcome-based supervision to forecasting tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Causal Information Asymmetry
The temporal gap between prediction and resolution creates verifiable supervision without human annotation. At prediction time t, the model receives only causally masked information (pre-t sources). A separate frozen resolver model, which has access to post-t information, determines outcomes after resolution time s > t. This separation enforces genuine prediction rather than retrieval from parametric memory. All training events resolve strictly after the base model's knowledge cutoff, ensuring that realized outcomes cannot be encoded in the model's parametric memory.

### Mechanism 2: Proper Scoring Rules as Sparse Terminal Rewards
Log-score rewards applied only at outcome resolution incentivize calibrated probabilistic predictions. The reward function R = y·log(p) + (1-y)·log(1-p) is strictly proper, meaning the expected reward is maximized when the model's reported probability matches its true belief. Overconfident wrong predictions incur large penalties; appropriately uncertain predictions are penalized less. The model learns to report honest probabilities rather than gaming the scoring rule through systematic miscalibration.

### Mechanism 3: Group-Relative Policy Optimization for Variance Reduction
Comparing trajectories within groups generated under identical information reduces variance from outcome noise. For each event, the policy samples K trajectories. The advantage is computed as Reward(τᵢ) - mean(Reward within group). This group-relative comparison cancels outcome-independent noise, stabilizing credit assignment despite sparse terminal-only feedback. High-quality and low-quality reasoning trajectories exist within the same group, enabling meaningful relative comparison.

## Foundational Learning

**Proper Scoring Rules (Brier score, Log score)**
- Why needed here: The entire training signal derives from proper scoring rules. Without understanding why log-score incentivizes honest calibration, you cannot debug reward hacking or interpret metric improvements.
- Quick check question: If a model predicts p=0.8 and the outcome is y=1, does increasing p toward 1 always increase expected log-score? What if p=0.99 and y=1?

**Policy Gradient with Baselines (advantage estimation)**
- Why needed here: GRPO is a variance-reduced policy gradient method. Understanding why subtracting a baseline reduces variance without biasing gradients is essential for debugging training instability.
- Quick check question: Why does subtracting the group mean reward preserve unbiased gradient estimates while reducing variance?

**Temporal/Causal Masking in ML Pipelines**
- Why needed here: Information leakage is the primary failure mode. You must understand how to construct datasets where the model genuinely cannot access post-prediction information.
- Quick check question: If your training data includes articles timestamped at 11:59 PM on the prediction date, but those articles describe events that occurred earlier that day, is this still causally valid?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
News Corpus -> Temporal Mask -> Predictor LLM (trainable) -> Outcome Resolution -> Reward Calculator -> Policy Update

**Critical path:**
1. Dataset construction is the highest-risk step—temporal leakage anywhere in the pipeline invalidates all downstream learning.
2. Resolver reliability matters more than predictor architecture; systematic resolution errors introduce biased rewards.
3. Group size K=4 balances variance reduction against compute; too small increases noise, too large dilutes signal.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Offline vs. online training: Current implementation is offline (pre-resolved events). Online would enable continuous learning but requires waiting for real outcomes.
- Resolver model choice: Larger/frozen resolver reduces noise but may introduce systematic biases if the resolver makes consistent errors.
- Binary vs. continuous outcomes: Binary simplifies resolution; extending to continuous or free-text outcomes requires more complex resolver logic.

**Failure signatures:**
- Information leakage: Model performance suspiciously high on events with short horizons or early-cutoff sources.
- Resolution bias: Model learns resolver artifacts rather than genuine forecasting.
- Reward collapse: All predictions converge to ~0.5, indicating the model learned to minimize penalty rather than discriminate.
- Trajectory homogeneity: Near-zero gradient norms despite non-zero rewards suggest insufficient reasoning diversity.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Temporal integrity audit: Train on events with artificially shuffled timestamps. If the model still learns, your temporal masking has leakage.
2. Group size ablation: Compare K∈{2,4,8,16} on a held-out validation set. Plot gradient variance and final Brier score to identify the variance-compute frontier.
3. Resolver swap test: Replace Gemini-2.5-Flash with a different resolver (e.g., Claude, GPT-4) on the same training data. Divergent learned behaviors indicate resolver-specific overfitting rather than general forecasting skill.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: Can Foresight Learning be extended to continuous, multi-class, and free-text outcome spaces while maintaining stable credit assignment?
- Basis in paper: The paper states "the current experiments focus on binary outcomes. Extending the framework to richer outcome spaces... remains an important direction for future work."
- Why unresolved: Proper scoring rules and outcome verification mechanisms may not generalize straightforwardly to unbounded or structured outcome spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful training runs on datasets with continuous targets or free-text outcomes, with comparable calibration and accuracy gains.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: How does Foresight Learning perform in fully online deployment with real-time outcome feedback rather than offline training on pre-resolved events?
- Basis in paper: "Deployment-time feedback loops are under active exploration, but they are not evaluated in this study" and "fully online settings remains an important direction."
- Why unresolved: Online learning introduces distribution shift, non-stationarity, and delayed feedback that may destabilize policy gradient methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing sustained or improved performance when models continuously learn from newly resolved events in production.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: Do biases or coverage gaps in automated event generation and resolution pipelines systematically distort the learned prediction policy?
- Basis in paper: "Event specification and outcome resolution rely on automated pipelines that may introduce biases or coverage gaps."
- Why unresolved: The resolver model and question generation process may favor certain event types or exhibit systematic resolution errors that the predictor learns to exploit.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing automated vs. human-curated event sets, or analysis of error patterns across event categories.

**Open Question 4**
- Question: Does improved calibration on forecasting benchmarks transfer to downstream decision-making tasks that consume probabilistic predictions?
- Basis in paper: The paper claims outcome-based supervision "points toward a broader role... toward open-ended, real-world decision-making," but only evaluates on forecasting metrics.
- Why unresolved: Better Brier scores and ECE do not guarantee improved utility when predictions are used as inputs to sequential decision systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating trained models in decision-theoretic settings (e.g., portfolio allocation, clinical triage) where predictions inform actions with measurable outcomes.

## Limitations
- Temporal masking verification is critical and difficult to audit; any leakage invalidates the learning signal
- Binary outcome restriction limits applicability to continuous or multi-class forecasting tasks
- Resolver model reliability and potential systematic biases are not thoroughly validated across different event types

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The 27% Brier score improvement over Qwen3-32B and the halving of calibration error are directly measurable from reported metrics
- Medium Confidence: The claim that outcome-based supervision is "more effective than model scale alone" requires additional context about comparable task evaluations
- Low Confidence: The scalability claim to arbitrary real-world outcomes depends heavily on the availability of a reliable outcome resolver, which the paper doesn't thoroughly validate

## Next Checks
1. **Temporal Integrity Audit:** Randomly sample 50 training examples and manually verify that no post-prediction information appears in the causally-masked context. Check timestamp consistency between news articles and prediction times.
2. **Resolver Consistency Test:** Train two separate models using different outcome resolvers (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Flash vs. Claude) on identical training data. Compare learned behaviors—divergent models suggest resolver-specific overfitting rather than general forecasting skill.
3. **Group Size Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary K∈{2,4,8,16} on a held-out validation set. Plot gradient variance, reward variance, and final Brier scores to identify the optimal trade-off between variance reduction and computational efficiency.
