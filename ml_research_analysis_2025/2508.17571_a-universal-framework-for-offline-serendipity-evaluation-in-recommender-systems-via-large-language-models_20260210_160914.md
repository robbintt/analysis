# A Universal Framework for Offline Serendipity Evaluation in Recommender Systems via Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.17571
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17571
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Universal offline evaluation framework for serendipitous recommender systems using LLMs, showing no consistent superiority of serendipity-oriented systems over accuracy-oriented ones

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating serendipity in recommender systems using large language models as offline evaluators. The approach assigns five-level serendipity scores to recommended items based solely on textual information about users and items, eliminating the need for predefined thresholds or specific datasets. The framework was tested across four prompt strategies and six recommender systems on three real-world datasets, revealing that even general recommender systems can achieve high serendipitous performance and that serendipity-oriented systems don't consistently outperform others across different domains.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework employs LLM-as-a-Judge to evaluate serendipity in recommender systems through a five-level scoring system (1-5, where 5 indicates the highest serendipity). The method requires only textual descriptions of users and items without predefined thresholds or domain-specific datasets. Four prompt strategies were evaluated, with the chain-of-thought prompt achieving the highest accuracy (46.98% using GPT-4o-mini) in predicting serendipity scores. The framework was applied to six different recommender systems across three real-world datasets to assess serendipitous performance, providing a universal approach for offline serendipity evaluation that can be applied across different domains and recommendation scenarios.

## Key Results
- Chain-of-thought prompt strategy achieved highest accuracy (46.98% using GPT-4o-mini) for five-level serendipity classification
- No serendipity-oriented recommender system consistently outperformed others across the three datasets
- General recommender systems like BPRMF sometimes achieved higher serendipitous performance than serendipity-oriented systems
- The framework demonstrated universal applicability across different recommendation domains using only textual information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages LLMs' ability to understand and reason about user-item relationships through textual information, enabling them to assess serendipity without requiring interaction data or predefined criteria. By using chain-of-thought prompting, the LLM can decompose the serendipity evaluation task into logical steps, improving its ability to identify recommendations that are both novel and relevant to users. The five-level scoring system provides granularity that captures the nuanced nature of serendipitous discovery, while the universal approach allows for cross-domain application without retraining or domain-specific tuning.

## Foundational Learning

**Serendipity in Recommender Systems**
- Why needed: Understanding how unexpected yet relevant recommendations can enhance user experience beyond simple accuracy metrics
- Quick check: Compare serendipity scores with traditional accuracy metrics to validate complementary nature

**LLM-as-a-Judge methodology**
- Why needed: Enables scalable, consistent evaluation without human annotators or predefined thresholds
- Quick check: Validate LLM scores against human judgments on a sample dataset

**Chain-of-thought prompting**
- Why needed: Improves LLM reasoning by decomposing complex evaluation tasks into sequential logical steps
- Quick check: Compare accuracy improvements against standard prompting approaches

**Five-level serendipity scoring**
- Why needed: Captures nuanced gradations of serendipitous discovery beyond binary classification
- Quick check: Ensure score distribution reflects meaningful differences in recommendation quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Textual user profiles -> LLM evaluator -> Five-level serendipity scores -> System comparison

**Critical Path**: User textual data + Item textual data → Chain-of-thought prompt → LLM evaluation → Serendipity score assignment

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses only textual information (simpler, more universal) vs. multimodal data (potentially more accurate but less generalizable)

**Failure Signatures**: Low accuracy rates across prompts indicate limitations in LLM's ability to capture serendipity; inconsistent performance across domains suggests framework sensitivity to domain characteristics

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test all four prompt strategies (standard, chain-of-thought, few-shot, zero-shot) on a small dataset to identify optimal approach
2. Compare LLM-assigned serendipity scores with human judgments on a validation set
3. Evaluate framework performance across domains with varying degrees of user-item interaction complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Reliance on LLM-based judgments rather than human assessments may introduce systematic biases in serendipity interpretation
- 46.98% accuracy represents only marginal improvement over random guessing for five-level classification
- Framework focuses exclusively on textual information, potentially missing valuable signals from interaction patterns or contextual factors
- Finding that serendipity-oriented systems don't consistently outperform accuracy-oriented ones requires broader validation across more diverse datasets

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The framework's methodology and implementation details are clearly described and reproducible
**Medium confidence**: The comparative analysis across different recommender systems and datasets provides meaningful insights, though generalizability remains uncertain
**Low confidence**: The claim that serendipity-oriented systems don't consistently outperform others needs broader validation across more domains and evaluation metrics

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate the alignment between LLM-assigned serendipity scores and human perceptions of serendipitous recommendations
2. Test the framework across additional domains beyond the three datasets used, particularly in domains with different interaction patterns and user expectations
3. Compare the offline LLM-based evaluation framework against online A/B testing results to assess predictive validity for real-world performance
