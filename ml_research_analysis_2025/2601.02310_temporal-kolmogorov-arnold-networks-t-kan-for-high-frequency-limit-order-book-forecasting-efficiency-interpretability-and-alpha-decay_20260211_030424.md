# Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (T-KAN) for High-Frequency Limit Order Book Forecasting: Efficiency, Interpretability, and Alpha Decay

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.02310
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02310
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: T-KAN achieves 19.1% relative F1 improvement (0.3995 vs 0.3354) over DeepLOB baseline on FI-2010 dataset at 100-tick horizon

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces T-KAN, a hybrid LSTM-KAN architecture that replaces standard LSTM linear gates with learnable B-spline activation functions for high-frequency limit order book forecasting. The model demonstrates significant improvements in classification performance and economic returns while providing interpretable learned activation functions that filter market microstructure noise. T-KAN is optimized for FPGA implementation targeting ultra-low latency deployment in high-frequency trading environments.

## Method Summary
T-KAN combines LSTM's sequential modeling with KAN's non-linear functional approximation by replacing LSTM gate linear transformations with learnable B-spline based activations. The architecture uses a 2-layer LSTM encoder (64 hidden units) followed by a KAN classification head, trained on 144-dimensional Z-score normalized LOB features from 10-tick lookback windows. The model employs weighted multi-class cross-entropy loss with inverse frequency weights and L1 sparsity regularization to encourage smooth spline activations.

## Key Results
- 19.1% relative F1-score improvement (0.3995 vs 0.3354) over DeepLOB baseline at 100-tick forecast horizon
- Transaction-cost adjusted backtest (1.0 bps): T-KAN yields 132.48% returns vs -82.76% for DeepLOB
- Learned B-spline activations show interpretable "dead zones" that filter microstructural noise while amplifying high-conviction signals
- Superior robustness to alpha decay over longer horizons compared to CNN-LSTM baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Learnable B-spline activations capture non-linear market microstructure dynamics more effectively than fixed linear transformations
- Mechanism: Standard LSTM gates use static weight matrices with fixed activation functions. T-KAN replaces these with learnable univariate spline functions parameterized via B-splines, enabling the model to learn the "shape" of market signals rather than just their magnitude. The B-spline basis functions allow localized adjustments to the activation curve without global parameter changes.
- Core assumption: LOB price dynamics contain localized non-linearities that fixed point-wise activations cannot efficiently approximate
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states model learns "shape of market signals"; section 2.2 equations define B-spline basis; limited direct corpus validation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Learned S-curve activations create interpretable "dead zones" that filter microstructural noise while amplifying high-conviction signals
- Mechanism: During training, B-spline parameters converge toward sigmoidal shapes with flattened regions near zero. Inputs within this "dead zone" receive near-constant low output, while inputs exceeding threshold receive non-linearly amplified output, acting as learned noise filter specific to z-score normalized LOB features.
- Core assumption: Neutral price movement class correlates with small-magnitude feature values representing noise rather than signal
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "dead-zones" visible in splines; section 4.2 describes filtering mechanism; corpus supports need for noise filtering in LOB data

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hybrid LSTM-KAN architecture addresses "temporal gap" in vanilla KANs while maintaining spline-based expressivity
- Mechanism: T-KAN uses KAN layers to redefine LSTM gates, preserving cell state/hidden state recurrence while replacing linear transformations with spline-based ones. The final hidden state is processed by KAN-optimized classification head, capturing both order flow momentum and complex non-linear manifolds.
- Core assumption: Sequential dependencies in LOB data require explicit memory states; pure functional approximation without recurrence is insufficient
- Evidence anchors: Section 2.3 explains vanilla KANs underperform without memory states; section 5.2 shows predictive information persistence; corpus references TKAN framework as prior art

## Foundational Learning

- **B-spline basis functions and Cox-de Boor recursion**: Why needed: Entire KAN mechanism rests on parameterizing learnable functions as B-splines. Quick check: Given knot vector {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}, can you sketch the support region of a single B-spline basis function of order 2?
- **LSTM gating mechanics (forget, input, output gates)**: Why needed: T-KAN modifies each gate's internal transformation. Must understand what each gate controls to interpret learned spline shapes. Quick check: If forget gate output is near-zero for all timesteps, what happens to cell state over long sequence?
- **Limit Order Book microstructure**: Why needed: 144-dimensional input represents prices and volumes across multiple LOB levels. Domain knowledge required for feature engineering, interpreting class imbalance, and understanding z-score normalization. Quick check: In rising market, would bid-side volume at level -1 increase or decrease, and why does this matter for mid-price prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input normalization → sliding window construction → LSTM encoding → KAN head spline evaluation → class logits → weighted loss
- **Critical path**: Input normalization → sliding window construction → LSTM encoding → KAN head spline evaluation → class logits → weighted loss
- **Design tradeoffs**: Parameter efficiency (104,451 vs DeepLOB's 58,211), justified by "profitability density" but increases training time; spline grid resolution vs smoothness with L1 penalty; T=10 lookback may miss longer-term dependencies
- **Failure signatures**: Splines converging to near-linear shapes (mechanism not activating); high recall on neutral class, low recall on up/down classes (class weights insufficient); training loss decreasing but validation F1 stagnant (overfitting); negative cumulative PnL despite reasonable F1 (prediction confidence insufficient)
- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Ablation on spline order: Train T-KAN with orders k=1, 2, 3; report F1 and visualize activation shapes
  2. Horizon sensitivity: Evaluate at k=10, 50, 100, 200 ticks; plot F1 decay curves
  3. Transaction cost break-even: Vary costs from 0.1 to 2.0 bps; identify threshold where returns cross zero

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **FPGA implementation latency**: Can T-KAN be mapped onto FPGA hardware to achieve sub-microsecond inference speeds for live HFT deployment? Current study validates predictive power but lacks empirical hardware latency metrics.
- **Modern dataset generalization**: Does T-KAN maintain performance on contemporary high-frequency datasets outside FI-2010? Results rely entirely on historical data that may not capture modern market microstructure dynamics.
- **Advanced architecture comparison**: How does T-KAN compare against Temporal Attention or Transformer-based models? Paper only compares against DeepLOB baseline, not establishing superiority over attention mechanisms.

## Limitations
- B-spline configuration (knot grid resolution, spline order) unspecified, preventing exact reproduction
- Parameter count discrepancy (532,675 vs 104,451) suggests potential confusion between total and trainable parameters
- Single-dataset evaluation (FI-2010) with one forecast horizon (k=100) limits generalizability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core architectural concept is technically sound; FI-2010 dataset is well-documented; weighted cross-entropy approach is standard practice.

**Medium Confidence**: F1-score improvement over DeepLOB is verifiable given dataset and metrics; transaction-cost backtest framework is plausible but requires assumptions.

**Low Confidence**: Interpretability claims about learned S-curve "dead zones" require visual inspection; alpha decay robustness needs multi-horizon validation; FPGA deployment claims lack architectural specifications.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on B-spline order**: Train T-KAN with orders k=1, 2, 3 on held-out validation fold; report F1-score differences and visualize learned activation shapes
2. **Multi-horizon performance decay**: Evaluate T-KAN vs DeepLOB at k=10, 50, 100, 200 ticks; plot F1-score decay curves to quantify alpha persistence
3. **Transaction cost break-even analysis**: Vary transaction costs from 0.1 to 2.0 bps; identify threshold where T-KAN cumulative returns cross zero to validate economic claims
