# Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition Leveraging Aligning Timestamps of ASR Transcripts and Speaker Diarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.19356
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19356
- Authors: Hsuan-Yu Wang; Pei-Ying Lee; Berlin Chen
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: Proper temporal alignment of ASR transcripts and speaker diarization improves SER accuracy from 56.82% to 66.81% and Macro F1-score from 47.10% to 66.48%

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of temporal misalignment between ASR transcripts and speaker diarization outputs in speech emotion recognition systems. The authors propose a timestamp alignment pipeline that synchronizes these modalities by reconstructing coherent speaker-attributed utterances, followed by a cross-attention fusion model that combines text and audio embeddings. Evaluations on IEMOCAP demonstrate substantial performance improvements, particularly for emotions requiring extended temporal context like sadness, where F1-score increases from 0.26 to 0.67.

## Method Summary
The method involves three main components: (1) an alignment pipeline that flattens word-level ASR outputs and regroups them into speaker turns based on consistency and pause thresholds (≤1.5s), (2) embedding extraction using wav2vec 2.0 for audio and RoBERTa for text, both fine-tuned during training, and (3) a cross-attention fusion architecture with a forget gate that dynamically filters cross-modal features before a Transformer-based fusion layer. The system processes raw audio through WhisperX for ASR and Pyannote 3.1 for speaker diarization, then aligns the outputs to create coherent turn-level segments for emotion classification.

## Key Results
- Temporal alignment improves overall accuracy from 56.82% to 66.81% and Macro F1-score from 47.10% to 66.48%
- Sadness F1-score shows dramatic improvement from 0.26 to 0.67, demonstrating alignment's importance for emotions with subtle, extended temporal patterns
- Fine-tuning embedding extractors provides an additional 10% accuracy gain over frozen embeddings
- Cross-attention fusion with gating outperforms simpler fusion methods across all evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Reconstructing fragmented ASR outputs into coherent speaker turns improves emotion classification, particularly for emotions requiring extended temporal context. The alignment pipeline flattens word-level ASR outputs into a chronological stream, then regroups words into turns based on speaker consistency and pause thresholds (≤1.5s). This preserves natural conversational boundaries and ensures each segment captures complete emotional expressions rather than acoustic fragments. Core assumption: Emotions like sadness exhibit acoustic patterns that unfold over longer utterances; fragmentation disrupts these patterns.

### Mechanism 2
Bidirectional cross-attention between text and audio embeddings enables each modality to selectively incorporate relevant features from the other. Text embeddings query audio (Key/Value) to produce audio-enriched text representations; audio embeddings query text for linguistically contextualized audio representations. This allows, for example, prosodic cues to disambiguate textual sarcasm. Core assumption: Emotional signals are distributed across modalities; neither text nor audio alone is sufficient for robust classification.

### Mechanism 3
The gating mechanism dynamically filters cross-modal attended features, suppressing noisy or irrelevant modality contributions. After cross-attention, original embeddings and attended representations pass through a forget gate that learns to weight their combination. This prevents degraded modality quality from corrupting the fused output. Core assumption: Not all cross-modal information is beneficial; selective filtering improves robustness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Speaker Diarization and ASR Integration**
  - Why needed here: The alignment pipeline requires understanding how ASR produces word-level timestamps and how diarization segments speaker turns. Misunderstanding these outputs leads to incorrect alignment logic.
  - Quick check question: Given ASR output `["hello" 0.0-0.5s]` and diarization output `[Speaker A 0.0-0.8s]`, which speaker should "hello" be attributed to?

- **Concept: Cross-Attention Mechanics**
  - Why needed here: The fusion block relies on query-key-value attention between modalities. Understanding attention weights helps debug whether modalities are exchanging useful information.
  - Quick check question: If text-to-audio attention weights are uniformly distributed, what does this suggest about the relationship between modalities?

- **Concept: Frozen vs. Fine-tuned Embeddings**
  - Why needed here: Table IV shows a 10% accuracy gap between frozen (56.82%) and fine-tuned (66.81%) extractors. Understanding when to freeze is critical for resource-constrained deployments.
  - Quick check question: What are two tradeoffs of fine-tuning Wav2Vec and RoBERTa versus keeping them frozen?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw audio → [WhisperX (ASR) + Pyannote 3.1 (Diarization)] → Alignment pipeline (flatten → group by speaker/pause → construct turns) → Wav2Vec 2.0 (audio, 768-dim) + RoBERTa (text, 768-dim) → Mean pooling → Cross-attention fusion with forget gate → Transformer fusion layer → Linear classifier → Softmax → Emotion class

- **Critical path:** Alignment quality → Embedding extractor choice (frozen/fine-tuned) → Fusion effectiveness. The 10% accuracy gain from alignment (56.82%→66.81%) and additional gains from fine-tuning indicate both stages are performance-critical.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Pause threshold: Lower values increase turn count (more segments, less context per segment); higher values merge turns (fewer segments, more context but potential speaker mixing). Frozen embeddings: Faster training, lower compute, but 10% accuracy penalty per Table IV. End-to-end vs. modular alignment: Modular approach (this paper) allows swapping ASR/diarization models but may not optimize jointly.

- **Failure signatures:** Low sadness F1 (<0.4) suggests alignment is fragmenting utterances or pause threshold is too low. Large accuracy gap between frozen and fine-tuned embeddings (>5%) indicates domain mismatch between pretraining and target data. Uniform attention weights suggest modalities are not learning to inform each other.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on pause threshold:** Test 0.5s, 1.0s, 1.5s, 2.0s thresholds; monitor per-emotion F1, especially sadness. Expect inverted-U curve.
  2. **Frozen vs. fine-tuned comparison:** Replicate Table IV on your target dataset to quantify the fine-tuning benefit; if <3%, consider freezing for efficiency.
  3. **Single-modality baselines:** Run text-only (RoBERTa → classifier) and audio-only (Wav2Vec → classifier) to quantify each modality's contribution and verify cross-attention is adding value.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the alignment pipeline generalize effectively to multilingual and in-the-wild conversational datasets beyond IEMOCAP? Basis: Authors explicitly state future work will extend to multilingual and in-the-wild datasets to evaluate cross-domain generalization. Unresolved because current evaluation is restricted to IEMOCAP, a controlled English-language dataset. Evidence needed: Empirical results showing comparable performance gains when applied to diverse datasets like MELD, DAIC-WOZ, or multilingual corpora like CMU-MOSEI.

### Open Question 2
What is the relative contribution of the alignment pipeline versus the specific cross-attention fusion architecture to the observed accuracy improvements? Basis: Authors plan to systematically assess the robustness of the proposed alignment pipeline across diverse multimodal fusion models. Unresolved because current study evaluates alignment using only one fusion architecture. Evidence needed: Ablation studies applying alignment to alternative fusion strategies (e.g., early concatenation, tensor fusion) with consistent benchmarking.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does Voice Activity Detection (VAD) boundary accuracy limit the theoretical ceiling of the alignment pipeline's performance? Basis: Table III shows oracle VAD reduces TEER from 89.35% to 53.90%, indicating VAD is a major bottleneck. Unresolved because specific sources of VAD error and their differential impact on emotion-specific performance remain uncharacterized. Evidence needed: Error analysis categorizing VAD failure types and their correlation with per-emotion F1-score degradation.

## Limitations
- Performance gains rely heavily on dataset-specific choices like the 1.5s pause threshold, which may not generalize across domains
- Lack of ablation studies showing individual contribution of the gating mechanism versus alignment pipeline
- Evaluation limited to IEMOCAP with only four emotion categories, raising questions about robustness to different datasets and emotion taxonomies

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The core claim that temporal alignment between ASR and speaker diarization improves SER performance (66.81% vs 56.82% accuracy) is well-supported by experimental evidence
- **Medium confidence:** The assertion that cross-attention fusion with gating provides meaningful improvements over simpler fusion methods is supported, but lacks direct ablation comparison
- **Medium confidence:** The explanation that sadness F1 improvement results from preserving longer temporal context through alignment is plausible but lacks acoustic analysis verification

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on pause threshold sensitivity:** Systematically test 0.5s, 1.0s, 1.5s, and 2.0s pause thresholds on IEMOCAP, measuring per-emotion F1 scores to identify the optimal threshold and verify the inverted-U relationship between threshold value and sadness detection performance.

2. **Modality contribution isolation:** Train and evaluate text-only (RoBERTa → classifier) and audio-only (Wav2Vec → classifier) baselines on aligned data to quantify each modality's individual contribution, then compare against the full multimodal model to verify cross-attention is adding value beyond simple modality concatenation.

3. **Cross-dataset generalization test:** Apply the trained model to a different emotion recognition dataset (e.g., MSP-Improv or EmoReact) without retraining to assess whether alignment and fusion benefits transfer across domains, measuring degradation in accuracy and per-class F1 to identify which components are most sensitive to domain shift.
