# KG-EDAS: A Meta-Metric Framework for Evaluating Knowledge Graph Completion Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.15357
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15357
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Primary result**: KG-EDAS achieves strong correlation with traditional metrics (MRR, Hit@1) while resolving inconsistencies and providing a unified ranking for KGC models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models by proposing KG-EDAS, a unified meta-metric framework that synthesizes performance across multiple metrics and datasets into a single normalized score. The method computes positive and negative deviations from average performance, balancing model strengths and weaknesses, and enabling robust, interpretable rankings. KG-EDAS achieves linear time complexity, ensuring scalability for large-scale evaluations. Experimental results on datasets like FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate strong alignment with traditional metrics (MRR, Hit@1) while resolving inconsistencies. Ablation studies confirm the framework's stability and resilience, even when individual metrics are removed.

## Method Summary
KG-EDAS adapts the EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution) multi-criteria decision-making method to create a unified evaluation framework for KGC models. The approach constructs a decision matrix of model performances across metrics, computes average solutions per metric, and calculates positive and negative deviations from these averages. These deviations are weighted, normalized, and combined into a single score Mi = ½[N(WPDAi) + (1 − N(WNDAi))], where WPDA and WNDA represent weighted positive and negative deviations. The framework handles both beneficial metrics (higher is better) and non-beneficial metrics (lower is better) through appropriate distance calculations, producing rankings that balance model strengths and weaknesses while maintaining strong correlation with traditional evaluation metrics.

## Key Results
- KG-EDAS achieves Pearson correlation of 0.9332 with mean MRR and 0.8329 with mean Hit@1 across benchmark datasets
- RotatE achieves the highest unified score (M ≈ 0.998) while resolving inconsistencies found in traditional metric rankings
- Ablation studies show rank changes ≤2 positions when removing individual metrics, demonstrating framework robustness
- Linear O(nm) time complexity enables scalable evaluation across large model and metric sets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aggregating normalized deviations from average performance yields consistent cross-dataset rankings that traditional disjoint metrics cannot provide.
- Mechanism: KG-EDAS constructs a decision matrix X ∈ ℝⁿˣᵐ (n models × m metrics), computes average solution Avgⱼ for each metric, then calculates Positive Distance from Average (PDA) and Negative Distance from Average (NDA). These are weighted, normalized, and combined into a single score Mᵢ = ½[N(WPDAᵢ) + (1 − N(WNDAᵢ))].
- Core assumption: The arithmetic mean of model performance serves as a meaningful reference point for evaluation; equal weighting of metrics approximates task-agnostic importance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation."
  - [methodology, Eq. 4-13] Full computational pipeline from decision matrix construction to final ranking.
  - [corpus] Related work "How Sharp and Bias-Robust is a Model?" addresses complementary evaluation perspectives but does not propose unified meta-metrics—highlighting novelty of KG-EDAS.
- Break condition: If all models perform identically across all metrics (Avgⱼ = Xᵢⱼ ∀i,j), deviations collapse to zero and ranking becomes undefined.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dual-metric deviation handling (PDA/NDA) captures both model strengths and weaknesses, enabling balanced trade-off assessment.
- Mechanism: For beneficial metrics (MRR, Hit@k), PDA rewards scores above average; for non-beneficial metrics (MR), PDA rewards scores below average. NDA captures the inverse. The final Mᵢ score explicitly balances N(WPDAᵢ) as strength and (1 − N(WNDAᵢ)) as weakness-compensation.
- Core assumption: Positive and negative deviations from average are equally informative for model quality assessment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By balancing positive and negative deviations from average performance, EDAS provides interpretable global ranks that resolve inconsistencies and reflect clear performance trade-offs."
  - [results, Table 2] RotatE achieves M = 0.9977 with NWPDA = 0.9954 and NWNDA = 0.0000, while ANALOGY (M = 0.2576) has NWNDA = 0.6252—demonstrating how NDA penalizes inconsistent performance.
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus validation for this specific dual-deviation approach; related KGC papers focus on model architectures rather than evaluation methodology.
- Break condition: If a single metric dominates PDA/NDA calculations due to extreme scale differences, normalization may not fully compensate—though the paper uses Avgⱼ in denominators to address this.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Linear aggregation preserves strong alignment with established metrics while resolving their pairwise conflicts.
- Mechanism: Equal-weight linear combination of normalized deviations produces Mᵢ ∈ [0,1]. Correlation analysis validates that this aggregation maintains semantic alignment with constituent metrics (Pearson r = 0.93 with mean MRR, r = 0.83 with mean Hit@1).
- Core assumption: Linear combination of normalized metrics is sufficient to capture model quality; non-linear interactions between metrics are negligible.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [results, Table 4] "EDAS demonstrates a strong correlation with both Mean MRR and Mean Hit@1, with Pearson coefficient values at 0.9332 and 0.8329 respectively, both statistically significant at p < 0.01."
  - [ablation, Table 7] Removing individual metrics causes maximum rank changes of ≤2 positions, demonstrating robustness to metric ablation.
  - [corpus] No comparable meta-metric frameworks found in corpus neighbors; evaluation papers focus on sharpness/bias rather than aggregation.
- Break condition: If downstream tasks require fundamentally different metric importance weightings (e.g., recommendation systems prioritizing Hit@10), equal weights may produce suboptimal rankings for that task.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)
  - Why needed here: KG-EDAS is adapted from EDAS, an MCDM method from operational research. Understanding MCDM principles (alternatives, criteria, beneficial vs. non-beneficial, normalization) is prerequisite to grasping why this approach works.
  - Quick check question: Given metrics A (beneficial, range [0,1]) and B (non-beneficial, range [1,∞]), how would you normalize both for fair aggregation?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Completion Evaluation Metrics
  - Why needed here: The framework synthesizes MRR, MR, and Hit@k. Understanding what each captures (MRR: average reciprocal rank sensitive to top ranks; MR: mean rank penalizes all errors; Hit@k: thresholded accuracy) is necessary to interpret KG-EDAS outputs.
  - Quick check question: If Model X has MRR = 0.8 but Hit@1 = 0.3, what performance characteristic does this reveal? How would KG-EDAS handle this?

- Concept: Correlation and Ranking Consistency
  - Why needed here: Validation relies on Pearson and Kendall correlation between KG-EDAS scores and traditional metrics. Understanding these measures (Pearson: linear relationship; Kendall τ: rank correlation) is needed to interpret the framework's effectiveness claims.
  - Quick check question: If EDAS has Pearson r = 0.93 with MRR but models A and B swap ranks between MRR and EDAS, does this indicate a problem? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Matrix X → Average Computation → PDA/NDA Layer → Weighted Aggregation → Normalization → Score Computation Mᵢ → Ranked Output
- Critical path:
  1. Correctly classify each metric as beneficial (higher = better) or non-beneficial (lower = better)—inversion error here propagates through entire pipeline.
  2. Handle division-by-zero in PDA/NDA when Avgⱼ = 0 (paper mentions "small constant adjustments").
  3. Ensure weight vector sums to 1 before weighted aggregation.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Equal weights vs. task-specific weights: Paper uses equal weights for generality; downstream tasks may require customization.
  - Mean vs. median as reference: EDAS uses mean (sensitive to outliers) for computational simplicity; median would be more robust but increases complexity.
  - Linear O(nm) complexity vs. more sophisticated aggregation: Sacrifices potential non-linear metric interactions for scalability and interpretability.
- Failure signatures:
  - All models receive identical Mᵢ ≈ 0.5: Indicates either identical input performances or normalization failure (max(WPDA) or max(WNDA) = 0).
  - Rankings contradict all traditional metrics: Check metric classification (beneficial vs. non-beneficial) and weight assignments.
  - Mᵢ values cluster near 0 or 1 exclusively: May indicate extreme performance gaps or normalization issue.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce Table 2 results: Run KG-EDAS on the 10 models with 5-dataset aggregated metrics (MR, MRR, Hit@1, Hit@10). Verify RotatE achieves M ≈ 0.998 and rank order matches paper.
  2. Ablation validation: Sequentially remove MRR, MR, and Hit@1 per Table 7; confirm max rank change ≤2 positions and cross-reference with paper's specific swap cases (e.g., TuckER/ConvR swap when MR removed).
  3. Correlation sanity check: Compute Pearson correlation between your computed Mᵢ values and mean MRR across the 5 datasets; target r > 0.90 per Table 4.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Equal-weight assumption may not generalize to all downstream tasks requiring specific metric prioritization
- Framework behavior with extreme performance distributions or all-identical model performances remains unexplored
- Division-by-zero handling uses unspecified "small constant adjustments" that could affect results

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The computational framework implementation and its O(nm) complexity; the correlation results with established metrics (Pearson r > 0.93 with MRR); the ablation study methodology and findings.
- **Medium confidence**: The equal-weight assumption's applicability across all KGC tasks; the framework's behavior with extreme performance distributions; the generalization to datasets beyond the five tested benchmarks.
- **Low confidence**: The handling of division-by-zero cases (small constant adjustments mentioned but not specified); the impact of non-linear metric interactions that the linear aggregation ignores; the framework's behavior when all models perform identically.

## Next Checks
1. **Weight Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the weight vector w_j to reflect different task priorities (e.g., recommendation systems prioritizing Hit@10 over MRR) and measure how rankings change. Compare against a weighted EDAS variant to identify thresholds where equal weights become suboptimal.

2. **Outlier Performance Distribution Test**: Create synthetic decision matrices where one metric contains extreme outliers (e.g., MR ranging 1-1000 while MRR remains 0.1-0.9). Run KG-EDAS and analyze whether the mean-based normalization still produces meaningful rankings or if median-based alternatives would be more robust.

3. **Cross-Dataset Aggregation Validation**: Apply KG-EDAS separately per dataset (5 separate matrices) then compare the average rankings versus the single flattened matrix approach used in the paper. Measure correlation between these two ranking methods and analyze cases where they diverge significantly.
