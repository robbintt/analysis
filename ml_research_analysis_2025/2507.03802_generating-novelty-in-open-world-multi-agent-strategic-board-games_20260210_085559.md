core_contribution: The paper introduces GNOME, a novel experimental platform for evaluating
  AI agents in open-world environments with unanticipated novelty. Unlike existing
  game-playing frameworks that assume static environments, GNOME allows for the injection
  of structural novelties (attribute, class, and representation changes) into multi-agent
  strategic board games like Monopoly, while keeping agent development separate from
  novelty generation to prevent model-selection bias.

# Generating Novelty in Open-World Multi-Agent Strategic Board Games

- Introduces GNOME platform for controlled novelty injection in multi-agent strategic board games

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GNOME, a novel experimental platform designed to evaluate AI agents in open-world environments where unanticipated novelty can occur. Unlike traditional game-playing frameworks that assume static environments, GNOME enables the injection of structural novelties into multi-agent strategic board games like Monopoly, allowing researchers to study how agents detect and adapt to unexpected changes without requiring retraining.

The platform was successfully demonstrated at NeurIPS 2020, where participants could inject various novelties (such as changing property colors, extending property slots, or modifying dice count) and observe agent responses through a web interface. GNOME's modular architecture supports hundreds of novelty types and was subsequently used in the DARPA SAIL-ON program to evaluate external teams developing novelty-adaptive agents, advancing research on AI robustness and understanding of domain principles.

## Method Summary
GNOME employs a modular architecture that separates novelty generation from agent development to prevent model-selection bias. The system allows for three types of structural novelties: attribute changes (modifying existing properties), class changes (adding new classes or removing existing ones), and representation changes (altering how game elements are displayed or processed). Through a web interface demonstrated at NeurIPS 2020, participants could inject these novelties into games like Monopoly and observe agent responses in real-time. The experimental design supports evaluating novelty-adaptive agents by running tournaments with pre-novelty and post-novelty phases, measuring win ratio changes and detection signals to assess agent robustness.

## Key Results
- Successful demonstration of controlled novelty injection at NeurIPS 2020 with web interface for participant interaction
- Modular architecture supporting hundreds of novelty types across multiple game domains
- Effective evaluation framework measuring win ratio changes and detection signals for novelty-adaptive agents
- Integration with DARPA SAIL-ON program for external team evaluations of novelty-adaptive AI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GNOME works by creating a controlled experimental environment where structural novelties can be systematically injected into game environments while maintaining separation between the novelty generation system and the agent development process. This separation ensures that evaluation results reflect genuine agent capabilities rather than overfitting to specific novelty patterns. The platform's modular design allows for flexible implementation of various novelty types, from simple attribute modifications to complex class and representation changes, enabling comprehensive testing of agent robustness across multiple dimensions of novelty.

## Foundational Learning
- **Structural Novelty Types**: Understanding attribute, class, and representation changes as distinct categories of novelty; needed for systematic evaluation of agent adaptation capabilities; quick check: can the system clearly differentiate between modifying existing properties versus adding new classes
- **Modular Architecture Design**: Separation of novelty generation from agent development to prevent bias; needed for fair and generalizable evaluation; quick check: can agents be developed independently of the novelty injection system
- **Real-time Evaluation Framework**: Ability to measure agent responses through win ratios and detection signals; needed for quantitative assessment of novelty adaptation; quick check: are there clear metrics for comparing pre-novelty and post-novelty performance
- **Open-World Game Environments**: Strategic board games as testbeds for AI robustness; needed for controlled yet complex environments; quick check: does the game complexity scale appropriately with novelty injection
- **No-Retraining Adaptation**: Evaluating agent performance without model retraining; needed for realistic assessment of generalization; quick check: can agents detect and respond to novelty using existing capabilities

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Web Interface -> Novelty Injector -> Game Engine -> Agent Manager -> Performance Evaluator

**Critical Path**: Participant selects novelty type in web interface → Novelty injector modifies game state → Game engine processes changes → Agent manager runs agents with modified environment → Performance evaluator measures win ratios and detection signals

**Design Tradeoffs**: The platform prioritizes controlled novelty injection over real-world environmental complexity, which enables systematic evaluation but may limit ecological validity. The separation between novelty generation and agent development ensures unbiased evaluation but requires additional coordination between system components.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include agent overfitting to specific novelty patterns, inability to detect structural changes, or catastrophic performance degradation when novelties are introduced. The system may also struggle with scaling to extremely complex novelty combinations or maintaining real-time performance with computationally intensive agents.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run baseline agent tournament without novelty to establish performance baselines
2. Inject single-attribute novelties and measure detection signal accuracy
3. Compare win ratio changes between agents with and without novelty-adaptive capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of specific quantitative results from the NeurIPS 2020 demonstration regarding participant engagement and agent performance metrics
- Limited discussion of real-world deployment challenges and scalability beyond experimental settings
- Potential constraints in ecological validity due to controlled game environment focus

## Confidence
- GNOME's successful demonstration at NeurIPS 2020: Medium confidence (described but lacks specific quantitative data)
- Use in DARPA SAIL-ON program: Medium confidence (program involvement stated but details limited)
- Modular architecture design and novelty injection methodology: High confidence (well-documented technical approach)

## Next Checks
1. Obtain and analyze quantitative results from the NeurIPS 2020 GNOME demonstration, including participant engagement metrics and agent performance data across different novelty types
2. Conduct systematic evaluation of GNOME's novelty injection system with at least 10 distinct novelty types across multiple game domains to verify the claimed scalability
3. Perform ablation studies comparing agent performance with and without novelty-adaptive capabilities to establish baseline detection/adaptation effectiveness
