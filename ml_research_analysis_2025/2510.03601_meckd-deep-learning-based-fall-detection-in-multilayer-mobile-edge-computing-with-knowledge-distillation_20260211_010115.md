# MECKD: Deep Learning-Based Fall Detection in Multilayer Mobile Edge Computing With Knowledge Distillation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.03601
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03601
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed MLMEC with KD improves accuracy by 11.65% and 2.78%, reduces latency by 54.15% and 46.67% on FallAllD and SisFall datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multilayer mobile edge computing (MLMEC) framework with knowledge distillation (KD) for fall detection systems. The architecture distributes deep learning models across edge devices, MEC servers, and cloud centers, each layer equipped with models of varying computational complexity. Knowledge distillation is employed to transfer knowledge from complex models to lighter ones, optimizing the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed system demonstrates significant improvements in both accuracy and latency compared to traditional MLMEC approaches without KD.

## Method Summary
The proposed MLMEC with KD framework implements a three-tier architecture where edge devices, MEC servers, and cloud centers each host models with different computational requirements. Knowledge distillation enables lighter models to learn from more complex ones, reducing computational load while maintaining accuracy. The system leverages inertial sensor data from wearable devices, processes it through the distributed ML pipeline, and applies KD techniques to optimize performance across the hierarchical computing layers. Experimental validation was conducted on FallAllD and SisFall datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

## Key Results
- Accuracy improvement of 11.65% on FallAllD dataset compared to MLMEC without KD
- Accuracy improvement of 2.78% on SisFall dataset compared to MLMEC without KD
- Latency reduction of 54.15% on FallAllD and 46.67% on SisFall datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MLMEC architecture optimizes resource utilization by distributing computational tasks across hierarchical layers, allowing complex models to run on powerful servers while lightweight models handle edge processing. Knowledge distillation bridges the accuracy gap between these models by transferring learned representations, enabling edge devices to achieve higher accuracy without the computational burden. This combination effectively balances the accuracy-latency trade-off crucial for real-time fall detection applications.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) fundamentals**: Understanding distributed computing at network edges is essential for implementing hierarchical ML architectures that reduce latency and bandwidth usage.
   - Why needed: MEC enables real-time processing close to data sources, critical for time-sensitive applications like fall detection.
   - Quick check: Verify understanding of MEC architecture layers and their respective computational capabilities.

2. **Knowledge Distillation techniques**: KD allows smaller models to mimic larger models' behavior, transferring learned knowledge without requiring equivalent computational resources.
   - Why needed: KD enables lightweight models at edge devices to achieve accuracy levels previously only possible with heavier models.
   - Quick check: Confirm understanding of teacher-student model relationships and distillation loss functions.

3. **Fall detection dataset characteristics**: Familiarity with FallAllD and SisFall datasets, including sensor types, sampling rates, and labeling conventions.
   - Why needed: Proper dataset understanding is crucial for implementing appropriate preprocessing and evaluation metrics.
   - Quick check: Review dataset documentation to understand fall event definitions and normal activity classifications.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Wearable sensors -> Edge device models -> MEC server models -> Cloud center models

**Critical Path**: Sensor data collection → Edge preprocessing → Model inference (distributed) → KD knowledge transfer → Decision output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture balances model complexity against computational resources across layers, with KD serving as the mechanism to reduce the accuracy gap between resource-constrained and resource-rich environments.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when network latency between layers exceeds threshold, when edge device resources are insufficient for baseline models, or when KD temperature parameters are poorly tuned.

**First Experiments**:
1. Benchmark baseline MLMEC performance without KD on both datasets
2. Implement KD between MEC server and edge device models, measure accuracy-latency trade-off
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on KD temperature parameter and layer-specific model selection
