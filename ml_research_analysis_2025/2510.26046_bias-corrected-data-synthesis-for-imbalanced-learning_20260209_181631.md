# Bias-Corrected Data Synthesis for Imbalanced Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.26046
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26046
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Bias correction procedure improves synthetic data augmentation for imbalanced learning with theoretical guarantees

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of imbalanced classification where minority classes are underrepresented, leading to poor sensitivity and high false negative rates. The authors propose a bias correction procedure that improves synthetic data augmentation by estimating and adjusting for the bias between true and synthetic minority distributions. The method generates synthetic minority samples and partitions the majority class into generation and correction subsets to estimate the bias through information transfer. The bias-corrected loss function is minimized to train a classifier, showing improved performance over raw data and uncorrected synthetic augmentation across multiple simulations and real MNIST data.

## Method Summary
The bias correction method works by first generating synthetic minority samples using a chosen generator (SMOTE, Gaussian mixture, perturbed sampling, or diffusion). The majority class is randomly partitioned into generation (S₀g) and correction (S₀c) subsets. Synthetic majority samples are generated from S₀g, and the bias estimator is computed by comparing losses on S₀c versus synthetic majority samples. This bias estimate is then added to the minority synthetic term in the loss function, creating a bias-corrected objective that is minimized to train the classifier. The framework extends to multi-task learning and causal inference settings through appropriate modifications of the loss function.

## Key Results
- Theoretical guarantees include error bounds on bias estimation and excess population risk
- Consistent gains in recall, precision, F1-score, and parameter estimation accuracy across simulations
- Method is especially effective when synthetic generators are suboptimal
- Extends to multi-task learning and causal inference settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Bias Estimation via Majority Class Transfer
The bias induced by synthetic data in the minority class can be estimated by partitioning and analyzing the majority class. The majority class is split into a generation subset (used to synthesize fake majority samples) and a correction subset (held out). The discrepancy in loss values between real and synthetic majority samples provides a data-driven estimator for the bias term that would otherwise be unobservable in the minority class.

### Mechanism 2: Partitioning to Avoid Information Leakage
Splitting the majority class into independent generation and correction subsets prevents the bias estimator from overfitting to the training data. Synthetic samples generated from S₀g are evaluated against held-out samples from S₀c, ensuring that the bias estimate reflects genuine distribution discrepancy rather than memorization artifacts.

### Mechanism 3: Theoretical Guarantees Under Distribution Mismatch
The bias-corrected estimator achieves bounded excess risk even when the synthetic generator poorly approximates the true minority distribution. The excess risk bound depends on a bias transfer term and sampling complexity terms, but critically does not directly depend on the Wasserstein distance between true and synthetic minority distributions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Wasserstein Distance (W₁, W₂)**: Used in Proposition 1 and Theorem 3.2 to quantify distributional discrepancies between true and synthetic distributions and bound bias transfer errors. Quick check: Can you explain why W₁ appears in the bias transfer bound while W₂ appears in the SMOTE analysis?

- **Excess Population Risk**: Theorem 3.1 measures the quality of the bias-corrected predictor by its excess risk relative to the optimal balanced-risk minimizer, providing a rigorous performance criterion. Quick check: What two components does Theorem 3.1 identify as controlling the excess risk?

- **Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighting (AIPW)**: Section 2.3 extends the bias correction framework to ATE estimation via AIPW, linking propensity score estimation quality to causal effect estimation error. Quick check: In Theorem 3.3, which term captures the interaction between propensity score error and outcome model error?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Synthetic Generator G -> Partitioning Module -> Bias Estimator -> Corrected Loss L_bc -> Classifier Training

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Generate synthetic minority samples from all observed minority data
  2. Partition majority data → generate synthetic majority from S₀g only
  3. Compute empirical bias ĤΔ₀ using S₀c and synthetic majority
  4. Form L_bc and optimize
  5. (Multi-task extension) Aggregate task-specific coefficient estimates → eigendecomposition → shared subspace extraction

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Partition size (n₀g vs. n₀c): Larger S₀g improves synthetic sample quality; larger S₀c reduces variance in bias estimation
  - Synthetic generator choice: High-quality generators yield smaller gains from bias correction; suboptimal generators benefit substantially
  - Computational cost: Bias correction requires additional synthetic generation for majority class and extra forward passes

- **Failure signatures**:
  1. Bias correction underperforms raw synthetic: Likely transformation assumption violated
  2. High variance in bias estimate: n₀c or ñ₀ too small
  3. No improvement over raw data: Minority class too small to support meaningful synthetic generation

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate mean-shift simulation with n=1000, d=10, π₁=0.05 using SMOTE; compare raw, synthetic-only, and bias-corrected across recall/F1
  2. Ablation on partition ratio: Vary n₀c from 10% to 50% of majority class; plot bias estimate variance and final F1
  3. Test with deliberately poor generator (e.g., Gaussian mixture on non-Gaussian data) to verify larger gains when synthetic quality is low

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the bias correction framework be rigorously extended to multi-class classification settings? The authors identify the lack of a "formal theoretical derivation supporting the algorithm's extension to the multi-class setting" as a limitation, despite satisfactory empirical results on MNIST. This remains unresolved because the current theoretical analysis is derived specifically for binary classification. A theoretical extension of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 providing non-asymptotic error bounds for the multi-class scenario would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How can the discrepancy between true and synthetic distributions be measured beyond a scalar loss function bias? The discussion notes that the current theoretical bias term is defined via a one-dimensional loss, which risks losing information about complex discrepancies in high-dimensional data. This is unresolved because compressing the distributional mismatch into a scalar value may not adequately capture geometric or structural differences. A modified correction framework utilizing a high-dimensional metric that demonstrates superior performance on complex image or manifold data would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
Is there a scalable criterion to determine when the computational cost of bias correction is justified? The authors list "establishing a computationally scalable criterion to determine whether the bias correction approach is likely to yield substantial performance gains" as a primary goal for future work. This remains unresolved because when synthetic generators are highly accurate, the performance gain is often marginal, rendering the extra computational cost inefficient. A diagnostic statistic derived from the generation and correction subsets that predicts the variance-bias trade-off prior to model training would resolve this.

## Limitations

- The bias correction mechanism relies critically on Assumption 1 (existence of a learnable transformation T between minority and majority distributions), which may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Theoretical guarantees depend on unknown constants in Wasserstein distance bounds and may not translate directly to finite-sample performance
- The partitioning strategy introduces additional hyperparameters (ratio of generation to correction subsets) that are not fully explored
- The method's effectiveness is inherently limited by the quality of the synthetic generator

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The partitioning mechanism for bias estimation and its implementation details are clearly specified and theoretically grounded
- **Medium confidence**: The transfer-based bias estimation works well when Assumption 1 holds, but generalizability to complex, real-world distributions remains uncertain
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical error bounds are mathematically sound under stated assumptions, but practical tightness of these bounds is unknown
- **Low confidence**: Performance improvements in multi-task learning and causal inference extensions, as these are briefly mentioned without comprehensive evaluation

## Next Checks

1. **Assumption robustness test**: Systematically evaluate the bias correction framework across synthetic data distributions where the transformation T either holds (Gaussian location shift) or fails (multi-modal, skewed distributions) to quantify performance degradation when Assumption 1 is violated.

2. **Partition sensitivity analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive ablation study varying the generation-to-correction partition ratio (from 90:10 to 10:90) to identify optimal splits and quantify variance in bias estimates across different imbalance ratios and sample sizes.

3. **Generator quality tradeoff**: Design experiments comparing bias correction effectiveness across a spectrum of synthetic generators (SMOTE, perturbed sampling, diffusion models) on the same base dataset to empirically validate the claim that bias correction provides larger gains when synthetic quality is low.
