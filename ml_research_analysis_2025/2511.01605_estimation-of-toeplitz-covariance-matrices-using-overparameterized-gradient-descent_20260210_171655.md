# Estimation of Toeplitz Covariance Matrices using Overparameterized Gradient Descent

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.01605
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01605
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Overparameterized gradient descent (K=2P or 4P) consistently achieves global convergence for Toeplitz covariance estimation, outperforming exact parameterization (K=P) and matching state-of-the-art methods like ATOM.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a simple gradient descent approach to estimate Toeplitz covariance matrices by modeling them as sums of complex sinusoids with learnable amplitudes and frequencies. The key insight is that mild overparameterization (K=2P or 4P components versus P dimensions) transforms a challenging non-convex optimization problem into one with benign landscape properties, enabling reliable convergence from random initializations. The authors demonstrate that while exact parameterization often gets trapped in suboptimal solutions, overparameterization consistently achieves lower error. They also introduce an accelerated GD variant using separate learning rates for amplitudes and frequencies, motivated by Hessian analysis showing vastly different curvature magnitudes.

## Method Summary
The method estimates a P×P Toeplitz covariance matrix by parameterizing it as C = Σₖ aₖv(ωₖ)v(ωₖ)ᴴ + εI, where v(ω) represents a complex sinusoid basis and a represents amplitudes. Optimization is performed via gradient descent on the negative log-likelihood objective, with two algorithms: Algorithm 1 uses a single learning rate with Armijo backtracking, while Algorithm 2 employs separate rates for amplitudes and frequencies. The authors prove that when frequencies are fixed on a grid, the optimization landscape is benign in population and asymptotic settings, ensuring convergence to the true covariance. Numerical experiments validate that overparameterization consistently improves accuracy across structured, autoregressive, and random covariance estimation tasks.

## Key Results
- Mild overparameterization (K=2P or 4P) enables global convergence from random initializations, while exact parameterization (K=P) often converges to suboptimal solutions
- Separate learning rates for amplitudes and frequencies accelerate convergence by 3-5× compared to uniform step sizes
- When frequencies are fixed, the negative log-likelihood landscape is provably benign—any stationary point recovers the true covariance in the population limit
- Overparameterized GD matches or exceeds ATOM accuracy across all tested scenarios (structured, AR, random covariances)
- The method remains simple and scalable, requiring only gradient computations without sophisticated initialization schemes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Mild overparameterization (K=2P or K=4P) enables gradient descent to escape suboptimal local minima and achieve global convergence from random initialization.
- Mechanism: The Carathéodory decomposition parameterizes the covariance as C = Σₖ aₖv(ωₖ)v(ωₖ)ᴴ + εI. With K>P, the optimization landscape becomes more benign—redundant parameters create additional descent paths that circumvent spurious stationary points present at exact parameterization (K=P).
- Core assumption: The optimization landscape transitions from "scary" non-convex to effectively benign when sufficiently overparameterized; this is assumed to generalize from amplitude-only proofs to joint amplitude-frequency optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "when K = P, GD may converge to suboptimal solutions. However, mild overparameterization (K = 2P or 4P) consistently enables global convergence from random initializations"
  - [Section VI.D, Figure 5] RMSE vs sample size shows K≈2P achieves substantially lower error than K≈P
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support for this specific mechanism in Toeplitz estimation

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Separate learning rates for amplitude and frequency parameters accelerate convergence by 3-5× compared to uniform step sizes.
- Mechanism: Hessian analysis reveals frequency parameters have curvature L_ω ≈ P^1.5·‖s‖₂·‖Ĉ⁻¹‖₂^(3/2), while amplitudes have curvature L_a ≈ P·‖Ĉ⁻¹‖₂—a difference of up to four orders of magnitude. Smaller steps for frequencies prevent oscillation while larger steps for amplitudes exploit their flatter loss geometry.
- Core assumption: The local Lipschitz constant approximations (22-23) accurately capture the dominant scaling behavior across parameter configurations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section IV, Figure 1] Empirical validation shows L_ω up to 4 orders of magnitude larger than L_a across 1000 trials
  - [Section VI.E, Figure 6] Algorithm 2 achieves significantly faster computation times, especially for larger K
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation for this specific Hessian-based preconditioning approach

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: When frequencies are fixed on a grid, the negative log-likelihood landscape is asymptotically benign—any stationary point recovers the true covariance in the population limit.
- Mechanism: With fixed frequencies {v(ωₖ)} spanning R^P, the NLL gradient condition vₖᴴM(a)vₖ = 0 for all k implies ⟨Γ, Γ⟩_Ĉ = 0 via a weighted inner product argument, forcing Γ = Ĉ - C = 0. Under sample covariance perturbation ∆, the error bound scales as ‖Ĉ - C‖²_F ≤ (λ/μ)²·ε².
- Core assumption: The complex sinusoids span R^P (full row rank condition) and the estimated covariance remains well-conditioned (μI ≼ Ĉ ≼ λI).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section V, Theorem 1] Population setting proof that stationary points recover true covariance
  - [Section V, Theorem 2] Asymptotic stability bound under perturbation
  - [corpus] Corpus references optimization in overparameterized models but not this specific landscape analysis

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Carathéodory Decomposition for Toeplitz Matrices**
  - Why needed here: This decomposition expresses any P×P positive definite Toeplitz covariance as a sum of K complex sinusoids—the fundamental parameterization enabling gradient-based optimization with built-in positive definiteness.
  - Quick check question: Given a 4×4 Toeplitz matrix with first row [4, 2, 1, 0.5], can you write it as Ĉ = Σₖ aₖv(ωₖ)v(ωₖ)ᴴ + εI with K=4? What constraints on aₖ and ωₖ ensure positive definiteness?

- Concept: **Negative Log-Likelihood for Covariance Estimation**
  - Why needed here: The objective function L(a,ω) = tr(SĈ⁻¹) + log|Ĉ| is the optimization target; understanding its gradient structure is essential for implementing and debugging the GD algorithms.
  - Quick check question: Why does NLL contain both the tr(SĈ⁻¹) term and the log|Ĉ| term? What happens to the gradient if Ĉ becomes singular?

- Concept: **Armijo Backtracking Line Search**
  - Why needed here: Both Algorithm 1 and 2 use adaptive step sizes via the Armijo condition; understanding this ensures proper convergence behavior and helps diagnose step size issues.
  - Quick check question: If the Armijo condition L(yₜ - η∇L) ≤ L(yₜ) - αη‖∇L‖² fails repeatedly, what does this indicate about the local loss geometry? How should β be tuned?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Sample covariance S → Initialize parameters â, ω̂ → Construct Ĉ(â,ω̂) → Compute Ĉ⁻¹ → Compute E matrix → Compute gradients (∂L/∂âₖ, ∂L/∂ω̂ₖ) → Backtracking step sizes → Update parameters → Check convergence → Return Ĉ

- Critical path:
  1. Sample covariance S → 2. Initialize â(0), ω̂(0) → 3. Construct Ĉ → 4. Compute Ĉ⁻¹ (O(P²) via Levinson or O(P log P) via FFT) → 5. Compute E matrix → 6. Compute gradients via equations (9-10) → 7. Backtrack step sizes → 8. Update parameters → 9. Check convergence (gradient norm or likelihood change) → 10. Return Ĉ

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Oversampling factor F**: Higher F (K=4P vs K=2P) improves robustness but increases per-iteration cost O(K). Paper shows F=2 sufficient for most cases.
  - **Joint vs amplitude-only optimization**: Joint (optimizing ω) achieves ~10× lower RMSE than amplitude-only (GDA) per Table I, but requires more careful step size tuning.
  - **Toeplitz inversion method**: Levinson-Durbin (O(P²)) vs FFT-based (O(P log P))—latter preferred for P > 100.
  - **Regularization ε**: Larger ε ensures numerical stability but biases estimates; paper uses fixed small ε interpreted as noise floor.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Diverging likelihood**: Step sizes too large; backtracking not triggering (check Armijo condition implementation).
  - **Slow convergence**: Using single learning rate instead of separate rates; verify Algorithm 2 is active.
  - **Poor accuracy with K=P**: Exact parameterization prone to local minima; increase K to 2P or 4P.
  - **Gradient explosion**: Covariance becoming near-singular; increase ε or bound amplitudes.
  - **Stuck at high RMSE**: Fixed-frequency (GDA) mode active when joint optimization needed; ensure frequencies are being updated.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sanity check—identity covariance**: Generate data with C=I_P, run Algorithm 2 with K=2P, M=50 samples. Expected: RMSE ≈ P/M (sample covariance baseline), converged amplitudes ≈ small, frequencies arbitrary.
  2. **Overparameterization sweep**: Use ATOM benchmark setup (P=15, structured frequencies), vary K∈{P, 1.5P, 2P, 4P} with M=40. Plot RMSE vs K to verify K≥2P threshold for stable convergence.
  3. **Learning rate ablation**: Same setup, compare Algorithm 1 (single η₀=1.0) vs Algorithm 2 (η₀^(a)=1.0, η₀^(ω)=0.01) measuring iterations to reach RMSE threshold. Expect 3-5× speedup for Algorithm 2.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Is the optimization landscape benign and free of spurious local minima when jointly optimizing both amplitudes and frequencies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "While we cannot yet prove this for joint amplitude and frequency optimization, our experiments suggest that it works well in practice."
- Why unresolved: The provided theoretical guarantees (Theorems 1 and 2) strictly assume frequencies are fixed and only amplitudes are optimized.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof extending the landscape analysis to the joint parameter space, or a counter-example identifying a stable spurious stationary point.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can second-order optimization methods utilizing the derived closed-form Hessian significantly outperform the proposed first-order methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes that the Hessian analysis "...suggests that second-order methods could further improve performance in future work."
- Why unresolved: The current work relies on first-order gradient descent with heuristics like separate learning rates (Algorithm 2) to handle curvature differences.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing faster convergence or lower compute time for a Newton-type method compared to Algorithm 2.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical minimum degree of overparameterization ($K/P$) required to ensure convergence from a random initialization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The experiments show that minimal parameterization ($K=P$) fails while mild overparameterization ($K=2P, 4P$) succeeds, but no theoretical threshold is established.
- Why unresolved: The paper empirically validates specific factors (2 and 4) but does not derive a general bound on the necessary redundancy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical derivation establishing a critical ratio of parameters to dimensions that guarantees the loss landscape becomes benign.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees are limited to amplitude-only optimization, with joint optimization relying on empirical evidence of benign landscapes
- The method requires careful tuning of overparameterization factor F and learning rates, with no universal theoretical prescription
- Performance depends on regularization parameter ε, which trades off numerical stability against estimation bias

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The empirical demonstration that mild overparameterization (K=2P, K=4P) consistently improves convergence over exact parameterization (K=P), supported by extensive numerical experiments across multiple covariance structures.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that separate learning rates accelerate convergence by 3-5×, based on Hessian analysis and experimental validation, though the exact speedup may vary with problem conditioning.
- **Medium confidence**: The theoretical framework for amplitude-only optimization being benign in population/asymptotic settings, with formal proofs provided, though practical finite-sample behavior may deviate.

## Next Checks
1. **Scaling behavior validation**: Test the method on larger P (e.g., P=50, 100) to verify that the K≈2P overparameterization rule scales appropriately and that Algorithm 2's acceleration remains effective.

2. **Perturbation sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the regularization parameter ε and sample size M to quantify the trade-off between numerical stability and estimation bias, particularly near the sample limit where ε becomes critical.

3. **Convergence landscape mapping**: For small P (e.g., P=5), exhaustively sample initializations to empirically verify that overparameterization eliminates spurious local minima that trap exact parameterization, complementing the theoretical arguments.
