## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IAO (Input-Action-Output) prompting, a structured template-based approach that makes explicit how LLMs access and apply their stored knowledge during reasoning tasks. IAO decomposes problems into sequential steps, clearly identifying the input knowledge being used, the action being performed, and the resulting output. Through experiments across diverse reasoning tasks including arithmetic, logical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning, IAO improved zero-shot performance compared to traditional chain-of-thought prompting. The method provides transparency in how LLMs leverage their stored knowledge while improving reasoning performance.

## Method Summary
IAO prompting is a structured template-based approach that decomposes reasoning tasks into three explicit components: Input (knowledge being accessed), Action (operation being performed), and Output (result). The framework guides LLMs through sequential reasoning steps by clearly specifying what knowledge is being used, what operation is being applied, and what the result should be. This structured format aims to make the knowledge flow more transparent while improving reasoning accuracy. The approach is evaluated through zero-shot prompting across multiple reasoning tasks including arithmetic, logical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning, with comparisons to traditional chain-of-thought prompting methods.

## Key Results
- Achieved 94.2% accuracy on GSM8K arithmetic reasoning compared to 90.1% for zero-shot CoT
- Improved zero-shot performance across diverse reasoning tasks including logical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning
- Human evaluation confirmed that IAO's structured format significantly enhances the ability to verify knowledge utilization and detect reasoning errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
IAO prompting works by making the implicit knowledge utilization process in LLMs explicit and structured. By decomposing reasoning into Input-Action-Output components, the method forces the model to clearly articulate what knowledge it is accessing (Input), what operation it is performing (Action), and what result it produces (Output). This structured approach reduces ambiguity in reasoning steps and helps prevent knowledge conflation or hallucination by requiring explicit specification of knowledge sources and operations. The template format guides the model through logical progression while maintaining transparency about knowledge flow, enabling better verification of reasoning correctness.

## Foundational Learning
- Chain-of-thought prompting: Sequential reasoning approach where models generate intermediate steps to solve problems. Why needed: Provides baseline comparison for evaluating IAO's improvements in structured reasoning.
- Zero-shot prompting: Generating responses without task-specific fine-tuning or examples. Why needed: Demonstrates IAO's effectiveness without requiring additional training data.
- Knowledge hallucination: Generation of false or unsupported information by LLMs. Why needed: Understanding this limitation motivates the need for transparent knowledge utilization.
- Structured reasoning templates: Predefined formats for organizing reasoning steps. Why needed: Forms the foundation of IAO's approach to making reasoning explicit.
- Human evaluation of model outputs: Assessing model reasoning quality through human judgment. Why needed: Validates whether IAO improves transparency and verifiability.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Input (Knowledge) -> Action (Operation) -> Output (Result) -> Next Step (if multi-step)

Critical path:
1. Problem decomposition into IAO components
2. Sequential execution of IAO steps
3. Final answer synthesis from outputs

Design tradeoffs:
- Explicit structure vs. natural reasoning flow
- Transparency vs. potential constraint on creativity
- Template rigidity vs. task flexibility
- Human readability vs. model performance

Failure signatures:
- Incorrect knowledge identification in Input component
- Misaligned Action operations
- Output that doesn't logically follow from Input-Action pair
- Template format violations
- Incomplete problem decomposition

First 3 experiments:
1. GSM8K arithmetic reasoning benchmark comparison with CoT
2. Multi-step logical reasoning task evaluation
3. Commonsense reasoning task with human verification study

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness appears task-dependent with strongest gains in structured reasoning problems
- Evaluation lacks systematic analysis of computational efficiency compared to other prompting methods
- Does not establish practical benefits of transparency in real-world applications
- Limited analysis of how transparency translates to improved model reliability

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- GSM8K arithmetic performance improvements (94.2% vs 90.1%)
- Zero-shot prompting effectiveness across multiple tasks

**Medium confidence:**
- Generalizability across diverse reasoning tasks
- Human evaluation findings on transparency improvements

**Low confidence:**
- Claims about detecting hallucinations through transparency
- Practical utility of enhanced transparency in real applications

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies to determine which IAO components (input specification, action clarity, or output formatting) contribute most to performance gains
2. Test IAO prompting on more complex, multi-step reasoning tasks requiring knowledge integration across domains
3. Evaluate computational overhead and response latency compared to standard chain-of-thought prompting to assess practical deployment feasibility
