# TinyScientist: An Interactive, Extensible, and Controllable Framework for Building Research Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06579
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06579
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Modular framework achieving comparable or better paper generation quality with tool usage improving writing/idea quality by over 0.1 points

## Executive Summary
TinyScientist is a modular framework designed to simplify and democratize the development of research agents by addressing the complexity of automatic research workflows. It introduces three core design principles: interactivity, achieved through a tabular-based interface enabling human-agent communication; extensibility, enabled by adopting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless tool integration; and controllability, ensured through built-in budget and safety constraints. The framework consists of four workflow components—thinker, coder, writer, and reviewer—supported by reusable feature components like Formatter, MCPClient, and Checker. Quantitative evaluations show that TinyScientist achieves comparable or better paper generation quality than existing frameworks, with tool usage improving writing and idea quality by over 0.1 points. Safety and budget checkers effectively block unsafe tasks and control resource usage, demonstrating robust controllability.

## Method Summary
TinyScientist addresses the complexity of building research agents by providing a modular framework with three core principles: interactivity through a tabular interface, extensibility via Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration, and controllability through budget and safety constraints. The framework organizes research workflows into four components—thinker (planning), coder (coding), writer (content generation), and reviewer (quality checking)—supported by reusable features like Formatter, MCPClient, and Checker. Evaluations demonstrate comparable or improved paper generation quality against baselines, with tool usage significantly enhancing writing and idea quality. Safety and budget constraints are validated as effective in experimental settings.

## Key Results
- TinyScientist achieves comparable or better paper generation quality than existing frameworks
- Tool usage improves writing and idea quality by over 0.1 points
- Safety and budget checkers effectively block unsafe tasks and control resource usage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from its modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct workflow components while enabling seamless tool integration through MCP. The tabular-based interface facilitates human-agent interaction, allowing researchers to guide the agent's decision-making process. Built-in safety and budget constraints ensure responsible resource usage and prevent unsafe outputs. The extensibility through MCP allows researchers to incorporate specialized tools as needed, making the framework adaptable to various research domains.

## Foundational Learning
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Standardized interface for tool integration - needed to enable extensibility without framework modifications
- **Tabular-based interface design**: Structured human-agent communication - needed to maintain interactivity while managing complex workflows
- **Budget and safety constraint implementation**: Resource management and output filtering - needed to ensure controllability and responsible usage
- **Component-based workflow architecture**: Separation of planning, coding, writing, and reviewing - needed to modularize complex research tasks
- **Automated evaluation metrics for research quality**: Objective quality assessment - needed to benchmark performance against baselines
- **Checker mechanisms for quality control**: Automated validation of outputs - needed to maintain consistency and correctness

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Thinker -> Coder -> Writer -> Reviewer (workflow pipeline)

**Critical Path**
Human input → Thinker (planning) → Coder (implementation) → Writer (content generation) → Reviewer (quality check) → Output with iterative refinement

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Modularity vs. integration complexity: Component separation enables extensibility but requires careful coordination
- Automated vs. human oversight: Balance between efficiency and quality control through the tabular interface
- Safety constraints vs. creative freedom: Necessary limitations may restrict certain research directions

**Failure Signatures**
- Workflow bottlenecks when components fail to communicate properly
- Safety constraints incorrectly blocking legitimate research tasks
- Budget overruns in computationally intensive operations
- Quality degradation when automated reviewers miss subtle issues

**First 3 Experiments to Run**
1. Basic workflow test: Run a simple research task through all components to verify integration
2. Safety constraint validation: Attempt to generate content that should be blocked by safety checks
3. Tool integration test: Connect a new research tool via MCP and verify functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on automated metrics without human studies, leaving open questions about real-world usability and subjective quality
- Safety and budget constraints validated only through controlled experimental settings; effectiveness in open-ended research tasks uncertain
- Tool integration via MCP theoretically extensible, but framework's ability to incorporate complex, domain-specific research tools not demonstrated
- Claims about real-world usability, robustness to diverse research domains, and seamless tool integration not empirically validated

## Confidence

**High Confidence**
- Framework architecture (thinker/coder/writer/reviewer workflow) and design principles are clearly defined and internally consistent
- Safety and budget checking mechanisms are technically sound

**Medium Confidence**
- Quantitative improvements over baselines are measurable, but practical significance and generalizability uncertain without human evaluation

**Low Confidence**
- Claims about real-world usability, robustness to diverse research domains, and seamless tool integration via MCP are not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human studies with researchers to evaluate practical usability, quality, and efficiency of research agents built with TinyScientist compared to manual workflows
2. Test framework's extensibility by integrating domain-specific tools and measuring integration success and performance impact
3. Perform stress tests on safety and budget constraints using adversarial or complex research tasks to evaluate robustness and failure modes
