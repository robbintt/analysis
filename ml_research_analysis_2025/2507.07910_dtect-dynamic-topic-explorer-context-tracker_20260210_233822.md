## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** DTECT identifies evolving trends by ranking words based on a composite "interestingness" score rather than just raw frequency.
- **Mechanism:** The system calculates a final score $S_{final}(v, k)$ as the product of **Burstiness** (peak vs. mean probability), **Specificity** (relevance to specific topic vs. corpus), and **Uniqueness** (IDF-style penalty for common words). This filters out static high-frequency terms (e.g., "bank") in favor of temporally active terms (e.g., "demonetisation").
- **Core assumption:** Terms that signal meaningful temporal shifts exhibit distinct probability trajectories (high burstiness) and are localized to specific topics (high specificity).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.2] Details the formula $S_{final} = S_{burst} \times S_{spec} \times S_{uniq}$.
  - [abstract] Mentions "trend analysis via temporally salient words."
  - [corpus] Indirect support only; related works like "Dynamic Topic Evolution..." discuss temporal attention, but do not validate this specific scoring formula.
- **Break condition:** If a topic evolves uniformly without distinct "spikes" (low burstiness variance), the scoring mechanism may fail to surface critical but gradual shifts.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** LLMs enhance interpretability by mapping opaque word distributions to semantic labels and grounded summaries via a context-constrained generation process.
- **Mechanism:** The system extracts the top-N words across time steps to form a "temporal keyword trajectory." This trajectory is fed to an LLM (e.g., GPT) with a prompt to generate a concise label. For summaries, retrieved documents are injected into the context window to ground the response, strictly preventing hallucinations via system prompts.
- **Core assumption:** Large Language Models can accurately synthesize semantic meaning from bag-of-words lists and adhere strictly to provided context constraints.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.1] Describes extracting top-N words per time point for labeling.
  - [section 4.4] Describes grounding chat responses in retrieved documents.
  - [corpus] Weak anchor; "Dynamic Topic Evolution..." uses LLMs for embeddings, not interpretability/labeling.
- **Break condition:** If the top-N words are incoherent (low TTC) or the context window is exceeded by retrieved documents, the LLM may generate generic or hallucinated labels.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The system ensures temporal continuity and semantic coherence through composite evaluation metrics (TTQ) during model selection.
- **Mechanism:** TTQ (Temporal Topic Quality) acts as a composite objective balancing **TTC** (semantic coherence of topic words) and **TTS** (smoothness of evolution across adjacent timestamps). This guides the selection of the underlying model (DTM, DETM, or CFDTM).
- **Core assumption:** Optimal dynamic topics should be both semantically interpretable (high coherence) and evolutionarily smooth (high smoothness).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.3] Defines TTC, TTS, and TTQ.
  - [table 4] Shows DTM achieving highest TTQ (0.1731 on Finance) despite higher runtime.
  - [corpus] "Merging Embedded Topics..." discusses topic quality in streams, supporting the need for robust metrics.
- **Break condition:** If the corpus contains abrupt "phase shifts" or breaking events, penalizing non-smoothness (via TTS) might cause the system to select a model that lags behind real-time trends.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM/DETM)**
  - **Why needed here:** Unlike static LDA, these models capture the time dimension. You must understand how the $\beta$ tensor ($T \times K \times V$) represents topic evolution to interpret the visualizations.
  - **Quick check question:** If a topic has high TTS (Temporal Topic Smoothness), would you expect its top words to change drastically between adjacent years?

- **Concept: Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR)**
  - **Why needed here:** Used in the retrieval module. It balances **relevance** (similarity to query) with **diversity** (dissimilarity to already selected documents) to ensure summaries cover different aspects of a theme.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might standard cosine similarity search fail to provide a comprehensive summary of a controversial topic compared to MMR?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - **Why needed here:** The Chat Assistant relies on this. It retrieves documents based on a word-timestamp query and forces the LLM to answer strictly using that context.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to the Chat Assistant's factual consistency if the retrieval step returns irrelevant documents?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Preprocessor (OCTIS-based) -> DynamicDataset -> DynamicTrainer (DTM/DETM/CFDTM) -> TopicQualityAssessor (TTC/TTS/TTQ) -> LLM Interface (LangChain) -> FAISS Index -> Streamlit UI

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Ingest:** Process raw JSONL -> Time-binned BoW/Vocab.
  2. **Train:** Fit $\beta$ tensor ($T \times K \times V$).
  3. **Score:** Compute Interestingness scores ($S_{final}$) for all words.
  4. **Index:** Build FAISS index for document retrieval.
  5. **Serve:** Streamlit queries LLM with top-words/summaries.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **DTM vs. DETM:** DTM offers higher topic quality (TTQ) but has massive runtime (290k secs on UN data); DETM is faster but slightly less coherent.
  - **Specificity vs. Uniqueness:** High specificity finds niche terms, but high uniqueness is needed to filter out common stopwords. The product $S_{spec} \times S_{uniq}$ balances this.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **"Generic Labels":** LLM returns vague labels (e.g., "General Policy") -> Indicates low TTC (incoherent top words).
  - **"Static Trends":** Informative Word Detection returns flat lines -> Indicates low Burstiness scores or model collapse (topics not evolving).
  - **"OOM Error":** Training crashes on large corpora -> DTM memory footprint is high; switch to DETM/CFDTM.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Run the provided `CFDTM` on the sample dataset; verify that TTC > 0 and plots render.
  2. **Metric Sensitivity:** Manually alter the "Interestingness" weights (e.g., set $S_{uniq}=1$) and observe if common stopwords flood the "Informative Words" list.
  3. **Hallucination Check:** Use the Chat Assistant to ask a question *not* present in the retrieved documents; verify it responds with "The information is not available..." rather than inventing facts.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- The system's reliance on LLM-based labeling introduces significant interpretability risks, with no quantitative evaluation of label accuracy or consistency across different LLM prompts or model versions.
- The temporal word detection mechanism may struggle with gradual topic evolution, potentially missing slowly evolving topics that don't show dramatic temporal shifts.
- The evaluation metrics (TTC, TTS, TTQ) are internally defined and validated only through relative comparisons between model architectures on three datasets, lacking external validation against human judgments.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The architectural components (preprocessing pipeline, model training, FAISS retrieval) are well-documented and technically sound. The runtime comparisons between DTM, DETM, and CFDTM are verifiable.
- **Medium confidence**: The composite scoring mechanism for informative words appears theoretically justified, but empirical validation of its superiority over simpler approaches is limited to qualitative observations.
- **Low confidence**: The LLM-based labeling and summarization components lack rigorous evaluation. The paper provides no analysis of hallucination rates, label consistency, or comparison with alternative labeling approaches.

## Next Checks

1. **Label Accuracy Benchmark**: Create a gold-standard dataset of topic labels for 50-100 topics across different time periods. Compare DTECT's LLM-generated labels against human annotations using precision, recall, and consistency metrics across multiple LLM runs.

2. **Temporal Evolution Robustness**: Test the system on datasets with known gradual evolution (e.g., climate policy discussions over 20 years) versus sudden shifts (e.g., pandemic-related topics). Measure detection accuracy and false negative rates for slowly evolving topics.

3. **Memory and Scalability Analysis**: Profile memory usage and training times for each model architecture (DTM, DETM, CFDTM) on progressively larger datasets (100K, 500K, 1M documents). Document OOM thresholds and identify the practical scalability limits of each approach.
