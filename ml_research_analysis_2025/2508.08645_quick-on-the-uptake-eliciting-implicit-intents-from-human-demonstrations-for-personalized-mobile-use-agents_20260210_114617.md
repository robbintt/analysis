# Quick on the Uptake: Eliciting Implicit Intents from Human Demonstrations for Personalized Mobile-Use Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.08645
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08645
- **Reference count:** 36
- **Primary result:** Dual analysis of explicit and implicit human intention flows improves mobile-use agent performance by up to 32.06% relative in intention alignment and 26.34% relative in step completion.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IFRAgent, a framework designed to enhance mobile-use agents by capturing both explicit and implicit human intention flows from demonstration data. By constructing standard operating procedures (SOPs) from explicit flows and building user-level habit repositories from implicit flows, IFRAgent personalizes agent behavior to better align with individual user preferences. The system employs retrieval-augmented generation and a warmed-up query rewriter to transform ambiguous queries into personalized instructions, resulting in substantial improvements over baseline methods in intention alignment and task completion rates.

## Method Summary
IFRAgent enhances mobile-use agents through a dual analysis of human demonstrations: explicit flows are used to build SOPs, while implicit flows inform user-level habit repositories. Ambiguous queries are rewritten into personalized instructions using retrieval-augmented generation and a warmed-up query rewriter. This approach leverages both the structured logic of explicit interactions and the nuanced, habitual patterns found in implicit interactions, enabling the agent to better infer user intent and adapt to individual preferences.

## Key Results
- IFRAgent achieves an average 6.79% (32.06% relative) improvement in intention alignment rate over baseline methods.
- Step completion rate improves by 5.30% (26.34% relative) with IFRAgent.
- The authors introduce MobileIAR, a new benchmark dataset with user-specific annotations for evaluating human-agent intention alignment.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to distinguish between explicit, rule-based user interactions and implicit, habitual behaviors. By separately modeling these flows, IFRAgent can construct both SOPs for predictable tasks and habit repositories for personalized adaptations. The retrieval-augmented generation and warmed-up query rewriter then leverage these dual models to disambiguate and personalize user queries, aligning agent actions more closely with individual user expectations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Explicit vs. implicit intention flows**: Explicit flows capture deliberate, rule-based interactions, while implicit flows encode habitual, user-specific patterns. This distinction is crucial for building both SOPs and personalized habit repositories.
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**: RAG combines retrieval of relevant context with generative models to improve query rewriting and personalization.
- **Warmed-up query rewriting**: Pre-training a query rewriter on demonstration data enables more accurate disambiguation of ambiguous user queries.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** User demonstrations -> Explicit flow extraction -> SOP construction; Implicit flow extraction -> Habit repository; Query rewriter (warmed-up) + RAG -> Personalized instruction generation -> Agent execution

**Critical path:** Demonstrations are parsed to extract explicit and implicit flows, which are separately processed into SOPs and habit repositories. Ambiguous queries are rewritten using the query rewriter and RAG, then executed by the agent.

**Design tradeoffs:** The dual analysis approach increases model complexity and training overhead but enables richer personalization. Relying on demonstration data for implicit habit capture may limit adaptability to novel user behaviors.

**Failure signatures:** Poor SOP or habit repository construction due to noisy or insufficient demonstration data; query rewriter may fail on out-of-distribution or highly ambiguous queries.

**First experiments:**
1. Compare explicit-only vs. implicit-only vs. dual analysis on intention alignment.
2. Ablate the warmed-up query rewriter to assess its impact on query rewriting accuracy.
3. Evaluate generalization of improvements across different mobile platforms and user demographics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out additional open questions beyond those related to dataset scope, generalization, and real-world robustness.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to the MobileIAR dataset, raising questions about external validity.
- The approach's robustness to out-of-distribution queries and long-term user adaptation is not demonstrated.
- Details on training procedures, hyperparameter sensitivity, and computational overhead are sparse.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The dual analysis framework (explicit flows for SOPs, implicit flows for habit repositories) is a novel and theoretically grounded contribution.
- **Medium confidence**: The reported performance improvements are reproducible within the MobileIAR benchmark, but external validity is uncertain.
- **Low confidence**: The practical impact of the approach in real-world, long-term deployments and its robustness to out-of-distribution queries are not demonstrated.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-platform and cross-user studies to assess generalization of the intention alignment improvements beyond the MobileIAR dataset.
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the relative contributions of explicit flows, implicit flows, and the warmed-up query rewriter to overall performance.
3. Evaluate the system's robustness and adaptability when exposed to novel, out-of-distribution queries and over extended periods of user interaction.
