- Method improves failure-cause inference using FBS model-based maintenance record accumulation

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of knowledge-based failure-cause inference in manufacturing systems by proposing a Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based method for maintenance-record accumulation. The approach explicitly structures knowledge about target systems and failures while creating sufficiently long causal chains to meet critical requirements for effective inference. An ontology-based approach integrates deep system knowledge with shallow failure knowledge, and maintenance records are accumulated using this framework. Experimental evaluation using a LEGO car assembly line demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed a baseline approach, particularly in difficult cases with limited data and vocabulary differences.

## Method Summary
The proposed method constructs a Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology that defines classes (System, Failure) and properties (hasPart, hasCause, hasFailure) to organize manufacturing system knowledge. The FBS model captures hierarchical relationships across five levels: LineFunction → ProcessFunction → ProcessElementFunction → Behavior → Structure. Maintenance records are linked to specific system nodes via the hasFailure property. During inference, the system generates vector embeddings for subgraphs containing failure nodes and their connected FBS model context, then uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to find relevant causes. The key innovation is creating graph-based chunks that include both failure and system information, providing richer context for vector embeddings compared to text-only approaches.

## Key Results
- Proposed method achieved Precision@8 = 1.0 and Recall@8 = 0.625 for difficult failure cases with vocabulary mismatches
- Outperformed baseline approach (Precision@8 = 0.375, Recall@8 = 0.25) in cases with limited similar maintenance records
- Minimal difference for easy cases (Precision@8: 0.75 vs 0.875), indicating method's value in edge cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured linkage between deep system knowledge and shallow failure knowledge improves failure-cause inference when vocabulary varies
- Mechanism: The FBS model-based method links specific failure events to hierarchical levels within a manufacturing system's Function-Behavior-Structure. By doing so, the inference engine can retrieve relevant cases not just by textual similarity of failure descriptions, but by structural and functional similarity. This mitigates issues where technicians describe the same failure with different words.
- Core assumption: The paper's Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology accurately models the critical relationships (hierarchical, realization, sequential) within a manufacturing system and that failures can be consistently mapped to this structure.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] The method integrates deep knowledge about the system's functions, behaviors, and structures with shallow knowledge of failures. [section 5] "for Assumed Failure 2, where only a few exact maintenance records exist and the wording does not match, the proposed method surpassed the baseline by a large margin... achieved Precision@8 = 1.0 and Recall@8 = 0.625."
- Break condition: If maintenance personnel cannot or do not accurately map new failure events to the correct nodes in the FBS model during data entry, the structured linkage is broken, and the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Restricting search space by system hierarchy improves precision in failure-cause inference
- Mechanism: The proposed method uses the `has Part` and `step After` properties in the ontology to organize system elements into a five-level hierarchy. During inference, the search for similar failure cases is explicitly constrained to the same hierarchical level as the input failure and its descendants. This prevents the retrieval of irrelevant cases from different parts of the system that might have superficially similar textual descriptions but different root causes.
- Core assumption: Failures and their causes propagate predictably within the defined hierarchical and sequential boundaries of the system, and that the most relevant causes are found at or below the level of the observed failure.
- Evidence anchors: [section 5] "Second, the FBS model explicitly retains hierarchy information, therefore, chunk generation and search could be restricted to failure nodes within the same hierarchical level, effectively reducing the search space."
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks if a failure in one part of the system (e.g., a process element) is primarily caused by a failure in a completely different, non-connected part of the system hierarchy. The search constraint would then eliminate the correct cause from consideration.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Creating graph-based chunks that include both failure and system information provides richer context for vector embeddings
- Mechanism: The inference process generates "chunks" for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In the proposed method, a chunk is not just the text of a failure but a subgraph including the failure node, its causal links (`has Cause`, `has Effect`), and the connected system model nodes (from the FBS model). The entire chunk is converted into a single vector embedding. This creates a more semantically rich representation, encoding not just the failure's text but its structural and causal context.
- Core assumption: The vector embedding model (in this case, `text-embedding-3-small`) can effectively condense the information from this mixed graph-text chunk into a single vector without losing critical distinctions.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.1] "...in the proposed method, chunking is first performed by identifying the failure node at the same hierarchical level with input failures, and then forming a chunk that includes the failure nodes causally related to it, as well as the FBS-model nodes connected to them."
- Break condition: If the embedding model struggles to differentiate between large, complex subgraphs, or if relevant information is "diluted" by less important nodes included in the chunk, the quality of the vector representation degrades, leading to poorer retrieval.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) Framework**
- Why needed here: This is the core paradigm used to organize deep knowledge about the manufacturing system. It defines how to model a system not just by its parts (Structure), but by what those parts do (Behavior) and what the system is ultimately for (Function). Understanding this hierarchy is essential for constructing the model and mapping failures correctly.
- Quick check question: Can you correctly classify a system component (e.g., "a robot's gripper") into one of the five levels of the ontology's functional hierarchy: LineFunction, ProcessFunction, ProcessElementFunction, Behavior, or Structure?

**Concept: Ontology and Knowledge Graphs**
- Why needed here: The method relies on a formal ontology (the Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology) to give machine-readable meaning to data. Understanding concepts like classes (e.g., `Failure`, `System`), properties (e.g., `has Cause`, `has Part`), and instances is necessary to implement the knowledge base and perform queries.
- Quick check question: What is the difference between an ontology and a knowledge graph, and what specific properties would you use in this system to connect a 'motor stall' failure to the 'conveyor belt' structure?

**Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Embeddings**
- Why needed here: This is the inference technique used in the paper's evaluation. You need to understand how text (or in this case, structured graph chunks converted to text) is transformed into vector embeddings and how semantic search uses these vectors to find relevant information for a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an answer.
- Quick check question: How does the chunking strategy in the proposed method differ from the baseline, and what problem does this strategy aim to solve during the retrieval phase of RAG?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
1. **Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology:** The formal schema, defining classes like `System`, `Failure`, and properties like `hasPart`, `hasCause`. Implemented using tools like Protégé.
2. **FBS Model Instances:** The knowledge graph nodes representing the specific manufacturing system (e.g., "Line 1," "Roof Assembly Process," "Robot Chuck"). This is the deep knowledge.
3. **Failure Record Instances:** Nodes representing observed failures, their causes, and effects. Each is linked to an FBS model node via `hasFailure`. This is the shallow knowledge.
4. **Knowledge Graph Database:** Stores all instances and their relationships (e.g., Neo4j).
5. **Inference Module (External):** Uses a chunking strategy to create subgraphs from the knowledge graph, generates vector embeddings for them, and performs RAG to answer failure-cause queries.

**Critical path:**
1. **FBS Model Construction:** Before any operation, experts must model the target system's Function, Behavior, and Structure and load it as instances into the graph database.
2. **Record Linkage:** During operation, every new maintenance record must be correctly linked to the relevant node(s) in the FBS model. This is the crucial step that creates the value.
3. **Chunking for Inference:** When a new failure query is made, the system identifies the relevant FBS node and creates a chunk containing the failure and its connected system context.

**Design tradeoffs:**
- **Single vs. Per-Node Embeddings:** The paper uses a single vector embedding for a graph chunk. This is simpler but risks information dilution. Per-node embeddings with weighted graph traversal could be more precise but are more complex.
- **Modeling Granularity:** The five-level FBS hierarchy is a simplification. More granular modeling might improve precision but dramatically increases the effort required for initial model construction and maintenance.

**Failure signatures:**
- **Inference returns causes from a wrong process:** This suggests the hierarchical constraint is too loose or the embeddings for chunks from different processes are too similar due to shared low-level process elements.
- **Poor recall for new types of failures:** This indicates a lack of historical maintenance records, a problem the method mitigates but does not solve if no structurally similar cases exist.
- **Inference fails to connect structurally similar cases:** This could mean the new failure was linked to the wrong node in the FBS model during data entry.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Validate FBS Model:** Before integrating, test the FBS model with domain experts. Can they correctly and consistently map common failures and system components to the ontology's classes?
2. **Ablation on Chunking Strategy:** Implement two chunking methods: (a) the paper's subgraph chunk, and (b) a simple text-only chunk. Run a set of queries and compare the retrieval results to see if the added structural context improves relevance.
3. **Vocabulary Mismatch Test:** Intentionally create test queries that use different terminology from the stored maintenance records to evaluate if the FBS-linked method improves recall compared to a text-only baseline, mimicking the paper's "Assumed Failure 2" test.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: Can an inference engine utilizing node-level embeddings and hierarchical weighting achieve higher precision than the current subgraph-chunking approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 notes that treating surrounding nodes as a single chunk caused precision drops, and Section 6 explicitly lists the "development of an inference engine with a node-level embeddings" as future work.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation used a generic RAG method that embedded subgraphs as single vectors, leading to false positives when different processes shared similar low-level elements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies on the same dataset comparing the current chunking method against a node-level embedding strategy using Precision@n and Recall@n metrics.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: Does the proposed FBS-based method retain its inference accuracy when scaled to larger, more complex manufacturing systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 6 states the necessity of "validation on larger, more diverse manufacturing systems to confirm generalisability."
- Why unresolved: The study was validated on a single, simplified learning factory (a LEGO car assembly line) with only 168 maintenance records.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results from deploying the ontology on full-scale industrial production lines with higher variability in equipment and failure modes.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: Can a user interface be designed to enable shop-floor engineers to accumulate maintenance records and construct FBS models without extensive ontology expertise?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.4 notes that a dedicated interface has not yet been implemented, and Section 6 lists "a user-friendly interface for shop-floor engineers" as a requirement for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies on specialized tools (Protégé, Python) which are not accessible to non-expert technicians on the production site.
- What evidence would resolve it: Usability studies measuring the time required and error rates of technicians using the new interface to correctly link failures to the FBS model.

## Limitations
- Evaluation used only 2 test failures, which is insufficient for robust validation of a diagnostic system
- LEGO car assembly line domain may not capture the complexity and variability of real industrial systems
- Method requires significant expert effort and domain knowledge for FBS model construction, which may not scale well to larger systems

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The FBS framework provides a structured approach to organizing manufacturing system knowledge
- The hierarchical constraint mechanism (Mechanism 2) is logically sound for reducing search space
- The integration of deep system knowledge with shallow failure knowledge is a valid conceptual approach

**Medium Confidence:**
- The experimental results showing improvement in difficult cases with vocabulary mismatches
- The claim that structured linkage between system and failure knowledge improves inference quality
- The overall effectiveness of the ontology-based approach for knowledge sharing across engineering phases

**Low Confidence:**
- The generalizability of results to industrial-scale manufacturing systems
- The long-term maintenance burden of keeping FBS models and failure mappings current
- The scalability of the approach when dealing with thousands of maintenance records

## Next Checks

1. **Ontology Mapping Consistency Test**: Conduct a controlled study where multiple domain experts independently map a set of common failure descriptions to the FBS model. Measure inter-rater reliability to assess whether the mapping step is feasible and consistent across operators.

2. **Vocabulary Mismatch Stress Test**: Create a systematic test suite with 20+ failures where descriptions are intentionally varied using synonyms, technical vs. colloquial terms, and industry-specific jargon. Compare retrieval performance of the FBS-linked method against a pure text-similarity baseline to quantify the structural advantage.

3. **Incremental Model Evolution Study**: Track the system's performance over time as new failures are added that don't fit existing FBS patterns. Measure how quickly the system adapts to novel failure modes and whether it maintains precision as the knowledge base grows, addressing the scalability concern.
