# StreamingTOM: Streaming Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18269
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18269
- Authors: Xueyi Chen; Keda Tao; Kele Shao; Huan Wang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 15.7× kv-cache compression, 2× faster TTFT, state-of-the-art training-free accuracy (63.8% offline, 55.8% streaming)

## Executive Summary
StreamingTOM addresses the fundamental constraints of streaming video understanding: causality (no future frame access) and accumulation (unbounded token growth over time). Existing methods only compress post-LLM kv-cache while leaving the costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged. StreamingTOM introduces Causal Temporal Reduction (CTR) that processes only a compact subset of tokens per frame instead of all visual tokens, and Online Quantized Memory (OQM) that stores tokens in 4-bit format with bounded active kv-cache. The framework achieves 15.7× kv-cache compression, 1.2× lower peak memory, and 2× faster TTFT while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods.

## Method Summary
StreamingTOM is a two-stage training-free framework that tackles streaming video understanding through Causal Temporal Reduction (CTR) and Online Quantized Memory (OQM). CTR processes each video frame with a fixed budget of 50 tokens by classifying tokens as static or dynamic based on cosine similarity to the previous frame (threshold τ_c=0.9), then selecting the most salient dynamic tokens and clustering static tokens. OQM stores all historical tokens in 4-bit format with on-demand retrieval, maintaining only a bounded active kv-cache of 12k tokens during decoding. The framework achieves causality by making decisions from adjacent frames only, and prevents accumulation by enforcing strict token budgets throughout the stream.

## Key Results
- 15.7× kv-cache compression ratio compared to baseline
- 2× faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) on streaming benchmarks
- State-of-the-art training-free accuracy: 63.8% on offline benchmarks, 55.8%/3.7 on RVS-Ego/RVS-Movie
- 1.2× lower peak GPU memory compared to prior streaming methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
StreamingTOM works by addressing the two fundamental constraints of streaming video understanding simultaneously. The causal temporal reduction ensures decisions are made without future frame access by comparing each frame only to its immediate predecessor, using temporal similarity and token saliency to select the most informative tokens within a fixed budget. The online quantized memory prevents unbounded token accumulation by storing all historical tokens in compact 4-bit format with efficient retrieval mechanisms, keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Together, these mechanisms reduce the prefill cost (which dominates for long videos) while maintaining accuracy through intelligent token selection and efficient storage.

## Foundational Learning

**Cosine Similarity for Temporal Redundancy**: Measures cross-frame token similarity to identify redundant information. Why needed: To classify tokens as static (highly similar to previous frame) or dynamic (novel information). Quick check: Verify similarity scores fall in expected range [0,1] and threshold τ_c=0.9 produces reasonable static/dynamic splits.

**4-bit Quantization with Per-Head Per-Channel Scaling**: Compresses tokens to 4 bits using min-max scaling per head per channel. Why needed: To store historical tokens efficiently while enabling on-demand retrieval. Quick check: Ensure scale = (max-min)/15 and offset = min are computed correctly per head per channel.

**Density-Based Clustering for Static Token Merging**: Groups similar static tokens to meet budget constraints. Why needed: To compress redundant static tokens while preserving their collective information. Quick check: Verify clustering reduces static tokens to exactly k_s while maintaining spatial coherence.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Video frames -> Vision Encoder -> CTR (Temporal Similarity + Saliency + Clustering) -> OQM (Quantization + Storage) -> Active KV Cache -> LLM Decoder

**Critical Path**: Frame processing -> CTR token selection (2-frame window) -> OQM storage/retrieval (bounded 12k tokens) -> LLM decoding with compressed kv-cache

**Design Tradeoffs**: Fixed 50-token budget per frame vs. adaptive allocation; 4-bit quantization vs. higher precision; 2-frame temporal window vs. longer context; all chosen for strict causality and bounded memory at the cost of potential information loss

**Failure Signatures**: Memory grows unbounded (OQM not storing all groups in 4-bit); TTFT unchanged (CTR not applied to prefill stage); Accuracy drops sharply (τ_c threshold too high or clustering too aggressive)

**First Experiments**: 1) Implement CTR with 2-frame window and verify token classification; 2) Add OQM with 4-bit quantization and check compression ratio; 3) Run end-to-end on single video and measure kv-cache size vs baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: Would extending the CTR temporal window beyond 2-frame comparison (e.g., 4-8 frames) improve token selection for slower motion patterns, and what's the efficiency-accuracy trade-off? The paper uses adjacent frames to maintain O(N+G²) complexity but doesn't explore longer windows.

**Open Question 2**: Could content-adaptive parameters (dynamic τ_c or per-frame budget G based on scene complexity) improve performance over fixed settings? The paper applies uniform parameters across diverse benchmarks without exploring adaptation.

**Open Question 3**: Is there an optimal quantization precision between 2-bit and 4-bit for OQM, or could mixed-precision strategies (different levels for static vs dynamic tokens) improve compression-accuracy trade-off? The paper uses uniform 4-bit quantization without exploring intermediate precision levels.

## Limitations
- Fixed hyperparameters (τ_c=0.9, G=50) lack empirical justification for sensitivity to video content
- Unspecified clustering algorithm for static token merging prevents exact reproduction
- No comparison to training-based streaming methods limits state-of-the-art claims
- Assumes 0.5/0.2 fps sampling without addressing temporal aliasing effects

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (95%+): Core architecture and mechanisms are fully specified and reproducible. The causal temporal reduction pipeline and 4-bit quantization scheme are mathematically complete.

**Medium Confidence** (70-95%): Quantitative results are plausible but lack hyperparameter sensitivity analysis. Accuracy claims are supported by training-free method comparisons but not tested against training-based alternatives.

**Low Confidence** (below 70%): Claims about being "first to tackle both constraints" are not rigorously proven. Performance on highly dynamic content is unexplored.

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Run CTR with τ_c values of 0.85, 0.90, and 0.95 on RVS-Ego subset to measure accuracy degradation and memory usage changes.

2. **Quantization Error Measurement**: Compute mean squared error between original FP16 tokens and dequantized 4-bit tokens across all heads/channels for sample video.

3. **Static vs Dynamic Classification Validation**: Implement diagnostic mode counting static/dynamic tokens per frame across test videos to verify 0.9 threshold produces reasonable distributions.
