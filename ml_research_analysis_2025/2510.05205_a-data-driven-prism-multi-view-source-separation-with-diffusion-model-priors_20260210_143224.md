# A Data-Driven Prism: Multi-View Source Separation with Diffusion Model Priors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05205
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05205
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: DDPRISM outperforms existing contrastive MVSS methods with FID scores of 1.57 vs 18.87 for CLVM-VAE on full-resolution MNIST, and achieves state-of-the-art results on galaxy image separation

## Executive Summary
DDPRISM introduces a diffusion-model-based framework for multi-view source separation that learns source priors and posteriors without explicit source assumptions. The method leverages multiple views of linear mixtures to identify distinct source distributions through iterative refinement using expectation-maximization. It demonstrates superior performance on synthetic 1D manifolds, Grassy MNIST, and galaxy image separation tasks, working effectively with incomplete, noisy data across varying resolutions.

## Method Summary
DDPRISM uses a diffusion-model-based EM framework to learn source priors and sample from joint posteriors in multi-view source separation. Given multiple views of linear mixtures with known mixing matrices, it trains independent diffusion models for each source through alternating E-steps (joint posterior sampling via MMPS) and M-steps (diffusion model updates). The method employs variance-exploding SDEs with Karras preconditioning, U-Net denoisers with attention for images, and achieves posterior sampling through the decomposition of prior and likelihood scores.

## Key Results
- Outperforms CLVM-VAE with FID of 1.57 vs 18.87 on full-resolution MNIST
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on galaxy image separation task
- Maintains performance with incomplete, noisy data across varying resolutions (FID=2.36 on downsampled GMNIST vs 1008.0 for CLVM-VAE)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-View Linear Decomposition
Linearly independent mixtures from multiple views provide sufficient constraints to identify distinct source distributions without observing any source in isolation. Given observations $y_\alpha = \sum_\beta A_{\alpha\beta} x_\beta + \eta_\alpha$ from multiple views $\alpha$, if mixing matrices $A_{\alpha\beta}$ differ sufficiently across views, the joint posterior over sources becomes identifiable even when each source appears in every observation.

### Mechanism 2: Diffusion Models as Expressive Bayesian Priors
Score-based diffusion models can capture complex, multimodal source distributions that parametric priors cannot, enabling high-fidelity posterior sampling through the posterior score formulation. Diffusion models learn to approximate $\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t)$ via denoising score matching, and for posterior sampling, the score is decomposed: $\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t|y) = \nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t) + \nabla_{x_t} \log p(y|x_t)$.

### Mechanism 3: Expectation-Maximization for Joint Source Prior Learning
Iteratively refining source estimates via posterior sampling and diffusion model updates enables learning all source priors simultaneously without labeled training data. The MCEM loop alternates between (E-step) sampling from the joint posterior $q_{\Theta_k}(\{x_\beta\}|y_\alpha, \{A_{\alpha\beta}\})$ using current diffusion models and (M-step) updating each source's diffusion model parameters $\theta_\beta$ by maximizing the expected log-likelihood over posterior samples.

## Foundational Learning

- **Score-based diffusion models (SDEs, denoising score matching, reverse sampling)**: Core engine for learning and sampling from source priors; understanding the reverse SDE and posterior score composition is essential for E-step implementation.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why Tweedie's formula enables converting a denoiser output $E[x_0|x_t]$ to the score $\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t)$?

- **Expectation-Maximization with latent variables**: Framework for iteratively learning priors without ground-truth sources; distinguishes E-step (posterior inference) from M-step (parameter update).
  - Quick check: In the MCEM setting, why does the M-step use samples from the posterior rather than integrating over the latent distribution?

- **Linear algebra for multivariate Gaussian inference (Woodbury identity, conjugate gradients)**: MMPS requires solving for the likelihood score without materializing the full Jacobian; vector-Jacobian products and conjugate gradient solvers are critical for scalability.
  - Quick check: How does the Woodbury identity help when inverting $\Sigma_y + A V[x_0|x_t] A^T$ in high dimensions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data loader -> Diffusion models -> E-step sampler -> M-step trainer -> Initialization module -> Metrics
- **Critical path**: 1) Prepare multi-view dataset with known mixing matrices (verify linear independence for identifiability). 2) Initialize source priors via Gaussian EM (32 laps for GMNIST). 3) Train initial diffusion models on Gaussian posterior samples. 4) EM loop: For each view batch, sample joint posterior (E-step), then update each source's diffusion model (M-step). 5) Monitor metrics (FID, PSNR) on held-out observations; stop when convergence plateaus. 6) For inference, sample from $p(\{x_\beta\}|y_\alpha, \{A_{\alpha\beta}\})$ using trained diffusion models.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Joint vs. sequential (simplified contrastive) training: Joint uses all information but scales linearly with sources; sequential discards later-view info for source $\beta$ but reduces compute. Gibbs vs. joint posterior sampling: Gibbs requires many more rounds for complex distributions; joint is more efficient but requires careful gradient computation. U-Net depth vs. MLP: U-Net essential for image data (FID=1.57 vs. 49.03 with MLP); MLP sufficient for 1D manifolds. PC steps vs. quality: 256 steps default; 16 steps degrade FID to 5.41; 1024 steps improve slightly.
- **Failure signatures**: Mode collapse or blurry priors: Likely insufficient EM laps, poor initialization, or too few PC steps. Sources not separated (residual mixing in posteriors): Check mixing matrix identifiability; ensure sufficient view diversity. Training divergence: Gradient clipping (1.0 norm), learning rate scheduling (cosine decay), and EMA (0.999) stabilize training. Slow convergence on later sources: Expected; later sources have less independent signal.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce 1D manifold contrastive MVSS: Use MLP denoiser, 3 sources, 2^16 samples per view, 16-64 EM laps. Verify posterior Sinkhorn divergence decreases with EM laps. 2) Ablate PC steps on GMNIST: Train full-resolution model with 16, 64, 256, 1024 steps. Confirm FID degrades at 16 steps and plateaus beyond 256. 3) Test downsampled GMNIST: Train with 1/3 full-res, 1/3 2x downsampled, 1/3 4x downsampled. Verify DDPRISM maintains performance (FID=2.36) while baselines struggle (CLVM-VAE FID=1008.0).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can DDPRISM be extended to handle nonlinear source mixing processes such as occlusion, and would such extensions require fundamental architectural changes or modified training objectives? The authors state it is restricted to linear source combinations, which excludes nonlinear generative processes like occlusion. Nonlinear mixing would break the analytic likelihood score derivation that relies on linear Gaussian convolutions.

### Open Question 2
Can the requirement for exact mixing matrix knowledge be relaxed to handle probabilistic mixing matrices with associated uncertainties? The current formulation uses A in the analytic likelihood score computation; uncertain mixing would require marginalizing over mixing matrix distributions, adding computational complexity to an already expensive sampling process.

### Open Question 3
What computational or algorithmic improvements could reduce the sampling cost bottleneck to enable higher-resolution and larger-dataset applications? The method requires iterative joint posterior sampling across all sources within each EM iteration, with current ablation showing 256 PC steps are needed for optimal performance.

## Limitations
- Computational constraints: Expensive posterior sampling (16-16384 PC steps) limits resolution and dataset size
- Problem scope restriction: Assumes linear mixing with known matrices, excluding blind source separation
- Resource requirements: High-resolution applications require extensive sampling and large model capacity

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Linear decomposition mechanism is well-supported by formal problem statement and identifiability analysis
- **Medium Confidence**: Diffusion model prior learning has strong theoretical grounding but depends on accurate posterior score approximation
- **Medium Confidence**: EM framework for joint source learning follows established methodology but may be sensitive to hyperparameter choices

## Next Checks

1. **Mixing Matrix Sensitivity**: Test DDPRISM performance across varying degrees of mixing matrix orthogonality and similarity using synthetic data with controlled mixing matrix parameters to measure identifiability thresholds.

2. **Noise Distribution Robustness**: Evaluate performance under non-Gaussian noise distributions (Laplacian, heavy-tailed) and with unknown noise parameters, comparing against ArrayDPS to quantify tradeoffs.

3. **Scalability Benchmarking**: Measure training and inference time scaling with image resolution (32x32 to 256x256) and dataset size (1k to 100k samples) to establish practical resolution limits.
