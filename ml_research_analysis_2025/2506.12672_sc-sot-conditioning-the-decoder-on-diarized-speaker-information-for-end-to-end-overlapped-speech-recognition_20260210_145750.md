# SC-SOT: Conditioning the Decoder on Diarized Speaker Information for End-to-End Overlapped Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12672
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12672
- Authors: Yuta Hirano; Sakriani Sakti

- This paper proposes SC-SOT, achieving up to 9.5% relative WER reduction on Libri2Mix and 10.4% on Libri3Mix by conditioning the decoder on diarized speaker information.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of end-to-end overlapped speech recognition using Serialized Output Training (SOT). The authors analyze how SOT implicitly handles speaker separation and find it often insufficient due to ambiguous acoustic cues. To improve this, they propose Speaker-Conditioned Serialized Output Training (SC-SOT), which explicitly conditions the decoder on speaker information from a jointly trained speaker diarization module. SC-SOT incorporates speaker embeddings to focus on target speaker characteristics and speaker activity information to suppress non-target speakers.

## Method Summary
The authors propose Speaker-Conditioned Serialized Output Training (SC-SOT) to improve end-to-end overlapped speech recognition. SC-SOT conditions the decoder on speaker information obtained from a jointly trained speaker diarization module. The approach uses speaker embeddings to capture target speaker characteristics and speaker activity information to suppress non-target speakers. This explicit conditioning addresses the limitations of conventional SOT, which often struggles with ambiguous acoustic cues in overlapped speech scenarios.

## Key Results
- SC-SOT achieves up to 9.5% relative WER reduction on Libri2Mix compared to conventional SOT
- SC-SOT achieves up to 10.4% relative WER reduction on Libri3Mix compared to conventional SOT
- The proposed method demonstrates effectiveness of conditioning the decoder with diarized speaker information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind SC-SOT's success lies in its explicit conditioning of the decoder with diarized speaker information. By incorporating speaker embeddings, the model can focus on the characteristics of the target speaker, effectively separating their speech from overlapping sources. The speaker activity information helps suppress non-target speakers, reducing ambiguity in the acoustic signal. This approach addresses the limitations of conventional SOT, which relies on implicit speaker separation that can be insufficient due to ambiguous acoustic cues in overlapped speech.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Serialized Output Training (SOT)**: A method for end-to-end speech recognition that processes speech and text sequences serially. Why needed: To handle overlapped speech by explicitly modeling speaker turns. Quick check: Verify that the model can distinguish between speakers in overlapped regions.

2. **Speaker Diarization**: The process of partitioning an input audio stream into homogeneous segments according to the speaker identity. Why needed: To provide speaker-specific information for conditioning the decoder. Quick check: Ensure the diarization module accurately identifies speaker turns and boundaries.

3. **Speaker Embeddings**: Fixed-dimensional representations of speaker characteristics learned from audio. Why needed: To capture unique features of each speaker for better separation. Quick check: Confirm that embeddings are distinct for different speakers and consistent for the same speaker across different utterances.

4. **Attention Mechanisms**: Techniques that allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. Why needed: To dynamically incorporate speaker information during decoding. Quick check: Verify that attention weights align with speaker turns in the input audio.

5. **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**: Architectures that convert input sequences to output sequences, often used in speech recognition. Why needed: To model the mapping from audio to text in overlapped speech scenarios. Quick check: Ensure the model can handle variable-length input and output sequences effectively.

## Architecture Onboarding

             Speaker Diarization Module

**Critical Path:**
The critical path in SC-SOT involves the integration of speaker information into the decoding process. Audio input is first processed by the encoder, then passed to the decoder. Simultaneously, the speaker diarization module processes the audio to extract speaker embeddings and activity information. These speaker-specific features are then incorporated into the decoder's attention mechanism, allowing it to focus on the target speaker's speech while suppressing others.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- **Joint Training vs. Separate Modules**: The paper opts for jointly training the speaker diarization module with the main model, which may improve coordination but could also introduce complexity in optimization.
- **Fixed vs. Adaptive Speaker Embeddings**: Using fixed speaker embeddings simplifies the model but may limit adaptability to varying acoustic conditions.
- **Explicit vs. Implicit Speaker Separation**: SC-SOT explicitly conditions on speaker information, which adds computational overhead but significantly improves recognition accuracy.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor diarization accuracy leading to incorrect speaker embeddings or activity information
- Over-reliance on speaker information causing degradation in scenarios with frequent speaker changes
- Inability to handle more than three overlapping speakers effectively

**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate SC-SOT on Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix to establish baseline performance
2. Conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of speaker embeddings and activity information separately
3. Test the model's performance on non-overlapping speech to ensure it doesn't degrade general ASR performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains are demonstrated only on synthetic mixtures (Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix) from the LibriSpeech corpus, raising questions about generalizability to real-world conversational speech
- The paper does not systematically quantify when and why SOT's implicit speaker separation is insufficient across different overlap scenarios
- Reliance on a jointly trained speaker diarization module introduces potential error propagation that is not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The proposed SC-SOT architecture and its integration with speaker embeddings and activity information is technically sound and well-explained
- **Medium confidence**: The relative WER improvements (9.5% on Libri2Mix, 10.4% on Libri3Mix) are reported but lack statistical significance testing and comparison against more recent competitive approaches
- **Low confidence**: Claims about SOT's "implicit" handling of speaker separation are somewhat speculative without comprehensive error analysis across different overlap types

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SC-SOT on real conversational datasets (e.g., CHiME-5, AMI) with varying acoustic conditions and overlapping patterns to assess real-world robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of speaker embeddings versus speaker activity information in the observed performance gains
3. Analyze error propagation by measuring SC-SOT performance as a function of diarization module accuracy across different speaker overlap configurations
