# Man-Made Heuristics Are Dead. Long Live Code Generators!

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08803
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08803
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: PolicySmith discovers heuristics that outperform 14 established baselines on real traces, with instance-optimal policies improving hit rates by 2% over manual oracles.

## Executive Summary
PolicySmith automates the generation of system heuristics using LLMs and evolutionary search, eliminating manual design. Given a policy template and evaluation context, it synthesizes optimized code for specific workloads, hardware, and objectives. Applied to web caching, it discovers heuristics that outperform 14 established baselines on real traces, with instance-optimal policies improving hit rates by 2% over manual oracles. In Linux congestion control, PolicySmith generates safe, compilable eBPF code that achieves up to 98% bandwidth utilization, demonstrating feasibility in safety-critical systems. The approach reduces manual effort, improves performance, and enables dynamic policy adaptation as contexts shift.

## Method Summary
PolicySmith uses an iterative search loop where an LLM generates candidate heuristics based on a policy template, the candidates are evaluated in a simulated context, and top performers are fed back as examples for the next generation. The system separates decision logic from state management in its templates, allowing the LLM to focus on generating smaller, more self-contained code blocks. For kernel deployment, generated code is compiled as eBPF programs that pass through the eBPF verifier for safety checks before execution.

## Key Results
- Discovers heuristics that outperform 14 established baselines on real traces
- Instance-optimal policies improve hit rates by 2% over manual oracles
- Generates safe, compilable eBPF code achieving up to 98% bandwidth utilization in Linux congestion control

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** LLM-guided evolutionary search can discover heuristics that outperform established baselines for specific contexts.
- **Mechanism:** The system generates candidate heuristics using an LLM, evaluates them against context-specific workloads, and feeds top performers back as examples for the next generation—gradually steering toward better code.
- **Core assumption:** The search space contains high-performing heuristics reachable through iterative refinement from seed examples.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "PolicySmith discovers heuristics that outperform 14 established baselines on real traces"
  - [section 4.2.3] "All heuristics produced by PolicySmith either match or outperform all 14 baselines for their original context"
- **Break condition:** If the template restricts the search space too narrowly, or if the LLM fails to generate syntactically valid code that passes the Checker, the evolutionary loop stalls.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Separating decision logic from state management in the Template design improves generation success rates
- **Mechanism:** By isolating the policy logic from state handling, the LLM only needs to generate smaller, self-contained code blocks that fit into predefined interfaces, reducing the complexity of each generation task.
- **Core assumption:** Smaller code generation tasks are more likely to succeed than full system implementations.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2] "PolicySmith templates separate the management of the underlying state from the decision logic, allowing the LLM to focus on generating smaller, more self-contained code blocks"
  - [section 4.2.1] The template approach enables successful generation of both web caching and Linux congestion control heuristics
- **Break condition:** If the template abstraction leaks implementation details that the LLM must guess, or if the interface constraints are too rigid to express optimal policies.

## Foundational Learning
- Learned: Automated heuristic generation using LLMs and evolutionary search can discover policies that outperform 14 established baselines in web caching
- Learned: Generated eBPF code can achieve 98% bandwidth utilization in Linux congestion control
- Learned: Template-based separation of decision logic from state management improves generation success rates
- Open question: The evaluation focuses on specific domains (web caching, congestion control) without exploring generalizability to other heuristic design problems

## Architecture Onboarding
- Key concept: PolicySmith uses a template-based approach where the LLM generates decision logic code that plugs into predefined interfaces for state management
- Key concept: The system employs an iterative evolutionary search loop with LLM-guided candidate generation and context-based evaluation
- Key concept: Generated code for Linux kernel deployment is compiled as eBPF programs that pass through the eBPF verifier for safety checks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the report body

## Limitations
- The approach requires domain-specific templates to be designed manually
- Evaluation is limited to web caching and Linux congestion control scenarios
- The effectiveness depends on the quality of the evaluation context and the LLM's ability to generate syntactically valid code

## Confidence
- Reason: The report body presents specific quantitative results (2% improvement over oracles, 98% bandwidth utilization) with clear mechanisms and assumptions
- Reason: Multiple evidence anchors are provided for each mechanism claim, linking to specific sections of the source paper
- Strength: Strong - The report body provides comprehensive coverage of the method, results, and mechanisms with supporting evidence
