# Neural Reasoning for Robust Instance Retrieval in $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.20457
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20457
- **Reference count:** 37
- **Primary result:** EBR outperforms symbolic reasoners on noisy and incomplete data while maintaining perfect accuracy on complete datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EBR, a neural reasoner that uses knowledge graph embeddings to perform robust instance retrieval in expressive description logics (SHOIQ). Unlike symbolic reasoners, EBR can handle inconsistencies and incompleteness in real-world knowledge bases. The approach maps DL concepts to neural interpretations using a knowledge graph embedding model (ComplEx with 128 dimensions). Experiments on six datasets show that EBR outperforms symbolic reasoners on noisy and incomplete data, achieving perfect Jaccard similarity on complete datasets. When integrated with concept learning frameworks, EBR maintained stable F1-scores across all learners, even on inconsistent knowledge bases where traditional reasoners failed.

## Method Summary
EBR converts Description Logic axioms into knowledge graph triples and trains ComplEx embeddings on these triples. The system maps TBox and ABox axioms to RDF triples, then uses the trained embeddings to predict instance membership probabilities. Complex concept retrieval is achieved through compositional set-theoretic operations on the neural predictions of atomic concepts, rather than tableau-based reasoning. The approach provides probabilistic outputs that are robust to logical inconsistencies that would cause symbolic reasoners to fail.

## Key Results
- EBR achieves perfect Jaccard similarity on complete datasets while symbolic reasoners maintain near-perfect scores
- On noisy and incomplete data, EBR maintains high Jaccard similarity while symbolic reasoners drop to 0.0
- When integrated with concept learning frameworks, EBR maintained stable F1-scores across all learners on inconsistent knowledge bases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** EBR approximates logical inference by converting Description Logic (DL) axioms into a link prediction task on a Knowledge Graph (KG).
- **Mechanism:** The system maps TBox and ABox axioms into RDF triples and trains a Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model to learn vector representations. Instance retrieval is performed by predicting truth probabilities of triples using a sigmoid function on embedding scores.
- **Core assumption:** Geometric relations in the continuous vector space preserve symbolic semantics well enough to infer missing assertions.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "Our reasoner relies on embeddings to approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner"; Section 3.1 defines DL to triple mapping; Section 3.2 defines scoring mechanism.
- **Break condition:** If embedding dimension $d$ is too low ($d < 64$), vectors lack capacity to encode complex hierarchies, causing accuracy to drop significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Complex concept retrieval is achieved via compositional set-theoretic operations rather than tableau-based reasoning.
- **Mechanism:** EBR retrieves instances for atomic parts using neural predictor, then computes intersections/unions of these sets. Table 2 formalizes this as "Neural Semantics," mapping logical constructors directly to set operations.
- **Core assumption:** Atomic predictions are sufficiently accurate that errors do not compound destructively when combined.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "solely requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts... to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept"; Table 2 explicitly maps logical constructors to set-theoretic operations.
- **Break condition:** Performance degrades if approximations for universal restrictions ($\forall r.C$) amplify noise in sparse graphs.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The probabilistic nature of the output provides robustness against logical inconsistencies that cause symbolic reasoners to fail.
- **Mechanism:** Symbolic reasoners adhere to the principle of explosion: a single contradiction renders the entire KB unusable. EBR assigns soft probabilities and returns a "best guess" set of instances rather than crashing.
- **Core assumption:** True facts in training data significantly outnumber contradictions, allowing the model to learn a manifold that ignores noise.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states "EBR is robust against inconsistencies and incompleteness... where traditional reasoners failed"; Figure 2 shows symbolic reasoners dropping to 0.0 Jaccard similarity with noise while EBR maintains high scores.
- **Break condition:** If noise is systematic and forms a coherent "false" structure in the graph, embeddings may learn incorrect logic, leading to high-confidence false positives.

## Foundational Learning

**Description Logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$**
- **Why needed here:** This is the input language. Understanding components (ABox vs. TBox, Nominals, Inverse Roles) is required to understand how the paper maps them to triples.
- **Quick check question:** Can you identify which part of the axiom $\exists \text{hasChild}. \text{Female} \sqsubseteq \text{Parent}$ represents the TBox schema and which represents the logical constructor?

**Knowledge Graph Embeddings (ComplEx)**
- **Why needed here:** EBR uses ComplEx specifically. You must understand that this model uses complex-valued vectors to capture asymmetric relations, crucial for the link prediction task.
- **Quick check question:** Why would a simple translational model like TransE fail to capture the hierarchical semantics of a TBox compared to ComplEx?

**Jaccard Similarity**
- **Why needed here:** This is the primary evaluation metric. It measures overlap between retrieved instances and ground truth.
- **Quick check question:** If EBR retrieves 10 instances and ground truth has 12, with 8 overlapping, what is the Jaccard similarity? (Answer: $8 / (10+12-8) = 8/14 \approx 0.57$).

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Ontology Parser -> Triple Converter -> KGE Trainer -> Neural Predictor -> Set Composer

**Critical path:** The Triple Converter is the most fragile component. If role inclusion axioms or inverse roles are not correctly materialized into triples before training, the embedding model will never learn those inferential links.

**Design tradeoffs:** The system trades logical certainty for robustness. It abandons formal guarantees of OWL reasoners to function on messy, real-world data where symbolic reasoners would simply crash.

**Failure signatures:**
- **Silent Logic Failure:** EBR returns a result with high confidence, but the set composition is logically invalid due to embedding drift.
- **Performance Cliff:** Retrieval accuracy for conjunctions ($C \sqcap D$) is near 0 while atomic retrieval is high, indicating the threshold $\gamma$ is poorly calibrated.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. **Dimensionality Validation:** Reproduce Figure 1 on a small dataset (e.g., Family) to verify that $d=128$ is indeed sufficient to reach Jaccard $\approx 1.0$.
2. **Noise Robustness Check:** Inject 5% random false triples into the training set of the Mutagenesis dataset and confirm that EBR maintains $>0.8$ Jaccard similarity while the baseline Pellet reasoner fails.
3. **Ablation on Constructors:** Test retrieval specifically on Universal Restrictions ($\forall r.C$) vs. Existential Restrictions ($\exists r.C$) to verify if the approximation via negation holds up effectively.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability remains untested at web-scale; experiments used only modest datasets (largest with 46,893 triples)
- Handling of nominals and complex cardinality restrictions is only briefly addressed, with implementation details deferred to future work
- Claims about reasoning with "expressivity of SHOIQ" are partially speculative as full implementation is not provided

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Core claim that EBR outperforms symbolic reasoners on noisy/incomplete data is well-supported by Figure 2 showing clear performance gaps.

**Medium Confidence:** Assertion that performance is "robust to the choice of γ" lacks specific validation across multiple threshold values.

**Low Confidence:** Claims about reasoning with "expressivity of SHOIQ" are partially speculative due to deferred implementation details.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Test:** Run EBR on a dataset with 1M+ triples to verify the claim of scalability beyond the reported benchmarks.

2. **Threshold Sensitivity:** Systematically vary γ (0.3, 0.5, 0.7) on at least two datasets to empirically verify the robustness claim.

3. **Stress Test on Contradictions:** Create a synthetic ontology with controlled contradictions (e.g., 20% of assertions violate disjointness axioms) to measure EBR's degradation compared to symbolic reasoners.
