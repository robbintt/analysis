# Human Guided Learning of Transparent Regression Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15992
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15992
- Reference count: 26
- Human-in-the-loop regression on permutation data outperforms complex neural baselines on small datasets while maintaining transparency

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HuGuR, a human-in-the-loop approach for transparent regression on permutation data. The method converts permutation structures into binary features based on order constraints and uses gradient boosting to build a linear model. Users can interactively refine the model by adding, removing, or refining constraints while coefficients are computed in real-time. In a user study with 21 participants, HuGuR models outperformed all baselines on small datasets and performed on par with complex neural networks while maintaining interpretability through at least one order of magnitude fewer parameters.

## Method Summary
HuGuR is a gradient boosted regression model that operates on binary features derived from order constraints in permutations. The algorithm starts with a base prediction (mean of training targets) and iteratively selects constraints using the Gauss-Southwell rule to maximize residual reduction. Each constraint is represented as a binary feature indicating whether a specific ordering relationship exists in the permutation. Users can interactively refine the model by expanding constraints, removing them, or resetting the model. The system computes coefficients in real-time based on gradients, allowing immediate visualization of constraint impact. The method was tested on 9 datasets including educational data and classifier chains, comparing against naive prediction, one-hot encoding with MLP, graph encoding, and LSTM-based sequence encoding.

## Key Results
- HuGuR outperformed all baselines on small datasets and matched complex neural network performance overall
- Best five user-built models achieved particularly strong results, demonstrating the value of human guidance
- HuGuR models had at least one order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters than neural network baselines
- Higher learning rates and more constraints per step correlated with better performance
- On larger datasets, machine-induced models began to outperform human-guided models, suggesting scalability limits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Converting permutation structures into binary features based on order constraints allows a linear gradient boosting model to capture complex dependencies.
- **Mechanism**: The system maps a permutation (e.g., `[3, 2, 1]`) to a binary vector indicating the presence of specific order constraints (e.g., `2 < 1`). A gradient boosting algorithm iteratively selects the constraint that most reduces the residual error (Gauss-Southwell selection), effectively building a linear combination of simple, human-readable rules.
- **Core assumption**: The target variable depends primarily on the relative ordering of items rather than absolute positions, and these dependencies can be approximated by a sum of independent constraint contributions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "...incorporates simple human-understandable constraints of the form x < y... as binary features."
  - [section 2.2]: "We base our approach on a gradient boosted regression model on simple binary features... calculate the coefficient... using the constraint's gradient... and calculate the new residuals."
  - [corpus]: Corpus neighbors focus on recommendation and generic LLM tasks; they do not offer direct evidence for this specific permutation-to-binary mechanism.
- **Break condition**: If the target function relies on long-range positional interactions (e.g., "item A at index 1 implies X, but only if item B is at index 5") that cannot be decomposed into independent order constraints.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interaction acts as a heuristic search optimization, improving sample efficiency on small datasets.
- **Mechanism**: The algorithm proposes constraints based on statistical gradients, but the user retains veto power and refinement control. By allowing users to expand a constraint (e.g., `A < B` $\to$ `A < C < B`) or remove noise, the system leverages human intuition to prune the search space and correct algorithmic myopia that might occur with limited training samples.
- **Core assumption**: Users can identify meaningful patterns or correct errors faster than the automated search can converge, particularly when training data is sparse.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Users can interactively refine the model... On small datasets, HuGuR outperformed all baselines."
  - [section 4.2]: "HuGuR outperforms all other methods... on small data sets... The best five user-built models achieved particularly strong results."
  - [corpus]: Corpus evidence regarding this specific HIL mechanism is weak; related papers discuss human guidance in recommendation but not permutation regression.
- **Break condition**: If the user lacks domain expertise or if the signal-to-noise ratio is too low for human pattern recognition, intervention may introduce bias or fail to improve upon the automated baseline.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Restricting the hypothesis space to sparse, transparent order constraints acts as a strong regularizer against overfitting.
- **Mechanism**: Unlike deep learning models (LSTM/MLP) that learn dense, distributed representations with thousands of parameters, HuGuR models are linear combinations of a limited set of constraints. This structural constraint limits model capacity, which prevents overfitting on small datasets but may restrict expressiveness on larger ones.
- **Core assumption**: The "true" model underlying the data is relatively sparse and can be described by a small number of key orderings.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "HuGuR models had at least one order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters... enhancing interpretability."
  - [section 4.2]: "On larger datasets... machine-induced models begin to outperform the user-built models."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus validation for this specific regularization argument in permutation regression.
- **Break condition**: If the dataset size grows significantly such that the complexity of the true function exceeds the capacity of the sparse linear model, deep learning baselines will likely dominate.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Gradient Boosting Regression**
  - **Why needed here**: This is the core engine of HuGuR. Understanding how it iteratively fits residuals by adding "weak learners" (here, single constraints) is essential to grasp how the model is built step-by-step.
  - **Quick check question**: How does adding a new constraint with a specific coefficient reduce the global prediction error in a greedy manner?

- **Concept**: **Permutation Encoding**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper compares multiple ways to feed ordered data into a model. Distinguishing between positional encodings (One-Hot), structural encodings (Graph), and the paper's semantic encoding (Constraints) is critical.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does a binary feature representing "Item A appears before Item B" provide different information than a feature representing "Item A is at index 1"?

- **Concept**: **Interactive Machine Learning (Human-in-the-Loop)**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper's unique selling point is the interaction loop. You must understand the trade-off between algorithmic optimization and human guidance to evaluate the results.
  - **Quick check question**: In the context of this paper, does the human set the weights (coefficients) or the features (constraints)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Ingestion -> Initial Constraint Generation -> User Decision Point (Accept/Refine/Reset) -> Coefficient Update -> Validation Feedback
- **Critical path**: Data Ingestion $\to$ Initial Constraint Generation $\to$ **User Decision Point (Accept/Refine/Reset)** $\to$ Coefficient Update $\to$ Validation Feedback
- **Design tradeoffs**: The system trades off the raw predictive power of deep learning (high capacity, black box) for the interpretability and controllability of a linear model (low capacity, transparent). The architecture prioritizes real-time interaction latency (calculating coefficients "on the fly") over offline batch processing speed.
- **Failure signatures**:
  1. **Stagnation**: Validation error stops decreasing despite user refinement, suggesting the constraint vocabulary is insufficient for the target
  2. **Overfitting Loop**: Users chase noise in the validation set, creating overly complex models that fail on the test set
  3. **Scalability Ceiling**: On the "large" datasets mentioned, the method fails to converge to the performance of neural baselines
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline Replication**: Implement the "Naive" and "One-Hot + MLP" baselines on the `edm_5_small` dataset to establish a performance floor
  2. **Ablation on Interaction**: Run HuGuR in "auto-pilot" (pure gradient boosting without user input) vs. "guided" mode to quantify the specific contribution of the human-in-the-loop
  3. **Scalability Limit Identification**: Incrementally increase dataset size (from `small` to `large` splits) to pinpoint exactly where the LSTM baseline begins to outperform the transparent HuGuR model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can the HuGuR scheme be effectively adapted for other structured pattern domains such as strings, sequences, trees, or graphs?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly identifies transferring the scheme to these specific pattern domains as a primary objective for future work.
- **Why unresolved**: The current work only instantiates the framework for permutation regression using specific order constraints.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A modified HuGuR implementation applied to sequence or graph data that maintains transparency while achieving competitive regression accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How does the process of interactively building a model influence the user's trust in the model compared to conventional black-box approaches?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The abstract and conclusion state that future work will study the degree of trust users place in models they construct themselves.
- **Why unresolved**: The current evaluation focuses strictly on predictive performance (MAE, $R^2$) rather than subjective metrics like user confidence or trust.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A follow-up user study utilizing trust measurement scales to compare HuGuR users against those using standard neural network tools.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: At what specific dataset size threshold do machine-induced models consistently outperform human-guided regression?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The authors observe that machine-induced models "begin to outperform" user-built models on larger datasets, implying a scalability boundary that was not strictly defined.
- **Why unresolved**: The study evaluated fixed "small" and "large" splits but did not characterize the exact point where human guidance ceases to be the dominant factor for performance.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A parameter sweep over varying training set sizes to identify the precise data volume where automated baselines definitively surpass HuGuR.

## Limitations
- The coefficient calculation formula for gradient boosting remains unspecified, with only a general description of using the constraint's gradient
- No clear guidance on pruning bounds for constraint search, despite mention of hierarchical structure exploitation
- Limited validation of the human-in-the-loop mechanism, as corpus evidence is weak and the ablation study comparing guided vs automated models is not performed
- Unclear whether performance improvements on small datasets stem from better model selection or simply from avoiding overfitting through constrained hypothesis space

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The transparent linear model architecture with interpretable constraints is correctly implemented and performs as described
- **Medium confidence**: The comparative results against neural baselines, particularly the parameter efficiency claim
- **Low confidence**: The specific contribution of human guidance to performance improvements, as this mechanism lacks direct validation

## Next Checks
1. Implement the ablation study comparing pure gradient boosting (no user intervention) against human-guided mode to isolate the HIL contribution
2. Run coefficient calculation with multiple plausible formulations (e.g., β = τ/n, β = τ/||Z||²) to verify sensitivity to this unspecified parameter
3. Systematically increase dataset size to identify the precise point where neural baselines begin to outperform the transparent model, testing the scalability claims
