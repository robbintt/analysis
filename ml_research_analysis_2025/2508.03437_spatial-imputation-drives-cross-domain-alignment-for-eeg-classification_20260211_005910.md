# Spatial Imputation Drives Cross-Domain Alignment for EEG Classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.03437
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03437
- **Authors:** Hongjun Liu; Chao Yao; Yalan Zhang; Xiaokun wang; Xiaojuan Ban
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** IMAC achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain EEG classification, outperforming baselines by up to 35% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent accuracy across heterogeneous electrode configurations.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of EEG signal classification under cross-domain distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies. The authors propose IMAC, a novel self-supervised framework that formulates cross-domain alignment as a spatial time series imputation task. IMAC introduces channel-dependent masking and reconstruction, simulating cross-domain variations like channel omissions and temporal instabilities to enable robust signal alignment during inference.

## Method Summary
IMAC introduces a self-supervised framework that formulates cross-domain alignment as a spatial time series imputation task. The method employs channel-dependent masking and reconstruction, simulating cross-domain variations like channel omissions and temporal instabilities. The architecture incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models temporal and spatial information, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility. During inference, the model uses the trained encoder to map target EEG signals to a shared latent space for classification, achieving robust cross-domain performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios
- Surpasses baseline methods by up to 35% in integrity scores under distribution shifts
- Demonstrates strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core innovation lies in transforming cross-domain alignment into a spatial imputation problem. By masking and reconstructing missing channels, IMAC learns to handle heterogeneous electrode configurations and acquisition protocols. The disentangled architecture separates temporal and spatial processing, allowing the model to focus on domain-invariant features while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-domain EEG classification**: Needed to handle distribution shifts between different EEG datasets; quick check: evaluate performance on datasets with different electrode configurations
- **Self-supervised learning**: Required for training without labeled cross-domain data; quick check: verify performance with and without pre-training
- **Spatial imputation**: Core mechanism for handling missing channels; quick check: test with different masking ratios
- **Disentangled architecture**: Separates temporal and spatial processing; quick check: compare with end-to-end models

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Raw EEG -> Temporal Encoder -> Spatial Encoder -> Imputation Module -> Classification Head

**Critical path:**
Temporal processing → Spatial alignment → Imputation reconstruction → Feature extraction → Classification

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Disentangled architecture reduces complexity but may lose some cross-domain temporal patterns
- Self-supervised pre-training improves generalization but requires additional computational resources
- Channel-dependent masking handles real-world variations but increases model complexity

**Failure signatures:**
- Poor performance on datasets with extreme channel variations
- Overfitting to specific electrode configurations
- Degraded accuracy when temporal patterns are highly domain-specific

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Evaluate performance with varying masking ratios (10%-50%)
2. Test on datasets with known electrode configuration differences
3. Compare with end-to-end models using the same pre-training data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational complexity analysis is limited, focusing on memory efficiency rather than comprehensive runtime comparisons
- Evaluation primarily relies on simulated variations and cross-center validation rather than extensive real-world deployment scenarios
- Lacks detailed analysis of how different masking strategies affect performance

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Core methodology and experimental design regarding spatial imputation framework

**Medium confidence:**
- Computational efficiency claims due to limited benchmarking
- Robustness claims under real-world distribution shifts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive runtime benchmarking across different hardware configurations to validate computational efficiency claims
2. Test the model on additional clinical EEG datasets with known domain shifts to assess real-world robustness
3. Perform ablation studies on different masking strategies and channel configurations to understand their impact on model performance
