# TTSDS2: Resources and Benchmark for Evaluating Human-Quality Text to Speech Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.19441
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19441
- Reference count: 40
- TTSDS2 achieves average Spearman correlation ρ > 0.67 with human MOS, CMOS, and SMOS ratings across 4 speech domains and 14 languages

## Executive Summary
TTSDS2 is a multi-dimensional distributional similarity metric for evaluating text-to-speech systems that correlates strongly with human perceptual ratings across diverse domains and languages. The method uses Wasserstein distances between SSL-derived features, speaker embeddings, prosody, and intelligibility factors to produce scores from 0-100 that indicate how closely synthetic speech matches real speech. A quarterly automated pipeline generates multilingual test data from YouTube to prevent benchmark contamination, enabling fair comparison of 20 recent TTS systems.

## Method Summary
TTSDS2 computes scores by extracting features from four perceptual factors: GENERIC (SSL embeddings), SPEAKER (d-Vector/WeSpeaker), PROSODY (F0, speaking rate), and INTELLIGIBILITY (ASR activations). For each feature, it calculates 2-Wasserstein distances from synthetic distributions to real speech and to noise reference distributions, then normalizes these distances to produce 0-100 scores. The final score is an unweighted average across all factors. The method is CPU-bound due to Wasserstein computations and requires ~9.4 minutes per evaluation on a Xeon E5-2620 processor.

## Key Results
- Average Spearman correlation ρ = 0.67 across all conditions, outperforming 16 other objective metrics
- Only metric to achieve correlation above 0.50 for every domain (Clean, Noisy, Wild, Kids) and subjective score (MOS, CMOS, SMOS)
- Speaker factor dominates for Clean/Noisy domains (r=0.84-0.86) while Intelligibility/Generic stronger for Wild/Kids
- Published over 11,000 subjective ratings dataset for future MOS prediction network training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Normalized Wasserstein distances between synthetic and real speech distributions produce scores that correlate with human perceptual ratings across diverse domains.
- Mechanism: For each feature X, compute 2-Wasserstein distance from synthetic distribution to real reference (W_real) and to distractor noise distributions (W_noise). Score S(X) = 100 × W_noise / (W_real + W_noise) yields 0-100 scale where >50 indicates closer to real than noise.
- Core assumption: SSL-derived features and perceptual factors capture what humans perceive as speech quality.
- Evidence anchors: Table 2 shows TTSDS2 achieving average ρ = 0.67 correlation; Figure 2 illustrates scoring computation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Averaging across four perceptually-motivated factor scores provides robustness that single-factor metrics lack.
- Mechanism: Four factors (GENERIC: SSL embeddings; SPEAKER: d-Vector/WeSpeaker; PROSODY: F0, speaking rate; INTELLIGIBILITY: ASR activations) computed independently then averaged unweighted.
- Core assumption: Factors capture partially orthogonal quality dimensions; their combination smooths domain-specific weaknesses.
- Evidence anchors: Table 6 shows Speaker factor dominates for Clean/Noisy but Intelligibility/Generic stronger for Wild/Kids.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Continually regenerated multilingual test data prevents contamination and maintains benchmark validity over time.
- Mechanism: Quarterly pipeline scrapes YouTube in 14 languages, applies XNLI-based content filtering, Demucs music detection, speaker diarization; synthesizes with 20 TTS systems and publishes updated rankings.
- Core assumption: Recent YouTube speech represents realistic, uncontaminated speech better than static curated corpora.
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.1 details 5-stage pipeline; multilingual validity checked via Uriel+ typological distance correlation (ρ = -0.51).

## Foundational Learning

- **Wasserstein Distance (Earth Mover's Distance)**
  - Why needed here: Core mathematical operation; normalization formula S(X) depends on understanding how distances between distributions work
  - Quick check question: Given two 1D distributions with sorted samples {x_i} and {y_i}, write the formula for W_2 distance.

- **Self-Supervised Speech Representations (HuBERT, wav2vec 2.0, WavLM)**
  - Why needed here: TTSDS2 extracts activations from these models; understanding what they encode determines what quality dimensions the metric captures
  - Quick check question: What type of speech information do SSL models learn during masked prediction pre-training?

- **Subjective TTS Metrics (MOS, CMOS, SMOS)**
  - Why needed here: These are the validation targets; understanding their variability and limitations explains why objective proxies are needed
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper state that "subjective metrics such as MOS are not easily comparable between works"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Audio → Feature Extractors (per factor) → Wasserstein Distance Calculator (CPU-bound) → Score Normalizer: S(X) = 100 × W_noise / (W_real + W_noise) → Unweighted Mean Aggregator → Final TTSDS2 Score (0-100)

- Critical path: 1. Prepare reference dataset (real speech, 1000+ samples recommended); 2. Load noise datasets from hf.co/datasets/ttsds/noise-reference; 3. Extract all features (GPU-accelerated for SSL models); 4. Compute Wasserstein distances per feature (CPU-bound bottleneck); 5. Normalize and aggregate across factors

- Design tradeoffs: CPU vs GPU (distance computation is CPU-bound ~9.4 min per evaluation); Breadth vs speed (11 features across 4 factors; removing features speeds evaluation but may reduce robustness); General vs domain-specific (unweighted averaging sacrifices domain-optimal performance for cross-domain stability)

- Failure signatures: Scores clustered near 50 (synthetic distribution equidistant from real/noise; may indicate feature extraction failure); High TTSDS2 with high WER (system generates plausible but incorrect text); Factor scores highly correlated (redundant signal suggests feature set could be reduced)

- First 3 experiments: 1. Sanity check: Run TTSDS2 on ground truth data; expect scores ~93 for real speech, <50 for noise reference datasets; 2. Factor ablation: Remove one factor at a time and recompute correlations with MOS/CMOS/SMOS to validate each factor's contribution; 3. Language robustness: Compare English TTSDS2 vs multilingual TTSDS2 (mHuBERT-147, XLSR-53) on non-English speech to validate multilingual adaptations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Can the released dataset of over 11,000 subjective ratings significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of MOS prediction networks?** The dataset is newly published; existing prediction networks have not yet been trained on this specific collection of high-quality, modern TTS samples.

2. **Does the observed Spearman correlation ceiling of 0.80 result from inherent noise in subjective listening tests or missing perceptual dimensions in objective metrics?** The paper establishes the ceiling but does not deconstruct the residual error to attribute it to either human variability or specific deficiencies in the metric's feature set.

3. **How can TTSDS2 be adapted to evaluate long-form speech synthesis and contextual consistency beyond the current 30-second limit?** The current metric computes distributional similarities over short utterances; it lacks a mechanism to measure prosodic consistency, narrative flow, or speaker identity stability over extended durations.

## Limitations

- CPU-bound performance bottleneck: 9.4-minute computation time per evaluation severely limits practical deployment in iterative TTS development
- Does not capture contextual understanding or emotional prosody nuances that humans notice but aren't encoded in current SSL features
- No mechanism to measure prosodic consistency, narrative flow, or speaker identity stability over extended durations (limited to 30-second utterances)

## Confidence

- **Metric Performance Claims (High)**: The correlation results (average ρ > 0.67) are directly measurable from Table 2 and Figure 2
- **Multilingual Robustness (Medium)**: While 14 languages are covered and typological distance correlation is provided, comprehensive multilingual validation across all 14 languages individually is not shown
- **Domain Coverage (High)**: The four-domain evaluation (Clean, Noisy, Wild, Kids) is explicitly defined and tested with clear performance metrics for each

## Next Checks

1. **Temporal Stability Test**: Run TTSDS2 on the same set of TTS systems across two different quarterly data collections. Measure rank correlation stability and identify whether observed score changes reflect actual system improvements or data collection artifacts.

2. **Feature Redundancy Analysis**: Compute pairwise correlations between all 11 features across multiple TTS systems. Identify which features provide redundant information versus unique perceptual dimensions, potentially enabling computational optimization without sacrificing accuracy.

3. **Contextual Quality Gap Assessment**: Design test cases where TTS systems generate semantically appropriate but phonetically unnatural speech (e.g., emphasis errors, incorrect prosody for meaning). Compare TTSDS2 scores with human ratings to quantify the metric's sensitivity to contextual vs purely acoustic quality.
