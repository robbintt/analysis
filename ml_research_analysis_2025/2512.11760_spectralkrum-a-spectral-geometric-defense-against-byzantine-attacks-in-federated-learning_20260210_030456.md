# SpectralKrum: A Spectral-Geometric Defense Against Byzantine Attacks in Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11760
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11760
- Authors: Aditya Tripathi; Karan Sharma; Rahul Mishra; Tapas Kumar Maiti
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: SpectralKrum achieves 49-51% mean accuracy against adaptive-steer attacks on CIFAR-10 with non-IID data, but shows limited advantage against label-flip attacks where malicious updates remain spectrally indistinguishable from benign ones.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes SpectralKrum, a defense against Byzantine attacks in federated learning that combines spectral subspace estimation with Krum's geometric neighbor selection. The method projects incoming client updates into a low-dimensional subspace estimated from historical aggregates, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates based on orthogonal residual energy. Evaluated on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet non-IID partitions (α=0.1), SpectralKrum demonstrates competitive robustness against directional and subspace-aware attacks, achieving mean accuracy around 49-51% across 56,000 training rounds. However, it provides limited advantage over simpler statistical methods under label-flip and min-max attacks where malicious updates remain spectrally indistinguishable from benign ones. The method preserves FL privacy by operating solely on model updates without auxiliary data, but requires significant computation overhead (1311 ms per round) compared to baselines.

## Method Summary
SpectralKrum operates by maintaining a rolling buffer of past aggregated updates, computing a low-dimensional PCA subspace from this history, and projecting client updates into this spectral space before applying Krum selection. The method then filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. This hybrid approach leverages the geometric clustering properties of benign updates while detecting anomalous directions orthogonal to the learned subspace. The defense is specifically designed for non-IID federated learning scenarios where client data distributions are heterogeneous, making classical defenses like Krum prone to oscillation and poor performance.

## Key Results
- SpectralKrum achieves mean accuracy of 49-51% against adaptive-steer attacks under Dirichlet non-IID conditions (α=0.1)
- Performance degrades to ~39% accuracy against label-flip attacks, showing limited advantage over simpler methods like GeometricMedian
- Computational overhead of 1311 ms per round significantly exceeds Krum variants (~8 ms) and other baselines
- Competitive performance against buffer-drift attacks demonstrates effectiveness of historical subspace estimation
- Limited improvement over simpler methods for min-max attacks where malicious updates stay within benign variance envelope

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Historical Subspace Estimation
Benign optimization trajectories concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold estimable from past aggregates, providing a reference structure that survives per-client heterogeneity. The method maintains a rolling buffer B of past aggregated updates, centers and trims extreme-norm entries, then computes rank-r PCA to obtain subspace basis U. Past aggregates are assumed less contaminated than current-round raw client submissions because they are outputs of prior robust aggregation. However, contamination may accumulate over time through buffer-drift attacks, or legitimate distribution shift may occur faster than buffer turnover.

### Mechanism 2: Krum Selection in Spectral Coordinates
Running Krum in low-dimensional spectral coordinates tightens benign clustering and suppresses adversarial directions that would dominate in full parameter space. Each update is projected to z_i = U^T d_i in R^r, pairwise distances are computed in this space, and the k = n−f−2 updates with smallest sum of distances to their n−f−2 nearest neighbors are selected. This leverages the assumption that benign updates cluster more tightly in the spectral subspace than in the original high-dimensional space. The approach may fail if the learned subspace misrepresents benign structure, or if adversaries successfully position updates inside the benign spectral cluster.

### Mechanism 3: Orthogonal Energy Guard
Updates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a calibrated threshold are geometrically anomalous regardless of their neighbor distances in spectral space. For each update d, orthogonal energy ρ(d) = ||d − UU^T d||_2 is computed, and a threshold τ is calibrated as the q-th quantile of historical ρ values. This mechanism assumes that Byzantine updates introduce variance orthogonal to the benign subspace that survives Krum selection. The guard is ineffective when malicious updates remain within the benign subspace (label-flip, min-max), producing orthogonal energy indistinguishable from benign.

## Foundational Learning

- **PCA and Low-Dimensional Subspace Projection**: Core to understanding how SpectralKrum compresses updates and what the subspace captures versus discards. Quick check: If benign updates span a 50-dimensional subspace and you set r=20, what signal is lost?
- **Krum's Neighbor-Based Selection**: SpectralKrum inherits Krum's logic; understanding its failure under non-IID clarifies why spectral pre-processing helps. Quick check: Why does Krum oscillate or select centrally-positioned adversaries when benign updates form multiple clusters?
- **Non-IID Data Distributions (Dirichlet α)**: The paper tests at α=0.1 (high heterogeneity); this is the regime where classical defenses degrade. Quick check: How does class imbalance per client affect the geometry of gradient vectors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Historical buffer (B=50 aggregated updates) -> Center/Trim (α=0.1) -> PCA module (r=50) -> Projection operator U and threshold τ -> Krum selector in R^r -> Guard filter by ρ -> Fallback: retain minimal-residual candidates if guard empties -> Average survivors -> Append to buffer
- **Critical path**: Buffer → Center/Trim → PCA → Project clients → Krum in R^r → Guard filter by ρ → Average survivors → Append to buffer
- **Design tradeoffs**: Larger r captures more benign variation but reduces spectral contrast with attacks; larger B stabilizes subspace estimation but slows adaptation to distribution shift; higher q provides tighter filtering but risks rejecting benign updates under drift; computation overhead is 1311 ms/round (highest among baselines)
- **Failure signatures**: Label-flip attacks cause accuracy drops to ~39% while GeometricMedian achieves ~57%; min-max attacks show SpectralKrum (~48.7%) competitive but not superior to simpler methods (~50-51%); buffer-drift causes gradual degradation if contamination accumulates faster than buffer refresh; empty guard triggers fallback mechanism
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce adaptive-steer benchmark to confirm ~49-51% mean accuracy; 2) Ablate orthogonal energy guard (τ=∞) to isolate residual filtering contribution; 3) Characterize label-flip failure mode by comparing vs GeometricMedian and documenting the ~18 percentage point gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can hybrid architectures combining spectral filtering with coordinate-wise median aggregation inherit complementary strengths against both subspace-aware attacks and label-flip/min-max perturbations? The paper suggests combining spectral projection with coordinate-wise median may capture both advantages, but no existing method demonstrates this comprehensively across all attack types.

### Open Question 2
Would robust PCA or streaming incremental PCA variants maintain cleaner subspace estimates under high non-IID heterogeneity (α < 0.1)? Standard PCA on a rolling buffer may be contaminated by distribution shifts and adversarial bias from past rounds, suggesting robust variants could improve stability.

### Open Question 3
Can layer-wise or multi-subspace PCA capture heterogeneous geometric structures across deep network layers to improve detection of attacks that affect specific layers differently? Global PCA may miss attack signatures concentrated in specific layers, such as backdoor triggers in later convolutional layers.

### Open Question 4
How does SpectralKrum perform against fully adaptive adversaries that track the server's PCA subspace in real-time and dynamically adjust orthogonal energy matching? Static adaptive-steer attacks assume imperfect subspace estimation; a stronger adversary with real-time access could potentially evade both Krum selection and guard filtering.

## Limitations
- Limited effectiveness against label-flip and min-max attacks where malicious updates remain spectrally indistinguishable from benign ones
- High computational overhead (1311 ms/round) compared to simpler methods like Krum variants (~8 ms)
- Relies on assumption that historical aggregates remain less contaminated than current client submissions over extended training

## Confidence
- **Mechanism 1 (Historical Subspace Estimation)**: Medium - Core assumption untested in literature; contamination accumulation not empirically characterized
- **Mechanism 2 (Krum in Spectral Coordinates)**: High - Consistent with related work on geometric selection; non-IID failure modes well-documented
- **Mechanism 3 (Orthogonal Energy Guard)**: Medium - Effective against orthogonal attacks but fails on subspace-bound attacks; calibration sensitivity unknown
- **Overall Robustness**: Medium - Strong against specific attacks but limited against others; hybrid architecture needed for comprehensive defense

## Next Checks
1. **Buffer Contamination Analysis**: Implement buffer-drift attack with increasing contamination rates; measure accuracy degradation and determine contamination threshold where historical estimation fails.
2. **Subspace Sensitivity Study**: Systematically vary PCA dimension r (20, 50, 100) and buffer size B (25, 50, 100); quantify tradeoff between spectral contrast and benign signal preservation.
3. **Hybrid Architecture Evaluation**: Combine SpectralKrum with geometric median filtering or angle-based defense; measure whether complementary signals improve robustness against label-flip and min-max attacks where spectral methods fail.
