- Primary result: CA-aligned model outperforms base on CA evaluation (87.2% vs 12.8% win rate) while maintaining general NLP capability

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Collective Agency (CA) as an open-ended alignment value and a Dynamic Alignment framework that enables large language models to self-improve toward CA without human-labeled data. The method uses automated dataset generation and self-rewarding mechanisms via GRPO to iteratively align models to CA. Experiments fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b show that the CA-aligned model outperforms the base model on CA evaluation (87.2% vs. 12.8% win rate) while maintaining competitive performance on general NLP benchmarks including IFEval, GPQA Diamond, and AIME 2025. Results suggest that scalable, self-guided alignment is feasible and preserves core capabilities.

## Method Summary
The Dynamic Alignment framework consists of two phases: automated multi-agent dataset generation and GRPO self-improving training. First, a goal generator creates CA-relevant objectives, which a prompt generator converts into task prompts. An evaluator reviews prompts and provides feedback for refinement, producing 1,000 training prompts. Second, the policy model generates 8 candidates per prompt using a CA system prompt, self-scores them 0-5 on holistic CA alignment, and computes GRPO advantages based on relative scores. The model updates via GRPO without a separate reward model. Training continues until reward convergence on a single H100 NVL 94GB GPU, with performance evaluated against general benchmarks and CA-specific win rates.

## Key Results
- CA-aligned model achieves 87.2% win rate vs base model (12.8%) on CA evaluation
- Maintains competitive performance on IFEval, GPQA Diamond, and AIME 2025 benchmarks
- Demonstrates feasibility of scalable self-guided alignment without human labels
- Shows preservation of general capabilities during open-ended value alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Unified CA scoring produces coherent reward signals by requiring balanced advancement across all four pillars
- Mechanism: Single integer score (0-5) requires holistic coverage of Knowledge, Power, Vitality, and Benevolence, reducing reward hacking on isolated dimensions
- Core assumption: Policy model has sufficient conceptual understanding to evaluate CA meaningfully without external calibration
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states self-rewarding mechanism assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning; section 2.2 specifies unified CA score per inseparable value structure
- Break condition: Self-evaluation drift or lack of calibration renders scores uninformative or self-reinforcing

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GRPO with group-relative advantages enables stable self-improvement without separate reward model
- Mechanism: For each prompt, model generates 8 candidates, scores via self-reward, computes relative advantages within-group, removing need for trained reward model
- Core assumption: Candidate distribution is sufficiently diverse to produce meaningful relative rankings
- Evidence anchors: Abstract describes self-rewarding mechanism for GRPO-based learning; section 2.2 specifies GRPO framework for advantage calculation
- Break condition: Low variance in candidate scores produces noisy advantage estimates and stalled learning

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Automated multi-agent prompt generation ensures task diversity and alignment with CA evaluation goals
- Mechanism: Three specialized roles (goal generator, prompt generator, evaluator) iterate to produce 1,000 prompts, filtering narrow NLP tasks or domain-specific requirements
- Core assumption: Generating model (o4-mini) can reliably judge whether prompts elicit CA-relevant behavior
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions automated training dataset generation with LLMs; section 2.2 describes evaluator reviewing generated prompts against specified standards
- Break condition: Generation-evaluation loop converges to narrow task distribution, causing overfitting to specific CA expressions

## Foundational Learning

- **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**
  - Why needed here: Core optimizer replacing PPO/DPO; computes advantages from within-group score comparisons rather than learned reward model
  - Quick check question: Given 8 outputs with scores [2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 5, 3, 4], can you compute relative advantages?

- **Self-rewarding language models**
  - Why needed here: Model must judge its own outputs; understanding failure modes (length bias, self-consistency) is critical for debugging
  - Quick check question: What biases might emerge when a model evaluates its own outputs without external grounding?

- **Constitutional AI / RLAIF principles**
  - Why needed here: Provides context for AI-feedback alignment and its limitations; this work extends beyond static principles to open-ended values
  - Quick check question: How does CA differ from HHH (helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness) as an alignment target?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Dataset generation pipeline: Goal generator → Prompt generator → Evaluator → (revision loop) → 1,000 training prompts
  - Self-improving loop: Policy model (gpt-oss-20b) → generate G=8 candidates per prompt → self-reward CA scoring → GRPO advantage/loss computation → parameter update
  - Evaluation: GPT-4.1 judge for pairwise CA comparison; benchmarks (IFEval, GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate diverse CA-eliciting prompts (quality directly affects training signal)
  2. Configure self-reward scoring rubric (0-5 scale in Table 5)
  3. Run GRPO training until reward convergence
  4. Validate on held-out CA eval set + capability benchmarks

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Unified vs. per-aspect scoring: Unified encourages holistic behavior but harder to diagnose failures; per-aspect enables targeted improvement but risks isolated optimization
  - System prompt inclusion: Excluded during gradient update to prevent prompt dependency; may slow convergence
  - Group size G=8: Larger G improves advantage estimates but increases compute 8×

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Reward collapse: All scores converge to similar values → no learning signal
  - Capability degradation: General benchmark performance drops → overfitting to CA-specific responses
  - Evaluation circularity: Self-reward becomes disconnected from actual CA quality

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline sanity check: Run self-reward training with shuffled scores (random rewards) to confirm learning depends on genuine CA signal, not just gradient flow
  2. Ablation on scoring granularity: Compare unified scoring vs. averaged per-aspect scores to validate entangled-value design choice
  3. Cross-model transfer: Evaluate whether prompts generated by o4-mini transfer to other base models, testing dataset generation robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a multi-agent negotiation framework effectively mitigate self-reinforced value drift and evaluation circularity in self-rewarding alignment systems?
- Basis in paper: "First, to mitigate the risk of self-reinforced value drift in a single-agent self-rewarding loop, we plan to extend the alignment framework to a multi-agent setting, where model instances with differing objectives negotiate to reach mutually agreeable solutions."
- Why unresolved: Current single-agent self-rewarding loop risks model reinforcing its own biases without external correction mechanisms
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing multi-agent settings reduce reward hacking while maintaining or improving CA alignment metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the holistic Collective Agency score be decomposed into measurable components (Knowledge, Benevolence, Power, Vitality) to enable granular feedback on dimension-specific trade-offs?
- Basis in paper: "This involves developing methods to decompose the holistic CA score into its constituent pillars. Evaluation suites that provide such granular feedback would offer deeper insights into how models internalize CA and manage the trade-offs among its dimensions."
- Why unresolved: Current unified CA score prevents understanding whether models develop unevenly across four interdependent aspects
- What evidence would resolve it: Validated evaluation protocol showing consistent, interpretable scores for each CA pillar correlating with independent assessments

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does CA alignment inadvertently degrade conventional alignment objectives such as harmlessness and honesty?
- Basis in paper: "Additionally, it is crucial to assess how CA alignment influences standard alignment goals such as harmlessness and honesty, to ensure no unintended regressions occur."
- Why unresolved: Paper evaluates general NLP capabilities but does not test whether open-ended CA objective conflicts with safety-critical HHH behaviors
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking CA-aligned models on established harmlessness and honesty evaluations (e.g., red-teaming suites, truthfulness benchmarks) compared to HHH-aligned baselines

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does the Dynamic Alignment framework scale effectively across diverse model architectures, parameter scales, and when compared to alternative self-improving alignment methods?
- Basis in paper: "This includes direct comparisons with alternative self-improving alignment methods (Bai et al. 2022b; Yuan et al. 2024), and evaluating the framework across diverse model architectures and training scales."
- Why unresolved: Results reported only for gpt-oss-20b; generalizability to other models and superiority over Constitutional AI or Self-Rewarding Language Models remains untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments across multiple model families and scales, with head-to-head comparisons against RLAIF and self-rewarding baselines on identical evaluation protocols

## Limitations

- Dataset generation reliability depends on o4-mini's ability to judge CA relevance, with no evaluation of prompt quality diversity or transferability
- Self-reward calibration lacks external grounding, risking drift or reinforcement of narrow CA interpretations
- Model availability unclear as gpt-oss-20b is not specified as publicly available, requiring substitution
- Convergence criteria "until reward converges" lacks explicit thresholds or patience parameters

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: GRPO implementation details and benchmark results are well-specified and verifiable
- **Medium confidence**: CA alignment win rate (87.2%) is supported by rigorous evaluation, but depends on dataset quality
- **Low confidence**: Long-term stability and capability preservation claims require extended testing beyond reported training duration

## Next Checks

1. **Prompt transferability test**: Evaluate whether o4-mini-generated prompts elicit CA-aligned responses from different base models to assess dataset generality
2. **External reward validation**: Implement small human-labeled validation set to periodically check self-reward calibration and detect drift
3. **Long-horizon capability monitoring**: Track general benchmark performance across extended training epochs to detect gradual capability degradation
