## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SurvCBM (Survival Concept-based Bottleneck Model) and SurvRCM (Survival Regularized Concept-based Model), the first concept-based learning models designed for survival analysis with censored data. SurvCBM integrates the concept bottleneck model architecture with survival analysis by using a Cox proportional hazards model or Beran estimator to predict survival functions from concept logits. SurvRCM applies concepts as regularization without a bottleneck layer. Both models are trained end-to-end and offer interpretable predictions in terms of concepts.

The proposed models address the gap in applying concept-based learning to survival analysis tasks, which involve predicting event times with censored data. Two interpretability approaches are proposed: one leveraging the linear relationship in the Cox model and another using an instance-based explanation framework with the Beran estimator. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SurvCBM outperforms SurvRCM and traditional survival models across multiple datasets, with C-index values reaching 0.82-0.95 depending on the dataset and model configuration.

## Method Summary
The SurvCBM model combines concept bottleneck architecture with survival analysis by first predicting interpretable concept logits, then using these concepts to estimate survival functions via Cox proportional hazards or Beran estimator. SurvRCM instead uses concepts as regularization without a bottleneck layer. Both models are trained end-to-end and incorporate censored data handling through appropriate loss functions. The interpretability comes from two approaches: linear Cox model relationships for SurvCBM and instance-based explanations using Beran estimator for both models.

## Key Results
- SurvCBM achieves C-index values of 0.82-0.95 across multiple datasets
- SurvCBM outperforms both SurvRCM and traditional survival analysis models
- Both models provide interpretable predictions in terms of predefined concepts
- The Cox proportional hazards approach and Beran estimator provide complementary interpretability mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of concept-based learning with survival analysis allows the model to leverage interpretable intermediate representations while handling the complexities of censored data. By using concepts as either a bottleneck (SurvCBM) or regularization (SurvRCM), the model can capture meaningful patterns in the data that are both predictive and interpretable. The Cox proportional hazards model provides linear interpretability when assumptions hold, while the Beran estimator offers instance-based explanations that are more flexible.

## Foundational Learning
- **Censored Data Handling**: Why needed - survival analysis often has incomplete event observations; Quick check - verify proper incorporation of censoring indicators in loss functions
- **Concept Bottleneck Architecture**: Why needed - enables interpretable intermediate representations; Quick check - validate concept prediction quality before survival prediction
- **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**: Why needed - provides interpretable linear relationship between concepts and survival; Quick check - test proportional hazards assumption validity
- **Beran Estimator**: Why needed - non-parametric approach for instance-based survival function estimation; Quick check - validate convergence and stability of estimates

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input -> Concept Predictor -> Survival Predictor (Cox/Beran) -> Output

Critical Path: Input features → Concept prediction layer → Survival function estimation → C-index evaluation

Design Tradeoffs: SurvCBM trades some predictive performance for interpretability through the bottleneck, while SurvRCM maintains direct feature-to-survival mapping but uses concepts only for regularization. The choice between Cox and Beran depends on whether linear interpretability or instance-based flexibility is prioritized.

Failure Signatures: Poor concept quality leads to degraded survival predictions; violation of Cox model assumptions undermines interpretability; heavy censoring may destabilize Beran estimator; small sample sizes may cause overfitting in concept bottleneck.

3 First Experiments:
1. Validate concept prediction accuracy on held-out data before training survival components
2. Compare C-index performance between SurvCBM with Cox vs. Beran approaches
3. Test sensitivity of results to concept selection by systematically adding/removing concepts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to high-dimensional data and datasets with heavy censoring (>50% censored) remains unproven
- Concept selection process is not fully automated and relies on predefined interpretable concepts
- Interpretability validity under model misspecification or with non-causal concepts is unclear
- Limited evaluation to three relatively small datasets compared to modern deep learning benchmarks

## Confidence
- Model Performance Claims: High confidence - well-supported by experimental results
- Interpretability Claims: Medium confidence - framework provides interpretable outputs but depends on concept quality
- Novelty Claims: High confidence - clear methodological contribution with no identified prior work

## Next Checks
1. External validation on additional survival datasets with varying levels of censoring, dimensionality, and domain
2. Evaluate impact of noisy or irrelevant concepts on model performance and interpretability
3. Analyze computational requirements and performance scalability for large-scale datasets
