# Seeing Through Risk: A Symbolic Approximation of Prospect Theory

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.14448
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14448
- Reference count: 30
- Symbolic model achieves 79.8% accuracy and 0.827 AUC on synthetic PT data, outperforming both logistic baseline (75.7%, 0.797 AUC) and parametric CPT (49.0%, 0.627 AUC).

## Executive Summary
This study proposes a symbolic modeling framework that approximates Prospect Theory (PT) using interpretable features and logistic regression, avoiding the complexity of nonlinear utility and probability weighting functions. By selecting features based on effect size, the model retains only behaviorally relevant predictors. Empirical results on synthetic data show the symbolic model achieves 79.8% accuracy and 0.827 AUC, outperforming both a black-box logistic baseline (75.7%, 0.797 AUC) and a parametric CPT model (49.0%, 0.627 AUC). The symbolic approach also reproduces key PT phenomena, such as the reflection effect, while maintaining transparency. This demonstrates that interpretable, cognitively grounded models can rival or exceed traditional parametric PT estimators in performance and stability, offering a promising direction for AI safety and economic policy applications.

## Method Summary
The symbolic approximation framework begins by constructing interpretable features that encode core PT concepts—gains/losses, probability transformations, and framing effects—based on known behavioral effects. Features are then selected using an effect-size criterion to retain only those with meaningful impact on decision outcomes. A logistic regression classifier is trained on these features to predict choices in gambles and reference-dependent scenarios. The symbolic model is evaluated against a black-box logistic baseline and a parametric Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) model on synthetic datasets generated to mimic PT-consistent decision behavior. Performance is measured via accuracy and AUC, with qualitative validation of the reflection effect and other known PT phenomena.

## Key Results
- Symbolic model achieves 79.8% accuracy and 0.827 AUC, outperforming both logistic baseline (75.7%, 0.797 AUC) and parametric CPT (49.0%, 0.627 AUC).
- The symbolic model successfully reproduces the reflection effect and other core PT phenomena.
- Feature selection based on effect size enables interpretability without sacrificing predictive power.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The symbolic approach works by translating complex, nonlinear PT mechanisms into interpretable, linearizable features that capture the essential behavioral drivers—such as loss aversion, probability weighting, and reference dependence—without resorting to opaque or parametric transformations. By focusing on effect-size-based feature selection, the model distills decision-making to only the most behaviorally relevant predictors, improving both interpretability and robustness. Logistic regression on these features can approximate the curvature and asymmetry of PT preferences, enabling high performance while remaining transparent. This avoids overfitting to parametric assumptions and allows direct inspection of how each psychological factor contributes to choices.

## Foundational Learning
- **Prospect Theory**: A descriptive model of decision-making under risk, capturing loss aversion, reference dependence, and nonlinear probability weighting. *Why needed*: PT is the behavioral benchmark the symbolic model aims to approximate.
- **Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT)**: A parametric formulation of PT with defined utility and weighting functions. *Why needed*: Serves as a performance comparison baseline.
- **Symbolic Modeling**: Representing complex relationships via interpretable, often linearized features. *Why needed*: Enables transparency and interpretability.
- **Effect Size Feature Selection**: Choosing features based on their statistical impact on outcomes. *Why needed*: Reduces model complexity while retaining behavioral relevance.
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear classification method used for transparent decision boundaries. *Why needed*: Provides a simple, interpretable base for the symbolic approximation.
- **Reflection Effect**: The tendency to make risk-averse choices for gains and risk-seeking choices for losses. *Why needed*: A core PT phenomenon the model must reproduce.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Synthetic Data Generator -> Feature Constructor -> Effect Size Selector -> Logistic Regression Model -> Performance Evaluator

**Critical Path**
Feature construction → Effect size selection → Logistic regression training → Accuracy/AUC evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Interpretability vs. expressive power: Symbolic model trades nonlinear flexibility for transparency.
- Feature selection vs. completeness: Effect-size filtering may exclude subtle behavioral interactions.
- Parametric vs. nonparametric: Avoids rigid assumptions but may miss fine-grained PT mechanisms.

**Failure Signatures**
- Over-reliance on effect-size filtering may omit key interactions.
- Synthetic data may not reflect real-world noise and diversity.
- Poor performance on out-of-distribution or culturally diverse samples.

**First Experiments**
1. Generate synthetic PT-consistent data with varying noise levels and test symbolic model robustness.
2. Evaluate symbolic model's ability to reproduce the reflection effect under manipulated framing.
3. Compare symbolic model predictions to actual human choice data from real gambles.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The authors note that applying the symbolic model to real-world, noisy datasets is an open challenge. They also highlight the need to validate whether the effect-size-based feature selection captures all behaviorally relevant interactions, or if some PT mechanisms are lost. Additionally, they call for comparison with optimized parametric PT implementations to ensure fairness in benchmarking.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to synthetic data; generalizability to real-world noisy datasets is untested.
- Effect-size-based feature selection may oversimplify or omit subtle behavioral interactions.
- Parametric CPT model performance may be artificially low due to implementation choices, raising questions about fairness of comparison.

## Confidence
- **High**: Model interpretability and successful reproduction of reflection effect in synthetic settings.
- **Medium**: Outperformance of logistic baseline on synthetic data (no cross-validation or external test set reported).
- **Low**: General superiority over parametric PT models, due to lack of real-world validation and comparison with optimized parametric implementations.

## Next Checks
1. Test the symbolic model on multiple independent real-world decision-making datasets to assess generalizability and robustness to noise.
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine whether the selected features truly capture the essential mechanisms of Prospect Theory or if important interactions are being lost.
3. Compare the symbolic approximation against multiple parametric PT implementations (including optimized variants) on the same benchmarks to isolate whether performance gains stem from modeling approach or implementation quality.
