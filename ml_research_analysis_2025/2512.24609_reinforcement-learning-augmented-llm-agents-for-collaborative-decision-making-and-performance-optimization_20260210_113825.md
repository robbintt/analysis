# Reinforcement Learning-Augmented LLM Agents for Collaborative Decision Making and Performance Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.24609
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24609
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** 3x speedup and 98.7% consistency over single-agent baselines in collaborative tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-augmented framework to enhance large language model agents' ability to collaborate effectively in multi-agent environments. The core challenge addressed is the lack of coordination and suboptimal global performance among individual LLM agents. By formulating the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and employing centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE), the framework leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies. A carefully designed joint reward balances task quality, speed, and coordination efficiency. The approach achieves significant improvements in both task processing speed and output consistency across collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, outperforming strong multi-agent baselines.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a reinforcement learning-augmented framework for collaborative multi-agent decision making using LLMs. It formulates the problem as a Dec-POMDP, where agents operate under partial observability but coordinate during centralized training. The centralized training phase uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize all agents' policies by aggregating their experiences, while decentralized execution allows each agent to act independently using its trained policy. A joint reward function is designed to balance three key aspects: task quality, execution speed, and coordination efficiency. This reward structure guides agents toward not only accurate task completion but also efficient and synchronized collaboration. The framework is evaluated on collaborative writing and coding tasks, demonstrating substantial gains in speed and consistency over single-agent and strong multi-agent baselines.

## Key Results
- 3x increase in task processing speed compared to single-agent baselines
- 98.7% structural/style consistency in collaborative writing tasks
- 74.6% test pass rate in collaborative coding tasks, outperforming strong multi-agent baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from addressing the coordination gap in LLM agents through a structured RL approach. By modeling collaboration as a Dec-POMDP, the method captures the partial observability and decentralized nature of real-world multi-agent tasks. Centralized training with GRPO enables agents to learn joint policies that account for the collective state and reward, while decentralized execution ensures scalability and robustness. The joint reward function is critical: it not only incentivizes high-quality task completion but also penalizes redundant communication and delays, directly targeting efficiency. This combination of theoretical formalism and practical reward design allows agents to discover and maintain coordination strategies that single-agent or ad-hoc multi-agent approaches cannot achieve.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dec-POMDP (Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process):** A formal framework for modeling multi-agent sequential decision making under partial observability; needed to capture the realistic constraints of collaborative LLM agents and enable rigorous policy optimization.
  - *Quick check:* Verify that agent observations are indeed local and that joint state cannot be fully observed by any single agent.

- **Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE):** A training paradigm where agents share experiences during training but act independently at test time; needed to balance learning coordination with practical deployment constraints.
  - *Quick check:* Confirm that during execution, agents do not share real-time information and only use their individual trained policies.

- **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO):** A policy optimization algorithm that updates agent policies based on relative performance within a group; needed to encourage cooperation and penalize free-riding or redundant actions.
  - *Quick check:* Ensure that reward updates are computed relative to the group's average performance, not absolute scores.

- **Joint Reward Design:** A composite reward function balancing task quality, speed, and coordination efficiency; needed to align agent incentives with global objectives and discourage inefficient communication.
  - *Quick check:* Test that increasing communication frequency does not always correlate with higher rewards, indicating effective coordination penalties.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Observation Collector -> Policy Network -> Action Selector -> Environment -> Reward Aggregator -> GRPO Trainer -> Updated Policy Network

**Critical Path:**
During training, each agent's observation is processed by its policy network to select actions, which are executed in the environment. Rewards and next observations are collected, aggregated across agents, and used by the GRPO trainer to update all policies jointly. During execution, agents act independently using their updated policies.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Centralized training enables coordination learning but requires aggregating all agents' experiences, increasing memory and computation as agent count grows.
- The joint reward must balance competing objectives (quality vs. speed vs. coordination), which may require careful tuning to avoid unintended behaviors.
- Partial observability models realism but can slow convergence compared to fully observable settings.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor coordination despite high individual performance may indicate reward weights are misaligned.
- Degraded performance with more agents could signal scalability bottlenecks in centralized training.
- Inconsistent outputs across agents may suggest insufficient reward shaping for style/structural alignment.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Evaluate task completion time and output consistency with 2-4 agents on a simple collaborative writing task.
2. Measure communication overhead and redundancy as agent count increases.
3. Compare reward contribution weights (quality vs. speed vs. coordination) to identify optimal balance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, limiting generalizability to other domains.
- Centralized training becomes computationally prohibitive with larger agent populations due to the need to aggregate all experiences.
- The paper lacks comparison to alternative reward-shaping methods or state-of-the-art MARL approaches beyond the mentioned baselines.
- No exploration of how the framework handles heterogeneous agent capabilities or failures during decentralized execution.

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
| --- | --- |
| Performance gains over single-agent baselines | High - supported by benchmark results |
| Superior coordination efficiency vs. strong multi-agent baselines | Medium - results are promising but comparisons are limited |
| Dec-POMDP formulation effectiveness | Medium - theoretically sound but requires broader validation |

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on diverse multi-agent tasks beyond writing and coding, such as negotiation or resource allocation, to assess domain robustness.
2. Evaluate scalability by increasing agent count and measuring centralized training time and communication overhead.
3. Compare against recent MARL baselines with alternative reward structures to isolate the impact of the proposed joint reward design.
