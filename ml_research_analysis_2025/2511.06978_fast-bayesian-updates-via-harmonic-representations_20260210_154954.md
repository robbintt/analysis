# Fast Bayesian Updates via Harmonic Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06978
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06978
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Fast Bayesian inference using spectral convolution with O(N log N) complexity via FFT

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for fast Bayesian inference by leveraging harmonic analysis. The core idea is to represent the prior and likelihood distributions in an orthogonal spectral basis, transforming the Bayesian update into a spectral convolution. The authors prove that the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients, and that this convolution can be computed efficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with O(N log N) complexity—a substantial improvement over O(N²) for naive methods. Rigorous mathematical criteria are established, linking the method's efficiency to the smoothness and spectral decay of the involved distributions. The method excels for smooth, well-behaved functions like Gaussians but faces challenges with discontinuous or heavy-tailed distributions and high-dimensional spaces. This approach offers a paradigm shift, connecting Bayesian computation to signal processing and enabling real-time, sequential inference for a wide class of problems.

## Method Summary
The method transforms Bayesian inference into a spectral computation by projecting prior and likelihood functions onto an orthonormal basis (e.g., Fourier series). The posterior coefficients are obtained through spectral convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients, followed by normalization. The key innovation is using the Fast Fourier Transform to compute this convolution efficiently in O(N log N) time rather than O(N²). The framework establishes precise conditions for when truncation of the spectral series yields accurate results based on the smoothness of the distributions.

## Key Results
- Proves that posterior Fourier coefficients equal the normalized convolution of prior and likelihood coefficients
- Achieves O(N log N) complexity via FFT, improving over O(N²) naive methods
- Establishes rigorous mathematical criteria linking method efficiency to distribution smoothness and spectral decay
- Demonstrates significant speedup for smooth distributions while identifying limitations for discontinuous or heavy-tailed cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Spectral Conversion of Bayesian Products
- **Claim:** The pointwise multiplication of the prior and likelihood functions converts into a discrete convolution of their spectral coefficients.
- **Mechanism:** By projecting probability densities onto an orthonormal basis (e.g., Fourier series), the product operation p(θ)L(θ) in the parameter domain maps to a linear convolution (a * b)_k in the coefficient domain. The paper proves that the posterior's coefficients are exactly this convolution (Theorem 3.1).
- **Core assumption:** The prior and likelihood are square-integrable (L²) and can be represented in the chosen orthonormal basis.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The authors prove that the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients..."
  - [section 3.2]: Defines Theorem 3.1 "Spectral Bayes Update" showing c̃_k = (a * b)_k.
  - [corpus]: The neighbor "Spectral Bayesian Regression on the Sphere" supports the general viability of harmonic diagonalization for Bayesian problems.
- **Break condition:** If the distributions are not square-integrable or the basis cannot represent the function (e.g., extreme heavy tails without appropriate weighting), the expansion fails to converge.

### Mechanism 2: FFT Acceleration of Convolution
- **Claim:** The spectral convolution can be computed with O(N log N) complexity using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
- **Mechanism:** The algorithm avoids the O(N²) cost of direct discrete convolution by transforming coefficient vectors into the frequency domain via FFT, performing element-wise multiplication, and transforming back (Convolution Theorem).
- **Core assumption:** The sequences are finite and periodized (circular convolution approximation), and N is small enough for the FFT to be efficient but large enough to capture the distribution.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity."
  - [section 6.1]: Derives the use of the Discrete Convolution Theorem to replace convolution with pointwise multiplication.
  - [corpus]: "Spectral Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes" discusses similar efficiency gains from spectral convolution, reinforcing the general speedup mechanism.
- **Break condition:** If the number of required coefficients N becomes exponential due to high dimensionality (Curse of Dimensionality), the FFT speedup is negated by the sheer size of N^d.

### Mechanism 3: Spectral Truncation and Smoothness
- **Claim:** Computational feasibility is achieved by truncating the spectral series, which yields high accuracy if the underlying distributions are smooth.
- **Mechanism:** Smooth functions have rapidly decaying spectral coefficients (e.g., exponential decay for analytic functions). The algorithm truncates the series to N modes (Proposition 4.1). For smooth functions, the energy in the truncated tail is negligible, making the finite-dimensional approximation accurate.
- **Core assumption:** The prior and likelihood possess a degree of smoothness (e.g., C^p differentiability or analyticity).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...linking the method's efficiency to the smoothness and spectral decay of the involved distributions."
  - [section 5.1]: Theorem 5.1 explicitly links function smoothness to the decay rate of coefficients (|a_k|=O(|k|^{-p-1})).
  - [corpus]: Weak or missing direct corpus evidence on truncation error bounds specifically for Bayesian updates; rely primarily on paper text.
- **Break condition:** Discontinuous functions (e.g., Uniform prior) or non-smooth likelihoods cause slow spectral decay (O(1/k)) and Gibbs phenomena, requiring large N and causing significant approximation error.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Orthonormal Bases & Hilbert Spaces**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire framework relies on representing probability densities as vectors of coefficients in a function space (typically L²). Without this, the convolution equivalence does not hold.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why representing a function as a sum of sines/cosines allows us to turn multiplication into convolution?

- **Concept:** **The Convolution Theorem**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the mathematical engine of the speedup. It justifies why we move to the "frequency domain" to multiply vectors instead of convolving them directly.
  - **Quick check question:** If convolution in the time domain equals multiplication in the frequency domain, what computational advantage does the FFT provide over a direct sliding window calculation?

- **Concept:** **Spectral Decay & Gibbs Phenomenon**
  - **Why needed here:** To diagnose failures. If a user applies this method to a step-function prior, they must understand why oscillations (Gibbs) appear and why the error remains high.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does a sharp corner or discontinuity in a probability density function require an infinite number of spectral coefficients to represent accurately?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Pre-processor: Projects input Prior and Likelihood PDFs into spectral coefficients (Forward FFT/Projection)
  2. Spectral Engine: Performs element-wise (Hadamard) product of the transformed coefficient vectors
  3. Post-processor: Inverse FFT to retrieve posterior coefficients, followed by extraction of the evidence (Z) and normalization

- **Critical path:** The transformation of input functions to the spectral basis (specifically the choice of N and basis type) dictates the maximum possible accuracy.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Speed vs. Accuracy:** Lower N (truncation point) increases speed but risks losing high-frequency details (smoothing the posterior)
  - **Basis Choice vs. Boundary Conditions:** Fourier basis implies periodicity; using it for non-periodic domains introduces boundary errors (Gibbs). Chebyshev or Hermite bases may be required for non-periodic or infinite domains respectively

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Ringing/Gibbs Oscillations:** Observed in the reconstructed posterior near sharp edges. Indicates N is too low or basis mismatch for discontinuous densities
  - **Mass Leakage:** If the domain is poorly chosen, probability mass may "wrap around" due to the circular convolution assumption inherent in FFT
  - **Dimensional Explosion:** Attempting this in >3-4 dimensions without separability checks will likely crash memory

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Gaussian-to-Gaussian Update:** Verify math correctness. A Gaussian prior multiplied by a Gaussian likelihood should yield an analytically known Gaussian posterior. Check if spectral coefficients match
  2. **Uniform Prior Test:** Stress test. Use a Uniform prior (discontinuous) and observe the Gibbs phenomenon. Plot the error against increasing N to verify the O(1/k) decay rate
  3. **Sequential Filtering:** Simulate a time-step update where Posterior(t) becomes Prior(t+1). Monitor stability: does the variance shrink correctly, or do numerical artifacts accumulate?

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can an automated procedure be developed to optimally select the orthogonal basis and resolution N based on the properties of the prior and likelihood?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that an "automated procedure for choosing the optimal basis... would greatly enhance the method’s robustness and usability."
- **Why unresolved:** The current framework requires manual matching of the basis to the function's domain and boundary conditions (e.g., Fourier for periodic, Hermite for infinite).
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An algorithm that dynamically minimizes truncation error by selecting from a library of bases without user intervention.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can tensor decomposition techniques, such as the Tensor-Train format, be effectively integrated to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper suggests combining the framework with "tensor decomposition techniques... to allow for efficient representation... thereby mitigating the exponential scaling."
- **Why unresolved:** The standard approach uses a tensor product basis where coefficients scale as N^d, making it impractical for high dimensions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified algorithm demonstrating polynomial complexity in high-dimensional settings while maintaining spectral accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the framework be modified to handle discontinuous or heavy-tailed distributions without succumbing to the Gibbs phenomenon or slow spectral decay?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The text notes the method "faces significant difficulties" with non-smooth functions and that such problems are "not amenable... without significant modification."
- **Why unresolved:** The efficiency of the spectral truncation relies on smoothness; discontinuous functions result in only algebraic decay (O(1/|k|)) of coefficients.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A rigorous extension of the Convolution Theorem within this framework that handles discontinuities with spectral accuracy.

## Limitations
- Method efficiency degrades significantly for discontinuous or heavy-tailed distributions due to slow spectral decay (O(1/|k|))
- High-dimensional scalability remains challenging as tensor-product basis scales as N^d coefficients
- Requires careful basis selection matching domain properties (periodic vs. non-periodic vs. infinite)

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mathematical framework linking Bayesian updates to spectral convolution is sound and well-proven (Theorem 3.1). The FFT acceleration mechanism is standard and correctly applied. The relationship between function smoothness and spectral decay rate is rigorously established (Theorem 5.1).
- **Medium Confidence:** The practical efficiency claims depend heavily on the choice of basis, domain, and distribution characteristics. While the paper provides theoretical guidance, real-world performance will vary significantly based on these factors. The truncation error analysis is sound but lacks comprehensive empirical validation across diverse distribution types.
- **Low Confidence:** The method's extension to high-dimensional problems through low-rank tensor decompositions is mentioned but not demonstrated. The paper provides no empirical evidence of how this method compares to established techniques (MCMC, VI) on practical inference problems beyond simple Gaussian cases.

## Next Checks

1. **High-Dimensional Scalability Test:** Implement a 5-10 dimensional Bayesian inference problem using tensor-product Fourier basis with low-rank approximation. Measure actual computational time and memory usage compared to naive MCMC, varying both dimension d and rank truncation parameter. Verify whether the claimed O(N log N) advantage persists.

2. **Distribution Robustness Benchmark:** Create a benchmark suite testing the method on various distribution pairs: (a) Smooth Gaussians (expected to excel), (b) Heavy-tailed distributions (Cauchy-like), (c) Discontinuous uniform priors, (d) Multi-modal distributions. For each, measure: (i) convergence rate of spectral coefficients, (ii) posterior reconstruction error vs. N, (iii) computational time. Compare against analytical posteriors where available.

3. **Sequential Stability Analysis:** Implement a particle filtering-like sequential update where the posterior from time t becomes the prior for time t+1. Track: (a) numerical drift in total probability mass across updates, (b) accumulation of Gibbs oscillations if using discontinuous distributions, (c) variance tracking accuracy over multiple updates. This tests the method's suitability for online/real-time applications.
