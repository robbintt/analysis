# A Systematic Study of Deep Learning Models and xAI Methods for Region-of-Interest Detection in MRI Scans

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.14151
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14151
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: ResNet50 achieved AUC 0.8184 and accuracy 0.74 for meniscus injury ROI detection in knee MRI

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates deep learning architectures and explainable AI methods for automated region-of-interest detection in knee MRI scans, specifically targeting meniscus injuries. The research compares supervised models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformer) with self-supervised approaches (U-Net + MLP classifier) while integrating xAI techniques like Grad-CAM for interpretability. ResNet50 demonstrated superior performance with AUC of 0.8184 and accuracy of 0.74, outperforming both transformer-based models and hybrid U-Net approaches. The study bridges the gap between algorithmic accuracy and clinical utility by providing actionable insights for automating ROI detection in MRI scans.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated multiple deep learning architectures including supervised models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformer) and self-supervised approaches combining U-Net with MLP classifiers for MRI analysis. XAI techniques, particularly Grad-CAM, were integrated to provide interpretability for clinical validation. Models were trained and tested on knee MRI datasets focused on meniscus injury detection, with performance metrics including accuracy, AUC, and qualitative assessments of xAI-generated explanations. The comparative analysis examined both classification performance and the clinical utility of interpretability methods across different architectural approaches.

## Key Results
- ResNet50 achieved the highest performance with AUC of 0.8184 and accuracy of 0.74
- Transformer-based models underperformed, likely due to limited data and lack of domain-specific pretraining
- Grad-CAM provided the most clinically meaningful explanations across all architectures
- Hybrid U-Net + MLP models showed lower classification performance despite potential for spatial feature leveraging

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of ResNet50 stems from its effective feature extraction capabilities through convolutional layers that capture hierarchical spatial patterns in MRI scans. Transfer learning from ImageNet pretraining provides a strong initialization for medical imaging tasks, allowing the model to leverage learned low-level features. The convolutional architecture naturally aligns with the grid-like structure of MRI data, enabling efficient spatial feature learning. Grad-CAM enhances interpretability by highlighting regions that contribute most to classification decisions, creating visual explanations that clinicians can validate against their expertise.

## Foundational Learning
- MRI Image Processing: Understanding how medical imaging data differs from natural images in terms of resolution, contrast, and noise patterns
- Transfer Learning Principles: Why pretrained CNN weights accelerate convergence and improve performance on limited medical datasets
- Explainable AI Fundamentals: How gradient-based methods like Grad-CAM generate interpretable heatmaps from black-box models
- Deep Learning Architectures: Differences between CNNs, transformers, and hybrid approaches for medical image analysis
- Performance Metrics in Medical AI: Understanding AUC, accuracy, and their clinical relevance for diagnostic systems

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: MRI Scan -> Preprocessing -> Deep Learning Model (ResNet50/InceptionV3/ViT) -> Classification Output -> Grad-CAM Heatmap -> Clinical Validation

Critical Path: Data Preprocessing → Model Inference → xAI Explanation Generation → Clinical Interpretation

Design Tradeoffs:
- CNN vs Transformer: CNNs excel with limited data and spatial hierarchies; transformers need more data but offer global context
- Supervised vs Self-supervised: Supervised provides direct classification; self-supervised enables feature learning but adds complexity
- Interpretability vs Performance: xAI methods add overhead but are essential for clinical adoption

Failure Signatures:
- Low AUC with high accuracy indicates class imbalance issues
- Inconsistent Grad-CAM patterns suggest model instability or data quality problems
- Poor generalization across patients indicates overfitting to specific acquisition protocols

Three First Experiments:
1. Compare ResNet50 with and without ImageNet pretraining on the same MRI dataset
2. Generate Grad-CAM heatmaps for correctly and incorrectly classified samples to identify failure patterns
3. Test model performance with varying input resolutions to find optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size for transformer-based models may have contributed to their underperformance
- Focus on meniscus injuries in knee MRI may not generalize to other anatomical regions or imaging protocols
- Evaluation of xAI methods was primarily visual and qualitative, lacking quantitative interpretability metrics

## Confidence
- High confidence in ResNet50's superior performance metrics (AUC 0.8184, accuracy 0.74) for this specific meniscus injury detection task
- Medium confidence in transformer models' underperformance due to data limitation caveats
- Medium confidence in Grad-CAM's clinical interpretability value pending quantitative validation
- Low confidence in generalizability of hybrid U-Net + MLP approach potential given lower classification performance

## Next Checks
1. Test the top-performing models (ResNet50 and Vision Transformer) on an external, independently collected knee MRI dataset to assess true generalizability
2. Conduct a clinician validation study comparing Grad-CAM-generated heatmaps against radiologist-identified ROIs using quantitative overlap metrics
3. Evaluate model performance with data augmentation and domain-specific pretraining for transformer architectures to determine if limited data explains their underperformance
