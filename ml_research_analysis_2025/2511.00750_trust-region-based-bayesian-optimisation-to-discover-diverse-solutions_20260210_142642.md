# Trust Region-Based Bayesian Optimisation to Discover Diverse Solutions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.00750
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00750
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Proposed methods outperform ROBOT baseline on 24 BBOB benchmark functions, especially in 10-20 dimensions, with interleaving approach showing best results

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of finding diverse solutions in high-dimensional black-box optimization using trust-region-based Bayesian optimization. The authors extend the TuRBO1 algorithm by incorporating diversity constraints at both the trust region center selection and candidate acquisition stages. Two variants are proposed: divTuRBO1-seq (sequential execution) and divTuRBO1-int (interleaving with shared progress across runs). Experimental results on 24 BBOB benchmark functions (2-20 dimensions) demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform the baseline ROBOT algorithm, particularly in higher dimensions, while successfully discovering diverse solution sets that maintain high objective values.

## Method Summary
The method extends TuRBO1 by adding diversity constraints to the trust region optimization process. At each iteration, the trust region center is selected based on both objective value and minimum distance threshold τ from existing diverse solutions. If no candidates satisfy the diversity constraint for three consecutive iterations, a restart is triggered. The acquisition function is modified to filter candidates by the distance threshold, selecting the top n candidates that maintain minimum distance from reference solutions. Two execution modes are proposed: sequential runs (divTuRBO1-seq) where each run's output becomes the reference set for the next, and interleaving (divTuRBO1-int) where multiple runs share diverse elites periodically across phases. The approach maintains TuRBO1's adaptive trust region sizing while ensuring discovered solutions remain spread apart in the search space.

## Key Results
- divTuRBO1 methods significantly outperform ROBOT baseline on 22 of 24 BBOB functions in 10-20 dimensional spaces
- Interleaving approach with 1-5 phases performs best, while performance degrades with excessive phases (>10)
- divTuRBO1-int achieves comparable results to divTuRBO1-seq in most cases, with interleaving showing particular advantage in high-dimensional spaces
- Solutions successfully maintain diversity constraints while achieving high objective values across all tested dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Diversity-Constrained Trust Region Centering
Repositioning trust region centers to prioritize diverse high-quality solutions enables discovery of spread solutions in high-dimensional spaces. At each iteration, the center is set to the best solution within the region that satisfies div(x, y) ≥ τ against reference set X_div. If no solutions meet the threshold for three consecutive iterations, the trust region restarts from a random global sample. This ensures trust regions are constrained to avoid previously discovered elites, naturally exploring underexplored high-value regions.

### Mechanism 2: Acquisition Filtering by Distance Threshold
Modifying acquisition function selection to enforce minimum distance from reference solutions maintains diversity without requiring explicit multi-objective formulation. After surrogate prediction, the acquisition function selects top n candidates satisfying div(x, y) ≥ τ with X_div. When no candidates satisfy the threshold, the farthest candidate is selected as fallback, pushing exploration outward. This leverages local surrogate accuracy within trust regions to identify high-value diverse candidates when filtered appropriately.

### Mechanism 3: Interleaved Information Sharing Across Runs
Interleaving multiple divTuRBO1 runs with periodic elite-sharing improves diversity discovery in high dimensions compared to fully sequential execution. m parallel divTuRBO1 runs are divided into max phases, with each run pausing after B' evaluations to share its current best diverse elite. Later phases resume with updated X_div from all runs, allowing them to avoid regions explored by sibling runs. This prevents redundant exploration and improves collective coverage of the solution space.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gaussian Process Surrogate Models**: Core prediction engine for BO; trust region boundaries feed into GP to constrain predictions to local hypercubes. Quick check: Can you explain why GP surrogate accuracy degrades in dimensions >20 without trust region constraints?

- **Trust Region Dynamics**: divTuRBO1 inherits TuRBO1's adaptive hypercube sizing; understanding when/why trust regions expand or contract is essential for debugging. Quick check: What triggers a trust region restart in standard TuRBO1, and how does divTuRBO1 modify this condition?

- **Diversity Threshold τ and Euclidean Distance**: The diversity constraint is defined by minimum pairwise distance; selecting appropriate τ is problem-dependent and critical for solution quality. Quick check: If τ = 2.0 in a [-5, 5]^20 hypercube, approximately how many well-separated solutions could theoretically fit?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: divTuRBO1 -> divTuRBO1-seq/divTuRBO1-int -> BBOB benchmark functions
- **Critical path**: 1) Initialize m divTuRBO1 runs with random samples 2) For each iteration: select diverse center → update trust region → query surrogate → filter candidates by τ → evaluate black-box → update X_global and X_tr 3) At phase boundary: collect best diverse elite from each run, update X_div for all runs 4) Repeat until budget exhausted; return X_div
- **Design tradeoffs**: Sequential vs Interleaved (sequential simpler; interleaved better diversity in high-D but requires coordination); Number of phases (1-5 recommended; >10 risks insufficient evaluations); τ selection (small τ allows denser solutions but may reduce quality; large τ enforces spread but may exclude high-value regions)
- **Failure signatures**: Frequent trust region restarts indicate τ too large for problem's viable solution regions; High variance across runs in 3-D with low budget suggests surrogate undertrained; ROBOT outperforming on F23 suggests rugged landscapes may benefit from simultaneous multi-trust-region exploration
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate 2-D visualization on F1-F6 with τ = 0.1, 1.0, 2.0 to validate diversity spread visually 2) Run divTuRBO1-seq vs divTuRBO1-int vs ROBOT on F1 in 10-D; compare mean objective of 10 diverse solutions 3) Ablation on max phases: Test divTuRBO1-int with phases = 1, 5, 10 on F3 in 20-D; observe performance degradation at 10+ phases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How do divTuRBO1-seq and divTuRBO1-int perform on real-world diversity optimisation tasks in molecular biology, engineering, or physics? The conclusion states it would be "beneficial to design efficient applications for real-world problems, such as those in molecular biology, engineering, and physics." This remains unresolved as the current study is restricted to synthetic BBOB benchmark functions.

- **Open Question 2**: Why does the baseline ROBOT algorithm outperform the proposed methods on highly rugged, multi-modal functions like F23? The results section notes that "F23 gets the best results from ROBOT" as an exception to the general trend. This anomaly is identified but not analyzed whether the failure is due to the diversity constraint, trust region management, or the interleaving process on rugged landscapes.

- **Open Question 3**: How does the performance of the proposed interleaving approach scale in search spaces with significantly more than 20 dimensions? The introduction motivates the work by the need to improve scalability "when the problem space scales to more dimensions," yet the experimental evaluation stops at 20 dimensions. While the method builds on TuRBO (designed for high dimensions), the added complexity of managing diverse reference sets in the interleaving approach might introduce scaling bottlenecks not visible at D ≤ 20.

## Limitations

- Exact GP surrogate model configuration (kernel type, hyperparameter priors, training procedure) and acquisition function specifics are not specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Diversity threshold τ selection is critical but lacks systematic guidance - the choice of τ = 0.1 vs 2.0 significantly impacts solution quality but selection criteria remain unclear
- Experimental budget calculation (100 + 10·D)·m evaluations per method assumes equal resource allocation across approaches, but this may not be optimal for all algorithms

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of diversity-constrained trust region centering and acquisition filtering is well-specified and theoretically sound. The experimental design using BBOB benchmarks is standard and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence**: The interleaving mechanism's effectiveness in high dimensions is demonstrated but the optimal number of phases (1-5) is empirical rather than theoretically derived. The comparison with ROBOT, while showing significant improvements, may depend on implementation details not fully specified.
- **Low Confidence**: The paper's claim that the proposed methods "successfully discover diverse solution sets while maintaining high objective values" lacks rigorous statistical analysis of solution quality distribution beyond mean values. The assertion that ROBOT underperforms due to single trust region limitations is plausible but not definitively proven.

## Next Checks

1. Implement a systematic parameter sweep for τ values across different dimensionalities to establish selection guidelines and identify breaking points where diversity constraints become too restrictive
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing divTuRBO1 performance with and without the three-consecutive-null-X_τ restart condition to quantify its impact on solution quality and computational efficiency
3. Replicate the 20-D experiments on F23 (highly multimodal function) with extended budget to test whether the proposed methods maintain their advantage in rugged landscapes or if ROBOT's multi-trust-region approach becomes more effective
