# Attention over Scene Graphs: Indoor Scene Representations Toward CSAI Classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.26457
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26457
- **Reference count**: 36
- **Primary result**: Scene graph approach achieves 81.27% balanced accuracy on Places8 and 74.27% on real-world CSAI evaluation

## Executive Summary
This work introduces ASGRA, a method for indoor scene classification and CSAI detection that leverages structured scene graph representations instead of raw pixel data. The approach converts images into scene graphs capturing object relationships and spatial layouts, then uses Graph Attention Networks for inference. This design provides inherent explainability through object and relationship identification while enabling privacy-preserving training without direct access to sensitive images. The method demonstrates strong performance on the Places8 dataset with 81.27% balanced accuracy and shows practical viability with 74.27% accuracy on real-world CSAI evaluation using law enforcement data.

## Method Summary
ASGRA processes indoor scenes by first converting images into structured scene graphs that capture objects, their relationships, and spatial arrangements. These graphs serve as input to Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for classification. The scene graph generation extracts visual features and encodes spatial relationships between objects, creating a rich representation that preserves contextual information. For CSAI classification, the method uses synthetic data generation to train models without requiring direct access to sensitive images, addressing privacy concerns. The attention mechanism in GATs allows the model to focus on relevant object relationships during inference, providing explainable predictions through the identified graph structure.

## Key Results
- Achieved 81.27% balanced accuracy on Places8 dataset, surpassing traditional image-based methods
- Obtained 74.27% balanced accuracy on real-world CSAI evaluation with law enforcement using RCPD dataset
- Demonstrated inherent explainability through object and relationship identification in scene graphs
- Showed privacy preservation capability by enabling training without direct access to sensitive images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the structured nature of indoor scenes through graph representations. Scene graphs capture the semantic relationships between objects (like "chair near table" or "person on bed") and their spatial arrangements, which are crucial for understanding indoor environments. Graph Attention Networks can then process these relationships by attending to the most relevant object connections for classification. This structured approach preserves contextual information that might be lost in traditional pixel-based methods, while the attention mechanism provides interpretability by highlighting which object relationships drive predictions. The synthetic data generation for CSAI allows models to learn patterns without exposing analysts to harmful content, maintaining privacy while preserving detection capability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Scene Graphs**: Why needed - To capture object relationships and spatial layouts in indoor environments; Quick check - Can the graph accurately represent "person sitting on chair next to table"?
- **Graph Attention Networks**: Why needed - To process structured graph data while focusing on relevant relationships; Quick check - Does the attention mechanism highlight meaningful object connections?
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Why needed - To train CSAI classifiers without exposing analysts to harmful content; Quick check - Do synthetically generated scenes preserve critical CSAI patterns?
- **Spatial Relationships Encoding**: Why needed - To capture the arrangement of objects which is crucial for indoor scene understanding; Quick check - Can the model distinguish between "person in front of TV" vs "person behind TV"?
- **Privacy-Preserving Training**: Why needed - To enable law enforcement to develop detection capabilities without storing harmful content; Quick check - Does the trained model maintain performance without direct access to real CSAI images?
- **Balanced Accuracy**: Why needed - To fairly evaluate performance across imbalanced classes common in CSAI datasets; Quick check - Does the metric appropriately reflect minority class detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image -> Scene Graph Generation -> Graph Attention Network -> Classification

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from raw image input through scene graph generation to GAT processing and final classification. Scene graph generation must accurately extract objects and relationships, as errors here propagate through the entire pipeline. The GAT then processes this structured information, with attention mechanisms focusing on the most relevant object relationships for the classification task.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational complexity (scene graph generation is expensive) for improved interpretability and privacy preservation. While pixel-based methods are faster, they lack the structured understanding and explainability that scene graphs provide. The synthetic data approach sacrifices some realism for privacy benefits and ethical training.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may fail when scene graphs poorly represent the actual image content, such as when objects are occluded or when complex relationships cannot be accurately captured. Performance degradation occurs if the synthetic data generation doesn't adequately represent real CSAI patterns, leading to domain shift issues. The method may also struggle with scenes containing objects not well-represented in training data or with unusual spatial arrangements.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test scene graph generation accuracy on benchmark datasets to ensure object and relationship extraction quality
2. Evaluate GAT performance with different attention mechanisms to identify optimal configuration
3. Compare synthetic data generation quality against real CSAI samples to assess domain adaptation capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on synthetic data generation for CSAI classification, which may not fully capture real CSAI complexity
- Places8 dataset covers only 8 indoor scene categories, limiting generalizability to diverse environments
- Performance gap between Places8 (81.27%) and real-world CSAI (74.27%) suggests domain adaptation challenges

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Scene graph approach outperforms traditional image-based methods on Places8
- **Medium confidence**: Explainability claims through object and relationship identification are valid but not quantitatively validated
- **Medium confidence**: Privacy preservation benefits are theoretically sound but not empirically validated in terms of actual privacy risk reduction

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on additional indoor scene datasets with more diverse categories to assess generalizability beyond Places8
2. Conduct user studies to quantify the actual explainability benefits and measure how well human analysts can interpret the model's scene graph reasoning
3. Implement and evaluate the model in a real-world CSAI detection workflow with law enforcement to assess practical deployment challenges and privacy preservation effectiveness
