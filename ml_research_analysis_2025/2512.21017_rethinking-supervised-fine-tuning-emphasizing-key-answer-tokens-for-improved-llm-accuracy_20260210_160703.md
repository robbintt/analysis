# Rethinking Supervised Fine-Tuning: Emphasizing Key Answer Tokens for Improved LLM Accuracy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.21017
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21017
- Authors: Xiaofeng Shi; Qian Kou; Yuduo Li; Hua Zhou
- Reference count: 4
- Key outcome: SFT-Key achieves 4.8% accuracy improvement over conventional SFT and 4.5% over SFT-CoT on CoT datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach called SFT-Key that focuses on key answer tokens rather than entire responses. The method identifies and emphasizes crucial tokens in responses during training, leading to improved accuracy on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. The approach addresses a limitation of conventional SFT where all tokens are treated equally, despite some being more critical for reasoning quality.

## Method Summary
SFT-Key modifies the standard SFT loss function by introducing token-level weighting that emphasizes key answer tokens. The method identifies important tokens through either human annotation or automatic selection based on their contribution to the final answer. During training, these key tokens receive higher weight in the loss calculation, effectively guiding the model to pay more attention to critical reasoning steps. The approach is compatible with existing SFT pipelines and requires only minimal modifications to the training process.

## Key Results
- 4.8% accuracy improvement over conventional SFT on CoT datasets
- 4.5% improvement over SFT-CoT baseline
- Demonstrated effectiveness across multiple 7B parameter models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by recognizing that not all tokens in a response contribute equally to the final answer quality. In reasoning tasks, certain tokens represent critical logical steps or key conclusions. By emphasizing these tokens during training, the model learns to focus on the most important aspects of the reasoning process rather than treating all tokens uniformly.

## Foundational Learning
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning: Sequential logical steps leading to conclusions; needed for understanding why token-level weighting matters in reasoning tasks
- Supervised fine-tuning loss functions: Standard cross-entropy training; needed to understand how SFT-Key modifies conventional approaches
- Token importance scoring: Methods for identifying critical tokens; needed to grasp how key tokens are selected

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Base LLM -> Token Weighting Module -> Modified Loss Function -> Trained Model
**Critical Path:** Token identification → Weight assignment → Loss computation → Parameter updates
**Design Tradeoffs:** Higher computational overhead for token weighting vs. improved accuracy; potential overfitting to annotated tokens
**Failure Signatures:** Over-emphasis on specific tokens leading to brittle reasoning; performance degradation on non-reasoning tasks
**First Experiments:** 1) Baseline SFT comparison on CoT tasks, 2) Key token ablation study, 3) Cross-dataset generalization test

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focused on CoT datasets, unclear generalizability to other task types
- Key token selection relies on human annotation for some datasets, introducing potential bias
- Limited testing to 7B parameter models, scalability to larger models unknown

## Confidence
High confidence in methodological innovation and technical soundness
Medium confidence in claimed accuracy improvements given limited dataset diversity
Low confidence in generalizability across different task types and model scales

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SFT-Key across diverse task categories beyond reasoning (e.g., factual QA, summarization, code generation)
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing different key-token selection strategies on the same datasets
3. Test the approach with larger model scales (13B, 30B, 70B) and different base model families
