# DeepSeek in Healthcare: A Survey of Capabilities, Risks, and Clinical Applications of Open-Source Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.01257
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01257
- Reference count: 40
- DeepSeek-R1 achieves strong performance on medical benchmarks like USMLE while being more susceptible to bias and adversarial manipulation than closed models

## Executive Summary
DeepSeek-R1 is an open-source large language model that combines Mixture of Experts (MoE), Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and reinforcement learning to deliver structured problem-solving capabilities in healthcare and other domains. The model achieves competitive performance on medical benchmarks such as USMLE while operating at significantly lower computational cost than proprietary alternatives. However, its open architecture and reasoning mechanisms make it more vulnerable to bias, misinformation, and adversarial attacks, particularly in multilingual and sensitive clinical contexts.

## Method Summary
The model employs a three-stage training pipeline: pretraining on a massive MoE backbone (DeepSeek-V3) with Multihead Latent Attention, supervised fine-tuning on curated Chain-of-Thought reasoning data, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop reasoning capabilities. The approach leverages sparse expert activation to reduce inference costs while maintaining reasoning depth through structured intermediate steps. The final architecture consists of a MoE foundation, reasoning engine, alignment layer, and inference output module.

## Key Results
- Achieves strong performance on USMLE and AIME benchmarks, comparable to proprietary models
- Reduces inference costs through MoE architecture while preserving reasoning depth
- Shows increased vulnerability to bias, misinformation, and adversarial manipulation compared to closed models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sparse Expert Activation for Cost Efficiency
The MoE architecture reduces inference costs by selectively activating parameters through a routing mechanism that engages only relevant expert subnetworks for specific input domains. This targets computational load while preserving model capacity, assuming the routing logic correctly identifies input domains and possesses distinct expert modules for different tasks.

### Mechanism 2: Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning Emergence (GRPO)
GRPO enables the model to develop structured Chain-of-Thought capabilities through a reward-based loop where it generates reasoning traces, receives feedback on accuracy and logical coherence, and updates its policy. This trial-and-error process encourages self-reflection and discovery of intermediate reasoning steps, assuming reward signals accurately proxy for correct reasoning rather than just plausible text.

### Mechanism 3: Chain-of-Thought Structured Decomposition
CoT serves as the primary interface for complex problem-solving by breaking multi-step queries into verifiable intermediate states, improving performance on structured benchmarks like USMLE. The model outputs intermediate reasoning steps before generating final answers, effectively offloading cognitive work to sequential generation, assuming context windows are large enough to contain traces without drifting.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) vs. GRPO**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the shift from simple supervised fine-tuning to policy optimization is required to understand why the model exhibits emergent reasoning
  - Quick check question: Does GRPO optimize for the probability of the next token (standard SFT) or the cumulative reward of a generated reasoning sequence?

- **Concept: Mixture of Experts (MoE) Sparsity**
  - Why needed here: Cost-efficiency claims rely entirely on how sparse the model is, requiring distinction between total parameter count and active parameter count
  - Quick check question: If an MoE model has 67B total parameters but only activates 7B per token, how does that change the latency profile compared to a dense 7B model?

- **Concept: Adversarial Alignment & Jailbreaking**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly warns that open models and CoT mechanisms are vulnerable to manipulation, requiring understanding of how safety alignment can be stripped
  - Quick check question: Why does an open weight model pose a higher risk for adversarial fine-tuning than a closed API model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Base Model -> DeepSeek-V3 (MoE Foundation) -> Reasoning Engine -> Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Module + Multihead Latent Attention (MLA) -> Alignment Layer -> Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + GRPO (Reinforcement Learning) -> Inference Output -> Structured reasoning trace → Final synthesized answer

- **Critical path:** Pretraining on DeepSeek-V3 MoE backbone → SFT on high-quality CoT data for reasoning formatting → GRPO reinforcement learning to refine logic and depth → Distillation/Deployment into smaller variants

- **Design tradeoffs:** Reasoning Depth vs. Latency (token-intensive reasoning increases accuracy but slows inference), Openness vs. Safety (MIT license enables local deployment but exposes model to adversarial fine-tuning), Specialization vs. Fluency (excels in logic/math/medicine but shows subpar performance in general natural language creativity)

- **Failure signatures:** Reward Hacking (producing formatted but factually empty responses), H-CoT (Hijacking Chain-of-Thought where adversarial prompts bypass safety constraints), Bias Amplification (three times more prone to bias than Claude-3 Opus, particularly in multilingual contexts)

- **First 3 experiments:** Latency vs. Token Count Analysis (plot inference time against CoT length), Adversarial Probe (attempt H-CoT prompts to bypass safety), Specialist Fine-tuning (test modularity and catastrophic forgetting on niche local datasets)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does DeepSeek-R1 maintain diagnostic accuracy comparable to proprietary models when validated across a wider range of medical specialties and real-world clinical datasets? Current evaluations are limited to specific domains using benchmark datasets rather than diverse clinical populations.

- **Open Question 2:** Can hybrid reinforcement learning methods or optimization algorithms successfully resolve the tension between token-intensive reasoning and the need for low-latency inference? Current MoE and CoT architecture prioritizes depth over speed, hindering deployment in real-time environments.

- **Open Question 3:** What specific alignment strategies are required to effectively mitigate the model's vulnerability to adversarial manipulation, such as Hijacking Chain-of-Thought and fine-tuning attacks? The transparency of model weights allows malicious actors to bypass safety alignment, and current RL-based safety measures suffer from reward gaming issues.

## Limitations

- Clinical effectiveness claims are based on benchmark performance rather than direct clinical validation or real-world patient outcome improvement
- Increased susceptibility to bias and misinformation, particularly in multilingual contexts, represents significant limitation for healthcare deployment
- Security implications of open-source deployment in healthcare settings with sensitive patient data remain underexplored

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Technical architecture claims (MoE, CoT, GRPO mechanisms) and benchmark performance metrics (USMLE, AIME scores)
- **Medium Confidence:** Cost efficiency claims and open-source licensing benefits
- **Low Confidence:** Clinical applicability claims and bias susceptibility assessments without empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Clinical Workflow Integration Test:** Deploy DeepSeek-R1 in a simulated clinical environment with actual healthcare professionals to evaluate usability, accuracy in context, and workflow disruption compared to existing solutions.

2. **Bias and Safety Red-Teaming:** Conduct systematic adversarial testing across multiple languages and cultural contexts to quantify the claimed "three times more prone to bias" assertion and identify specific failure modes.

3. **Real-World Performance Benchmarking:** Compare DeepSeek-R1's performance against proprietary models on actual patient case data and medical decision-making tasks, measuring not just accuracy but also reasoning quality and hallucination rates in clinical contexts.
