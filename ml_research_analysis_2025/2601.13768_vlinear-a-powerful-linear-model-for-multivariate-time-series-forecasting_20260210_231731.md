# vLinear: A Powerful Linear Model for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.13768
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13768
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** Achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior computational efficiency using a linear-based forecaster.

## Executive Summary
vLinear introduces a novel linear model for multivariate time series forecasting that achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior computational efficiency. The core innovation is vecTrans, a lightweight module that models multivariate correlations using a learnable rank-1 vector, reducing computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N). This is paired with WFMLoss, a final-series-oriented flow matching loss that incorporates path- and horizon-weighted strategies to improve forecasting accuracy. The method consistently outperforms existing approaches across 22 benchmarks and 124 forecasting settings, while consuming significantly fewer FLOPs and less GPU memory than attention-based alternatives.

## Method Summary
vLinear is a linear-based time series forecaster that leverages two key innovations: vecTrans and WFMLoss. vecTrans replaces standard self-attention with a rank-1 vector multiplication, modeling multivariate correlations in O(N) complexity. WFMLoss modifies flow matching by optimizing for the final predicted series directly rather than the intermediate velocity field, incorporating path-weighting and horizon-weighting strategies. The model consists of input normalization, embedding, stacked vecTrans-MLP blocks, and a final projection layer that generates velocity fields for deterministic inference.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 22 benchmarks and 124 forecasting settings
- Reduces computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N) using vecTrans
- Delivers up to 5× speedup in inference compared to attention-based alternatives
- WFMLoss outperforms velocity-oriented baselines by 2-4% in MSE metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Rank-1 Multivariate Aggregation (vecTrans)
The vecTrans module models multivariate correlations using a learnable rank-1 matrix (a single vector) rather than a full input-dependent attention matrix. This reduces complexity from O(N²) to O(N) while preserving performance. The core assumption is that attention matrices in time series forecasting exhibit low-rank structure, allowing a single global weighted average to capture cross-variate dependencies.

### Mechanism 2: Final-Series-Oriented Flow Matching (WFMLoss)
WFMLoss optimizes for the final predicted series directly rather than the intermediate velocity field. Instead of matching ground-truth velocity, it projects the predicted velocity back to the final time step and computes error there, incorporating path-weighting (2-t)^{-0.5} to emphasize later stages. The assumption is that velocity-oriented objectives are suboptimal because they force the model to memorize initial random noise rather than focusing on the deterministic target.

### Mechanism 3: Linearized Deterministic Inference
If the flow-matching network is linear, stochastic inference is mathematically equivalent to a deterministic pass from an all-zero state. This allows bypassing sampling loops and running as a standard deterministic regressor during inference, leveraging the linearity of the projection layer.

## Foundational Learning

- **Flow Matching (FM)**: Why needed: vLinear adopts the FM framework for training; understanding how continuous-time velocity fields transform noise into data is necessary to grasp WFMLoss modifications. Quick check: How does a velocity field differ from a direct prediction in a generative model?
- **Low-Rank Attention Approximation**: Why needed: The core efficiency of vecTrans relies on the assumption that attention matrices can be approximated by low-rank matrices without losing predictive power. Quick check: Why does standard self-attention scale quadratically with sequence length N?
- **Linear vs. Non-Linear Layers in Flow Models**: Why needed: The simplified inference relies entirely on the linearity of the WFMLin layer. Quick check: Does f(A + B) = f(A) + f(B) hold for a standard ReLU layer? Does it hold for a pure Linear layer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Norm -> Embedding -> Stacked [vecTrans + MLP] blocks -> Projection -> WFMBlock
- **Critical path:** vecTrans must be implemented as a matrix-vector multiplication followed by broadcasting to ensure O(N) complexity. WFMLoss requires sampling t, constructing noisy state, predicting velocity, projecting to final series, and computing weighted MAE.
- **Design tradeoffs:** vecTrans is extremely fast (5× speedup) but restricts multivariate interaction to a global weighted sum. Training uses noise injection for robustness while inference uses the "all-zero" trick for determinism and speed.
- **Failure signatures:** Low-Rank Bottleneck (validation loss plateaus early), Inference Mismatch (results differ significantly from training).
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replace attention module in existing Transformer with vecTrans to confirm 5× speedup on Traffic/ECL datasets
  2. Train vLinear with standard MSE vs. WFMLoss to isolate performance gain from final-series-oriented objective
  3. Test Rank-k variant with k > 1 on PEMS datasets to see if higher rank improves performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the theoretical optimality of the horizon-weighted strategy in WFMLoss degrade significantly for time series that violate the first-order Markov process or Laplace distribution assumptions? The paper proves optimality only under these assumptions but doesn't analyze performance on datasets that violate them.

### Open Question 2
Why does increasing the rank of the vecTrans matrix beyond rank-1 fail to improve performance? The paper empirically observes rank-1 sufficiency but doesn't provide theoretical explanation for why higher-rank modeling fails to capture additional information.

### Open Question 3
Does the restriction of the velocity network to a single linear layer fundamentally limit the model's ability to learn complex non-linear generation trajectories? While a single linear layer outperforms multi-layer variants, this leaves open whether this choice is a universal inductive bias or a limitation for datasets requiring highly non-linear generative paths.

## Limitations

- vecTrans's rank-1 constraint may be insufficient for datasets with complex, non-redundant cross-variate interactions
- The critical OrthoTrans preprocessing step requires external OLinear implementation not detailed in the paper
- Deterministic inference (all-zero start) is elegant for speed but limits probabilistic uncertainty estimation capabilities

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** vecTrans achieves claimed computational speedup (O(N²) → O(N)) and theoretical equivalence of deterministic inference
- **Medium Confidence:** WFMLoss improves performance over velocity-oriented objectives, though "suboptimal" claim needs more corpus support
- **Medium Confidence:** General superiority over SOTA is well-supported, but specific component contributions could be further isolated

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce efficiency claim: Replace attention module in existing Transformer with vecTrans on Traffic/ECL datasets to confirm 5× inference speedup
2. Isolate loss contribution: Train vLinear with standard MSE vs. WFMLoss to measure isolated performance gain from final-series-oriented objective
3. Test rank sensitivity: Evaluate Rank-k variant with k > 1 on PEMS datasets to determine if higher rank improves expressivity or merely increases compute
