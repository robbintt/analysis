core_contribution: This paper tackles suicide risk assessment from social media posts,
  a challenging task due to severe class imbalance, ordinal and categorical risk levels,
  and temporal posting patterns. To address these issues, the authors propose a hierarchical
  dual-head model based on MentalRoBERTa, which combines CORAL ordinal regression
  and standard classification on a shared sequence representation.

# Hierarchical Dual-Head Model for Suicide Risk Assessment via MentalRoBERTa

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.20085
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20085
- **Reference count**: 29
- **Primary result**: Proposed hierarchical dual-head model achieves macro F1 of 0.5098 on augmented suicide risk dataset, outperforming baseline models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of suicide risk assessment from social media posts by proposing a hierarchical dual-head model built on MentalRoBERTa. The model tackles severe class imbalance, ordinal risk levels, and temporal posting patterns through a novel architecture that combines CORAL ordinal regression with standard classification. By incorporating time interval embeddings and a carefully balanced loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3 Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss), the model demonstrates improved performance over existing approaches on a Reddit-based suicide risk dataset.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a hierarchical dual-head model based on MentalRoBERTa to assess suicide risk from social media posts. The architecture processes sequences of exactly 5 consecutive posts using a 3-layer Transformer encoder with explicit time interval embeddings to capture posting behavior dynamics. The model employs a dual-head design that combines CORAL ordinal regression and standard classification on a shared sequence representation. To address efficiency concerns, the first 6 layers of MentalRoBERTa are frozen and mixed-precision training is employed. The model is trained with a combined loss function and evaluated using 5-fold stratified cross-validation, with macro F1 as the primary metric.

## Key Results
- The proposed model achieves a macro F1 of 0.5098 on the augmented dataset
- Significant improvements in MAE and Quadratic Weighted Kappa compared to baseline models
- Demonstrated performance gains over the original imbalanced dataset
- Effective handling of class imbalance through combined loss function approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works by addressing three key challenges in suicide risk assessment: class imbalance through Focal Loss, ordinal nature of risk levels through CORAL regression, and temporal patterns through time interval embeddings. The hierarchical dual-head architecture allows the model to simultaneously capture both ordinal and categorical aspects of suicide risk while the time embeddings enable it to model user posting behavior patterns that may correlate with risk levels.

## Foundational Learning
- **CORAL ordinal regression**: Needed to preserve the natural ordering of suicide risk levels; quick check: ensure model correctly ranks predictions by risk severity
- **Dual-head architecture**: Required to simultaneously handle ordinal and categorical classification tasks; quick check: verify both heads contribute to final predictions
- **Time interval embeddings**: Essential for capturing temporal patterns in posting behavior; quick check: confirm embeddings improve performance over time-agnostic models
- **Combined loss function**: Necessary to balance multiple objectives (ordinal structure, classification accuracy, class imbalance); quick check: validate each loss component contributes positively

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: MentalRoBERTa (layers 1-6 frozen) -> Transformer encoder (3 layers) -> Time embeddings -> Dual-head output (CORAL + Classification)

**Critical path**: Input sequence → Frozen MentalRoBERTa → 3-layer Transformer → Time embeddings → Dual-head prediction → Combined loss

**Design tradeoffs**: Frozen layers improve efficiency but may limit fine-tuning capability; dual-head approach captures multiple aspects of risk but increases complexity

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance on minority classes indicates Focal Loss imbalance; degraded ordinal performance suggests CORAL component issues; time embedding failures manifest as loss of temporal pattern recognition

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test individual loss components (CORAL only, Cross-Entropy only, Focal Loss only) to validate combined approach
2. Evaluate different sequence lengths (1, 3, 5, 10 posts) to assess temporal modeling robustness
3. Compare with single-head baseline to quantify dual-head architecture benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: To what extent does the LLM-based data augmentation introduce semantic drift or distinct stylistic artifacts that the model exploits rather than actual risk signals?
- **Basis in paper**: Section III details using GPT-4 for both generating variants and labeling external data, relying on strict prompts to maintain semantics
- **Why unresolved**: The paper validates performance gains but does not quantify the linguistic similarity or potential "model bias" between the synthetic and original human-authored posts
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A human expert evaluation measuring semantic preservation and stylistic naturalness in the augmented samples compared to the original dataset

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How robust is the hierarchical model to variations in posting frequency and sequence length outside the fixed experimental window of 5 consecutive posts?
- **Basis in paper**: Section II-A states the model constructs sequences of exactly 5 consecutive posts; Section IV evaluates only this specific configuration
- **Why unresolved**: It is unclear if the temporal modeling generalizes to users with sparse posting histories (fewer than 5 posts) or longer-term temporal patterns
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Performance metrics (Macro F1, Kappa) evaluated on variable sequence lengths (e.g., 1 to 20 posts) to test the sensitivity of the attention pooling mechanism

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Does the model maintain high performance when applied to social media platforms with different linguistic constraints, such as Twitter/X's character limits?
- **Basis in paper**: The Introduction and Experiments focus exclusively on Reddit data (r/SuicideWatch, r/depression)
- **Why unresolved**: The domain-specific pre-training of MentalRoBERTa on Reddit may not transfer effectively to platforms with different slang, brevity, or demographic distributions
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Cross-domain evaluation results on a benchmark dataset sourced from a non-Reddit platform

## Limitations
- The model is trained and evaluated exclusively on Reddit data, limiting generalizability to other social media platforms
- The relatively modest macro F1 score of 0.51, despite improvements, indicates the task remains challenging and the solution far from clinical deployment readiness
- The complexity of the model with multiple loss components and dual-head architecture may hinder practical implementation and adoption

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The model architecture design and training methodology are clearly described and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Performance improvements over baselines are statistically significant within the study's experimental framework
- **Medium confidence**: The ordinal classification approach appropriately addresses the nature of suicide risk assessment

## Next Checks
1. External validation on clinically-collected data from healthcare settings to assess real-world applicability beyond social media
2. Ablation studies testing each component (time embeddings, dual-head architecture, loss function weighting) to quantify individual contributions
3. Temporal stability analysis examining model performance across different time periods and user cohorts to evaluate robustness to posting pattern variations
