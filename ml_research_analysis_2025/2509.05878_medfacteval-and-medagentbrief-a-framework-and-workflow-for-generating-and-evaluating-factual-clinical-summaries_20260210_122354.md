# MedFactEval and MedAgentBrief: A Framework and Workflow for Generating and Evaluating Factual Clinical Summaries

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05878
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05878
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: LLM Jury achieves near-perfect agreement with physician gold standard (kappa=81%), offering scalable clinical summary evaluation

## Executive Summary
This work introduces MedFactEval, a framework using an "LLM Jury" of ten models to assess AI-generated clinical summaries against clinician-defined key facts, validated against a seven-physician gold standard with near-perfect agreement (kappa=81%). It also presents MedAgentBrief, a multi-step workflow for generating factual discharge summaries that outperformed single-prompt approaches in fact presence while increasing inference costs. Meta-evaluation showed the LLM Jury's performance was statistically non-inferior to a single human expert (kappa=67%, P<0.001), offering a scalable alternative to expert review. The work provides both a reliable evaluation framework and a high-performing generation workflow for safe AI deployment in clinical documentation.

## Method Summary
The study introduces MedFactEval, which uses a "LLM Jury" of ten diverse models to evaluate whether generated clinical summaries contain specific key facts identified by clinicians. The evaluation compares the LLM Jury's consensus to a seven-physician gold standard panel. MedAgentBrief is a multi-step generation workflow that creates summaries by first drafting from key notes, then iteratively refining with remaining documents while adding provenance tags, and finally verifying citations. The framework focuses evaluation on clinically salient "key facts" rather than global quality metrics, enabling more reliable assessment of factuality in clinical summaries.

## Key Results
- MedFactEval LLM Jury achieved near-perfect agreement with seven-physician gold standard (kappa=81%)
- MedAgentBrief workflow consistently improved factual presence scores over single-prompt baseline for every foundation model tested
- LLM Jury performance was statistically non-inferior to single human expert evaluation (kappa=67%, P<0.001)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: LLM Jury Majority Voting Reduces Individual Model Noise
A majority-vote ensemble of multiple LLMs (10 models) provides more reliable fact presence evaluation than any single model. Aggregating binary verdicts from diverse models via majority vote reduces individual model biases and idiosyncratic errors, acting as a "wisdom of crowds" effect that smooths out random fluctuations in judgment. The errors of individual LLM judges are assumed to be not perfectly correlated, allowing some models to catch omissions or contradictions that others miss.

### Mechanism 2: Iterative Refinement with Source Grounding Improves Factuality
A multi-step generation workflow that iteratively integrates information from source notes yields higher fact presence than a single-prompt approach. By processing notes chronologically and explicitly instructing the model to identify and integrate salient information at each step, the workflow reduces cognitive load on a single LLM call. The initial draft from key anchor documents (H&P, final note) is iteratively refined by processing remaining progress notes in chronological order, preventing information from being "lost" in a long context window or complex synthesis task.

### Mechanism 3: Clinician-Grounded Evaluation Criteria Increases Clinical Validity
An evaluation framework based on a small set of high-salience, clinician-defined key facts provides a more clinically relevant and reliable signal than global quality scores or broad automated metrics. Reframing the evaluation task from subjective "is this summary good?" to concrete, binary verifiable questions ("is Fact X present?") aligns evaluation with what is clinically actionable. This focuses the LLM Jury's assessment on specific, pre-validated truths, reducing ambiguity in the evaluation process itself.

## Foundational Learning

- **Cohen's Kappa Coefficient (κ)**: The core metric used to validate the MedFactEval framework. Understanding it is essential to interpret the "almost perfect agreement" (κ=81%) and "non-inferiority" claims. Quick check: If two evaluators agree 90% of the time but the prevalence of a condition is very high (or very low), would you expect the Kappa score to be higher or lower than 0.90?

- **Non-Inferiority Statistical Testing**: The study's primary claim rests on a statistical test (non-inferiority, P<0.001) against a margin, not on the LLM Jury being better than a human. This prevents misinterpreting the result as "LLMs are superior doctors." Quick check: In a non-inferiority trial, is the goal to prove the new treatment is better than the control, or that it is not unacceptably worse?

- **Agentic Workflow / Chain-of-Thought (MedAgentBrief)**: The MedAgentBrief workflow is a prime example of an agentic system where an LLM's output is fed back as input in a structured loop. Understanding this pattern is key to replicating the results. Quick check: In the MedAgentBrief workflow, what is the primary role of the "provenance tag" embedded during iterative refinement?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  1. Source Data Ingestion: Extracts unstructured notes (H&P, Progress Notes) from the EHR for a given patient encounter.
  2. MedAgentBrief Generation Engine:
     - Step 1: Initial Draft (H&P + Final Note) -> LLM -> Draft Summary
     - Step 2: Iterative Refinement (Loop: Remaining Notes + Current Summary -> LLM -> Updated Summary with Provenance Tags)
     - Step 3: Verification & Citation (Final Summary -> LLM -> Verified Summary with Resolved Citations)
  3. MedFactEval Evaluation Framework:
     - Input: Clinician-defined Key Facts + Generated Summary
     - Process: LLM Jury (10 diverse models) -> Majority Vote
     - Output: Fact Presence Score, Contradiction Score, Qualitative Error Report

- **Critical path**:
  The validation of the entire system hinges on the Meta-Evaluation loop:
  1. Define Key Facts (Clinicians).
  2. Generate Summaries (MedAgentBrief & Baseline).
  3. Create Gold Standard (7-Physician Panel vote on Key Facts).
  4. Run MedFactEval (LLM Jury) on the same summaries.
  5. Compare LLM Jury agreement to the Gold Standard to establish non-inferiority.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Performance vs. Cost/Latency: MedAgentBrief improves factuality but increases inference cost by 5-10x and latency. A production system must budget for this.
  - Evaluation Scope vs. Feasibility: Focusing on only 3 key facts makes evaluation clinically feasible (low cognitive burden) but creates a partial view of quality, missing unspecified but potentially important information.
  - LLM Jury Size: A full 10-model jury provides robustness but is costly. The paper suggests a "Small LLM Jury" (3 models) is a viable, cheaper alternative that still meets non-inferiority criteria.

- **Failure signatures**:
  1. Error Propagation in MedAgentBrief: If the "Initial Draft" contains a hallucination, the "Iterative Refinement" step may perpetuate it. The "Verification" step is meant to catch this, but is not foolproof.
  2. Correlated Errors in LLM Jury: If most or all models in the jury share a common training bias or failure mode (e.g., misinterpreting a specific medication change), the majority vote will confidently produce the wrong evaluation.
  3. Non-Representative Key Facts: If clinicians defining the key facts miss a crucial piece of information (e.g., a subtle but vital lab trend), the evaluation will give a "perfect" score to a summary that omits it, creating a dangerous false negative.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce the Meta-Evaluation Baseline: Using provided code and a small sample of cases, calculate agreement (Cohen's Kappa) between a single LLM judge and simulated gold standard to confirm baseline performance.
  2. Ablate the MedAgentBrief Workflow: Generate summaries using only Step 1 (Initial Draft) and compare its MedFactEval score to the full multi-step workflow to quantify iterative refinement contribution.
  3. Test a Small LLM Jury Configuration: Create a 3-model jury (e.g., Claude 3.5, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3-8b) and compare its evaluation scores and cost-per-evaluation against the full 10-model jury on generated summaries.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does the MedFactEval framework maintain high reliability when applied to diverse clinical specialties and non-academic settings? The authors acknowledge the single-site limitation and state that "larger-scale validation across diverse settings is warranted."

- Can the identification of "key facts" be standardized or automated without losing clinical salience? The authors state "future work could explore methods to further standardize or automate this selection process" to address the subjectivity of clinician-defined facts.

- How does MedFactEval perform in prospective, real-time clinical workflows regarding latency and safety monitoring? The authors list their "immediate goal is to deploy MedAgentBrief in a pilot study, using MedFactEval to provide real-time safety monitoring."

## Limitations

- Generalizability beyond three key facts: The evaluation framework's focus on three pre-specified facts per case creates a narrow lens that may miss critical omissions or clinically important nuances not captured in the key fact set.

- Unknown evaluation prompt robustness: Specific LLM Jury evaluation prompts and the Task-Assisting LLM configuration are not detailed in the paper text, potentially affecting reproducibility and performance.

- Cost-performance trade-off uncertainty: While MedAgentBrief improves factuality, the 5-10x increase in inference costs and latency may limit practical deployment without further optimization.

## Confidence

- MedFactEval framework validation (High): The near-perfect agreement (kappa=81%) with the seven-physician gold standard and statistical non-inferiority to single human expert evaluation provides strong empirical support.
- MedAgentBrief workflow effectiveness (Medium): Consistent improvement over single-prompt baselines is demonstrated, but the magnitude of improvement varies by model and the cost implications require further validation.
- LLM Jury scalability (Medium): The proposed reduction to a three-model "Small LLM Jury" appears viable based on theoretical discussion, but direct empirical validation is needed.

## Next Checks

1. Validate Small LLM Jury Configuration: Test the proposed three-model jury (Claude 3.5, Llama-4-Scout, DeepSeek-R1) against the full ten-model jury on a held-out test set to confirm non-inferior performance while achieving cost reduction.

2. Test Error Propagation in MedAgentBrief: Conduct ablation studies to quantify how hallucinations in the initial draft affect final output quality, and validate the effectiveness of the verification pass in catching propagated errors.

3. Evaluate Clinical Completeness Beyond Key Facts: Have clinicians review a sample of high-scoring summaries to identify clinically important information that may be present but not captured in the three key facts, assessing the framework's blind spots.
