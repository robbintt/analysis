# Physics-Informed Parametric Bandits for Beam Alignment in mmWave Communications

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.18299
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18299
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Physics-informed parametric bandit algorithms (PR-ETC and PR-GREEDY) exploit mmWave channel sparsity to achieve significantly lower regret than traditional bandit methods in beam alignment tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the beam alignment problem in mmWave communications, where selecting the optimal directional beam from a large codebook is crucial for signal quality but computationally expensive. Traditional bandit algorithms struggle due to the large action space and non-unimodal reward functions in realistic channels. The authors propose two physics-informed parametric bandit algorithms that exploit the sparse multipath structure of mmWave channels by treating channel parameters as black boxes, estimating them via maximum likelihood, and using known beam pattern structure to guide exploration and exploitation. Experiments on DeepMIMO and DeepSense6G datasets show significant performance improvements over baselines like UCB, LSE, BISECTION, and IMED-MB.

## Method Summary
The paper frames beam alignment as a parametric bandit problem where the optimal beam depends on unknown channel parameters (angles and gains of dominant propagation paths). The algorithms estimate these parameters via maximum likelihood estimation from RSS observations, then use the physics-informed beam pattern model to select optimal beams. PR-ETC explores uniformly for a fixed period then commits to the best beam, while PR-GREEDY updates estimates and selects beams online. Both algorithms exploit the fact that mmWave channels have few dominant paths (k ≤ 5), reducing the effective action space from K beams to 2k channel parameters. The approach is extended to mobile scenarios through periodic restarts.

## Key Results
- PR-ETC and PR-GREEDY achieve mean normalized regret of 0.59 at T=50 and 0.59 at T=200 on DeepMIMO data, outperforming UCB, LSE, BISECTION, and IMED-MB baselines
- PR-GREEDY achieves lower regret than PR-ETC but at higher computational cost (~377ms per step vs ~8ms total for PR-ETC)
- Algorithms remain robust when k=1 despite true channels having more than 2 paths (tested on 2,851 BS-UE pairs)
- Mobile scenario performance maintained with periodic restart every 50 steps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Exploiting sparse multipath structure reduces the effective action space from K beams to 2k channel parameters, enabling sample-efficient learning.
- Mechanism: mmWave channels have few dominant propagation paths (k ≤ 5). Instead of learning which of K beams is optimal, the algorithm estimates 2k channel parameters (k angles θ*, k complex gains β*). The beam pattern ha(θ) is known analytically, so once parameters are estimated, the optimal beam is computed as argmax_a R(fa, θ*, β*).
- Core assumption: The channel follows a sparse geometric model with at most k dominant paths. The algorithm is robust to model misspecification (tested with k=1 when true paths > 3).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "exploit the sparse multipath property of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption"
  - [Section III.A]: "In practice, a small value of k models the channel well, i.e., k ≤ 5"
  - [Section V.B.1]: "This demonstrates the robustness of our algorithm, even with k=1" despite 2,851 BS-UE pairs having more than two paths
  - [corpus]: Related work on mmWave beamforming (e.g., M2BeamLLM, multi-modal sensing papers) does not use this parametric approach; they rely on deep learning without explicit channel parameterization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Maximum Likelihood Estimation recovers channel parameters from noisy RSS observations by minimizing prediction error over the parameter space.
- Mechanism: Given action-reward pairs {at, rt}, the algorithm solves argmin_{θ,β} Σt(rt - R(fat, θ, β))². This is equivalent to maximizing likelihood under Gaussian noise. The RSS function R is determined by the physics: R(f, θ*, β*) = 30 + 10 log₁₀(|Σᵢ βi ha(θi)|²).
- Core assumption: Gaussian noise model; bounded reward function; the MSE landscape is sufficiently well-behaved (Assumption 2: strong convexity-like property).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section IV.A.1]: "maximizing the likelihood function L(β,θ|Sm) over the parameter space is equivalent to minimizing the square loss"
  - [Assumption 2]: "the landscape of the mean square error of predicted expected reward of all beams as a function of (θ, log β) is strongly convex"
  - [Fig. 3]: Verifies Assumption 2 empirically on DeepMIMO data
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus comparison; this MLE-based approach differs from deep learning methods in related mmWave papers.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Explore-Then-Commit structure with M random samples achieves regret O(T^(2/3) k^(1/3)), independent of the number of beams K.
- Mechanism: PR-ETC uniformly samples M beams during exploration, estimates parameters once, then commits to the greedy beam. With M = T^(2/3) · [kσ² log|B||Θ|]^(1/3), the regret balances exploration cost (MRmax) and exploitation error (T · estimation error). The key insight is that parameter estimation error depends on k, not K.
- Core assumption: Assumptions 1-3 (bounded rewards, strong convexity of MSE landscape, local Lipschitzness). The parameter spaces B and Θ are discrete grids of bounded size.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Theorem 4]: "RegretT ≤ O(Rmax T^(2/3) [kσ²(log|B|+log|Θ|]^(1/3))"
  - [Remark 5]: "log|B| and log|Θ| are roughly the number of bits needed to encode βi and θi, which can be regarded as constants"
  - [Section V.B, Fig. 5-6]: PR-ETC achieves mean normalized regret of 0.59 at T=50 and improves significantly by T=200

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) and Regret**
  - Why needed here: The beam alignment problem is framed as selecting actions (beams) to maximize cumulative reward (RSS). Regret quantifies the cost of suboptimal selections.
  - Quick check question: Why does UCB perform poorly in this setting? (Answer: UCB requires O(√KT) steps; when K≈180 and T≈50, it cannot explore all arms meaningfully.)

- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**
  - Why needed here: The core algorithm estimates unknown channel parameters from observed RSS values by maximizing likelihood (equivalently, minimizing squared error).
  - Quick check question: If the noise were Laplacian instead of Gaussian, would minimizing absolute error be more appropriate? (Answer: Yes, MLE under Laplacian noise corresponds to L1 loss.)

- **mmWave Geometric Channel Model**
  - Why needed here: The algorithm exploits the physics of mmWave propagation—sparse paths with specific angles and gains—to reduce dimensionality.
  - Quick check question: Why does antenna sidelobe structure break unimodality assumptions? (Answer: Even with a single LoS path, the beam pattern has multiple local peaks from sidelobes, as shown in Fig. 1.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Parameter estimation (MLE) -> Beam selection (argmax R) -> PR-ETC/PR-GREEDY controller -> Mobile restart scheduler

- **Critical path**:
  1. Define discrete parameter grids Θ (angles) and B (gains) based on hardware/resolution constraints
  2. During exploration (PR-ETC) or each step (PR-GREEDY): collect (beam index, RSS) pair
  3. Run MLE via grid search over Θ^k × B^k (exponential in k; paper uses k=1,2)
  4. Compute expected RSS for all beams using R(fa, θ̂, β̂)
  5. Select beam with highest expected RSS

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **PR-ETC vs PR-GREEDY**: PR-ETC has lower compute (~7.91 ms total vs ~376.73 ms/step for PR-GREEDY) but higher regret. PR-GREEDY is more adaptive but computationally expensive due to per-step MLE.
  - **Exploration length M**: Larger M improves parameter estimates but increases overhead. Paper uses M=20 as default.
  - **Grid resolution**: Finer grids (larger |Θ|, |B|) improve accuracy but increase MLE computation exponentially.
  - **Number of paths k**: k=1 is robust but may be suboptimal for multi-path channels; k=2 improves performance but doubles search space dimension.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **High regret with PR-ETC after exploration**: Parameter estimates are poor → check if M is sufficient, verify noise level σ, ensure grid Θ covers true angles.
  - **Excessive compute time for PR-GREEDY**: Grid search over (θ, β) pairs is expensive → consider coarser grids, fewer paths k, or gradient-based optimization (mentioned as future work).
  - **Mobile tracking fails to adapt**: Restart interval τ may be too long for channel dynamics → reduce τ or implement adaptive restart (noted as open question).

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Sanity check on synthetic data**: Generate RSS from a known (θ*, β*) with Gaussian noise. Run PR-ETC with M=20, k=1. Verify that estimated parameters converge to true values within grid resolution. Check regret decreases after exploration phase.
  2. **Comparison of PR-ETC and PR-GREEDY**: On DeepMIMO scenario 4, run both algorithms for T=200 steps. Measure normalized regret (Eq. 6) and per-step computation time. Confirm PR-GREEDY achieves lower regret but higher compute cost.
  3. **Robustness to model misspecification**: Set k=1 in the algorithm but evaluate on DeepMIMO pairs with >3 paths (2,152 pairs available). Compare regret against baselines (UCB, LSE, BISECTION). Verify that physics-informed algorithms remain competitive despite misspecified k.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a formal regret guarantee be established for the PR-GREEDY algorithm in this setting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Remark 7 states, "We leave proving regret guarantee for PR-GREEDY as an interesting question."
- Why unresolved: Standard analysis for greedy algorithms relies on action diversity from stochastic action sets. In this fixed-beam setting, establishing diversity for greedy selections is difficult.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical proof deriving a sublinear regret bound for PR-GREEDY or identifying specific conditions under which such a bound holds.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can adaptive restart mechanisms be effectively integrated with physics-informed algorithms for nonstationary settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they leave "the investigation of a combination of our physics-informed algorithm with adaptive restart [e.g., 36] as an interesting open question."
- Why unresolved: The current solution uses fixed-period restarts (Algorithm 3), which may not be optimal for sudden changes like blockages or rapid mobility.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm design and empirical evaluation showing that adaptive restarts (e.g., change-detection based) yield lower dynamic regret than fixed periods in mobile scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms be improved to meet real-time constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion lists "improve the time cost of our algorithms, possibly by utilizing compressed sensing" as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: The experiments show PR-GREEDY incurs high latency (~377 ms per step) due to solving the MLE via grid search, rendering it impractical for strict real-time requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of an MLE solver using compressed sensing or optimization techniques that reduces per-step latency to the order of milliseconds without increasing regret.

## Limitations

- Theoretical regret bounds rely on strong convexity assumptions that may not hold across all channel conditions and noise distributions
- Exponential computational complexity of grid-based MLE for k>2 paths severely limits practical applicability
- Mobile scenario performance depends critically on heuristic restart interval τ without systematic optimization

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Core mechanism of exploiting sparse multipath structure to reduce dimensionality; effectiveness of MLE-based parameter estimation on benchmark datasets; PR-ETC vs PR-GREEDY computational tradeoff
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical regret bounds (limited by single empirical validation); robustness claims to model misspecification (tested only for k=1 with >3 paths)
- **Low confidence**: Mobile scenario performance without adaptive restart mechanism; performance in non-Gaussian noise environments

## Next Checks

1. **Assumption 2 validation**: Systematically test MSE landscape convexity across different channel conditions, SNR levels, and antenna configurations to verify the theoretical regret bound's validity
2. **Baseline implementation audit**: Reimplement LSE and IMED-MB baselines with documented parameter settings and conduct ablation studies to isolate performance differences
3. **Adaptive restart mechanism**: Implement and evaluate adaptive restart strategies (e.g., based on RSS variance or Kalman filtering) for mobile scenarios to reduce dependence on fixed τ parameter
