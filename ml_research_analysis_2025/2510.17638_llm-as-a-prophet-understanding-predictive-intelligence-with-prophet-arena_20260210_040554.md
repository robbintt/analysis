# LLM-as-a-Prophet: Understanding Predictive Intelligence with Prophet Arena

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17638
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17638
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces a live benchmark for evaluating LLM forecasting capabilities across calibration, accuracy, and economic value metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper presents LLM-as-a-Prophet, a framework that evaluates large language models' ability to forecast real-world events through Prophet Arena, a live benchmark built from prediction market events. The framework decomposes forecasting into three modular stages: event extraction, context construction, and probabilistic prediction. Across 1,300+ resolved events, the study measures model performance using Brier scores, calibration error, and market return. Results show that while frontier LLMs demonstrate strong calibration and reasoning alignment, they still lag behind prediction markets in short-term accuracy and market profitability. The work establishes a rigorous testbed for studying predictive intelligence and identifies key bottlenecks in event recall, source usage, and information aggregation.

## Method Summary
The framework evaluates LLMs on real-world prediction market events by decomposing forecasting into three stages: event extraction (identifying relevant events from market data), context construction (gathering and synthesizing relevant information), and probabilistic prediction (generating calibrated probability forecasts). The Prophet Arena benchmark collects live prediction market events and evaluates models across three complementary dimensions: Brier score (forecasting loss), calibration error (probability accuracy), and market return (economic value). The study analyzes performance across multiple frontier LLMs using a standardized experimental protocol on 1,300+ resolved events.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve low calibration errors and strong reasoning alignment but lag behind prediction markets in short-term accuracy
- Frontier models show superior performance in long-term forecasting compared to near-term predictions
- Bottlenecks identified in event recall, source usage, and information aggregation, particularly near event resolution dates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by systematically breaking down the complex forecasting task into manageable components that can be individually analyzed and optimized. By leveraging prediction market events as a standardized testbed, the approach ensures real-world relevance while maintaining consistency across evaluations. The three-stage decomposition allows for targeted improvements in specific forecasting capabilities while the multi-metric evaluation captures different aspects of predictive intelligence beyond simple accuracy measures.

## Foundational Learning
- **Event extraction**: Identifying relevant forecasting targets from market data - needed to establish clear prediction tasks, quick check: can the model accurately identify event start/end dates and resolution criteria
- **Context construction**: Gathering and synthesizing relevant information from multiple sources - needed to build comprehensive evidence bases, quick check: does the model incorporate diverse, reliable sources without hallucination
- **Probabilistic prediction**: Generating calibrated probability forecasts - needed for actionable predictions, quick check: do predicted probabilities match empirical frequencies across multiple events
- **Calibration measurement**: Quantifying alignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes - needed to assess forecast reliability, quick check: calibration curves show minimal deviation from perfect calibration line
- **Information aggregation**: Combining evidence from multiple sources - needed for robust predictions, quick check: ensemble predictions outperform individual model outputs
- **Temporal dynamics**: Understanding how prediction quality changes over time - needed for practical deployment, quick check: performance degradation rates near resolution dates

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Prediction Market Events -> Event Extraction -> Context Construction -> Probabilistic Prediction -> Performance Evaluation

Critical Path:
The critical path follows the three-stage pipeline: event extraction must complete before context construction, which must complete before probabilistic prediction, with performance evaluation occurring after prediction generation.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Real-world relevance vs controlled experimental conditions (prediction markets provide realism but introduce noise)
- Model complexity vs computational efficiency (more sophisticated reasoning vs faster iteration)
- Granular decomposition vs holistic assessment (component-level insights vs overall forecasting capability)

Failure Signatures:
- High Brier scores indicate poor probability estimation
- Large calibration errors suggest systematic overconfidence or underconfidence
- Negative market returns indicate economically unviable predictions
- Degradation near resolution dates signals temporal reasoning limitations

First Experiments:
1. Compare iterative vs single-pass context construction approaches on complex multi-factor events
2. Test different temporal windows (1 week, 1 month, 3 months to resolution) for identifying nonlinear performance degradation
3. Evaluate ensemble vs single-model predictions for quantifying information aggregation benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- The three-stage pipeline may not capture complex real-world events requiring feedback loops or iterative refinement
- Temporal dynamics of information decay and model reasoning quality near resolution dates remain incompletely characterized
- The study lacks controlled ablation studies to definitively isolate causal factors behind identified bottlenecks

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Calibration error measurements and Brier score calculations are methodologically sound and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about LLMs lagging prediction markets in short-term accuracy are supported by current data but may shift as models improve
- **Medium confidence**: Identification of bottlenecks in event recall and source usage is based on observed patterns but lacks definitive causal isolation

## Next Checks
1. Implement controlled experiments testing whether iterative refinement of context windows improves LLM prediction accuracy compared to the current single-pass approach, particularly for complex multi-factor events

2. Conduct temporal sensitivity analysis by comparing LLM performance across different time-to-resolution intervals (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 3 months) with statistical power sufficient to detect nonlinear degradation patterns

3. Design A/B tests comparing different information aggregation strategies (e.g., ensemble methods vs single-model predictions) to quantify the impact of information fusion on prediction market returns and identify optimal architectures for predictive intelligence
