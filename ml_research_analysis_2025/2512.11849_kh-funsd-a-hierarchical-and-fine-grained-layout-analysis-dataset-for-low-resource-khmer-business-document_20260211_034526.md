## Quick Facts

- First publicly available dataset for hierarchical layout analysis and form understanding in Khmer business documents

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces KH-FUNSD, the first publicly available dataset for hierarchical layout analysis and form understanding in Khmer business documents. The dataset includes 158 receipts, invoices, and quotations with multi-level annotations for region detection, FUNSD-style entity classification, and fine-grained semantic labeling. A three-level annotation framework captures structural zones (header, form field, footer) and semantic roles (label, value, symbol, etc.), enabling both layout analysis and precise information extraction. The authors benchmark several state-of-the-art models—including YOLO variants, DETR, and LayoutLM models—establishing first baselines for Khmer document AI. Results show DETR achieves 86.6% mAP for region detection, while LayoutLMv3 reaches 68.6% F1-score for fine-grained classification. The dataset addresses the lack of resources for low-resource, non-Latin scripts and supports further research in Southeast Asian document understanding.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a three-level annotation schema for Khmer business documents: (1) region detection (header, form field, footer, other), (2) FUNSD-style entity classification (header, question, answer, other) with linking, and (3) fine-grained semantic role classification (8 classes including header_label, form_value, symbol, etc.). YOLOv8/9/10 and DETR models are trained for region detection with mAP50 evaluation, while LayoutLMv1/v2/v3 models handle semantic classification with F1-score evaluation. The dataset contains 158 documents (111 train / 23 val / 24 test) with 12,126 annotated entities. Training uses standard computer vision and NLP pipelines with specific hyperparameters for each model type, leveraging 2× RTX 3090 Ti GPUs.

## Key Results
- DETR achieves 86.6% mAP50 for region detection, outperforming YOLO variants
- LayoutLMv3 reaches 68.6% F1-score for fine-grained semantic classification
- Footer and "other" regions show lower detection performance (70-76%) due to layout variability
- Models struggle with densely populated table regions and visually similar semantic classes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hierarchical multi-level annotation enables simultaneous region detection and semantic role assignment through progressively refined supervision signals. The three-level schema (region → FUNSD-style → fine-grained) allows models to learn coarse-to-fine representations, with region-level bounding boxes localizing structural zones and fine-grained roles enabling precise semantic extraction. This approach assumes document structure follows predictable patterns where semantic roles correlate with spatial regions.

### Mechanism 2
LayoutLM's joint text-layout-visual encoding improves fine-grained semantic classification by fusing token embeddings with bounding box coordinates and visual patch features. The self-attention mechanism learns that spatially adjacent tokens often share semantic relationships (e.g., label-value pairs), outperforming YOLO for semantic roles. This assumes textual content provides discriminative signal for semantic roles that pure visual detection cannot capture.

### Mechanism 3
DETR's transformer-based detection handles variable document layouts better than anchor-based YOLO variants through learned object queries and global self-attention, avoiding hand-crafted anchor boxes. This flexibility better accommodates diverse document structures where region sizes/aspect ratios vary significantly. The approach assumes document regions behave like objects detectable via global context reasoning rather than local feature matching.

## Foundational Learning

- **FUNSD-style annotation schema (question/answer/header/other + linking)**
  - Why needed: The paper adopts this paradigm for entity relationship modeling, essential for interpreting FUNSD-style benchmark results
  - Quick check: Given "Date: 2025-01-15", which is question and which is answer? How would you encode their relationship?

- **Multi-modal fusion in document transformers**
  - Why needed: LayoutLM models combine text, spatial, and visual modalities; understanding token-bounding box alignment is crucial for debugging performance gaps
  - Quick check: If OCR produces misaligned bounding boxes for Khmer text, which modality would be most affected and why?

- **Evaluation metrics: mAP vs. F1 for detection vs. classification**
  - Why needed: The paper reports mAP50 for detection and F1 for semantic classification; these are not directly comparable
  - Quick check: Why does Table IV use mAP50 while Table VII uses F1-score? What task characteristic determines this choice?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Document Image → Preprocessing (de-skew, contrast) → OCR (Khmer-adapted) → Detection Branch (YOLO/DETR) for region bounding boxes OR Semantic Branch (LayoutLM) for token + bbox + visual features → Hierarchical JSON Output (regions → entities → links)

- **Critical path:** OCR quality → Bounding box alignment → Token-layout fusion. Errors propagate; Khmer OCR is the likely bottleneck (paper notes "scarcity of robust Khmer OCR tools")

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - YOLO/DETR: Fast inference, good for region detection; cannot model entity relationships
  - LayoutLM: Slower, requires OCR; captures semantic relationships but sensitive to tokenization errors
  - DETR vs. YOLO: DETR more flexible but may require more training data; YOLO better for real-time

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low footer detection: High layout variability (70-76% vs. 94-97% for form fields)
  - "Symbol" vs. "header_label" confusion: Visually similar classes
  - Densely populated tables: Misclassification clusters

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline reproduction: Train YOLOv9 for region detection and LayoutLMv3 for fine-grained classification; verify mAP50 ≈ 85.6% and F1 ≈ 68.6%
  2. OCR ablation: Manually correct OCR output for 20-document subset; measure F1 improvement
  3. Cross-dataset transfer: Fine-tune LayoutLMv3 pretrained on FUNSD/XFUND; assess Latin-script pretraining impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **End-to-end joint modeling:** Can joint modeling approaches improve performance over separate region detection and semantic classification for Khmer business documents? (Section VI explicitly calls for exploring end-to-end joint modeling)

- **Cross-script transferability:** How effectively can the annotation schema and benchmark transfer to other low-resource Southeast Asian scripts with similar complex writing systems? (Conclusion encourages adoption to other Southeast Asian scripts)

- **OCR-free alternatives:** Will OCR-free document understanding models outperform OCR-dependent approaches for Khmer, given OCR scarcity? (Section V.B notes OCR scarcity; Donut mentioned but not evaluated)

- **Architectural improvements:** What strategies can improve model robustness on densely populated table regions and visually similar semantic classes? (Error analysis shows these as key failure modes but no solutions proposed)

## Limitations

- Empirical claims rely on a single low-resource script (Khmer) without validation on other non-Latin scripts, limiting generalizability
- OCR quality for Khmer text—critical for LayoutLM performance—is not quantified, creating uncertainty about achievable results
- Three-level annotation schema lacks ablation studies to prove necessity versus simpler two-level approaches

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Detection task results (mAP metrics, DETR superiority over YOLO) - directly measurable, minimal subjective interpretation
- **Medium confidence:** LayoutLM performance on fine-grained classification - F1-scores reported but heavily dependent on unverified OCR quality
- **Low confidence:** Claims about "first publicly available" dataset and broader applicability to other Southeast Asian scripts - based on literature review without systematic survey

## Next Checks

1. **OCR quality quantification:** Manually transcribe 100 random Khmer tokens from the dataset and calculate character error rate to establish baseline OCR reliability
2. **Cross-script generalization:** Apply the same three-level annotation schema and benchmark models to at least one other non-Latin script (e.g., Thai from Typhoon OCR) to test transferability
3. **Annotation schema ablation:** Train models using only region detection, only FUNSD-style classification, and only fine-grained classification to empirically validate the hierarchical approach's added value
