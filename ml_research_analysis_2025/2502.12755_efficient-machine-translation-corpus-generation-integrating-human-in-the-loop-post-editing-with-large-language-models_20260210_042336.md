## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an enhanced methodology for machine translation corpus generation that integrates semi-automated human-in-the-loop post-editing with large language models (LLMs). Building on prior work using real-time custom quality estimation, the system incorporates LLM-driven features including enhanced translation synthesis, assisted annotation analysis, pseudo-labeling, and translation recommendation to improve translation quality while reducing annotator workload. The approach combines multiple MT outputs through LLMs to generate better initial hypotheses, provides comprehensive translation quality assessments, and enriches corpora with high-confidence pseudo-labels.

## Method Summary
The system uses an enhanced post-editing approach that integrates LLM capabilities into the MT corpus generation pipeline. Multiple MT outputs are synthesized through LLMs to create higher-quality initial translation hypotheses for post-editing. The system provides comprehensive quality assessment using both traditional metrics (COMET-QE, GEMBA) and LLM-based estimations. It incorporates confidence-based pseudo-labeling to selectively automate human annotation, and uses an online ML model (FLAML-based) to prioritize samples for human review based on uncertainty sampling and quality scores.

## Key Results
- 4.33% average improvement in translation quality scores post-editing
- Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.40 between COMET-QE and LLM quality estimations
- LLM-based model selection achieved 24% accuracy for top-1 and 57% for top-3 model predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-based synthesis of multiple MT outputs produces better initial translation hypotheses for post-editing.
- Mechanism: The system feeds multiple MT outputs into an LLM with appropriately designed prompts, which synthesizes a more coherent translation by combining strengths from different systems. This creates a higher-quality starting point that reduces annotator editing distance.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively identify and merge the strongest segments from competing MT outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "combines multiple MT outputs through LLMs to generate better initial hypotheses"
  - [section 3.1]: "By ensembling multiple translations with appropriately designed prompts, the LLMs can synthesize more coherent and contextually appropriate translations."
  - [corpus]: Related work (DuTerm, arXiv:2511.07461) supports two-stage NMT+LLM architectures but focuses on terminology enforcement rather than synthesis.
- Break condition: When constituent MT outputs contain systematic errors in the same segments, leaving the LLM no correct signal to synthesize from.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLM-based quality estimation provides moderately correlated translation assessment that complements traditional QE metrics.
- Mechanism: LLM evaluates translations using its language understanding capabilities; scores are correlated with established metrics (COMET-QE) to validate reliability. The dual-analysis cross-verifies fidelity and naturalness.
- Core assumption: A Spearman correlation of 0.40 represents sufficient alignment for LLM estimates to serve as useful quality signals.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.40 between COMET-QE and LLM estimations"
  - [section 5.2]: "The Spearman coefficient was 0.40, indicating a moderate correlation... validating the reliability of the automated quality metrics"
  - [corpus]: GEMBA (Kocmi & Federmann) is cited as prior LLM-based QA, but correlation thresholds for production use remain understudied.
- Break condition: Domain shifts or language pairs where LLM quality judgments systematically diverge from human preferences.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Confidence-based pseudo-labeling enables selective automation of human annotation.
- Mechanism: The system assigns confidence scores to translations; above a configurable threshold, samples are auto-labeled without human review. Administrators adjust thresholds based on quality monitoring.
- Core assumption: High-confidence predictions generalize across the unlabeled distribution without systematic bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "enriches corpora with high-confidence pseudo-labels"
  - [section 4.2]: "Administrators can set a confidence threshold to determine the extent of automatic labeling versus human annotation."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence—no corpus papers validate pseudo-labeling thresholds for MT corpus generation specifically.
- Break condition: Miscalibrated confidence on out-of-distribution segments leads to silent quality degradation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Quality Estimation (QE) without reference translations**
  - Why needed here: The system relies on COMET-QE and GEMBA-DA as teacher metrics for real-time model training. Understanding reference-free evaluation is essential for interpreting correlation results.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why reference-free QE metrics are necessary for production MT systems where ground-truth translations don't exist?

- Concept: **Active Learning with Uncertainty Sampling**
  - Why needed here: The FLAML-based online model prioritizes samples using uncertainty sampling combined with lowest COMET-DA and highest TER scores.
  - Quick check question: How does prioritizing low-confidence samples for annotation improve model learning efficiency compared to random sampling?

- Concept: **LLM Prompting for Translation Tasks**
  - Why needed here: Enhanced Translation Synthesis depends on prompt design to combine multiple MT outputs effectively.
  - Quick check question: What prompt components would you include to ensure an LLM selects the best segments from multiple translation candidates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Sample ingestion -> Multiple MT system translation -> LLM synthesis of hypotheses -> Quality scoring (COMET-QE + LLM) -> Priority ranking (uncertainty + TER) -> Human post-edit OR auto-label (threshold-dependent) -> Model retraining loop

- Critical path: Sample ingestion → Multiple MT system translation → LLM synthesis of hypotheses → Quality scoring (COMET-QE + LLM) → Priority ranking (uncertainty + TER) → Human post-edit OR auto-label (threshold-dependent) → Model retraining loop

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher confidence thresholds → more automation but risk of silent errors; lower thresholds → more human oversight but higher cost
  - LLM-only vs. ensemble QE: LLM provides richer analysis but adds latency and cost; COMET-QE is faster but less nuanced
  - Real-time vs. batch retraining: Real-time adapts faster but may destabilize; batch is stable but slower to improve

- Failure signatures:
  - Spearman correlation dropping below 0.30 between LLM and COMET-QE (indicates distribution shift)
  - Top-3 model prediction accuracy falling below 40% (suggests ranking model degradation)
  - Annotator edit distance not decreasing over time (LLM synthesis not improving hypotheses)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline correlation calibration**: Measure Spearman/Pearson/Kendall correlations between your LLM and COMET-QE on a held-out validation set before deploying auto-labeling.
  2. **Threshold sensitivity analysis**: Test auto-labeling at confidence thresholds of 0.7, 0.8, 0.9; measure downstream MT quality impact per threshold.
  3. **Synthesis ablation**: Compare post-editing effort (character edit distance, time) between single-MT, multi-MT ensemble without LLM, and LLM-synthesized hypotheses.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- The reported 4.33% average quality improvement lacks statistical significance testing, and the correlation threshold of 0.40 between LLM and COMET-QE quality estimates may be insufficient for production deployment without further validation.
- The system's reliance on LLM-based synthesis assumes the LLM can effectively combine multiple MT outputs, but this mechanism could fail when constituent translations share systematic errors.
- Pseudo-labeling confidence thresholds are set administratively without empirical validation for the specific task of MT corpus generation, raising concerns about silent quality degradation from overconfident auto-labeling.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The overall system architecture integrating multiple MT outputs with human-in-the-loop post-editing is well-established and technically sound. The Spearman correlation of 0.40 between LLM and COMET-QE provides moderate validation of the LLM quality estimation approach.
- **Medium Confidence**: The 4.33% quality improvement claim requires more rigorous statistical validation. The LLM-based synthesis mechanism is plausible but under-validated for the specific task of combining multiple MT outputs. The 24% top-1 and 57% top-3 model prediction accuracies suggest room for improvement in the ranking system.
- **Low Confidence**: The pseudo-labeling component lacks empirical validation for MT corpus generation, with no established thresholds or bias analysis provided. The correlation threshold of 0.40 for production use is asserted but not justified against domain-specific requirements.

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical Significance Testing**: Conduct paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests comparing post-editing quality improvements across annotators and language pairs to establish statistical significance of the 4.33% improvement claim.

2. **Pseudo-Labeling Threshold Calibration**: Perform systematic analysis of auto-labeling quality at different confidence thresholds (0.7, 0.8, 0.9) using held-out validation sets to identify optimal thresholds that balance automation benefits against quality risks.

3. **Cross-Validation of Quality Estimation**: Test the Spearman correlation between LLM and COMET-QE estimates across multiple domains and language pairs to determine if the 0.40 threshold generalizes or requires domain-specific calibration.
