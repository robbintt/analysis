## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15439
- Reference count: 18
- Reviews LLM-based strategies for toxic language detection and mitigation in software engineering

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive review of LLM-based strategies for combating toxic language in software engineering contexts. The authors examine existing datasets, annotation techniques, preprocessing methods, and model architectures for both general-purpose and domain-specific approaches. They highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based rewriting for toxicity mitigation while emphasizing the importance of domain-specific tuning and interpretability. The review identifies key challenges including annotation subjectivity, dataset bias, and the need for specialized approaches in SE communication contexts.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic literature review examining existing approaches to toxic language detection and mitigation in software engineering. They analyzed multiple datasets, annotation methodologies, and model architectures, with particular focus on comparing general-purpose LLMs against domain-specific alternatives. An ablation study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-based rewriting strategies, measuring success rates in reducing toxic content while preserving semantic meaning. The methodology included both qualitative synthesis of existing research and quantitative evaluation of mitigation effectiveness across different approaches.

## Key Results
- LLM-based rewriting demonstrates high effectiveness for toxicity mitigation while preserving semantic meaning
- Domain-specific tuning shows promise over general-purpose approaches for SE contexts
- Annotation subjectivity and dataset bias present significant challenges for model training and evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of LLM-based strategies stems from their ability to understand context and nuance in language while leveraging large-scale pretraining on diverse text corpora. In software engineering contexts, these models can identify toxic patterns specific to technical communication while maintaining awareness of domain terminology and collaborative norms. The rewriting mechanisms work by understanding both the offensive content and the intended meaning, allowing for targeted modifications that preserve technical accuracy while removing harmful elements.

## Foundational Learning
- **Toxic language detection**: Why needed - to identify harmful content in SE communications; Quick check - evaluate precision/recall on SE-specific datasets
- **Domain adaptation**: Why needed - general models may miss SE-specific toxic patterns; Quick check - compare performance on SE vs general datasets
- **Annotation subjectivity**: Why needed - impacts dataset quality and model reliability; Quick check - inter-annotator agreement metrics
- **Mitigation strategies**: Why needed - detection alone is insufficient for SE collaboration; Quick check - success rate of content preservation

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Raw text -> Preprocessing -> Detection model -> Classification -> Mitigation strategy -> Output text
**Critical path**: Text input → Tokenization → Toxic pattern identification → Context analysis → Rewriting → Quality verification
**Design tradeoffs**: General vs domain-specific models (coverage vs precision), automated vs human-in-the-loop mitigation (scalability vs accuracy)
**Failure signatures**: False positives on technical jargon, missed context-dependent toxicity, preservation of offensive intent during rewriting
**First experiments**: 1) Compare detection accuracy on SE vs general datasets, 2) Measure semantic preservation in rewritten content, 3) Evaluate inter-annotator agreement on SE toxic language labeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to effectively handle edge cases and domain-specific nuances in SE communications
- The long-term sustainability and evolution of toxicity detection models in rapidly changing SE contexts
- Methods for improving interpretability of mitigation strategies for SE practitioners

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation across multiple datasets, raising generalizability concerns
- Ablation study scope appears restricted, potentially missing edge cases
- Lack of quantitative benchmarking between general-purpose and domain-specific approaches across diverse SE domains

## Confidence
- High confidence in identification of relevant detection and mitigation strategies
- Medium confidence in comparative effectiveness of domain-specific versus general-purpose approaches
- Medium confidence in reported ablation study results due to limited scope
- Low confidence in long-term sustainability claims without longitudinal validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset validation using multiple SE-specific toxicity corpora to verify the robustness of claimed effectiveness metrics
2. Perform qualitative evaluation with SE practitioners to assess real-world applicability and interpretability of mitigation strategies
3. Implement controlled experiments comparing domain-tuned models against general-purpose models across diverse SE communication contexts (pull requests, issues, comments)
