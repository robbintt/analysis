# Generating Pedagogically Meaningful Visuals for Math Word Problems: A New Benchmark and Analysis of Text-to-Image Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03735
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03735
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Junling Wang, Anna Rutkiewicz, April Yi Wang, Mrinmaya Sachan
- Primary result: MATH2VISUAL framework with 1,903 annotated visuals shows fine-tuned models achieve 4.7-4.9/5.0 scores on accuracy, completeness, and clarity for pedagogically meaningful math visuals

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MATH2VISUAL, a framework for generating pedagogically meaningful visuals from math word problems to support young learners' comprehension. The authors co-designed a visual language and design space with primary school teachers, covering seven mathematical operations and creating a dataset of 1,903 annotated visuals. They evaluated state-of-the-art Text-to-Image models, finding that fine-tuning on their dataset significantly improved visual generation quality. While models showed strong performance on accuracy, completeness, and clarity, challenges remain with visualizing mathematical relationships, establishing a new benchmark for educational visual generation.

## Method Summary
The authors developed MATH2VISUAL through a co-design process with primary school teachers, establishing a visual language and design space for math word problems. They annotated 1,903 visuals covering seven mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison, fraction, and remainder). The framework was evaluated using fine-tuned versions of SDXL, SD1.5, and SDXL-Turbo models. Teacher ratings assessed visual quality across multiple dimensions including accuracy, completeness, and clarity. The study systematically analyzed model performance across different mathematical operations and identified specific challenges in visualizing mathematical relationships.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned models achieved high scores (4.7-4.9/5.0) on accuracy, completeness, and clarity for formal visuals
- Models demonstrated strong performance in generating pedagogically meaningful visuals for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Significant challenges identified in visualizing mathematical relationships, particularly for comparison, fraction, and remainder operations
- Fine-tuning on the MATH2VISUAL dataset substantially improved visual generation quality compared to baseline models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by translating mathematical relationships described in word problems into visual representations that preserve pedagogical meaning. By co-designing with teachers, the authors ensured the visual language captures educational best practices for representing mathematical concepts. The fine-tuning process adapts general text-to-image models to the specific domain of mathematical visualization, learning the mapping between problem text and pedagogically appropriate visual elements. The structured annotation process provides clear supervision for models to learn both the visual style and the mathematical relationships being represented.

## Foundational Learning
- Visual language design: Creating a standardized way to represent mathematical concepts visually is essential for consistent model training and evaluation (quick check: verify all teachers use consistent visual elements for the same operation)
- Pedagogical alignment: Visuals must support learning objectives rather than just being aesthetically pleasing (quick check: teacher review confirms visuals aid comprehension)
- Mathematical relationship visualization: Complex relationships like fractions and remainders require specialized visual representations beyond simple counting (quick check: visualize 3/4 using pie charts or number lines)
- Multimodal learning: Combining text and visual information enhances mathematical understanding for young learners (quick check: compare problem-solving with vs without visuals)
- Domain-specific fine-tuning: General text-to-image models need adaptation to capture mathematical precision and pedagogical requirements (quick check: measure performance improvement after fine-tuning)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Math word problem text -> Text-to-Image model (fine-tuned on MATH2VISUAL) -> Generated visual -> Teacher evaluation

Critical path: The pipeline flows from problem text through the fine-tuned model to visual generation, with teacher evaluation providing quality feedback for iterative improvement.

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes pedagogical accuracy over visual aesthetics, choosing clear mathematical representations over decorative elements. This tradeoff ensures educational utility but may limit creative visual expression.

Failure signatures: Models struggle with abstract mathematical relationships (fractions, comparisons, remainders) and may produce visuals that are mathematically correct but pedagogically unclear. Performance degradation occurs when problems involve multiple operations or complex contextual relationships.

Three first experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline SDXL model on 100 randomly selected MWPs from the dataset to establish performance without fine-tuning
2. Test fine-tuned model on out-of-distribution MWPs from different grade levels to assess generalization
3. Conduct ablation study removing visual language constraints to measure impact on pedagogical quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on teacher ratings, introducing potential subjectivity despite structured rubrics
- Sample size of 1,903 visuals may not capture full diversity of real-world math problems
- Focus on primary school mathematics (grades 1-6) limits generalizability to higher-level concepts
- Performance metrics may be inflated due to models being trained and tested on data from the same domain
- No assessment of accessibility considerations for learners with visual impairments

## Confidence
High Confidence: Framework design process with teachers is well-documented and methodologically sound; benchmark creation and challenge identification are robustly supported.

Medium Confidence: Evaluation results showing fine-tuning improvement are credible but may not generalize beyond the MATH2VISUAL dataset domain.

Low Confidence: Claims about long-term pedagogical impact on student learning outcomes lack direct support from this technical performance-focused study.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain generalization test**: Evaluate fine-tuned models on externally sourced math word problems from different curricula and educational systems to assess performance outside the MATH2VISUAL dataset distribution.

2. **A/B testing with actual learners**: Conduct controlled classroom studies comparing student comprehension and problem-solving success rates when using AI-generated visuals versus traditional textbook diagrams or teacher-created visuals.

3. **Accessibility audit**: Test the generated visuals using accessibility tools and with students who have visual impairments to ensure the designs meet universal design principles and can be effectively interpreted by all learners.
