# Unveiling Affective Polarization Trends in Parliamentary Proceedings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05231
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05231
- Authors: Gili Goldin; Ella Rabinovich; Shuly Wintner
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Affective polarization (measured via Valence and Arousal) significantly increased in Knesset committee proceedings from 1998-2024, with government speakers showing more positive and assertive language than opposition speakers.

## Executive Summary
This study operationalizes affective polarization using Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) emotional dimensions and applies them to Hebrew parliamentary proceedings from the Knesset. The authors developed a large Hebrew VAD lexicon, trained regression models on sentence embeddings, and found that government members use more positive and assertive language than opposition members. Most importantly, they detect a statistically significant increase in affective polarization over time, driven by rising variance in Valence and higher Arousal, even after controlling for gender and coalition composition.

## Method Summary
The method involves three main components: (1) creating a Hebrew VAD lexicon by translating and expanding the Mohammad 2018 lexicon, (2) training GLM binomial regression models on sentence embeddings from a domain-adapted encoder (Knesset-multi-e5-large), and (3) analyzing temporal trends using Mann-Kendall tests and OLS regression with controls for government/opposition ratio and gender ratio. The domain adaptation uses decoupled fine-tuning where only the encoder is fine-tuned on Knesset data via MLM, then reattached to the pre-trained sentence-transformer.

## Key Results
- Government speakers show higher Valence and Dominance than opposition speakers
- Opposition speakers exhibit higher Arousal than government speakers
- Affective polarization significantly increased over time, driven by rising V-variance and A-mean
- Temporal trends remain significant after controlling for committee composition and gender

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: VAD-Based Operationalization of Affective Polarization
- Claim: Affective polarization manifests as increasing variance in Valence combined with elevated Arousal over time
- Mechanism: Polarized discourse produces both disagreement (high Valence variance from opposing positive/negative statements) and emotional intensity (high Arousal from heated arguments)
- Core assumption: Emotional style reliably signals polarization; VAD dimensions capture this signal
- Evidence: "level of affective polarization, as reflected by this style, is significantly increasing with time"; "operationalize affective polarization as the combination of high variance in Valence and high values of Arousal"

### Mechanism 2: Domain-Adapted Encoder via Decoupled Fine-Tuning
- Claim: Fine-tuning only the encoder component on domain data improves VAD prediction over off-the-shelf models
- Mechanism: MLM pre-training on 32M Knesset sentences adapts lexical representations; sentence-transformer preserves transfer learning
- Core assumption: Domain adaptation benefits sentence-level tasks even with MLM fine-tuning
- Evidence: "This approach moderately improved the results, compared to the original multilingual model"; Knesset-multi-e5-large achieved V=0.764, A=0.468, D=0.669 vs. 0.737, 0.408, 0.496

### Mechanism 3: Protocol-Level Aggregation with Confound Controls
- Claim: Computing VAD metrics per protocol and controlling for composition isolates temporal polarization trends
- Mechanism: Protocol-level aggregation reduces noise; OLS regression separates time effects from compositional confounds
- Core assumption: Protocol-level metrics are stable enough to detect trends; confounds are adequately captured
- Evidence: "the time point measure is statistically significant and the corresponding coefficients are positive" across committees; TP coefficient β×100=0.30 (V_var), 0.04 (A_mean), both p<0.001

## Foundational Learning

- **VAD Emotional Dimensions (Valence, Arousal, Dominance)**
  - Why needed: These continuous dimensions operationalize emotional style; prerequisite to interpreting polarization results
  - Quick check: Which dimension would capture the difference between "I'm delighted" and "I'm furious"?

- **Affective vs. Ideological Polarization**
  - Why needed: The paper explicitly distinguishes these; affective concerns emotional dislike, not policy disagreement
  - Quick check: If two parties agree on policy but express mutual contempt, which type of polarization is present?

- **Mann-Kendall Trend Test**
  - Why needed: Non-parametric test for monotonic trends in time series; used to detect increasing polarization
  - Quick check: Why prefer Mann-Kendall over linear regression for detecting trends in non-normal political discourse data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Knesset-multi-e5-large encoder → 1024-dim sentence embeddings
  2. Three GLM binomial regression models → V, A, D scores ∈ [0,1]
  3. Protocol aggregation layer → Compute V_mean, V_var, A_mean, etc. per protocol
  4. Trend detection → Mann-Kendall test + OLS regression with confounds

- **Critical path:**
  Raw text → Tokenization → Encoder → Embedding → Regression models → Sentence-level VAD → Protocol aggregation → Time-series analysis → Trend significance

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Committee protocols only: More spontaneous speech but reduces data scope
  - Word-level training data on sentence-level prediction: Lexicon provides volume but may miss context
  - 0.7/0.3 thresholds for high/low VAD: Arbitrary but balanced for statistical power

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low A/D correlations (0.468-0.669) vs. Valence (0.764): Arousal/Dominance harder to predict reliably
  - HebEmo model failed on parliamentary data: Domain mismatch degrades off-the-shelf models
  - Inter-annotator agreement lower for A/D (0.662-0.675) than V (0.904): Human subjectivity affects gold standard

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate government vs. opposition validation: Compute V_mean, A_mean, D_mean by speaker role
  2. Sanity check VAD predictions: Extract top/bottom 20 sentences per committee per dimension
  3. Trend analysis with bootstrap: Apply Mann-Kendall to V_var and A_mean by committee

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Direction of Influence**: Is the observed increase in affective polarization a "bottom-up" trend driven by citizen sentiment or a "top-down" process driven by political elites? The authors plan to compare Knesset trends to general media to determine causality.

2. **Plenary vs. Committee Speech**: Does affective polarization manifest in structured, prepared plenary speeches to the same degree it appears in spontaneous committee deliberations? The current analysis focused only on committee protocols.

3. **Linguistic Strategies**: What specific linguistic or rhetorical strategies are driving the consistent decline in Dominance scores among both coalition and opposition members over time? The authors identify the trend but note that future research could investigate underlying linguistic features.

## Limitations

- Domain Generalization: The Hebrew VAD lexicon may not fully capture parliamentary discourse nuances, as evidenced by performance gaps between dimensions
- Temporal Confounds: Cannot definitively isolate affective polarization from correlated phenomena like legislative agenda shifts or protocol recording changes
- Binary Classification: Government/opposition assignment oversimplifies complex parliamentary coalition dynamics

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Government speakers consistently show higher Valence and Dominance than opposition speakers; temporal increase in V-variance and A-mean is statistically significant
- **Medium Confidence**: VAD prediction models generalize reasonably well (V: 0.764, A: 0.468, D: 0.669), though Arousal and Dominance predictions are notably less reliable
- **Low Confidence**: Specific mechanisms driving temporal polarization trends cannot be definitively isolated from confounding factors

## Next Checks

1. **Bootstrap Temporal Analysis**: Apply bootstrap resampling to Mann-Kendall tests and OLS regression to establish confidence intervals for reported polarization trends

2. **Topic-Driven Validation**: Conduct topic modeling on protocols to identify whether VAD trends correlate with specific legislative domains rather than partisan conflict

3. **Speaker-Level Granularity**: Replicate analysis at individual speaker level rather than protocol aggregation to verify pattern persistence when controlling for speaker-specific effects
