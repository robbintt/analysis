# Intelligent Image Sensing for Crime Analysis: A ML Approach towards Enhanced Violence Detection and Investigation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.13910
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13910
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** CNN-LSTM framework achieves 83% accuracy, 91% precision, and 74% recall for real-time violence detection on Raspberry Pi

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a machine learning framework for detecting and classifying violent events in video streams, deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time operation. The system combines 3D convolutional neural networks for spatial feature extraction with bidirectional LSTM networks for temporal processing of violent action sequences. Using a custom dataset of ~500 videos and innovative "Super Image" frame sampling techniques, the model achieves 83% accuracy while maintaining approximately 2-second processing latency per frame.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a two-stage approach: a detection model using 3D CNNs for binary violence/non-violence classification, followed by a classification model that uses separable 3D convolutions for spatial feature extraction and bidirectional LSTM for temporal processing to categorize violence types. Video frames are preprocessed through a "Super Image" construction method that samples frames using multiple strategies (uniform, random, continuous, MAD, Lucas-Kanade optical flow) to preserve temporal information while reducing computational load. The system is deployed on a Raspberry Pi with a camera module, using Flask for real-time HTTP-based communication between the camera, inference engine, and client applications.

## Key Results
- 83% accuracy in detecting violent events in real-time video streams
- 91% precision and 74% recall demonstrate the model's conservative detection approach
- ~2 second processing latency per frame on Raspberry Pi hardware
- Effective performance across multiple violence datasets including Hockey fights, NTU CCTV, Sohas, and WVD

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining spatial feature extraction with temporal sequence modeling enables detection of violent actions that unfold over time.
- Mechanism: The architecture uses separable convolutional 3D layers to extract spatial features from video frames, then feeds these feature sequences into a bidirectional LSTM that processes temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. This allows the model to recognize motion patterns characteristic of violence.
- Core assumption: Violent actions exhibit distinctive spatio-temporal patterns that differ from non-violent activities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "classification model utilizes the separable convolutional 3D model for feature extraction and bidirectional LSTM for temporal processing"
  - [section III, 3.3] "we integrate an LSTM network to capture the temporal dynamics of the video sequence, inputting the sequence of feature vectors extracted by the CNN"
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers confirm CNN-LSTM and similar spatio-temporal architectures are standard for violence detection; VideoMamba paper notes CNNs "struggle with long-term dependencies" suggesting this hybrid approach addresses a known limitation
- Break condition: If violent actions in your target domain are primarily distinguished by single-frame appearance (e.g., weapon presence) rather than motion over time, the LSTM component adds unnecessary latency.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-strategy frame sampling into a "Super Image" preserves temporal information while reducing computational load for edge deployment.
- Mechanism: Rather than processing every frame sequentially, the system samples frames using multiple strategies (uniform, random, continuous, MAD, Lucas-Kanade optical flow) and arranges them into a composite "Super Image" that maintains aspect ratio. This condenses video information into a format more amenable to efficient processing.
- Core assumption: Key violent actions can be identified from strategically sampled frames rather than complete video sequences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III, 3.4] "To construct a SUPER IMAGE, the primary concept revolves around preserving aspect information and minimizing information loss"
  - [section III, 3.4] Describes five sampling methods including Lucas-Kanade which "selects k frames with the largest amount of motion, ensuring dynamic content is represented"
  - [corpus] Evidence weak; corpus papers do not discuss Super Image techniques explicitly
- Break condition: If your use case requires detecting subtle, rapidly-occurring violence (e.g., quick knife strikes), aggressive frame sampling may miss critical frames.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Edge deployment on Raspberry Pi with Flask enables real-time violence detection with acceptable latency in resource-constrained environments.
- Mechanism: The trained model is deployed on a Raspberry Pi with camera module. Flask handles HTTP routes for frame capture, model inference, and result dissemination. The system achieves ~2 seconds per frame processing time.
- Core assumption: 2-second latency is acceptable for the target violence detection use case.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "system is deployed on a Raspberry Pi with a camera module for real-time video capture and processing"
  - [section IV, 4.3] "The device processed real-time data effectively, with an average processing time of 2 seconds per frame"
  - [section III, 3.5] "frameworks like Flask for real-time violence detection... enables seamless real-time communication between the machine learning model and the hardware setup"
  - [corpus] Federated Learning paper confirms Raspberry Pi deployment for violence detection is viable; addresses energy/computation tradeoffs
- Break condition: If your application requires sub-second response (e.g., immediate alert triggering), this architecture will be too slow.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3D Convolution vs 2D Convolution
  - Why needed here: The paper uses 3D CNNs for detection and separable 3D convolutions for classification. Unlike 2D convolutions that process spatial dimensions only, 3D convolutions operate on (height, width, time) cubes, capturing motion across adjacent frames.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a 3D kernel of size (3×3×3) processes temporal information while a 2D kernel of size (3×3) does not?

- Concept: Bidirectional LSTM
  - Why needed here: The classification model uses Bi-LSTM to process feature sequences in both temporal directions. This allows the model to use future context when classifying current frames, which helps when violent actions have distinctive wind-up or follow-through motions.
  - Quick check question: Why might a bidirectional LSTM outperform a unidirectional LSTM for violence classification, and when would it not help?

- Concept: Optical Flow (Lucas-Kanade)
  - Why needed here: One frame sampling strategy uses Lucas-Kanade optical flow to detect motion magnitude and select frames with significant movement. Understanding optical flow helps you debug why certain frames are selected.
  - Quick check question: What does optical flow measure, and why would high optical flow values correlate with frames likely to contain violent action?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Raspberry Pi Camera Module (CSI port) → Fisheye lens for wide FOV → Frame extraction → Resolution normalization (1280×720) → Super Image construction via samplers → 3D CNN for binary classification → Separable 3D Conv → Bi-LSTM → Dense layers for multi-class categorization → Flask server with routes for frame capture, inference, and result streaming → Real-time predictions

- Critical path:
  1. Camera calibration for fisheye distortion (if not done, spatial features will be corrupted)
  2. Frame sampling strategy selection (impacts what the model "sees")
  3. Model loading and warm-up inference (first inference is typically slower)
  4. Flask route configuration for client integration

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. Latency: The 83% accuracy at 2 sec/frame reflects a balance. More complex models would increase accuracy but worsen latency.
  - Precision vs. Recall: 91% precision vs. 74% recall indicates the model is conservative—it misses some violent events but rarely raises false alarms. This is appropriate for high-traffic public spaces where false alarms cause fatigue.
  - Super Image density vs. information preservation: More frames in the Super Image preserves temporal detail but increases computation.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low-light performance degradation (explicitly noted in Section IV, 4.4)
  - High-density crowd confusion (explicitly noted in Section IV, 4.4)
  - First-inference latency spike (common in TensorFlow/PyTorch on first run)
  - Flask timeout if inference exceeds HTTP timeout window

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline validation: Run inference on held-out videos from each source dataset (Hockey, NTU CCTV, Sohas, WVD) separately to identify which domain the model generalizes to best.
  2. Sampler ablation: Test each sampling strategy (uniform, random, MAD, Lucas-Kanale) in isolation on the same test videos to determine which captures violent action most reliably.
  3. Latency profiling: Measure end-to-end latency from frame capture to prediction output, decomposed into: (a) frame acquisition, (b) preprocessing/Super Image construction, (c) model inference. Identify the bottleneck.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can the model architecture be refined to mitigate the accuracy degradation observed in high-density crowd scenarios and low-light conditions?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly list "challenges... in high-density crowd scenarios and low-light conditions" where "accuracy slightly decreased" as a primary limitation.
  - Why unresolved: The current CNN-LSTM implementation struggles with feature extraction in these specific complex environments, and the paper does not propose a specific algorithmic solution.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A modified model evaluation showing consistent precision and recall metrics in low-light and high-density test sets compared to the baseline.

- **Open Question 2:** Which specific additional sensors can be integrated to enhance detection performance in challenging visual scenarios?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states that future work will focus on "incorporating additional sensors for better performance in challenging scenarios."
  - Why unresolved: The current system relies exclusively on a camera module, making it vulnerable to visual obstructions and lighting issues that other sensors (e.g., audio, thermal) might solve.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study of the system's performance when augmented with various sensor types versus the vision-only baseline.

- **Open Question 3:** What privacy-preserving mechanisms can be implemented within the real-time pipeline without significantly compromising the 2-second processing latency?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "enhancing privacy and ethical practices" as a crucial area for further research as the technology is integrated into public security systems.
  - Why unresolved: The current framework focuses on raw frame processing for violence detection without addressing the privacy implications of capturing identifiable human features in public spaces.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a privacy layer (e.g., automatic face blurring or encryption) integrated into the Raspberry Pi workflow with a negligible impact on the frame processing time.

## Limitations

- Limited architectural details prevent exact reproduction of the 3D CNN and BiLSTM configurations
- 2-second processing latency may be too slow for real-time intervention scenarios requiring immediate response
- Super Image sampling methodology lacks validation against traditional frame-by-frame processing approaches

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The CNN-LSTM architecture combination for spatio-temporal violence detection is well-established in the literature and the reported precision (91%) suggests reliable performance on the tested datasets.
- **Medium confidence:** The edge deployment feasibility and 2-second latency claim are plausible given the hardware constraints, though real-world performance may vary significantly with environmental conditions.
- **Low confidence:** The Super Image sampling methodology and its claimed benefits over traditional approaches are not well-validated, as evidenced by the weak corpus support for this specific technique.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset generalization test:** Evaluate the trained model separately on each source dataset (Hockey, NTU CCTV, Sohas, WVD) to determine domain-specific performance and identify generalization gaps.

2. **Sampler strategy ablation:** Systematically compare all five sampling strategies (Uniform, Random, Continuous, MAD, Lucas-Kanade) on identical test videos to quantify their relative effectiveness in capturing violent events.

3. **End-to-end latency decomposition:** Profile the complete pipeline from camera capture through inference to measure processing time distribution across acquisition, preprocessing, Super Image construction, and model inference to identify bottlenecks.
