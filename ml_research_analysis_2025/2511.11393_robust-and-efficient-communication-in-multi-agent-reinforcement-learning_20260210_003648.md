- This survey reviews robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints like perturbations, delays, and limited bandwidth.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically analyzes recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under realistic constraints such as message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. The authors examine communication challenges across three representative domains—cooperative autonomous driving, distributed SLAM, and federated learning—highlighting the tension between bandwidth constraints and the need for effective coordination. They present a comprehensive taxonomy of methods addressing when, whom, and what to communicate, ranging from variance-based pruning and event-triggered scheduling to semantic compression and personalized topologies. The survey also explores robustness to adversarial and stochastic interference through techniques like message filtering, reliability estimation, and Byzantine-resilient aggregation. A unified framework is proposed that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical deployments.

## Key Results
- The survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy of methods addressing when, whom, and what to communicate in MARL.
- Methods like NDQ can discard >80% of messages without performance loss through information-theoretic pruning.
- A unified framework is proposed that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness for practical deployments.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information-Theoretic Pruning for Bandwidth Efficiency
- Agents can maintain coordination under strict bandwidth limits by maximizing the mutual information between messages and actions while minimizing message entropy, effectively discarding redundant data.
- Methods like Variance-Based Control (VBC) and NDQ (Nearly Decomposable Q-functions) apply differentiable masking or information bottlenecks. VBC prunes dimensions with low variance, while NDQ minimizes the KL-divergence between joint Q-values and independent Q-values to enforce sparsity.
- Core assumption: The decision-relevant information can be compressed into a lower-dimensional manifold without destroying the gradient flow required for backpropagation.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions "limited bandwidth" and the need to transmit "only the most valuable updates." [section] Section V details VBC and NDQ, noting NDQ can discard >80% of messages without performance loss. [corpus] The paper "Learning what to say and how precisely" (arXiv:2511.01554) supports this by optimizing message precision at the bit-level via discrete communication learning.
- Break condition: If the environment dynamics change such that previously "redundant" dimensions become critical for safety (e.g., rare edge cases), static or slow-adapting pruning masks may drop essential signals.

### Mechanism 2: Active Defense via Reliability Estimation
- In adversarial or noisy channels, robustness is improved by actively estimating the reliability of incoming messages rather than treating all inputs equally.
- Frameworks like ADMAC (Active Defense Multi-Agent Communication) introduce a learnable "reliability estimator" that computes a weight $w_i \in [0,1]$ for incoming messages based on local observation and hidden state, attenuating the influence of perturbed inputs before aggregation.
- Core assumption: There exists a detectable statistical or semantic discrepancy between benign messages and adversarially perturbed or corrupted messages within the agent's representation space.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] highlights "message perturbations" and "adversarial... interference" as key challenges. [section] Section III.A.2 describes ADMAC's mechanism (Eq. 5-6) for weighting messages to filter attacks. [corpus] The paper "Towards Robust Multi-UAV Collaboration" (arXiv:2503.02913) corroborates this by using attention mechanisms to handle noise-resilient communication.
- Break condition: If an attacker utilizes "adversarial" perturbations that perfectly mimic the distribution of benign messages (e.g., sophisticated generative attacks), the reliability estimator may assign high scores to malicious data.

### Mechanism 3: Delay-Aware Dynamic Scheduling
- Agents can mitigate the performance degradation caused by transmission delays by learning to regulate "waiting time" based on network conditions, rather than assuming synchronous availability.
- The DACOM framework extends the action space to include a waiting duration $d_i$. A "TimeNet" module predicts the optimal time to wait for incoming messages based on observed network latency and bitrates, trading off action staleness against information completeness.
- Core assumption: The control loop can tolerate non-deterministic action delays without becoming unstable, and network states are locally observable.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] explicitly lists "transmission delays" as a realistic constraint. [section] Section IV details DACOM and the "TimeNet" module (Eq. 14-16) for balancing message waiting vs. immediate execution. [corpus] Evidence in the provided corpus is weak regarding specific delay-scheduling mechanisms beyond the survey context;

## Foundational Learning
This survey builds upon foundational work in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that established the theoretical frameworks for communication in cooperative multi-agent systems. The survey positions itself as a comprehensive review of recent advances rather than presenting original empirical results. It draws from established MARL architectures and learning paradigms, particularly those that address the communication bottleneck in multi-agent systems. The work synthesizes insights from earlier surveys on MARL communication and extends them to address more realistic deployment scenarios involving perturbations, delays, and bandwidth constraints. The foundational concepts include decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) and value decomposition networks that enable coordinated decision-making among multiple agents.

## Architecture Onboarding
The survey provides a structured framework for understanding and implementing robust and efficient communication in MARL systems. For practical implementation, developers should first identify the specific constraints of their deployment environment (bandwidth limits, latency issues, or potential for adversarial interference). Based on these constraints, the survey suggests selecting appropriate methods from its taxonomy: variance-based pruning for bandwidth efficiency, event-triggered scheduling for resource conservation, or reliability estimation for adversarial robustness. The unified framework presented recommends co-designing communication protocols with the learning algorithm and robustness mechanisms from the outset, rather than treating them as separate concerns. Implementation should begin with simpler methods like VBC for bandwidth-constrained environments before progressing to more complex adaptive systems like DACOM or ADMAC.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open research questions that warrant further investigation. First, there is a need for more systematic benchmarking of robustness and efficiency metrics across different MARL communication methods, as current evaluations are often inconsistent and incomparable. Second, the survey highlights the challenge of designing communication protocols that can adapt in real-time to rapidly changing network conditions without requiring extensive retraining. Third, there is an open question about how to effectively balance the trade-off between communication efficiency and the risk of missing critical information, particularly in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. Fourth, the survey points to the need for better theoretical understanding of how communication topology affects convergence properties in MARL. Finally, the authors note that most current methods focus on homogeneous agent populations, leaving open the question of how to design communication protocols for heterogeneous multi-agent systems with varying capabilities and constraints.

## Limitations
The survey acknowledges several limitations in the current state of research on robust and efficient MARL communication. First, many of the surveyed methods have been primarily evaluated in simulation environments, with limited validation in real-world deployment scenarios. Second, the trade-offs between communication efficiency and learning performance are not well-characterized theoretically, making it difficult to predict performance in novel situations. Third, most methods assume relatively stationary environments, with limited research on communication protocols that can adapt to dynamic or non-stationary conditions. Fourth, the survey notes that while many methods address specific constraints (bandwidth, delays, or perturbations), fewer approaches tackle the problem of co-designing communication, learning, and robustness simultaneously. Fifth, there is limited research on the computational overhead introduced by sophisticated communication protocols, which could offset gains from efficiency improvements. Finally, the survey points out that many methods rely on centralized training with decentralized execution, which may not be feasible in all deployment scenarios.

## Confidence
High confidence in the survey's comprehensive coverage of the field. The authors systematically organize a large body of research into a coherent taxonomy, covering when to communicate (event-triggered vs. scheduled), whom to communicate with (topology design), and what to communicate (semantic compression vs. selective sharing). The survey provides concrete examples of methods and their performance characteristics, such as NDQ's ability to discard >80% of messages without performance loss. The unified framework proposed represents a synthesis of current approaches rather than an untested new method, suggesting the authors have a solid understanding of the field's state. The inclusion of multiple real-world domains (autonomous driving, SLAM, federated learning) demonstrates breadth in the survey's scope. While the survey does not present original experimental results, its systematic review of existing literature appears thorough and well-organized.

## Next Checks
To further evaluate the claims and methods presented in this survey, the following checks should be performed: First, examine the specific performance metrics used to evaluate communication efficiency and robustness across different methods to assess their comparability. Second, investigate the computational overhead introduced by communication protocols like ADMAC and DACOM to verify that efficiency gains are not offset by increased processing requirements. Third, look for empirical studies that test these communication methods in real-world deployment scenarios rather than just simulations. Fourth, examine the theoretical guarantees provided for convergence and stability in the presence of communication constraints and perturbations. Fifth, investigate the scalability of these methods as the number of agents increases, particularly for topology-based approaches. Sixth, check whether the survey adequately represents work from diverse research communities (robotics, networking, machine learning) to ensure comprehensive coverage. Finally, verify the claims about method performance by examining the original papers cited for specific results like NDQ's >80% message reduction.
