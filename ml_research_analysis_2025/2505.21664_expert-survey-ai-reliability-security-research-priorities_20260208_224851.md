# Expert Survey: AI Reliability & Security Research Priorities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.21664
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21664
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: 53 AI reliability and security experts ranked 105 technical research areas by importance and tractability, identifying evaluations and monitoring as top priorities.

## Executive Summary
This survey of 53 AI reliability and security experts provides the first comprehensive ranking of 105 technical research areas by combining importance (likelihood of reducing severe AI harms) and tractability (feasibility with $10M over 2 years). The results reveal strong expert consensus around evaluation-focused approaches, with capability evaluations, CBRN-specific assessments, and oversight of LLM-agents dominating the top priorities. Multi-agent safety emerged as a critical but underinvested frontier. The findings identify actionable near-term opportunities for funders and researchers while highlighting areas requiring sustained long-term investment despite lower tractability scores.

## Method Summary
The study surveyed 53 experts (10.6% response rate from 515 invitations) who rated 105 AI reliability and security sub-areas across 20 categories. Each sub-area was evaluated on importance (reducing severe harms: >100 lives or >$10B economic impact) and tractability (measurable progress with $10M over 2 years) using 5-point Likert scales. Promise scores were calculated by multiplying mean importance and tractability ratings. Sub-areas with ≤2 ratings were excluded from quantitative analysis. The survey ran from December 2024 to March 2025 using Qualtrics, with experts recruited via author-based identification from key publications plus expert referrals.

## Key Results
- Nine of the top 15 approaches emphasize evaluation, detection, or monitoring rather than root-cause solutions or theoretical research
- Multi-agent safety sub-areas all scored within the top 30, with metrics and security ranking 7th and 8th highest overall
- High-importance but low-tractability areas (hardware security, interpretability) require larger, long-term investments
- Experts broadly agree on actionable near-term opportunities, especially in capability evaluation and applied security

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Expert-derived promise scores identify research areas offering highest risk reduction per marginal dollar invested
- Mechanism: Survey methodology aggregates expert judgment across importance and tractability dimensions, multiplying them to surface areas excelling in both
- Core assumption: Expert judgment provides valid signal about future impact potential and practical implementability
- Evidence anchors: 52 of 53 respondents identified at least one research direction as both important and tractable; study claims to be first data-driven ranking of comprehensive AI safety taxonomy
- Break condition: If expert preferences systematically diverge from actual implementation outcomes, or if the $10M/2-year frame excludes genuinely high-impact long-term research

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dangerous capability evaluations dominate top priorities because they provide concrete, measurable interventions with well-defined success criteria
- Mechanism: Evaluation-focused approaches score highly because experts can clearly specify what progress looks like, unlike theoretical frameworks where success metrics remain contested
- Core assumption: Measurable interventions translate more reliably into risk reduction than foundational/theoretical work
- Evidence anchors: 9 of top 15 approaches emphasize evaluation; lowest variance relates to evaluation, monitoring, or detection approaches
- Break condition: If evaluation methods fail to capture emergent or latent capabilities that manifest differently in deployment

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-agent safety represents an undercapitalized but critical research frontier requiring dedicated infrastructure
- Mechanism: All multi-agent sub-areas scored in top 30, with experts recognizing that agent interactions create novel risks absent in single-agent threat models
- Core assumption: Risks from multi-agent systems scale qualitatively differently from single-agent risks
- Evidence anchors: All multi-agent sub-areas scored within top 30; multi-agent metrics and evaluations ranked 7th and 8th highest
- Break condition: If multi-agent risks prove addressable through extensions of single-agent safety techniques

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Promise score calculation (importance × tractability)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how rankings emerge requires grasping that high scores require excellence in both dimensions
  - Quick check question: Why might a high-importance, low-tractability area (like mechanistic interpretability) still warrant long-term investment despite scoring lower on promise?

- Concept: **Evaluation vs. intervention distinction**
  - Why needed here: The survey reveals expert preference for measurement-focused work over root-cause solutions
  - Quick check question: What tradeoffs might emerge from prioritizing detection capabilities over preventive interventions?

- Concept: **Latent capability detection and sandbagging**
  - Why needed here: Top-ranked area addresses risk that models may underperform during evaluations while retaining harmful abilities
  - Quick check question: Why might model developers have structural incentives to understate model capabilities during evaluations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The taxonomy structures 105 sub-areas into 20 categories spanning theoretical foundations, training methods, oversight techniques, interpretability, robustness, evaluation, multi-agent interactions, security, and domain-specific evaluations. Entry points vary by stakeholder: funders should start with promise rankings (pp. 12-13), researchers with domain-specific sub-areas in Appendix A.

- Critical path: For near-term impact (<$10M, <2 years) → evaluation methodology → domain-specific evaluations (CBRN, cyber, deception) → oversight/monitoring tools. For long-term bets → hardware security → interpretability foundations → mechanistic understanding of reasoning.

- Design tradeoffs: The $10M/2-year tractability frame disadvantages infrastructure-heavy security research despite high importance; conversely, it advantages evaluation work where progress metrics are clearer but causal impact on harm reduction may be indirect.

- Failure signatures:
  - High variance in expert ratings signals unresolved debates
  - Low response counts (n<3) indicate expert coverage gaps—29 sub-areas excluded from quantitative analysis
  - Importance-tractability gaps >1.5 suggest areas requiring sustained large-scale investment

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Map your organization's current portfolio against the 105-sub-area taxonomy to identify coverage gaps relative to expert-ranked priorities
  2. For evaluation-focused investments, verify that proposed metrics have clear thresholds tied to the paper's harm definitions (>100 lives, >$10B economic impact)
  3. For multi-agent safety work, establish whether existing testbeds can simulate the interaction patterns experts flag as concerning (collusion, correlated failures, emergent coordination)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Is it feasible to develop a continuously maintained, "live" version of this survey to track real-time changes in research priorities?
  - Basis in paper: The authors state they "plan to explore the feasibility of such a project" to address the lag between data collection and publication
  - Why unresolved: The standard survey process is time-intensive, causing results to become outdated quickly in the rapidly evolving AI landscape
  - What evidence would resolve it: A successful implementation of a dynamic survey platform that maintains data quality without causing expert fatigue

- Question: To what extent do experts bias their ratings toward their own research sub-areas compared to adjacent fields?
  - Basis in paper: The authors identify "Mitigating respondent bias" as a key future direction, noting the challenge of experts favoring their own research
  - Why unresolved: The current anonymous data does not link specific demographic expertise to ratings, preventing the quantification of this bias
  - What evidence would resolve it: A statistical analysis correlating self-identified expertise with relative ratings in future non-anonymous iterations

- Question: How can the perspectives of diverse stakeholders and the broader public be systematically integrated into technical research prioritization?
  - Basis in paper: The authors note that "technical expertise is only one component" and future work must explore inclusive processes like participatory workshops
  - Why unresolved: Current rankings rely almost entirely on technical experts (84% ML/CS background), potentially neglecting broader sociotechnical values
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative results between technical expert rankings and rankings derived from public or stakeholder participatory methods

## Limitations

- The 10.6% response rate and reliance on author-based recruitment may introduce selection bias toward particular research traditions or geographic regions
- The $10M/2-year tractability frame may systematically disadvantage long-horizon research (hardware security, interpretability) despite their high importance scores
- High variance in expert ratings for several sub-areas signals unresolved conceptual disagreements that the promise score methodology cannot resolve

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The ranking of evaluation and monitoring approaches as top priorities, supported by both promise scores and consensus variance analysis across multiple independent data points
- **Medium confidence**: The identification of multi-agent safety as underinvested but critical, based on consistent high scores across all sub-areas, though empirical validation of the claimed qualitative differences from single-agent risks remains pending
- **Low confidence**: The precise tractability assessments for long-horizon areas like hardware security and mechanistic interpretability, given the small expert samples (n=3) and the potential mismatch between the $10M/2-year frame and actual research timelines

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the survey with broader recruitment methods (including non-author experts and practitioners) to assess whether the current ranking holds under different sampling frames
2. For the top 10 promise-scored areas, map existing funding portfolios to identify actual investment gaps versus perceived ones in the expert consensus
3. Conduct a small-scale validation study where research teams attempt to make progress on the highest-variance sub-areas within the $10M/2-year constraint to test the tractability assessments empirically
