# FORLER: Federated Offline Reinforcement Learning with Q-Ensemble and Actor Rectification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.02055
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02055
- **Reference count:** 21
- **Primary result:** Proposes FORLER for federated offline RL in IoT, combining Q-ensemble aggregation with δ-periodic actor rectification to mitigate policy pollution and improve performance across heterogeneous data.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenges of offline federated reinforcement learning in IoT systems, where devices collect diverse datasets with varying quality. The authors propose FORLER, a method that combines server-side Q-ensemble aggregation with device-side actor rectification to handle policy pollution and local optima issues. The method introduces a δ-periodic actor rectification strategy that balances computational efficiency with performance improvement. Extensive experiments on D4RL MuJoCo tasks demonstrate FORLER's superiority over strong baselines, showing consistent performance gains and faster convergence under various data quality distributions and device counts.

## Method Summary
FORLER tackles offline federated RL by implementing a two-level optimization framework. At the server level, it aggregates Q-functions from all devices using a pessimistic ensemble approach to mitigate policy pollution from low-quality data. At the device level, it employs actor rectification with zeroth-order search and regularization to escape local optima. The key innovation is the δ-periodic actor rectification strategy, which performs actor updates only every δ iterations to reduce computational burden while maintaining performance. This approach balances the need for local exploration with the efficiency requirements of federated learning systems.

## Key Results
- FORLER consistently outperforms strong baselines (Fed-CQL, Fed-TD3BC, FEDORA) on D4RL MuJoCo tasks (Walker2d, Hopper, HalfCheetah, Ant) with higher scores and faster convergence
- The method demonstrates robustness under varying data quality distributions and different numbers of participating devices
- Theoretical analysis provides safe policy improvement guarantees through pessimistic value estimation
- δ-periodic actor rectification effectively balances local computation and performance, reducing device-side computational load

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of FORLER stems from its dual approach to handling the unique challenges of federated offline RL. The Q-ensemble aggregation at the server creates a pessimistic value estimate that prevents overfitting to potentially noisy or biased data from individual devices. Meanwhile, the actor rectification mechanism allows each device to locally escape suboptimal policies while being regularized to stay within the support of their collected data. The δ-periodic strategy ensures that devices don't waste computation on frequent actor updates when the Q-function changes are minimal, making the approach practical for resource-constrained IoT devices.

## Foundational Learning
- **Pessimistic value estimation:** Uses ensemble of Q-functions to avoid overestimation bias from low-quality data. Why needed: Prevents policy pollution from devices with poor datasets. Quick check: Verify ensemble variance correlates with data quality metrics.
- **Zeroth-order optimization:** Enables policy updates without requiring gradient information from the environment. Why needed: Essential for true offline learning where environment interaction is prohibited. Quick check: Compare convergence speed with first-order methods on synthetic problems.
- **Federated averaging with variance weighting:** Aggregates model updates based on data quality indicators. Why needed: Ensures high-quality data contributions have greater influence on the global model. Quick check: Test sensitivity to weighting schemes under known data quality distributions.
- **Safe policy improvement bounds:** Provides theoretical guarantees for policy updates within the support of offline data. Why needed: Ensures learned policies don't deviate into dangerous or untested state-action regions. Quick check: Verify bound tightness empirically on benchmark tasks.
- **Communication-efficient federated learning:** Reduces frequency of model updates to save bandwidth. Why needed: Critical for IoT systems with limited communication resources. Quick check: Measure actual bandwidth savings under different δ values.
- **Actor-critic framework with regularization:** Stabilizes learning by constraining policy updates. Why needed: Prevents catastrophic forgetting of useful behaviors from good data sources. Quick check: Monitor KL divergence between consecutive policies during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Server -> Q-ensemble aggregation -> Global Q-function -> Device broadcast
Device -> Local data buffer -> Actor rectification (δ-periodic) -> Q-function update -> Server upload

**Critical Path:**
1. Devices upload Q-function parameters to server
2. Server aggregates using pessimistic ensemble to create global Q
3. Server broadcasts global Q to all devices
4. Devices perform actor rectification every δ iterations
5. Devices upload updated Q-functions to server

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The δ-periodic actor rectification strategy trades off between computational efficiency and responsiveness to Q-function changes. Smaller δ values provide more frequent policy updates but increase device computation, while larger δ values save computation but may miss important Q-function improvements. The pessimistic ensemble aggregation trades estimation accuracy for safety, potentially underestimating values from high-quality data sources but preventing catastrophic overestimation from poor data.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Performance degradation when δ is too large relative to Q-function change rate
- Suboptimal convergence when data quality variance is extremely high across devices
- Communication bottlenecks when too many devices participate simultaneously
- Local optima entrapment when regularization parameters are too restrictive

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test single-device performance to verify actor rectification effectiveness without federation complexity
2. Run with homogeneous high-quality data across all devices to establish upper performance bound
3. Evaluate with extreme data quality heterogeneity (some devices with near-random data) to test robustness limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dependence on fixed δ scheduling may not be optimal across all federated settings and could introduce communication overhead if δ is too small
- Assumes reliable device-server communication and synchronized aggregation intervals that may not hold in highly dynamic IoT environments
- Does not address scenarios with extreme data scarcity or devices with completely incompatible state-action spaces
- Theoretical safe policy improvement guarantees rely on assumptions about value function boundedness and Lipschitz continuity that may not hold in all practical tasks

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Q-ensemble aggregation effectiveness and actor rectification mechanisms, well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results
- **Medium confidence:** Scalability under varying device counts, experiments show improvement but don't explore extreme federation scenarios
- **Medium confidence:** Robustness to heterogeneous data quality, evaluation covers several distributions but doesn't test edge cases like adversarial data sources

## Next Checks
1. Test FORLER's performance under extreme device heterogeneity where some devices have orders of magnitude more data than others, to verify the pessimistic ensemble's effectiveness in highly imbalanced settings.

2. Evaluate the impact of different δ scheduling strategies (adaptive vs. fixed) on both performance and communication efficiency, particularly in scenarios with highly variable network conditions.

3. Implement FORLER in a real-world IoT testbed with physical devices to validate the method's practical utility beyond simulated environments, focusing on communication overhead and computation constraints.
