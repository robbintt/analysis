# Measuring Mechanistic Independence: Can Bias Be Removed Without Erasing Demographics?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.20796
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20796
- Reference count: 36
- Key finding: Demographic bias mechanisms operate independently from demographic recognition, requiring dimension-specific interventions for effective debiasing

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multi-task evaluation pipeline to assess how demographic bias mechanisms in language models differ from general demographic recognition. Using bidirectional prompts linking demographics to names, professions, and education levels, the authors systematically compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for identifying bias features. In Gemma-2-9B, attribution-based ablations reduced race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations were more effective for education bias. The study reveals that bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, with contextual sophistication proxies driving stereotyping.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a multi-task evaluation pipeline that uses bidirectional prompts connecting demographics to various attributes (names, professions, education levels). They employed both attribution-based ablations (identifying features that causally influence outputs) and correlation-based methods (measuring statistical relationships) to systematically identify and mitigate bias features in Gemma-2-9B. The pipeline measures effectiveness through KL divergence reductions in stereotypical associations while tracking preservation of legitimate demographic recognition tasks. Cross-task and cross-format validations were used to confirm that debiasing effects were specific to the targeted bias dimensions.

## Key Results
- Attribution-based ablations reduced race and gender profession stereotypes by 34.2% KL reduction while preserving name recognition accuracy
- Correlation-based ablations achieved 30.7% KL reduction for education bias and avoided "prior collapse"
- Bias mechanisms operate through task-specific pathways rather than absolute demographic markers, with contextual sophistication proxies identified as key drivers of stereotyping

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that demographic bias in language models emerges from task-specific computational mechanisms that are mechanistically independent from general demographic recognition capabilities. Attribution-based methods work well for race and gender bias because these biases are encoded through specific feature pathways that can be selectively ablated without disrupting the model's ability to recognize demographic information when contextually appropriate. Correlation-based methods excel for education bias because this type of stereotyping is more diffuse and interconnected with other model representations, making statistical correlation detection more effective than causal attribution. The independence of these mechanisms means that effective debiasing requires dimension-specific interventions tailored to how each bias type is mechanistically encoded.

## Foundational Learning
**Bidirectional Prompt Engineering**: Prompts that map demographics to attributes in both directions to capture full representational relationships - needed to comprehensively map bias mechanisms, quick check: verify both directions produce coherent outputs
**KL Divergence for Bias Measurement**: Kullback-Leibler divergence quantifies changes in probability distributions between biased and debiased model outputs - needed to measure effectiveness of interventions, quick check: confirm reduction correlates with qualitative bias reduction
**Attribution-Based Ablation**: Method identifying features that causally influence outputs through systematic removal and observation - needed for targeted intervention design, quick check: validate that ablated features specifically relate to bias dimensions
**Correlation-Based Feature Detection**: Statistical methods measuring relationships between demographic features and outputs - needed for detecting diffuse bias patterns, quick check: verify correlation patterns persist across multiple model runs

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Bidirectional prompts -> Feature detection (attribution/correlate) -> Ablation intervention -> KL divergence measurement -> Cross-task validation
**Critical Path**: Prompt design → Bias feature identification → Intervention application → Performance measurement → Validation across tasks
**Design Tradeoffs**: Attribution methods provide causal understanding but may miss diffuse patterns; correlation methods capture broader relationships but lack causal specificity; single-model focus enables controlled experiments but limits generalizability
**Failure Signatures**: Prior collapse (over-aggressive debiasing), task interference (debiasing one dimension affecting unrelated tasks), measurement noise from small sample sizes
**First Experiments**: 1) Replicate bidirectional prompt consistency checks, 2) Compare attribution vs correlation feature overlap for same bias dimensions, 3) Test intervention stability across multiple random seeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Single model focus (Gemma-2-9B) limits generalizability to other architectures and scales
- Attribution method's superior performance for race/gender bias needs validation across different cultural contexts and naming conventions
- Focus on English-language prompts and Western demographic categories creates potential blind spots for global applicability

## Confidence
- **High**: Mechanistic independence of bias from demographic recognition (consistent cross-task validation)
- **Medium**: Contextual sophistication proxies as stereotyping drivers (based on indirect proxy measures)
- **Medium**: Dimension-specific interventions being necessary (supported by experimental data but needs broader validation)

## Next Checks
1) Replicate the entire pipeline across at least three additional model families (different scales, architectures, and training paradigms) to assess generalizability of the mechanistic independence finding
2) Conduct ablation studies specifically targeting the contextual sophistication proxies identified as drivers of stereotyping to verify their causal role
3) Test the debiasing interventions' robustness across multilingual prompts and non-Western demographic categories to evaluate cultural transferability of the dimension-specific approach
