# Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer for Reliability-Aware Early Fault Warning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21293
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21293
- Reference count: 40
- The authors propose a compact tri-branch encoder combining convolutional stem, Tiny-Mamba SSM, and local Transformer with physics-guided spectral alignment and EVT-based threshold calibration for early fault warning.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of reliable early fault warning in rotating machinery under nonstationary operating conditions, domain shifts, and severe class imbalance, while maintaining low false-alarm rates. The authors propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder that combines a convolutional stem for micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch for long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer for cross-channel resonances. The method includes a physics-guided spectral alignment that maps attention to classical bearing fault-order bands for interpretability and a decision layer using extreme value theory (EVT) to achieve a target false-alarm intensity with hysteresis to suppress chatter. Evaluated on leakage-free streaming benchmarks (CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot), PG-TMT shows higher precision-recall AUC, competitive or better ROC AUC, shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, and strong cross-domain transfer, with demonstrated real-time deployment capability on CPUs and embedded GPUs.

## Method Summary
The method combines a tri-branch encoder architecture with physics-guided spectral alignment and EVT-based decision thresholds. The encoder uses depthwise-separable convolutions for micro-transients, Tiny-Mamba SSM for long-horizon dynamics, and a local Transformer for cross-channel resonances, fused via gated residuals. Physics priors constrain attention to bearing fault-order bands through spectral alignment losses. The decision layer calibrates thresholds using EVT on healthy-score exceedances to achieve target false-alarm intensity, with dual-threshold hysteresis to suppress chatter. Training uses class-balanced BCE/focal loss plus physics losses, with streaming inference maintaining model state.

## Key Results
- PG-TMT achieves higher precision-recall AUC and competitive ROC AUC versus single-branch or conventional models across multiple datasets
- Mean time-to-detect is reduced at matched false-alarm intensity compared to baseline methods
- Strong cross-domain transfer performance demonstrated on leakage-free machine/rig-level splits
- Real-time deployment capability confirmed with sub-10ms inference on CPUs and embedded GPUs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-timescale feature capture via tri-branch fusion may improve early fault detection under nonstationary conditions, contingent on each branch capturing distinct temporal dynamics.
- Mechanism: The convolutional stem extracts micro-transients (impact-like events), the Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-horizon dynamics with stable recurrence, and the local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. Gated residual fusion combines these into unified representations, producing association-discrepancy evidence.
- Core assumption: Each branch captures complementary information that would be lost in a single-architecture encoder; long-horizon degradation follows near-linear dynamics suitable for SSM modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances."
  - [section II-A]: Stability parameterization ensures ρ(A)<1 via continuous-time diagonal A_c = −softplus(η) and zero-order-hold discretization.
  - [corpus]: Related work on physics-aware LSTM autoencoders (arxiv:2512.06809) demonstrates benefits of physics-informed architectures, but Tiny-Mamba specifically is not evaluated in corpus papers.
- Break condition: If degradation dynamics become highly nonlinear or if micro-transients are dominated by noise rather than fault signatures, the assumed complementarity may degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Physics-guided spectral alignment constrains attention to physically meaningful frequency bands, which may improve interpretability and reduce spurious detections.
- Mechanism: Temporal attention p_t is projected to spectral attention A_t(f_k) via weighted DFT. A Gaussian-mixture mask M_t(f) derived from bearing fault orders (BPFI, BPFO, BSF, FTF) and sidebands penalizes attention outside physically plausible bands through KL divergence and Laplacian smoothness losses.
- Core assumption: Bearing geometry parameters (N_b, d, D_p, θ) and RPM estimates are sufficiently accurate; fault signatures concentrate around theoretical order bands.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility."
  - [section II-B]: Equations (15)-(19) define fault orders and spectral mask; ablation in Table II shows removing physics priors reduces PR-AUC and increases FAR.
  - [corpus]: "Optimized Spectral Fault Receptive Fields" (arxiv:2506.12375) uses frequency-domain features for diagnosis, supporting frequency-domain approaches but not the specific attention-to-spectrum mapping.
- Break condition: If operating-point excursions cause order bands to shift outside the mask, or if geometry metadata is incorrect, spectral alignment may misdirect attention.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: EVT-based threshold calibration with hysteresis provides practitioner-controllable false-alarm intensity and stable alarm episodes.
- Mechanism: Healthy-score exceedances above threshold u are modeled as Generalized Pareto Distribution. The on-threshold τ_on is analytically derived (Eq. 25) to achieve target intensity λ_FA. Dual-threshold hysteresis (τ_on, τ_off = τ_on − δ) with minimum hold time T_min suppresses rapid on/off chatter.
- Core assumption: Score tails follow GPD; exceedance arrivals approximate a Poisson process; healthy calibration data is representative.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter."
  - [section II-C]: Proposition (closed-form on-threshold) provides τ_on formula; validity domain specified; Table V shows realized FAR staying near target across SNR levels.
  - [corpus]: Risk-based prognostics (arxiv:2508.11031) describes risk-decision coupling but does not evaluate EVT-based intensity control specifically.
- Break condition: If score distribution deviates significantly from GPD (e.g., multimodal healthy scores) or if operating conditions shift calibration validity, realized intensity may diverge from target.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **State-space models (SSMs) and selective recurrence**
  - Why needed here: The Tiny-Mamba branch uses discretized continuous-time dynamics with stability constraints; understanding how A, B, C matrices govern recurrence is essential for debugging long-horizon tracking.
  - Quick check question: Given a diagonal state matrix A with eigenvalues λ_i, what condition ensures stable recurrence over infinite horizons?

- Concept: **Extreme value theory and Peaks-over-Threshold**
  - Why needed here: The decision layer models score exceedances as GPD; understanding tail behavior and Poisson arrival assumptions is critical for threshold calibration and diagnosing FAR deviations.
  - Quick check question: If the shape parameter ξ > 0, what does this imply about the tail behavior of the distribution?

- Concept: **Bearing fault frequency orders**
  - Why needed here: The spectral alignment loss requires computing BPFI, BPFO, BSF, FTF from geometry; understanding these orders enables validation of physics priors and debugging alignment failures.
  - Quick check question: For a bearing with N_b = 8 balls, pitch diameter D_p = 40mm, ball diameter d = 8mm, contact angle θ = 0°, and shaft frequency f_r = 25 Hz, compute BPFO.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Stem: Depthwise-separable 1-D conv → micro-transients (y_conv)
  - Branch 1: Tiny-Mamba SSM → long-horizon dynamics (y_ssm)
  - Branch 2: Local-window Transformer → cross-channel coupling (y_att)
  - Fusion: Gated residual combining [y_conv || y_ssm || y_att]
  - Scoring: Association-discrepancy evidence → calibrated score s_t
  - Decision: EVT threshold τ_on + hysteresis → alarm episodes

- Critical path: Raw vibration window → Stem → parallel branches → fusion → evidence → score → EVT threshold → alarm output. Latency is dominated by local attention O(N_h · W · d_head) and SSM update O(d_ssm).

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Window length L vs. detection latency: longer L improves spectral resolution but delays detection.
  - Band-alignment weight λ_align vs. flexibility: stronger physics constraint improves interpretability but may suppress genuine off-band signatures.
  - Hold time T_min vs. responsiveness: longer T_min reduces chatter but delays alarm confirmation.

- Failure signatures:
  - FAR drifting above target: Check RPM-aware τ_on adaptation; verify calibration data represents current operating regime.
  - Delayed detection (high MTTD): Check convolutional stem output for transient suppression; verify SSM state isn't saturating.
  - Attention leaking outside fault bands: Reduce λ_align or check geometry/RPM inputs for errors.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation per branch**: Run full model vs. each branch removed on validation split; quantify PR-AUC and MTTD impact to validate complementarity assumption.
  2. **Calibration sensitivity**: Vary u (95th vs 99th percentile) and λ_FA target; plot realized FAR vs. target to verify EVT calibration holds across operating points.
  3. **Noise robustness sweep**: Evaluate at SNR ∈ {0, 5, 10, 15, 20} dB with fixed thresholds; confirm graceful PR-AUC degradation and contained FAR per Table IV-V patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can self-calibrating spectral priors be developed that automatically track operating-condition changes (speed, load, geometry) without requiring manual re-calibration of fault-order bands?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "PG-TMT currently relies on geometry and RPM metadata to seed spectral priors; large operating-point excursions or configuration changes may require re-calibration" and propose future work on "self-calibrating priors via online identification and RPM compensation."
- Why unresolved: Current spectral alignment uses fixed bearing geometry (Nb, d, Dp, θ) and RPM estimates; the paper does not address how bands would adapt when these parameters drift or are unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of online band-adaptation mechanisms that maintain band-alignment scores (ρ) and false-alarm intensity (λFA) under simulated operating-point excursions, with comparison to fixed-prior baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can uncertainty quantification be integrated into EVT-based threshold calibration to support risk-aware maintenance decisions under covariate shift?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future work includes "incorporate uncertainty quantification for EVT and score calibration to better support risk-aware maintenance decisions under covariate shift."
- Why unresolved: The paper fits GPD parameters (ξ, β) and rate (λu) to healthy calibration data but does not propagate parameter uncertainty into confidence bounds on the derived on-threshold (τon) or alarm-intensity estimates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Derivation and empirical validation of uncertainty intervals for τon and realized λFA under distributional shift, with decision rules that account for calibration uncertainty in maintenance planning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the PG-TMT framework generalize to non-rotating machinery assets and heterogeneous sensing modalities beyond vibration (e.g., acoustic, current, temperature)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note: "Our experiments focus on rotating machinery with vibration sensing and do not yet cover other asset classes or heterogeneous sensing modalities."
- Why unresolved: Physics priors (BPFI/BPFO/BSF/FTF order bands, MSD residual) are derived specifically for bearing vibration; it is unclear how the tri-branch encoder and spectral alignment would be reformulated for different physics or modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Transfer experiments on non-bearing datasets (e.g., gearbox, pump, motor current signatures) with modality-appropriate physics priors, reporting PR-AUC, MTTD, and band-alignment analogues.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Under what conditions does the Poisson-arrival assumption for EVT exceedances remain valid in streaming deployment with rapid operating-point transients?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The decision layer assumes "exceedance arrivals above u form (to first order) a Poisson process" and uses ΔTmerge for declustering, but rapid RPM/load transients may violate the stationarity assumption without explicit validation.
- Why unresolved: The paper applies RPM-aware τon(Ω̂) compensation but does not quantitatively assess EVT model fit under aggressive speed transients or time-varying healthy-score distributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Goodness-of-fit tests (e.g., Anderson–Darling for GPD tails, Poisson process diagnostics) on healthy-score exceedances under synthetic and field speed-transient scenarios, with comparison of achieved vs. target λFA.

## Limitations
- Physics priors depend on accurate bearing geometry and RPM estimates; errors in these inputs could degrade both interpretability and detection performance
- EVT calibration assumes score tail behavior follows GPD and healthy data represents current operating conditions—significant operating-point shifts or GPD misfit could cause target false-alarm intensity to drift
- Cross-domain transfer gains are demonstrated, yet the role of shared physical priors versus dataset-specific features is not fully disentangled

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Tri-branch architecture improves PR-AUC and MTTD versus single-branch or conventional CNNs/Transformers (supported by ablation and Table I)
- **Medium Confidence**: Physics-guided spectral alignment yields interpretable band-alignment scores and reduces false alarms (supported by Table II ablation and qualitative alignment plots)
- **Medium Confidence**: EVT-based dual-threshold hysteresis achieves practitioner-controllable false-alarm intensity with ≤1.2× drift (supported by Table V across SNR levels)

## Next Checks
1. **Geometry Sensitivity Test**: Systematically vary bearing geometry inputs (±10% ball count, pitch/ball diameters) and quantify degradation in band-alignment score and detection performance to bound robustness to metadata errors

2. **Operating-Point Drift Stress Test**: Simulate healthy data drift (e.g., RPM changes, load shifts) after EVT calibration; track realized false-alarm intensity over time to assess validity domain limits and need for adaptive thresholds

3. **Real-Time Edge Deployment Validation**: Deploy PG-TMT on embedded GPU (e.g., Jetson Xavier) with batch=1; measure actual latency (p50/p90/p99) and CPU/GPU utilization under realistic streaming rates to confirm claimed sub-10ms inference feasibility
