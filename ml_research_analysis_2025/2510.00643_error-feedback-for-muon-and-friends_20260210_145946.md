# Error Feedback for Muon and Friends

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00643
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00643
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First communication-efficient distributed optimizer for Muon/Scion/Gluon family with bidirectional compression

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EF21-Muon, a communication-efficient distributed optimizer that extends error feedback to non-Euclidean settings. The method enables bidirectional compression for the Muon/Scion/Gluon family of optimizers while maintaining strong convergence guarantees. The authors demonstrate up to 7x communication savings on NanoGPT without accuracy degradation compared to uncompressed baselines, while providing theoretical convergence guarantees under both standard non-Euclidean smoothness and the more general (L0,L1)-smoothness regimes.

## Method Summary
EF21-Muon extends the error feedback mechanism to non-Euclidean settings by incorporating the Bregman divergence framework. The method modifies the standard EF21 algorithm to work with non-Euclidean gradients through appropriate choice of norms and prox operators. The key innovation is the error correction mechanism that accumulates and compresses gradient errors while preserving convergence properties. The algorithm supports stochastic gradients, momentum, and various non-Euclidean compressors, making it applicable to the broader Muon/Scion/Gluon optimizer family.

## Key Results
- Up to 7x communication savings on NanoGPT with no accuracy degradation compared to uncompressed baselines
- Theoretical convergence guarantees under both standard non-Euclidean smoothness and (L0,L1)-smoothness regimes
- First bidirectional compression method for non-Euclidean optimizers in the Muon family
- Matches state-of-the-art convergence rates for Euclidean methods while enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by extending the error feedback mechanism to non-Euclidean settings through the Bregman divergence framework. The key insight is that by carefully accumulating and correcting gradient errors using appropriate norms and prox operators, the algorithm can maintain convergence properties even with aggressive compression. The bidirectional compression capability is achieved by applying error feedback both in the forward and backward communication phases, allowing for significant communication savings while preserving the optimizer's convergence behavior.

## Foundational Learning

**Non-Euclidean Smoothness**: Generalization of smoothness conditions beyond Euclidean spaces using Bregman divergences and appropriate norms. Needed to extend optimization theory to more general geometries. Quick check: Verify the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient under the chosen norm.

**Error Feedback Mechanism**: Technique for preserving convergence in compressed gradient settings by accumulating and correcting quantization errors. Needed to enable communication-efficient distributed training. Quick check: Confirm that error accumulation preserves the convergence guarantees of the base optimizer.

**(L0,L1)-Smoothness Regime**: More general smoothness condition that relaxes traditional Lipschitz assumptions. Needed to capture a broader class of optimization problems and enable faster convergence under suitable norm choices. Quick check: Validate the relationship between L0 and L1 parameters for the target problem class.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Code -> Gradient Computation -> Non-Euclidean Compression -> Error Feedback Accumulation -> Parameter Update -> Model Output

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves gradient computation, non-Euclidean compression with error feedback, and parameter update. The compression and error feedback stages are where the main innovations occur and where communication bottlenecks are addressed.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades off compression quality against convergence speed and final accuracy. Bidirectional compression provides greater communication savings but may require more careful tuning of error feedback parameters. The choice of norm and (L0,L1) parameters affects both theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

**Failure Signatures**: Convergence degradation when compression ratio is too aggressive, error accumulation becomes unstable, or inappropriate norms are chosen for the problem geometry. Poor performance may also occur when the (L0,L1)-smoothness assumptions are violated.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Verify basic convergence on a simple convex problem with known solution
2. Compare communication efficiency vs. accuracy trade-off across different compression schemes
3. Test bidirectional vs. unidirectional compression on a small-scale distributed training task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies heavily on standard non-Euclidean smoothness assumptions and (L0,L1)-smoothness framework
- Experimental validation limited to a single NLP task (NanoGPT) without broader architecture coverage
- Trade-offs between compression ratio, convergence speed, and final accuracy are not fully characterized
- Extension to momentum variance reduction is mentioned but not theoretically analyzed or experimentally validated

## Confidence

**Major Claim Confidence**:
- Convergence guarantees under non-Euclidean smoothness: **High**
- EF21-Muon achieves communication efficiency without accuracy loss: **Medium** (based on limited experiments)
- Theoretical rates match Euclidean state-of-the-art: **High** (under stated assumptions)
- Bidirectional compression with strong guarantees: **Medium** (requires further validation)

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate EF21-Muon on diverse architectures (vision, speech, multimodal) beyond NanoGPT to assess generality
2. Conduct ablation studies on different non-Euclidean norms and (L0,L1)-smoothness regimes to characterize practical benefits
3. Analyze the trade-off between compression ratio, convergence speed, and final model accuracy across varying dataset sizes and model scales
