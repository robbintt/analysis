# Who Is Lagging Behind: Profiling Student Behaviors with Graph-Level Encoding in Curriculum-Based Online Learning Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.18925
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18925
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Graph-level representation learning with GINs and InfoGraph enables profiling of student behaviors in ITS to identify struggling students and analyze cohort differences

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CTGraph, a self-supervised graph-level representation learning approach for profiling student behaviors in curriculum-based online learning systems. The method constructs curriculum-aligned graphs for each student, capturing learning paths and performance metrics across concepts using Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs) within an InfoGraph framework. By encoding students' learning behaviors into fixed-length vector representations through contrastive learning, the approach enables educators to identify struggling students as outliers in the latent space and perform comparative analysis across different student cohorts.

## Method Summary
CTGraph constructs curriculum-based learning graphs where nodes represent concepts with multivariate tracing vectors (accuracy, attempts, timing) as attributes. The method applies node absorption to remove unattempted concepts while preserving structural relationships. A 3-layer GIN encoder generates global and local representations, which are trained using InfoGraph's mutual information maximization between graph-level and subgraph-level representations. The resulting 96-dimensional embeddings are compressed via PCA for visualization and analysis. The approach identifies struggling students through outlier detection in the latent space and enables comparative analysis by measuring behavioral similarities and differences among student groups.

## Key Results
- CTGraph effectively identifies struggling students by locating them as outliers in the learned latent space
- The method provides comparative analysis of different student groups to pinpoint when and where students are struggling
- Latent space representations reveal subtle differences in behaviors and learning paths among similar students

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Graph Construction Preserves Curriculum Structure and Behavioral Granularity
Representing student learning as curriculum-aligned graphs enables simultaneous capture of structural learning paths and fine-grained behavioral attributes. Curriculum-structure graphs encode prerequisite relationships between concepts. Student-specific graphs include only attempted concepts with multivariate tracing vectors as node attributes. Node absorption removes unvisited concepts while reconnecting nearest successors, eliminating null values that would harm contrastive learning. Core assumption: Students' concept coverage patterns and per-concept performance metrics jointly characterize learning status meaningfully.

### Mechanism 2: Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning Generates Discriminative Representations
InfoGraph's mutual information maximization between global and local representations produces embeddings that encode multi-scale behavioral patterns without manual labeling. GIN encoder iteratively aggregates k-hop neighborhood information to form patch representations. A READOUT function creates global graph-level representation. The contrastive discriminator distinguishes positive global/local pairs from negative samples across all graph instances, forcing the encoder to preserve both structural patterns and node-level attribute variations. Core assumption: Students with similar learning behaviors and paths will converge to nearby regions in the learned latent space.

### Mechanism 3: Latent Space Geometry Enables Behavioral Cohort Discovery
The learned 96-dimensional representations exhibit smooth distributions over behavioral attributes, enabling outlier detection and similar-student retrieval through geometric operations. PCA compression to 3D enables visualization. Color-coding by aggregated tracing attributes shows gradient alignment in the latent space. Cosine distance in the original 96-dim space identifies neighboring students with similar behaviors. Vector arithmetic identifies cohort groups showing progressive behavioral differences. Core assumption: The encoder produces representations where cosine/Euclidean distances correlate with multi-dimensional behavioral similarity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs)**
  - Why needed here: GINs provide maximum discriminative power for distinguishing graph structures, which is critical when students cover similar concepts but in structurally different prerequisite orders
  - Quick check question: Why would a standard mean-pooling GCN fail to distinguish two students who covered the same concepts but in different sequences?

- **Concept: Mutual Information Maximization**
  - Why needed here: The InfoGraph objective ensures global representations preserve information from all local subgraph patches, preventing the encoder from collapsing to trivial solutions that ignore fine-grained behavioral details
  - Quick check question: What would happen to the learned representations if mutual information were maximized only at the global level, without enforcing local patch consistency?

- **Concept: Contrastive Learning with Negative Sampling**
  - Why needed here: Self-supervised learning requires distinguishing each student's graph from others; negative samples across the dataset provide the learning signal without manual labels, particularly important for long-tail behavioral distributions
  - Quick check question: Why might using only within-batch negatives be insufficient when student behaviors follow a highly skewed distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Data Preprocessing -> Graph Construction -> GIN Encoder -> Contrastive Discriminator -> Representation Extraction -> Analysis Pipeline

- **Critical path:**
  1. Validate curriculum-structure graph has correct prerequisite edges
  2. Verify node absorption preserves nearest-successor relationships after removing empty nodes
  3. Monitor contrastive loss convergence — should decrease steadily without collapse
  4. Confirm latent space exhibits attribute gradients via color-coded validation plots

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Node absorption vs. null-value handling: Absorption eliminates sparsity issues but loses explicit information about which concepts were skipped
  - Medium-high coverage threshold (50%): Ensures graphs have sufficient complexity for contrastive learning but excludes early-stage or disengaged students from training
  - Sum READOUT vs. mean/attention: Sum preserves learning intensity information (total attempts) but may bias toward students covering more concepts
  - 3-layer GIN depth: Balances discriminative power with computational cost; may miss long-range dependencies in curricula with deep prerequisite chains

- **Failure signatures:**
  - All representations cluster tightly → Check gradient flow or increase negative sample diversity
  - No correlation between latent position and behavioral attributes → Encoder may have collapsed; verify MI loss is non-trivial
  - Outliers don't correspond to low-performing students → Validate tracing vector construction and attribute normalization
  - Cohort groups show no behavioral progression → Vector search may be retrieving noise; verify cosine distance calculations or increase representation dimensionality

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline validation: Train CTGraph on a single topic. Visualize 3D latent space with color-coded accuracy/attempt/timing. Confirm smooth gradients and that outliers align with known struggling students.
  2. Coverage threshold ablation: Compare representations learned with 30%, 50%, and 70% concept coverage thresholds. Measure impact on student inclusion count and latent space discriminative quality.
  3. Cross-topic transfer: Train CTGraph on Algebra I and evaluate whether the encoder produces meaningful representations for Algebra II without retraining. Assess if latent space structure transfers across related curricula.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Does the integration of fine-grained temporal features (e.g., temporal embeddings via Transformers) significantly improve the discriminative power of student representations compared to the aggregated statistics used in the current study?
- **Open Question 2**: To what extent does the "node absorption" technique introduce structural bias against students with partial attendance, thereby conflating "lagging" behavior with "skipped" behavior?
- **Open Question 3**: Can this graph-based profiling framework effectively identify "superficial engagement" or academic dishonesty (e.g., Generative AI usage) which may produce high-accuracy traces without genuine comprehension?

## Limitations
- Uses proprietary dataset from Adaptemy, limiting reproducibility and external validation
- Qualitative evaluation through PCA visualization lacks quantitative validation metrics
- No direct validation from corpus papers for this specific application of graph representation learning to educational data

## Confidence
- **High**: Theoretical foundation of using GINs for graph-level representation learning and the InfoGraph framework for self-supervised learning
- **Medium**: Effectiveness of node absorption for handling sparse student graphs and interpretability of the latent space for behavioral analysis
- **Low**: Generalizability of results to other curriculum domains and absence of quantitative validation metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing CTGraph with baseline methods on held-out test data with known student outcomes
2. Implement cross-validation across the four mathematics topics to assess model robustness and identify influential curriculum structures
3. Develop quantitative metrics for measuring the quality of behavioral cohorts identified in the latent space (e.g., silhouette scores, behavioral similarity measures)
