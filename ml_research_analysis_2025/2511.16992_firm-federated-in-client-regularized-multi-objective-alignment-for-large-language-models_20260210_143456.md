# FIRM: Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective Alignment for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16992
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16992
- Reference count: 4
- None

## Executive Summary
FIRM addresses the challenge of federated multi-objective alignment for large language models, balancing helpfulness and harmlessness objectives while maintaining communication efficiency. The method employs a regularized multi-objective gradient descent approach (MGDA) within a federated learning framework, using proximal policy optimization (PPO) for local client updates. The key innovation is the use of a regularized MGDA solver that ensures convergence to Pareto-stationary solutions while maintaining stable gradient directions across clients.

## Method Summary
The method implements federated PPO with LoRA adapters on TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 across 8 clients over 16 rounds. Each client computes separate gradients for helpfulness and harmlessness objectives using respective reward models, constructs a normalized Gram matrix, and solves a regularized QP to find optimal weight combinations. Local updates use 3 PPO epochs per round with batch size 16, then aggregates via FedAvg. Regularization (β=0.01) ensures stable λ convergence across clients.

## Key Results
- Achieves Pareto-stationarity in multi-objective alignment balancing helpfulness and harmlessness
- Demonstrates stable λ convergence across clients during federated training
- Maintains communication efficiency through LoRA-based local updates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by combining multi-objective gradient descent with federated learning constraints. The regularized MGDA solver finds optimal weight combinations that minimize gradient disagreement while maintaining convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions. Trace-normalization of the Gram matrix ensures stable numerical behavior, while LoRA adapters reduce communication overhead. The proximal policy optimization framework enables stable policy updates that balance exploration and exploitation across both objectives.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Why needed - to balance conflicting helpfulness and harmlessness objectives simultaneously; Quick check - verify gradients point in different directions for each objective
- **Federated learning**: Why needed - to train across distributed clients without centralizing sensitive data; Quick check - ensure aggregation works with 8 clients
- **Proximal Policy Optimization**: Why needed - stable reinforcement learning updates for language model fine-tuning; Quick check - monitor KL divergence stays near target
- **LoRA adapters**: Why needed - reduce communication overhead by updating only low-rank matrices; Quick check - verify adapter dimensions (rank=16) work correctly
- **Gram matrix normalization**: Why needed - ensure numerical stability in multi-objective gradient computation; Quick check - confirm trace normalization prevents condition number explosion
- **Regularized QP solver**: Why needed - find stable weight combinations that minimize gradient disagreement; Quick check - verify λ stays within simplex constraints

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: HH-RLHF prompts -> 8 clients -> Local PPO (3 epochs) -> Gram matrix computation -> Regularized MGDA solver -> LoRA update -> FedAvg aggregation -> Model update
- **Critical path**: Prompt distribution → Local PPO training → Multi-objective gradient computation → QP solving → LoRA update → Federated aggregation
- **Design tradeoffs**: LoRA rank 16 vs full fine-tuning (communication efficiency vs performance), β=0.01 regularization vs potential over-regularization, 3 local epochs vs faster convergence
- **Failure signatures**: λ oscillation across clients indicates poor regularization or normalization issues; one objective domination suggests reward scaling problems or insufficient β; slow convergence may indicate inappropriate learning rates
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Test regularized MGDA solver with synthetic gradients to verify λ convergence; 2) Run federated training with 2 clients to debug communication and aggregation; 3) Validate reward model outputs are properly normalized before multi-objective combination

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Missing critical PPO hyperparameters (value loss coefficient, entropy coefficient) that affect convergence behavior
- QP solver implementation unspecified, creating uncertainty about numerical stability and computational efficiency
- Ambiguous prompt sampling strategy across rounds creates uncertainty about data distribution shifts

## Confidence
- High confidence in conceptual framework of regularized MGDA for multi-objective federated alignment
- Medium confidence in empirical results due to missing implementation details
- Low confidence in claimed communication efficiency gains without baseline comparisons

## Next Checks
1. Implement regularized MGDA solver using scipy.optimize with simplex constraints and verify trace-normalized Gram matrices produce stable λ convergence
2. Conduct ablation studies varying β (regularization strength) and rank (LoRA rank) to confirm Pareto-stationarity improvements
3. Test federated pipeline with 2-3 clients first, monitoring per-client reward trajectories and λ stability before scaling to 8 clients
