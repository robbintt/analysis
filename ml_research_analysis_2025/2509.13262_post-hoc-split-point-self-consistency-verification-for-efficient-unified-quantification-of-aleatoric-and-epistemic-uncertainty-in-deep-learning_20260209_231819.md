# Post-Hoc Split-Point Self-Consistency Verification for Efficient, Unified Quantification of Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty in Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13262
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13262
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes a post-hoc single-forward-pass framework that jointly quantifies both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty without modifying pretrained models, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art methods with minimal overhead.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently quantifying both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in deep learning models. Existing methods are either computationally intensive (e.g., Bayesian or ensemble methods) or provide only partial, task-specific estimates (e.g., single-forward-pass techniques). The proposed solution is a post-hoc single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures both uncertainty types without modifying or retraining pretrained models. The core idea is "Split-Point Analysis" (SPA), which decomposes predictive residuals into upper and lower subsets, computing Mean Absolute Residuals (MARs) on each side. Under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel "Self-consistency Discrepancy Score" (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation. For regression, side-specific quantile regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are available, SPA-based calibration identities adjust the softmax outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities. Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks demonstrate that the framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ methods while incurring minimal overhead.

## Method Summary
The framework extracts penultimate-layer features from a frozen base model and computes residuals. It partitions residuals into upper (+) and lower (-) subsets for split-point analysis. A lightweight MLP head jointly predicts quantile regression bounds and MARs for each subset. The Self-consistency Discrepancy Score (SDS) quantifies epistemic uncertainty as the deviation from harmonic mean identity. For regression, split-point QR provides aleatoric intervals calibrated by SDS; for classification, softmax outputs are recalibrated using zero-included MARs from calibration data before computing predictive entropy. The entire process requires only a single forward pass through the base model plus the lightweight UQ head.

## Key Results
- Jointly quantifies aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass without modifying pretrained models
- Regression experiments show improved interval coverage and calibration through split-point quantile regression with SDS-based refinement
- Classification experiments demonstrate effective softmax recalibration and uncertainty estimation when calibration data is available
- Matches or exceeds performance of multiple state-of-the-art UQ methods across diverse benchmarks while maintaining minimal computational overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The deviation from the harmonic mean of split residuals functions as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty (model bias). Under ideal conditions where a model predicts the conditional mean, the total Mean Absolute Deviation equals the harmonic mean of upper and lower subset MADs. The framework computes a Self-consistency Discrepancy Score (SDS) based on the gap between observed MARs and this theoretical identity. A high SDS implies the prediction point is not the conditional mean, signaling model misalignment or bias. The core assumption is that the base model's prediction is the primary split point, and the harmonic identity holds strictly when the model is unbiased.

### Mechanism 2
Separating quantile regression (QR) targets by residual sign improves interval coverage for asymmetric noise distributions. Instead of regressing global quantiles, the framework trains separate heads for upper and lower residuals. This allows the prediction interval to expand asymmetrically (e.g., wider upper bound for positive skew). The SDS is then used to adaptively scale these intervals, enforcing the self-consistency constraint to recalibrate coverage. The core assumption is that the residual distribution is heteroscedastic and potentially asymmetric, requiring separate bounds for over- and under-estimation.

### Mechanism 3
Softmax probabilities can be recalibrated using statistics of zero-included residuals derived from a calibration set. The method treats softmax outputs as expectations of Bernoulli distributions. By computing "zero-included MARs" on a calibration set, it derives the conditional class frequency PC,k. It uses the difference between upper and lower zero-included MARs to adjust the softmax output, correcting for over/under-confidence. The core assumption is that a representative calibration dataset is available to accurately estimate conditional class frequencies.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Heteroscedasticity
**Why needed here:** The entire framework assumes noise ε(x) varies with input x. If you assume homoscedasticity (constant noise), the "split-point" analysis reduces to a global variance estimate, losing the method's primary advantage.
**Quick check question:** Does your target dataset exhibit varying noise levels across the input domain (e.g., sensor reliability dropping at range)?

### Concept: Aleatoric vs. Epistemic Uncertainty
**Why needed here:** The paper explicitly disentangles these. Aleatoric is captured by Prediction Intervals (QR), while Epistemic is captured by the SDS. You must distinguish them to interpret the two output heads correctly.
**Quick check question:** If I double the training dataset size, which uncertainty type should theoretically decrease?

### Concept: Post-Hoc vs. Internal Methods
**Why needed here:** This method is "Post-Hoc External." It appends a lightweight MLP to a frozen base model. Understanding this informs how you manage the training pipeline (i.e., you don't backpropagate through the backbone unless doing "joint" training).
**Quick check question:** Can I apply this method to a model I only have API access to (no gradients), or do I need the feature extractor weights?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Base Model -> Penultimate features h -> UQ Network (MLP with 5 heads) -> SDS + Quantile Bounds + MARs

### Critical path:
1. Extract penultimate features h from the frozen base model
2. Pass h through the UQ MLP to get quantile bounds (q+, q-) and MARs
3. Compute SDS: Δ' = |2z+z- - z(z++z-)|
4. Calibrate Intervals: Scale bounds using SDS-derived factors sC

### Design tradeoffs:
- **UQ Head Depth:** The paper notes that deeper MLPs improve epistemic correlation (SDS accuracy) but increase PIECE (worse calibration/overfitting). Use shallow MLPs for better calibration, or separate heads (deep for MAR/epistemic, shallow for QR/aleatoric).
- **Training Strategy:** Stagewise (Post-hoc) vs. Joint. Stagewise preserves base task accuracy better. Joint training improves epistemic correlation but risks degrading the primary task.

### Failure signatures:
- **High PIECE+ vs Low PIECE- (Asymmetric Error):** Indicates the split-point QR heads are unbalanced; check if R+ or R- subsets are too small
- **Constant SDS:** If SDS remains flat for OOD data, the feature map h may not be informative enough for the MLP to detect distribution shifts
- **Negative Calibration Factors:** If sC calculation yields invalid values, the MAR estimates (z) may have collapsed (near zero), causing numerical instability in the harmonic mean

### First 3 experiments:
1. **Synthetic Validation:** Run on the "Cubic Regression" task with asymmetric LogNormal noise to visually confirm the SDS rises in OOD regions and Intervals adapt to skewness
2. **Ablation on MLP Depth:** Compare a 1-layer vs. 3-layer UQ head on a UCI benchmark to quantify the tradeoff between PIECE (calibration) and Correlation (epistemic)
3. **Stagewise vs. Joint:** Fine-tune the UQ head alone, then try joint training. Compare base model RMSE degradation against the gain in AUROC (epistemic detection)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the split-point self-consistency verification mechanism be modified to robustly identify the correct zero-minimum in the Self-Consistency Discrepancy Score (SDS) landscape when multiple local minima exist due to asymmetric or multimodal distributions? The authors note that if multiple zero-minima exist, the method may "select an improper one, causing systematic biases to evade detection."

### Open Question 2
Can the post-hoc UQ framework be adapted to handle structured feature representations, such as graphs or sequences, without relying on flattened vectorial feature maps? The authors state their "current implementation relies on flat, vectorial feature maps and may not generalize to structured representations (e.g., graphs or sequences) without adapting the UQ regressor."

### Open Question 3
How can the Self-Consistency Discrepancy Score (SDS) be refined to better distinguish between high-uncertainty in-distribution samples and true out-of-distribution (OOD) data points? The Conclusion notes that while SDS is a fine-grained metric, "high-uncertainty in-distribution samples can be mistaken for OOD, reducing its specificity compared to dedicated detectors."

## Limitations
- The harmonic identity assumption may not hold for complex distributions with multiple balance points, potentially causing erroneous zero-uncertainty predictions
- The calibration approach is fundamentally limited by the availability and quality of calibration data, with noisy estimates leading to unreliable probability adjustments
- The split-point QR mechanism adds computational overhead without clear benefits for symmetric noise distributions

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The empirical evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, validating the framework's practical utility

**Medium Confidence:** The theoretical foundations (harmonic identity, self-consistency) are mathematically sound but rely on idealized conditions that may not always hold in practice

**Medium Confidence:** The calibration methodology works when representative calibration sets are available, but sensitivity to calibration set size and quality needs more systematic study

## Next Checks

1. **Synthetic Distribution Stress Test:** Generate synthetic regression data with multiple "balance points" where MAD+ = MAD- but the prediction point ≠ E[Y], then verify whether SDS correctly identifies these as high epistemic uncertainty cases rather than erroneously reporting zero uncertainty

2. **Calibration Set Size Sensitivity:** Systematically vary the calibration set size (from 1% to 50% of training data) on UCI benchmarks and measure the degradation in ECE/AUROC metrics to quantify the framework's sensitivity to calibration data availability

3. **Symmetry vs. Asymmetry Tradeoff:** Compare the proposed split-point QR against standard QR on synthetic data with controlled symmetry parameters (from perfectly symmetric Gaussian to highly skewed distributions) to quantify the performance gain/loss as a function of noise asymmetry
