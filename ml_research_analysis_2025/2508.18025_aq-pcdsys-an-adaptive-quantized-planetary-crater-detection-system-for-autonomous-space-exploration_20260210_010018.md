# AQ-PCDSys: An Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System for Autonomous Space Exploration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.18025
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18025
- Authors: Aditri Paul; Archan Paul
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Integrated QNN, AMF, and multi-scale heads for real-time crater detection on resource-constrained hardware.

## Executive Summary
AQ-PCDSys addresses the challenge of deploying deep learning models for real-time crater detection on resource-constrained, space-qualified hardware. The system integrates a Quantized Neural Network with Quantization Aware Training, an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion module combining optical imagery and Digital Elevation Models, and Multi-Scale Detection Heads. This architecture reduces computational load and memory usage while maintaining high detection accuracy across a wide range of crater sizes. The design enables efficient, context-aware perception for autonomous planetary exploration, overcoming limitations of traditional single-modality detectors in extreme lighting conditions.

## Method Summary
The system employs Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to simulate INT8 constraints during optimization, combined with Conv-BN folding to reduce overhead. Dual-stream backbones process optical imagery and Digital Elevation Models, which are fused via an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism using learned attention masks. Multi-scale detection heads (P3, P4, P5) resolve craters across different diameters, with loss boosting applied to the P3 head for small-crater emphasis. The model is trained on LROC/NAC optical and LOLA DEM data, co-registered at ~1.1m/px resolution.

## Key Results
- Quantized Neural Network with QAT reduces memory and computational overhead while preserving detection fidelity
- Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion compensates for lighting-induced failures in single-modality systems
- Multi-Scale Detection Heads with loss boosting enable accurate detection across crater diameters spanning orders of magnitude

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Quantization-aware training reduces memory and computational overhead while preserving detection fidelity on integer-arithmetic hardware. During training, pseudo-quantization stubs simulate low-precision noise, forcing weights and activations to adapt to INT8 constraints before deployment. This is combined with batch norm folding, which merges Conv2D+BatchNorm into a single operation, eliminating intermediate memory transfers.

### Mechanism 2
Adaptive Weighting Mechanism enables context-aware sensor prioritization, compensating for lighting-induced failures in single-modality systems. Separate attention sub-networks generate weight maps A_OI = σ(Conv_OI(F_OI)) and A_DEM = σ(Conv_DEM(F_DEM)). These are learned via backpropagation from the composite loss, teaching the network to up-weight DEM when optical data is unreliable (shadows, glare) and vice versa.

### Mechanism 3
Multi-scale detection heads with loss boosting enable accurate detection across crater diameters spanning orders of magnitude. Feature pyramid outputs P3 (stride /4), P4 (/8), P5 (/16) capture different spatial resolutions. P3 head (small craters) receives boosted loss weight w_s, forcing gradient emphasis on fine-grained hazards during training.

## Foundational Learning

- **Quantization fundamentals** (symmetric vs. asymmetric, scale factor, zero-point): The entire system hinges on INT8 deployment; misunderstanding quantization granularity leads to accuracy collapse. Quick check: Can you explain why QAT generally outperforms post-training quantization for aggressive bit-width reduction?

- **Attention mechanisms** (spatial attention, learned weighting): AWM uses sigmoid-gated attention to reweight sensor modalities; this is the adaptive intelligence layer. Quick check: How does element-wise multiplication of a feature map by an attention mask differ from channel-wise attention?

- **Feature Pyramid Networks and multi-scale detection**: P3/P4/P5 hierarchy determines which craters each head can resolve; stride vs. receptive field trade-offs are critical. Quick check: Why would a stride /4 feature map be better for small craters than stride /16?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Optical Camera, LiDAR/Stereo → DEM → Preprocessing → Dual Quantization-Aware Backbones → AMF Module (attention sub-networks → weighted fusion) → Multi-Scale Detection Heads (P3/P4/P5) → NMS → Output (bboxes, confidence, class labels) → Mission Control Systems (Navigation, Localization, Hazard Avoidance)

- **Critical path**: Backbones must be fused (BN folding) before QAT is applied; QAT-trained weights must be converted to fully quantized INT8 before deployment. AMF weights are learned jointly with detection heads via composite loss.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Depthwise separable convolutions reduce MAC operations but may reduce feature expressivity; loss boost for P3 improves small-crater recall but risks overfitting to sparse small-crater labels; fusion at feature level preserves spatial detail but requires dual backbone inference.

- **Failure signatures**: Detection collapse in shadow regions → AWM not learning to up-weight DEM; P3 head missing small craters → Loss boost insufficient or P3 resolution inadequate; INT8 deployment accuracy drop > 5% → QAT simulation didn't match target hardware quantization scheme.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) QAT calibration sweep: Train with varying QAT start epochs and compare INT8 vs FP32 accuracy gap on held-out illumination conditions; 2) AMF ablation: Run inference with fixed (non-adaptive) OI/DEM weights vs learned AWM on shadow-heavy test images; measure mAP delta; 3) Loss boost sensitivity: Vary w_s from 1.0 to 3.0 and plot P3 small-crater recall vs P4/P5 mAP to find stability boundary.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the proposed quantized architecture maintain high detection fidelity and low latency when deployed on actual resource-constrained, radiation-hardened onboard processors? The paper serves as a "blueprint for future empirical validation and hardware benchmarking on integer-arithmetic units."

### Open Question 2
How does the Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module quantitatively compare against simpler, fixed-weight fusion strategies or single-modality approaches in extreme lighting conditions? The authors list "Ablation Studies" as immediate future work.

### Open Question 3
To what extent can the Adaptive Weighting Mechanism (AWM) generalize to distinct planetary environments, such as the hazy atmosphere of Titan or the icy surface of Europa? The authors explicitly mention testing "Multi-Body Applicability" as a long-term direction.

## Limitations

- Lack of published validation results demonstrating full integrated system performance on actual planetary imagery
- No empirical evidence of detection accuracy, latency, or power consumption metrics on target hardware
- Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion effectiveness unverified without ablation studies comparing to fixed or decision-level fusion baselines

## Confidence

- **Quantization & Deployment Pipeline**: High - follows well-documented best practices with strong theoretical foundation
- **Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion**: Low - concept is plausible but lacks empirical evidence for reliable learning of context-dependent patterns
- **Multi-Scale Detection with Loss Boosting**: Medium - logical architectural approach but contingent on correct hyperparameter tuning and clean small-crater labels

## Next Checks

1. **INT8 Deployment Validation**: Convert QAT-trained model to fully quantized INT8 and benchmark detection accuracy on held-out test set with varying illumination conditions; compare to FP32 baseline ensuring drop <5%.

2. **Adaptive Fusion Ablation Study**: Run full pipeline on validation set spanning illumination conditions; compare mAP of learned AWM vs fixed weights to quantify adaptive fusion benefit.

3. **Multi-Scale Detection Sweep**: Systematically vary loss boost multiplier w_s from 1.0 to 3.0; measure P3 small-crater recall and overall P4/P5 mAP to identify stability boundary and check for overfitting.
