# Every Question Has Its Own Value: Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20187
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20187
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: RLEV improves value-weighted accuracy and learns value-sensitive termination policies across multiple RL algorithms

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method that aligns Large Language Model optimization with quantifiable human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the reward function, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across multiple RL algorithms and model scales.

The method addresses a fundamental limitation in current LLM training approaches: the inability to distinguish between high-value and low-value outputs when both are correct. By integrating explicit value signals into the reward function, RLEV policies not only improve value-weighted accuracy but also develop sophisticated behaviors like concise responses for low-value prompts and thorough responses for high-value ones. The paper demonstrates this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on end-of-sequence tokens.

## Method Summary
RLEV extends traditional RLVR by incorporating human-defined value signals into the reward function. The approach uses exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels, where each prompt-response pair is assigned a value score representing its importance or significance. The reward function combines correctness verification (as in RLVR) with value weighting, such that correct responses to high-value prompts receive disproportionately higher rewards. This creates a utility-maximizing objective that aligns model behavior with human priorities. The method is evaluated across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, DPO, Direct Preference Optimization) and various model scales, demonstrating consistent improvements in value-weighted accuracy while maintaining or improving overall correctness.

## Key Results
- RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, DPO, Direct Preference Optimization) and model scales
- RLEV policies learn a value-sensitive termination policy: concise responses for low-value prompts, thorough responses for high-value prompts
- The observed behavior pattern is attributed to value-weighted gradient amplification specifically on end-of-sequence tokens
- RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as difficulty-based labels, demonstrating practical utility alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RLEV works by directly incorporating human value preferences into the reinforcement learning reward function. Traditional RLVR optimizes for binary correctness, treating all correct answers equally regardless of their significance. RLEV modifies this by multiplying the correctness reward by an explicit value signal, creating a utility function that weights outcomes by their importance to humans. This value-weighted reward creates stronger gradients for high-value prompts, causing the model to prioritize these outputs during training. The gradient amplification on end-of-sequence tokens specifically drives the observed termination policy behavior, where the model learns to generate more comprehensive responses for high-value prompts and more concise responses for low-value ones. This represents a shift from optimizing for accuracy alone to optimizing for utility-weighted accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
**Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**: An RL framework that optimizes LLMs using binary correctness rewards in objective domains. Why needed: Provides the baseline framework that RLEV extends. Quick check: Verify that RLVR baselines are properly implemented before testing RLEV.

**Value-weighted gradients**: The amplification of gradients for high-value prompts due to the multiplicative reward structure. Why needed: Explains the mechanism behind RLEV's value-sensitive behavior. Quick check: Monitor gradient magnitudes across different value levels during training.

**Termination policy learning**: The model's ability to adapt response length and thoroughness based on prompt value. Why needed: Demonstrates sophisticated behavior beyond simple accuracy optimization. Quick check: Compare response lengths across value levels in validation data.

**Utility function alignment**: Optimizing for a weighted combination of correctness and value rather than correctness alone. Why needed: The core conceptual advance over traditional RL approaches. Quick check: Verify that value-weighted accuracy improves while maintaining overall accuracy.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input prompts -> Value signal + Correctness reward -> Weighted reward function -> RL algorithm (PPO/DPO/DPPO) -> Value-sensitive policy

Critical path: Value signal integration -> Weighted reward computation -> Policy gradient update -> Value-sensitive termination behavior

Design tradeoffs: The method requires explicit value labels for training data, which may be expensive to obtain but enables direct utility optimization. The choice of RL algorithm (PPO vs DPO vs Direct Preference Optimization) affects convergence speed but not the fundamental value alignment capability.

Failure signatures: If value signals are poorly calibrated or inconsistent, the model may develop pathological behaviors favoring high-value prompts regardless of correctness. If value signals are too sparse, the method may not outperform simpler approaches.

First experiments:
1. Implement RLVR baseline with exam-style dataset and verify correctness-only performance
2. Add value signal integration to the reward function and test on synthetic value-labeled data
3. Compare response length distributions across value levels to verify termination policy learning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on synthetic exam-style datasets with explicit ground-truth value labels, potentially limiting generalization to real-world scenarios
- The method depends on having reliable value labels for training data, which may be expensive or unavailable for many domains
- The core claim about value-weighted gradient amplification driving behavior is inferred empirically rather than proven mechanistically

## Confidence
- Value-weighted accuracy improvements: High
- Cross-RL algorithm consistency: High
- Value-sensitive termination behavior: Medium (empirical observation, mechanistic explanation limited)
- Noise robustness generalization: Medium (tested only on proxy signals)
- Practical applicability with noisy real-world values: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test RLEV on open-ended, real-world datasets where value attribution is subjective and compare against human preference judgments
2. Evaluate whether value-sensitive termination behavior translates to measurable utility gains in practical applications
3. Investigate the method's performance when value labels are partially or systematically incorrect, simulating real-world annotation noise
