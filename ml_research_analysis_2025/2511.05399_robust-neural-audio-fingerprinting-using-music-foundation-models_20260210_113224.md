# Robust Neural Audio Fingerprinting using Music Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05399
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05399
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Music foundation models (MuQ, MERT) outperform neural baselines and classical methods in robust audio fingerprinting across distortions

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the use of music foundation models (MuQ, MERT) as backbones for robust neural audio fingerprinting, aiming to improve resilience against distortions like time stretching, pitch shifting, compression, and filtering. The method involves contrastive learning with extensive data augmentation and compares frozen vs. unfrozen versions of the backbones. Experiments show that music foundation models consistently outperform both neural baselines (NAFP, GraFPrint) and classical approaches (Dejavu) across multiple augmentation types. For example, the unfrozen MuQ model achieves 88.18% overall accuracy in track-level retrieval and F1 scores above 80% in segment-level Pexeso benchmark tasks.

## Method Summary
The method leverages music foundation models (MuQ, MERT) as backbones for audio fingerprinting, employing contrastive learning with extensive data augmentation. The approach compares frozen versus unfrozen versions of these backbones to evaluate performance trade-offs. The system is trained to generate robust embeddings that maintain similarity under various audio distortions while enabling accurate track retrieval and segment localization.

## Key Results
- Unfrozen MuQ model achieves 88.18% overall accuracy in track-level retrieval
- F1 scores above 80% in segment-level Pexeso benchmark tasks
- Music foundation models outperform neural baselines (NAFP, GraFPrint) and classical approaches (Dejavu) across multiple augmentation types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Music foundation models capture rich, generalizable musical features that transfer well to fingerprinting tasks. Their pre-training on large music datasets enables them to encode semantic audio content rather than just spectral patterns. When fine-tuned (unfrozen), these models adapt their learned representations specifically for robust similarity matching under distortions. The contrastive learning framework with augmentation teaches the model to map distorted versions of the same audio to nearby points in embedding space while pushing apart different tracks.

## Foundational Learning

**Audio Fingerprinting** - Creating compact, robust representations of audio that enable efficient identification and matching. Needed because traditional methods struggle with distortions and scale. Quick check: Can the system identify a song from a 10-second clip with 95% accuracy?

**Contrastive Learning** - Training framework that learns representations by comparing similar and dissimilar pairs. Needed to make embeddings robust to augmentations while preserving discrimination between different tracks. Quick check: Do augmented versions of the same track cluster together in embedding space?

**Music Foundation Models** - Large-scale models pre-trained on diverse music corpora that capture general musical understanding. Needed because generic audio models lack music-specific semantics. Quick check: Does the model understand musical structure beyond basic audio features?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Audio Input -> Music Foundation Backbone (MuQ/MERT) -> Augmentation Module -> Contrastive Loss -> Embedding Output

**Critical Path**: The backbone model processes audio to generate embeddings, which are then evaluated for similarity under various augmentations. The contrastive loss drives learning to make embeddings robust while discriminative.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Frozen backbones offer computational efficiency and stability but may miss task-specific optimizations. Unfrozen models achieve better performance but require more resources and risk overfitting.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation on spectral filtering and adversarial audio modifications indicates limitations in handling frequency-domain distortions. Localization errors suggest challenges in precise boundary detection.

**First Experiments**: 1) Benchmark unfrozen MuQ against frozen version on track-level retrieval accuracy. 2) Test model robustness to pitch shifting with varying degrees of transposition. 3) Evaluate segment localization precision on overlapping audio segments.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on specific augmentation types, leaving uncertainty about performance under other real-world distortions or adversarial attacks
- Comparison with classical approaches may not represent state-of-the-art in traditional fingerprinting methods
- Computational cost and practical deployment considerations of fine-tuning large foundation models versus frozen versions require further exploration

## Confidence
High confidence in comparative performance against neural baselines and classical methods
Medium confidence in generalization to all types of audio distortions
Medium confidence in practical applicability of localization capabilities for real-world catalog management

## Next Checks
1. Test robustness against broader range of audio distortions including real-world noise, reverberation, and adversarial examples
2. Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability of fine-tuning large foundation models versus frozen versions in practical deployment scenarios
3. Conduct experiments in complex real-world environments with overlapping audio tracks, background noise, and varying audio qualities to validate segment-level localization capabilities
