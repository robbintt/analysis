# Towards AI Agents for Course Instruction in Higher Education: Early Experiences from the Field

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.20255
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20255
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Key outcome**: AI Instructor Agent deployed in graduate Cloud Computing course, showing shift from broad exploration to focused inquiry with coverage 52.5%→31.0%, depth 1.33→2.06, and turn length 48.2→54.4 words over two weeks.

## Executive Summary
This study explores the deployment of an LLM-based Instructor Agent as the primary instructor for a graduate-level Cloud Computing course at IISc, replacing traditional lectures with student-driven, AI-mediated learning. The agent, configured in Microsoft Teams Copilot with weekly topic-specific prompts, facilitated concept exploration and self-paced study, supplemented by human instructor Q&A sessions. Student engagement was evaluated via topic coverage, depth, and turn length metrics, showing a clear shift from broad exploration to focused inquiry over time. The approach demonstrates AI's potential to enhance higher education scalability and personalization, though challenges like content generation quality and assessment anxiety remain.

## Method Summary
The study deployed an AI Instructor Agent in a graduate Cloud Computing course at IISc, replacing traditional lectures with student-driven, AI-mediated learning in live classroom settings. The agent was configured in Microsoft Teams Copilot with three-part prompts: system-level persona and guardrails, KLI framework pedagogical alignment with Bloom's taxonomy, and weekly topic knowledge bases. The course ran for 17 students (senior undergrad/Masters/PhD) with 90-minute sessions structured as instructor primer → 45-60 min student-agent interaction → peer group discussions → instructor Q&A. Evaluation was performed by a separate GPT-4o-mini agent on AWS Lambda processing transcripts to compute coverage, depth, and turn length metrics, generating automated PDF feedback per student.

## Key Results
- Topic Coverage decreased from 52.5% in Week 1 to 31.0% in Week 2, indicating more focused engagement
- Topic Depth increased from 1.33 to 2.06 on a 0-3 scale, showing deeper inquiry over time
- Average Turn Length increased from 48.2 to 54.4 words, reflecting more substantive student contributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The AI Instructor Agent works by providing personalized, on-demand instruction that adapts to individual student inquiry patterns. Students can explore topics at their own pace, ask follow-up questions, and receive immediate responses without waiting for scheduled lectures. The agent's knowledge base ensures consistency with curriculum objectives while the pedagogical scaffolding (KLI framework) promotes deeper learning through inquiry-based approaches aligned with Bloom's taxonomy. The hybrid model of AI-mediated learning plus human Q&A sessions addresses both the scalability of AI and the nuanced guidance needed for complex topics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bloom's Taxonomy**: Framework for categorizing educational goals from remembering to creating - needed to structure learning outcomes and assess depth of understanding
- **KLI Framework**: Knowledge-Learning-Instruction framework that bridges learning theory and practice - needed to design pedagogical prompts that promote effective learning
- **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques for crafting effective LLM prompts - needed to configure the agent's persona, guardrails, and topic-specific knowledge bases
- **LLM Hallucination**: Tendency of language models to generate plausible but incorrect information - needed to implement guardrails and provide curated supplementary materials
- **Assessment Anxiety**: Student stress about non-uniform content delivery - needed to establish clear expectations and occasional human-led assessments
- **Quick check**: Can students articulate how the agent's responses differ from traditional lectures and whether this benefits their learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Students -> Teams Copilot (Instructor Agent) <- Evaluation Agent (Lambda) -> PDF Reports -> Instructor

**Critical Path**: Student asks question → Instructor Agent responds → Student follows up → Transcript captured → Evaluation Agent processes → Metrics generated → Instructor reviews

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- **AI vs. Human Instructor**: AI provides scalability and personalization but lacks nuanced judgment; hybrid model balances both
- **Exploration vs. Coverage**: Broad topic coverage enables exploration but may sacrifice depth; metric tracking helps balance
- **Generated vs. Curated Content**: Generated diagrams/solutions are flexible but may contain errors; curated slides ensure accuracy

**Failure Signatures**:
- Agent hallucinates non-existent URLs or generates incorrect/incomplete diagrams
- Students spend excessive time on early subtopics, missing later content
- Assessment anxiety from non-uniform content delivery

**First Experiments**:
1. Test agent with a simple topic (e.g., "What is cloud computing?") to validate basic functionality and identify hallucinations
2. Run a short 15-minute session with 2-3 students to observe interaction patterns and pacing issues
3. Process a sample transcript through the evaluation agent to verify metric calculations and identify edge cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=17) limits generalizability of findings
- Evaluation relies entirely on a single GPT-4o-mini agent's assessments rather than multiple human evaluators
- No data on actual learning outcomes or performance differences compared to traditional instruction

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The methodology for configuring and deploying the AI instructor agent is well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: The engagement metrics (coverage, depth, turn length) show clear trends over time
- **Low confidence**: Claims about the agent's effectiveness in enhancing learning outcomes, as no learning outcome data is presented

## Next Checks
1. **Replicate with independent evaluation**: Have multiple human raters independently score a subset of transcripts to validate the GPT-4o-mini agent's depth and coverage assessments
2. **Learning outcome measurement**: Conduct pre/post testing on actual learning outcomes to determine if the AI-mediated approach improves or maintains learning compared to traditional instruction
3. **Controlled comparison**: Run parallel sections of the same course - one with AI instructor and one with traditional lectures - while controlling for instructor experience and student background to isolate the effect of the AI agent
