# MedNeXt-v2: Scaling 3D ConvNeXts for Large-Scale Supervised Representation Learning in Medical Image Segmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.17774
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17774
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: MedNeXt-v2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on six medical image segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating that stronger backbones reliably predict better pretrained model outcomes.

## Executive Summary
MedNeXt-v2 introduces a compound-scaled ConvNeXt architecture for 3D medical image segmentation, addressing the gap where large-scale pretraining often neglects backbone validation and optimization. The method integrates a 3D Global Response Normalization (GRN) module to improve representation learning and scales depth, width, and input context. Pre-trained on 18k CT volumes across 40 structures, MedNeXt-v2 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on six challenging CT and MR benchmarks (144 structures), achieving consistent gains over seven publicly released pretrained models. Key findings include: stronger backbones lead to better pretraining outcomes, representation scaling disproportionately benefits pathological segmentation, and modality-specific pretraining offers negligible advantage once full fine-tuning is applied. The work establishes MedNeXt-v2 as a robust backbone for large-scale supervised representation learning in 3D medical image segmentation.

## Method Summary
MedNeXt-v2 is a compound-scaled ConvNeXt architecture designed for 3D medical image segmentation. The method integrates 3D Global Response Normalization (GRN) modules into ConvNeXt blocks to improve representation learning and prevent feature collapse. The architecture scales depth (52-layer UNet), width (base channel C and width×2.0 variants), and input context (128³ pretraining, 192³ fine-tuning). The model is pretrained on 18k CT volumes from the CADS dataset across 44 target structures, then fine-tuned on six public benchmarks (BTCV, AMOS22, KiTS23, ACDC, Stanford Knee, and Toothfairy) with 144 total structures. Training uses nnUNet preprocessing, AdamW optimizer with linear warmup, and deep supervision at all decoder levels.

## Key Results
- MedNeXt-v2 outperforms seven publicly released pretrained models on six CT/MR segmentation benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores.
- Stronger from-scratch performance reliably predicts better downstream performance after pretraining, validating the importance of backbone architecture selection.
- Modality-specific pretraining offers negligible benefit once full fine-tuning is applied, suggesting pretraining datasets can be more diverse than previously assumed.
- Representation scaling (width×2.0) shows mixed results, while context scaling (192³ patches) provides consistent improvements for boundary-sensitive structures.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: 3D Global Response Normalization Prevents Feature Collapse
- Claim: Adding 3D GRN modules post-expansion layer stabilizes training and improves representation quality in ConvNeXt-based architectures.
- Mechanism: GRN applies L2 normalization across channels: `X_i = γ * X_i * N(X_i) + β + X_i`, where `N(X_i) = ||X_i|| / Σ||X_j||`. This prevents any single feature map from dominating, encouraging diverse representation learning.
- Core assumption: Feature diversity correlates with downstream segmentation quality across anatomical structures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "integrates a 3D Global Response Normalization (GRN) module to improve representation learning"
  - [Section 2.2.1] Figure 3 visualization shows GRN reduces dead/saturated activations compared to MedNeXt-v1
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related work BioVFM-21M discusses scaling but not normalization mechanisms specifically
- Break condition: If expansion ratios are small (R < 2), GRN benefits diminish as feature collapse is less likely.

### Mechanism 2: Backbone Quality Predicts Pretraining Effectiveness
- Claim: Networks with stronger from-scratch performance on small-scale benchmarks yield better pretrained models, independent of dataset size.
- Mechanism: Better inductive bias and architectural efficiency at small scale transfers to large-scale representation learning, creating a "capacity to learn" that scales with data.
- Core assumption: Small-scale benchmark datasets (BTCV, AMOS, KiTS, ACDC) are representative proxies for generalizable segmentation capability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "demonstrate that stronger from scratch performance reliably predicts stronger downstream performance after pretraining"
  - [Section 4.2] MedNeXt-v2 outperforms CADS despite similar pretraining data (+1.0 DSC on brain metastases)
  - [corpus] BioVFM-21M corroborates that scaling behavior differs in medical vs. natural images
- Break condition: If pretraining dataset has fundamentally different characteristics than benchmarks (e.g., different modalities or annotation granularity), correlation may weaken.

### Mechanism 3: Asymmetric Context Scaling (Small Pretrain, Large Finetune)
- Claim: Pretraining with 128³ patches and fine-tuning with 192³ patches provides computational efficiency without sacrificing downstream performance.
- Mechanism: Pretraining learns local features efficiently with smaller patches; fine-tuning with larger context (3.375× volume) leverages spatial relationships for boundary structures without requiring full pretraining recomputation.
- Core assumption: Spatial relationships relevant to downstream tasks (e.g., jaw-tooth proximity) can be learned during short fine-tuning phases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 2.2.2] "use the standard input patch size of 128×128×128 in pretraining, and scale it up to 192×192×192 during fine-tuning"
  - [Section 4.1] Figure 5 shows improved tooth segmentation near image boundaries with larger context
  - [corpus] No direct corroboration found
- Break condition: For tasks requiring global anatomical understanding (e.g., multi-organ relative positioning), small-patch pretraining may fail to capture necessary relationships.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: ConvNeXt Block Architecture**
  - Why needed here: MedNeXt-v2 builds on ConvNeXt blocks (depthwise conv → pointwise expansion → activation → compression) rather than traditional ResNet blocks. Understanding this is essential for modifying the architecture.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why depthwise separable convolutions reduce parameters compared to standard convolutions?

- **Concept: Deep Supervision in Encoder-Decoder Networks**
  - Why needed here: MedNeXt-v2 applies supervision at all decoder levels, not just the final output. This affects loss computation and gradient flow during training.
  - Quick check question: How does adding auxiliary losses at intermediate decoder stages affect training dynamics?

- **Concept: Transfer Learning with Full Fine-tuning**
  - Why needed here: The paper's finding that modality-specific pretraining offers negligible benefit under full fine-tuning challenges common assumptions about domain-specific pretraining.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between full fine-tuning vs. frozen-backbone transfer learning, and when might each be appropriate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Stem: 3D Conv (1×1×1) projecting input → base channels (C)
  - MedNeXt-v2 Block: DW Conv (3×3×3) → GN → 1×1×1 expansion (ratio R) → GELU → GRN → 1×1×1 compression
  - Up/Down Blocks: Strided/transposed convolutions with channel scaling (2× down, 0.5× up)
  - Deep Supervision: 1×1×1 conv at each decoder level → output classes
  - Architecture: 5-stage encoder-decoder, symmetric capacity

- **Critical path:**
  1. Load pretrained weights (CADS-sub, 18k volumes)
  2. Adjust output classes via final 1×1×1 conv
  3. Set patch size (128³ for base, 192³ for context-scaled variant)
  4. Apply linear warmup (50 epochs) + AdamW with lr=1e-3
  5. Fine-tune for 300 epochs with batch size 2

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Base vs. Width×2.0: Doubling channels (62M → 247M params) increases compute ~4× but shows mixed improvements; context scaling often outperforms capacity scaling
  - Patch size: 192³ requires ~3.4× more VRAM during fine-tuning but enables better boundary segmentation
  - GRN overhead: Minimal FLOPs increase (~0.1%) but requires channel-wise L2 norm computation

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Dead activations in early layers: GRN not applied correctly (verify all blocks include GRN)
  - Poor boundary segmentation: Context too limited; try Patch×1.5 variant
  - Training instability early in fine-tuning: Linear warmup not applied; SGD used instead of AdamW
  - Saturated performance on simple tasks: Expected; datasets like Stanford Knee (D2) show minimal variance across methods

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline reproduction**: Load MedNeXt-v2 Base pretrained weights, fine-tune on a single dataset with 128³ patches, verify DSC matches reported values (±0.5%).
  2. **Ablation GRN**: Train MedNeXt-v2 from scratch with and without GRN on a small dataset (e.g., BTCV), compare activation distributions and DSC.
  3. **Context scaling test**: Fine-tune same pretrained model with 128³ vs. 192³ patches on a dataset with boundary-sensitive structures (e.g., Toothfairy D3), measure DSC difference on structures near volume edges.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does modality-specific pretraining (e.g., CT vs. MR) provide significant advantages in few-shot or linear-probe settings where full fine-tuning is restricted?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude that "modality-specific pretraining offers negligible benefit once full finetuning is applied," but they restrict this finding specifically to the "full finetuning" regime.
- Why unresolved: It remains untested whether the representations learned are truly modality-agnostic or if the fine-tuning process simply overwrites modality-specific biases. The benefit of matched modalities might emerge in data-scarce scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: A benchmark comparing frozen backbone performance or few-shot adaptation (e.g., 1-5 examples) on cross-modal tasks using the CT-pretrained vs. MR-pretrained models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can evaluation benchmarks be designed to prevent performance saturation from masking the efficacy of future architectural scaling?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section E discusses the "diminishing returns of scaling," noting that "saturated datasets may lead to inconclusive assessments of pretraining efficacy" and that careful consideration is needed when selecting evaluation data.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies that standard metrics on saturated datasets (like Stanford Knee) cannot distinguish between a 30M and a 440M parameter model, but does not propose a standardized solution to this measurement ceiling.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study correlating the "saturation speed" of various datasets with model scale, potentially proposing a dynamic benchmark suite that weights difficult, pathological structures more heavily than saturated healthy anatomy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the current scale of medical pretraining data (approx. 18k volumes) limit the effective capacity of wider network architectures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors found that increasing network capacity (Width×2.0, 247M params) yielded mixed results and did not outperform context scaling, explicitly motivating "reflection on naively scaling network capacity."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the Width×2.0 model underperformed due to architectural inefficiencies or simply because the 18k-volume pretraining dataset was insufficient to train 247M parameters without overfitting.
- What evidence would resolve it: A scaling law analysis training MedNeXt-v2 Width×2.0 on progressively larger datasets (e.g., 50k, 100k volumes) to see if performance scales logarithmically as it does for smaller models.

## Limitations
- The CADS subset filtering criteria (44 target structures) is not explicitly defined, creating potential reproducibility issues when obtaining pretraining data.
- The paper demonstrates negligible benefit from modality-specific pretraining under full fine-tuning, but this finding may not generalize to scenarios with limited fine-tuning data or when using frozen backbones.
- Performance gains from context scaling (192³ vs 128³) are shown but the computational overhead and practical deployment trade-offs are not quantified.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: GRN module effectiveness in preventing feature collapse, and the correlation between from-scratch performance and pretraining outcomes.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that modality-specific pretraining offers negligible advantage under full fine-tuning, given the specific experimental setup and limited ablation studies.
- **Low confidence**: The asymmetric scaling hypothesis (small pretrain, large fine-tune) lacks direct mechanistic evidence and may be dataset-dependent.

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce core architecture**: Implement MedNeXt-v2 Base with 3D GRN modules, train from scratch on BTCV, and verify activation distributions and DSC match reported patterns.
2. **Test modality-specific pretraining**: Fine-tune the same pretrained model on both CT and MR datasets with frozen and full-tuning scenarios to quantify modality-specific benefits.
3. **Evaluate context scaling limits**: Systematically compare 128³ vs 192³ vs 256³ patch sizes on boundary-sensitive datasets to determine where context scaling provides diminishing returns.
