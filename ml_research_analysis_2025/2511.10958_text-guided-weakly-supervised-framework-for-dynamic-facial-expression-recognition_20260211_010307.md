# Text-guided Weakly Supervised Framework for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10958
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10958
- Authors: Gunho Jung; Heejo Kong; Seong-Whan Lee
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework for DFER achieving SOTA results with 60.17% UAR and 71.62% WAR on DFEW benchmark.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) under weak supervision, where only coarse video-level emotion labels are available. The proposed TG-DFER framework integrates vision-language pre-trained models with a multi-grained temporal network to align textual emotion descriptions with visual instance features. By formulating DFER as a multiple instance learning problem, the method leverages both short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow while overcoming the many-to-one labeling problem inherent in video-level annotations.

## Method Summary
TG-DFER introduces a novel text-guided weakly supervised approach for dynamic facial expression recognition. The method combines vision-language pre-trained models with a multi-grained temporal network to address the many-to-one labeling problem in DFER. It formulates the task as multiple instance learning using coarse video-level labels, integrating fine-grained textual descriptions through visual prompts that align enriched emotion labels with visual instance features. The framework captures both short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while operating under weak supervision constraints.

## Key Results
- Achieves 60.17% UAR and 71.62% WAR on DFEW benchmark, outperforming baseline models
- Demonstrates effectiveness of text-guided approach in weakly supervised DFER setting
- Shows state-of-the-art performance on FERV39K benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages vision-language pre-trained models to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions, addressing the limitation of coarse video-level labels. The visual prompts align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, creating a bridge between language and visual modalities. The multi-grained temporal network captures both immediate facial movements and the progression of emotional states over time, enabling comprehensive expression analysis.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)**: Needed because only video-level labels are available, not frame-level annotations. Quick check: MIL framework should correctly identify positive instances within bags of mixed labels.
- **Vision-Language Pre-training**: Required to bridge textual emotion descriptions with visual features. Quick check: VL models should generate semantically meaningful representations for emotion-related text.
- **Temporal Modeling**: Essential for capturing facial dynamics and emotional flow. Quick check: Network should distinguish between different temporal patterns of expression evolution.
- **Weak Supervision**: Necessary due to the cost and complexity of frame-level annotation. Quick check: Model should learn effectively from only video-level labels.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: VL Model -> Visual Prompts -> Multi-grained Temporal Network -> MIL Loss

**Critical Path**: Input video frames → Visual feature extraction → Visual prompt generation → Multi-grained temporal processing → Instance classification → Video-level prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**: Shallow temporal depths perform better due to dataset simplicity, but may limit scalability to more complex temporal patterns. Text guidance improves semantic understanding but depends on quality of textual descriptions.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor performance on minority classes (Disgust, Fear) due to data imbalance
- Degradation with occlusions or extreme pose variations
- Suboptimal results when textual descriptions poorly align with visual content

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Ablation study removing text guidance to quantify its contribution
2. Test with different temporal depths to validate optimal configuration
3. Evaluation on occluded or extreme-pose subsets to assess robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the TG-DFER framework be adapted to maintain high recognition accuracy for underrepresented emotions (e.g., Disgust, Fear) without relying on external data augmentation or synthetic generation?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Discussion section explicitly identifies "Data Imbalance" as a remaining challenge, noting that the model struggles with expressions like Disgust and Fear due to severe imbalance in benchmark datasets.
- **Why unresolved:** The current methodology achieves state-of-the-art results on majority classes but fails to generalize effectively to minority classes solely through the proposed text-guided MIL mechanism.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstration of improved class-wise accuracy on minority emotions using modified loss functions or sampling strategies intrinsic to the weakly supervised framework, rather than external data balancing.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Is the multi-grained temporal network's capacity limited by the "low inherent temporal complexity" of current benchmarks, and would it fail to generalize to datasets with longer, more intricate emotional narratives?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The ablation study on temporal depths notes that deeper models perform worse, attributed to a "mismatch between the model's increased complexity and the low inherent temporal complexity of the DFER datasets."
- **Why unresolved:** The authors suggest the network is sufficient for short, decisive moments, but it remains unproven whether the shallow optimal depth is a limitation of the architecture or the simplicity of current datasets like DFEW.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation of the proposed temporal network on datasets with long-range temporal dependencies (e.g., uncut movie scenes) where deeper temporal modeling is statistically proven to outperform shallow configurations.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the visual prompt mechanism's dependency on frame-level feature extraction affect robustness when facial regions are occluded or exhibit extreme pose variations?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Discussion lists "Occlusions and Variations" as a challenge, stating that real-world conditions negatively affect performance and suggesting the need for robust feature extraction or attention mechanisms.
- **Why unresolved:** The visual prompt ($VP$) is generated via a weighted sum of visual features; if these features are degraded by occlusion, the alignment between the text prompt and visual context may collapse.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies or qualitative visualizations of the visual prompt's attention maps on specifically occluded or extreme-pose video subsets, showing maintained alignment capability.

## Limitations
- Struggles with underrepresented emotions (Disgust, Fear) due to data imbalance
- Performance degrades with facial occlusions and extreme pose variations
- Shallow temporal network may not scale to datasets with complex emotional narratives

## Confidence
- **Effectiveness of text-guided approach**: Medium
- **Generalization across diverse expression styles**: Low
- **Robustness to real-world variations**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework's performance on datasets with frame-level annotations to assess the impact of the many-to-one labeling assumption.
2. Test the model's robustness across diverse cultural contexts and expression styles by validating on datasets with varied demographic representation.
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of the vision-language pre-trained model and visual prompts to overall performance, isolating their individual effects on accuracy.
