# Automobile demand forecasting: Spatiotemporal and hierarchical modeling, life cycle dynamics, and user-generated online information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17275
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17275
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Integrates LightGBM quantile regression with pooled training and MILP reconciliation to achieve integer-coherent forecasts, with online configurator data notably improving accuracy at disaggregated levels.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses monthly automobile demand forecasting across a complex 5-level hierarchy for a German premium OEM, integrating spatiotemporal dependencies, life cycle dynamics, and user-generated online information. The core innovation combines a pooled LightGBM ensemble with quantile regression for probabilistic forecasts, and a mixed-integer linear programming approach for integer-coherent reconciliation. Results demonstrate that integer forecasts significantly outperform rounded continuous forecasts, while online configurator traffic provides valuable early demand signals, particularly at granular levels.

## Method Summary
The method employs LightGBM models with quantile regression trained on pooled datasets selected through data-driven optimization (POOL-SEL-BP), integrating direct and recursive forecasting strategies into a pooled ensemble (DRFAM-PP). A mixed-integer linear programming (REC-MILP) formulation ensures integer-coherent forecasts while maintaining hierarchical consistency. Key innovations include the Age-Volume Moment feature for capturing life cycle dynamics and the incorporation of online configurator traffic as an exogenous predictor.

## Key Results
- Integer-coherent reconciliation via MILP outperforms traditional rounding methods, reducing WMAPE by up to 5.8% at granular levels
- Online configurator traffic significantly improves medium-term forecast accuracy at disaggregated levels
- Short-term demand is driven by life cycle maturity and operational signals, while medium-term demand reflects anticipatory factors like online engagement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Pooled Ensemble with Quantile Regression (DRFAM-PP)
The DRFAM-PP model combines direct and recursive forecasting strategies with data-driven pooling, providing superior accuracy by leveraging cross-series information while maintaining specificity through intelligent pool selection. This architecture learns shared patterns from similar series while retaining individual characteristics, particularly valuable for sparse data at variant levels.

### Mechanism 2: Integer-Coherent Reconciliation via MILP
The MILP approach treats reconciliation as a weighted L1 minimization problem constrained to the integer lattice, directly producing operationally feasible integer forecasts. This avoids the rounding biases inherent in traditional continuous reconciliation methods that must be converted to integers post-hoc.

### Mechanism 3: Online Configurator Data as a Leading Indicator
User-generated online configurator traffic serves as an early signal of consumer interest, improving forecast accuracy at disaggregated levels for medium-term horizons. This data captures demand signals earlier than traditional lagged sales data or macroeconomic indicators.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting
Why needed: The forecasting problem is structured across a 5-level hierarchy where forecasts at different levels must be consistent (add up correctly). Reconciliation mechanisms ensure these constraints are met.
Quick check: If you forecast 100 cars for Model X and 200 for Model Y, but your forecast for their shared Product Line is 250, how do you resolve this inconsistency? (Answer: Reconciliation).

### Concept: Quantile Regression
Why needed: The paper uses quantile regression to produce probabilistic forecasts, not just point estimates, enabling risk-aware decision-making in volatile markets.
Quick check: A model predicts the median demand (50th percentile) is 100 units. Why is this insufficient for planning inventory to ensure a 99% service level? (Answer: It tells you nothing about the upper tail of the demand distribution).

### Concept: Feature Engineering for Life Cycle Dynamics
Why needed: Automotive products have complex, non-standard life cycles (5-7 years with multiple peaks). The Age-Volume Moment (AVM) feature captures this non-linear temporal pattern.
Quick check: Why would a simple linear time trend be a poor feature for forecasting a car model's sales over its entire 7-year life? (Answer: Life cycles are non-linear with introduction, growth, maturity, and decline phases; a linear trend cannot capture this shape).

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map:
Data Layer (4,386 time series + exogenous features) -> Preprocessing (AVM, WDI, feature selection) -> Base Forecasting Layer (Pooled LightGBM models for each quantile/strategy) -> Ensemble Layer (DRFAM-PP averaging) -> Reconciliation Layer (REC-MILP solver) -> Final integer-coherent forecasts

### Critical path:
Correct feature engineering (especially AVM) -> Optimal pool selection (POOL-SEL-BP) -> Training pooled LightGBM models -> Applying REC-MILP reconciliation

### Design tradeoffs:
- Globality vs. Locality: The choice of lambda in POOL-SEL-BP controls the number of pools, balancing shared pattern learning against individual series specificity
- Accuracy vs. Coherence: Reconciliation enforces hierarchy coherence but may slightly adjust accurate base forecasts; REC-MILP-LW weights allow prioritizing either top-level stability or bottom-level operational accuracy
- Point vs. Probabilistic: Quantile regression provides distributional insights but is more computationally intensive than single point forecasts

### Failure signatures:
- Over-smoothing: Pools that are too large lose specific variant trends, degrading accuracy at Market-Product Type level
- Rounding Distortion: Post-hoc rounding of continuous reconciliation breaks hierarchy coherence and severely biases low-volume forecasts
- Stale Signal: Outdated configurator visit data degrades medium-term forecast accuracy when the online-to-purchase relationship decays

### First 3 experiments:
1. Replicate base forecasting by training global LightGBM models (DIR and REC) with specified features (AVM, etc.) and evaluate on provided test set using RMSSE and MSPL
2. Validate pool selection by implementing POOL-SEL-BP optimization and comparing DRFAM-PP accuracy against hierarchical pooling baseline
3. Test reconciliation by implementing REC-MILP formulation and comparing performance (WMAPE, RMSSE) against Bottom-Up with post-hoc rounding, focusing on Market-Product Type level

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can discrete integer-coherent reconciliation be extended to probabilistic forecasting settings?
Basis: The Conclusion explicitly states the need to "extend discrete forecast reconciliation to probabilistic settings."
Why unresolved: REC-MILP ensures integer coherence for point forecasts but doesn't generate coherent prediction intervals or full distributions for uncertainty quantification.

### Open Question 2
Does the proposed framework generalize to volume-based OEMs or industries with less product variety?
Basis: The Conclusion proposes to "test the framework in other hierarchical industries."
Why unresolved: The study is limited to a premium OEM with mass customization, high variety, and sparse data; optimal pooling may not remain superior in high-volume, low-variety settings.

### Open Question 3
Can reconciliation objectives be optimized for specific supply chain decision costs rather than pure statistical accuracy?
Basis: The Conclusion identifies "decision-aware objectives" as a direction for future research.
Why unresolved: Current REC-MILP minimizes weighted L1 error (statistical loss), which doesn't explicitly minimize actual operational costs like inventory holding or stockouts.

## Limitations
- Proprietary data dependency: Strong performance claims rely on internal OEM data that cannot be independently validated
- Pool selection optimization: Relies on proprietary validation losses and market cluster definitions, making exact replication impossible
- Generalizability uncertainty: Performance gains may not translate to different automotive segments or other industries with different data characteristics

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The architectural approach (LightGBM + quantile regression + pooled training + MILP reconciliation) is technically sound and well-documented
- Medium Confidence: SHAP-based interpretability findings are methodologically valid but depend on proprietary data relationships
- Low Confidence: Specific percentage improvements in forecast accuracy cannot be independently verified due to proprietary data dependencies

## Next Checks

1. Replicate core architecture by training LightGBM quantile regression models with specified features on a public time series dataset to verify the base forecasting approach
2. Test integer reconciliation by implementing REC-MILP formulation on a hierarchical dataset and measuring accuracy difference versus post-hoc rounding
3. Validate pooling strategy by testing DRFAM-PP ensemble approach with fixed pools on public data to assess data-driven pooling benefits
