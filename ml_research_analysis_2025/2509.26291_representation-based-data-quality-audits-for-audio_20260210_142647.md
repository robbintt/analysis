# Representation-Based Data Quality Audits for Audio

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26291
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26291
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: SelfClean achieves state-of-the-art ranking performance for detecting off-topic samples, near-duplicates, and label errors in audio datasets using pre-trained encoders like BEATs.

## Executive Summary
This paper adapts the SelfClean data auditing framework from images to audio, enabling detection of off-topic samples, near-duplicates, and label errors through representation-based ranking. The method leverages pre-trained self-supervised audio encoders to map waveforms into a semantic embedding space, where geometric anomalies indicate data quality issues. Evaluated on ESC-50, GTZAN, and a proprietary industrial dataset, the framework achieves strong AUROC/AP scores and significant annotation effort savings (up to 97.1% for near-duplicates) without requiring dataset-specific training.

## Method Summary
The framework maps raw audio waveforms to embeddings using pre-trained encoders (BEATs, M2D) that were trained on large-scale audio corpora like AudioSet-2M. These embeddings are aggregated to file-level via mean pooling, then analyzed using modality-agnostic indicator functions that score data points based on geometric properties in the representation space—isolation for off-topic samples, proximity for near-duplicates, and intra/extra-class distance ratios for label errors. The resulting scores produce ranked lists for human-in-the-loop review, with no further training required on the target dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art ranking performance using pre-trained encoders like BEATs, often outperforming issue-specific baselines
- Synthetic evaluations show up to 97.1% effort savings for near-duplicate detection compared to exhaustive review
- Strong generalization across contamination types, with significant operational efficiency gains in real-world audio data quality auditing workflows

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Large-Scale Pre-trained Semantic Compression
Leveraging off-the-shelf audio encoders pre-trained on massive datasets provides a more robust basis for data auditing than training representations from scratch. The framework uses these encoders to map raw audio waveforms into a high-dimensional latent space where semantically similar audio samples cluster together, regardless of the specific target dataset size. The core assumption is that semantic features learned from large-scale general audio corpora transfer effectively to specific downstream datasets, preserving enough information to distinguish signal from noise.

### Mechanism 2: Geometry-Based Indicator Functions
Data quality issues manifest as geometric anomalies (isolation, proximity, or density) in the representation space, which can be scored using modality-agnostic indicator functions. Once audio is embedded, the system applies indicator functions without further training—off-topic samples are identified via isolation measures, near-duplicates via extreme proximity, and label errors by comparing sample features against class centroids. The core assumption is that the embedding space is geometrically organized such that "clean" data forms dense clusters while "dirty" data appears as outliers or interlopers.

### Mechanism 3: Review Prior
The framework produces ranked lists for human-in-the-loop review rather than making binary decisions, allowing reviewers to focus on the most suspicious samples first. This prioritization approach is particularly valuable when dealing with large audio datasets where exhaustive manual review would be prohibitively expensive.

## Foundational Learning

### Self-supervised Learning (SSL)
**Why needed:** Enables training on unlabeled audio data at scale, capturing rich acoustic patterns without manual annotation.  
**Quick check:** Can the encoder cluster semantically similar sounds together in embedding space?

### Representation Space Geometry
**Why needed:** Quality issues manifest as geometric anomalies (isolation, proximity, density) that indicator functions can detect.  
**Quick check:** Do off-topic samples appear as isolated points while clean samples form dense clusters?

### Indicator Functions
**Why needed:** Provide a training-free method to score data points based on their geometric properties in embedding space.  
**Quick check:** Does the isolation score effectively rank off-topic samples higher than clean ones?

### Audio Embeddings
**Why needed:** Compress raw waveforms into semantic feature vectors that preserve discriminative information.  
**Quick check:** Are embeddings stable across different segments of the same audio file?

### Mean Pooling Aggregation
**Why needed:** Combine segment-level embeddings into a single file-level representation for downstream analysis.  
**Quick check:** Does mean pooling preserve the most salient features for quality detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Raw Audio -> Pre-trained Encoder (BEATs/M2D) -> Segment Embeddings -> Mean Pooling -> File-Level Embedding -> Indicator Functions -> Ranked Scores

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from raw audio through the pre-trained encoder to produce embeddings, which are then aggregated and scored by indicator functions. The quality of the pre-trained encoder and the effectiveness of the indicator functions are the most critical components for overall performance.

### Design Tradeoffs
The framework trades off exact issue localization for computational efficiency by using file-level aggregation rather than segment-level analysis. While this may obscure short-duration anomalies, it enables processing of large datasets with minimal computational overhead.

### Failure Signatures
Performance degradation occurs when target domain audio contains features absent from pre-training data, when high intra-class variance creates false positives for label errors, or when synthetic contamination doesn't reflect real-world quality issues.

### First 3 Experiments
1. Verify that BEATs embeddings cluster semantically similar ESC-50 classes together in t-SNE visualization
2. Test indicator function scores on known synthetic corruptions (OT, ND, LE) in ESC-50
3. Compare AUROC scores using frozen BEATs vs. fine-tuned LoRA on CSEM dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can segment-level issue attribution provide higher detection accuracy than file-level mean pooling for localized audio defects? The conclusion states future work will explore segment-level issue attribution, as the current implementation aggregates segment embeddings into a single file-level vector via mean pooling, which may obscure short-duration anomalies.

### Open Question 2
Which unsupervised adaptation techniques can effectively specialize general pre-trained audio encoders to specific target datasets? The conclusion proposes exploring more advanced techniques for adapting general representations to specific dataset contexts, as the authors found that LoRA adaptation provided no significant benefit over frozen features, likely due to data scarcity or objective mismatch.

### Open Question 3
Does modifying Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) parameters or sample window sizes significantly improve near-duplicate detection in highly repetitive industrial audio? The authors speculate that shorter sample windows or alternative STFT parameters may improve results after observing lower performance on the repetitive, high-frequency CSEM dataset.

## Limitations
- SelfClean indicator functions are under-specified, creating barriers to exact replication
- Synthetic contamination realism limits external validity for actual industrial pipelines
- Performance heavily dependent on AudioSet-2M pre-training, potentially degrading for acoustically distinct domains

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Pre-trained encoders (BEATs, M2D) significantly outperform intrinsic SSL (CLMR) on small corpora for all three issue types; consistently demonstrated across ESC-50, GTZAN, and CSEM.

**Medium confidence:** Geometry-based indicator functions in the embedding space reliably surface quality issues for human review, as evidenced by strong AUROC/AP on synthetic datasets. Real-world applicability depends on synthetic contamination fidelity.

**Low confidence:** The 97.1% effort savings figure for near-duplicates is based on synthetic ESC-50 data; savings in real industrial settings could be lower if noise patterns are less separable.

## Next Checks

1. **Indicator function transparency:** Request exact mathematical formulas or pseudocode for the off-topic (isolation), near-duplicate (proximity), and label error (intra/extra-class) scoring functions from authors to enable precise replication.

2. **Real-world contamination test:** Apply the pipeline to an industrial audio dataset with known, organically occurring quality issues (not synthetic) and compare effort savings to synthetic baseline.

3. **Cross-corpus embedding robustness:** Evaluate BEATs/M2D embeddings on a small dataset drawn from a domain acoustically distinct from AudioSet-2M (e.g., underwater acoustics or industrial machinery) to test generalization when pre-training data is a poor match.
