# WaymoQA: A Multi-View Visual Question Answering Dataset for Safety-Critical Reasoning in Autonomous Driving

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20022
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20022
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces first training-enabled, multi-view driving QA dataset for safety-critical reasoning with 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of safety-critical reasoning in autonomous driving, where decisions to avoid one risk can inadvertently create new dangers. Existing driving QA datasets primarily focus on normal scenarios and rely on single-view inputs, limiting their effectiveness for complex safety-critical situations. The authors introduce WaymoQA, a novel multi-view driving QA dataset with 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs specifically designed for safety-critical reasoning in autonomous driving contexts.

The dataset uniquely combines both image and video modalities and supports two-stage safety-critical reasoning: resolving immediate risks and mitigating decision-induced downstream risks. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) significantly underperform on safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes. However, fine-tuning these models with WaymoQA leads to substantial performance improvements, with accuracy increases of up to 16.8% on Image QA and 16.3% on Video QA tasks.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces WaymoQA, a training-enabled multi-view driving QA dataset specifically designed for safety-critical reasoning in autonomous driving. The dataset contains 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios, incorporating both image and video modalities. The key innovation is the two-stage safety-critical reasoning framework that addresses both immediate risk resolution and downstream risk mitigation. The dataset leverages multi-view inputs from autonomous vehicle sensors to capture comprehensive scene understanding, enabling models to reason about safety-critical scenarios where avoiding one risk might create another.

## Key Results
- Existing MLLMs underperform on safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes
- Fine-tuning with WaymoQA improves model accuracy by up to 16.8% on Image QA
- Fine-tuning with WaymoQA improves model accuracy by up to 16.3% on Video QA
- WaymoQA is the first training-enabled dataset specifically designed for safety-critical reasoning in autonomous driving

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset works by providing comprehensive multi-view sensor data that captures the full context of safety-critical scenarios. By incorporating both immediate risk detection and downstream risk mitigation in a two-stage reasoning framework, the dataset forces models to consider the cascading effects of driving decisions. The human-annotated question-answer pairs ensure high-quality supervision for complex reasoning tasks that require understanding cause-and-effect relationships in dynamic driving environments.

## Foundational Learning
**Multi-view sensor fusion** (why needed: captures complete environmental context; quick check: verify sensor alignment and temporal synchronization)
**Safety-critical decision cascades** (why needed: understanding how one risk avoidance creates new risks; quick check: validate risk propagation modeling)
**Two-stage reasoning** (why needed: separates immediate response from long-term consequences; quick check: test intermediate decision validation)
**Temporal consistency** (why needed: ensures reliable reasoning across dynamic scenarios; quick check: verify temporal alignment across views)
**Risk prioritization** (why needed: determines which risks to address first in complex scenarios; quick check: validate scoring mechanisms)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Multi-view Sensor Inputs -> Risk Detection Module -> Decision Cascade Analyzer -> Downstream Risk Mitigator -> QA Answer Generator

**Critical Path:**
Sensor fusion and risk detection occur first, followed by decision cascade analysis, then downstream risk assessment, with the QA generator producing final answers based on all preceding stages.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The architecture prioritizes comprehensive safety assessment over computational efficiency, trading speed for thoroughness in risk evaluation. Multi-view inputs increase accuracy but require more processing power and memory.

**Failure Signatures:**
Models may fail when temporal inconsistencies exist between views, when immediate risks mask more critical downstream dangers, or when risk prioritization incorrectly weights competing hazards.

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Baseline evaluation comparing single-view vs. multi-view performance on safety-critical scenarios
2. Ablation study isolating the contribution of each reasoning stage to overall accuracy
3. Cross-scenario generalization test using out-of-distribution safety-critical situations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential bias in human-annotated question-answer pairs may not capture full diversity of real-world safety-critical scenarios
- Reliance on Waymo's proprietary data may limit reproducibility and broader adoption
- Evaluation metrics do not explicitly measure downstream risk mitigation effectiveness

## Confidence

**Confidence Labels:**
- Dataset novelty and scope: **High**
- Performance improvement claims: **Medium**
- Two-stage reasoning framework: **Medium**
- Generalization to real-world scenarios: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of multi-view inputs versus single-view baselines in safety-critical scenarios
2. Evaluate model performance on out-of-distribution scenarios not present in the training data to assess generalization
3. Implement a temporal consistency check between multi-view inputs to ensure reliable reasoning in dynamic driving situations
