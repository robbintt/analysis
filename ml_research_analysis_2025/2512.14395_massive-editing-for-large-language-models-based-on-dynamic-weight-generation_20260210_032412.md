- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14395

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of large-scale knowledge editing in Large Language Models (LLMs), where existing methods suffer from limited knowledge capacity, interference accumulation, and scalability issues. The proposed MeG method introduces a dynamic weight generation approach using diffusion models to conditionally generate neuron weights based on knowledge queries, allowing a single dynamic neuron to achieve large-scale editing without modifying internal weights. This design maintains superior locality performance while scaling to 10,000 edits, achieving state-of-the-art results across Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics.

The method demonstrates significant empirical improvements on ZsRE and COUNTERFACT datasets, particularly excelling in locality with up to 95.75% absolute improvement. The approach preserves general capabilities after editing and shows strong scalability across different LLM sizes, representing a substantial advance in the field of knowledge editing for LLMs.

## Method Summary
The MeG method introduces a dynamic weight generation approach that uses diffusion models to conditionally generate neuron weights based on knowledge queries. Instead of modifying internal weights directly, MeG employs a single dynamic neuron that can adapt to various knowledge editing tasks. The diffusion model serves as a conditional generator that produces appropriate weights for the dynamic neuron based on the specific knowledge being edited. This design allows the system to maintain superior locality performance while scaling to large numbers of edits (up to 10,000), avoiding the interference accumulation problems that plague existing methods. The approach is evaluated across multiple dimensions including reliability, generality, and locality, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while preserving the model's general capabilities.

## Key Results
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance across Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics
- Demonstrated up to 95.75% absolute improvement in locality on benchmark datasets
- Successfully scaled to 10,000 edits without degradation in performance
- Preserved general capabilities of LLMs after extensive knowledge editing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MeG method works by leveraging diffusion models as conditional weight generators for dynamic neurons. When a knowledge editing task is required, the diffusion model generates appropriate weights for a single dynamic neuron based on the specific knowledge query. This approach decouples the knowledge editing process from the internal architecture of the LLM, preventing interference accumulation that occurs when directly modifying weights. The conditional generation ensures that each editing task receives weights optimized for that specific knowledge, while the dynamic neuron architecture allows for efficient scaling to large numbers of edits without architectural modifications.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Models**: Generative models that learn to denoise data through a Markov chain process. Needed for learning complex weight distributions and generating high-quality weight parameters. Quick check: Verify the diffusion model can generate valid weight matrices of appropriate dimensions.
- **Dynamic Neurons**: Neurons that can have their weights conditionally generated rather than being fixed. Needed to provide flexibility for knowledge editing without modifying the base model. Quick check: Ensure dynamic neuron weights can be swapped without affecting model stability.
- **Conditional Generation**: Process of generating outputs based on input conditions or prompts. Needed to ensure weight generation is specific to the knowledge being edited. Quick check: Test that different knowledge queries produce meaningfully different weight outputs.
- **Knowledge Locality**: Measure of how well edits affect only intended knowledge without impacting unrelated capabilities. Needed to evaluate the precision of editing methods. Quick check: Verify edited knowledge doesn't degrade performance on unrelated tasks.
- **Interference Accumulation**: Degradation of model performance due to overlapping or conflicting weight modifications. Needed to understand why traditional editing methods fail at scale. Quick check: Monitor performance degradation as number of edits increases.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Knowledge Query -> Diffusion Model -> Dynamic Neuron -> LLM Forward Pass

Critical Path: The core workflow involves receiving a knowledge query, passing it through the diffusion model to generate conditional weights, applying these weights to the dynamic neuron, and then performing the LLM inference with the updated weights.

Design Tradeoffs: The method trades computational overhead of diffusion model inference against the benefit of avoiding interference accumulation and maintaining scalability. This represents a shift from weight modification to weight generation, prioritizing long-term stability over immediate computational efficiency.

Failure Signatures: Potential failures include diffusion model generating invalid weight configurations, poor generalization of generated weights to unseen knowledge types, and computational bottlenecks during real-time editing scenarios.

First Experiments:
1. Validate diffusion model weight generation quality by comparing generated weights against known good configurations for simple editing tasks
2. Test locality preservation by performing single edits and measuring impact on unrelated knowledge
3. Evaluate scalability by incrementally increasing the number of edits and monitoring performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on factual knowledge editing, leaving unclear performance on complex reasoning or procedural knowledge modifications
- Computational overhead of diffusion model-based weight generation not fully characterized for real-time inference scenarios
- Long-term stability and catastrophic forgetting effects beyond immediate post-editing performance remain unexplored

## Confidence
High confidence in: The core architectural contribution of dynamic weight generation via diffusion models, the empirical improvements on ZsRE and COUNTERFACT benchmarks, and the preservation of general capabilities post-editing.

Medium confidence in: The scalability claims to 10,000 edits (limited intermediate validation points), the absolute locality improvements (benchmark-specific), and the computational efficiency relative to baseline methods.

Low confidence in: Long-term stability beyond immediate evaluation windows, performance on non-factual knowledge types, and real-world deployment scenarios involving heterogeneous edit patterns.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal evaluation measuring edit stability and knowledge retention over extended time periods (e.g., 1000+ inference steps post-editing) to assess potential forgetting or interference accumulation.

2. Test the method on diverse knowledge types including procedural knowledge, causal reasoning, and multimodal information to evaluate generalizability beyond factual editing.

3. Benchmark computational overhead by measuring inference-time latency and memory requirements when applying the diffusion-based weight generation during real-time editing scenarios.
