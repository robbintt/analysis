# Beyond Point Estimates: Likelihood-Based Full-Posterior Wireless Localization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.25719
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25719
- **Reference count:** 30
- **Primary result:** MC-CLE achieves 32.15× geometric improvement in cross-entropy loss vs. 10.42× for Gaussian baselines

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the problem of estimating the full posterior distribution of a transmitter's position from receiver measurements, rather than just a point estimate. The authors propose MC-CLE, a neural density estimation framework that trains a scoring network to compare true and candidate transmitter locations using Monte Carlo sampling. The method is evaluated on a 2D line-of-sight simulation with a uniform linear array receiver, demonstrating significant improvements in capturing multi-modal posteriors and ambiguous geometries compared to Gaussian baseline models.

## Method Summary
MC-CLE trains a neural network to score candidate transmitter locations by comparing them to the true location using Monte Carlo sampling. The method uses physically-motivated input features (relative unit vectors, log-distance, and trigonometric transformations of angles) and a simple MLP architecture to output scalar scores representing unnormalized log-likelihoods. During training, the network learns by maximizing the likelihood ratio of the true location against a set of random candidate locations, approximating the partition function with Monte Carlo samples. The approach is evaluated on 100,000 simulated transmitter-receiver pairs in a 2D LOS environment.

## Key Results
- MC-CLE achieves 32.15× geometric improvement in cross-entropy loss compared to uniform prediction
- Gaussian baseline models achieve only 10.42× geometric improvement, showing MC-CLE's superior performance
- MC-CLE successfully captures multi-modal posteriors, particularly front-back ambiguities that Gaussian models cannot represent
- The method produces more concentrated posteriors with lower Shannon entropy than parametric baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Contrastive Likelihood Estimation
The model learns a posterior distribution by maximizing the likelihood ratio of the true transmitter location relative to random candidate locations. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss that compares the true location score against Monte Carlo samples, the network pushes the score of the true location up while pushing incorrect candidates down. This contrastive approach allows the model to learn the full posterior without requiring explicit normalization.

### Mechanism 2: Physical Feature Preprocessing
Explicit physical feature preprocessing reduces the learning burden by embedding domain invariants directly into the input. The transformation uses relative unit vectors, log-distance, and sin/cos of angles, aligning the input manifold with the physics of wave propagation where signal strength decays logarithmically and angles are periodic. This preprocessing helps the network focus on learning the likelihood structure rather than coordinate transformations.

### Mechanism 3: Flexible Neural Scoring for Multi-Modal Posteriors
A flexible neural scoring function captures multi-modal posteriors that parametric Gaussian models fundamentally cannot. By outputting a scalar score for any coordinate, the model constructs a density field that can assume arbitrary shapes, allowing it to represent mixture distributions such as a peak at the true angle and a secondary peak at the ambiguous mirror angle. This flexibility is crucial for handling hardware ambiguities like front-back ambiguity in uniform linear arrays.

## Foundational Learning

- **Cross-Entropy & Partition Functions:** Understanding that the log-sum-exp term acts as a normalizer (partition function) is critical to debugging why the model might output uniform scores or collapse. *Quick check:* If you increase the number of candidates K by a factor of 10, how should the variance of the loss estimate theoretically change?
- **Array Signal Processing (ULA & Ambiguity):** To interpret visualizations, one must recognize that a Uniform Linear Array cannot distinguish front from back. The model isn't "failing" when it shows two lobes; it is correctly reflecting the physics. *Quick check:* Why does the paper use sin(φ) and cos(φ) as input features rather than raw radians or degrees?
- **Probability Density vs. Point Estimation:** This architecture outputs a landscape of likelihood (a heatmap), not a single coordinate. Evaluating it requires metrics like Shannon Entropy or CEL, not just Mean Squared Error distance to the true point. *Quick check:* A Gaussian model might have low MSE (mean is correct) but high Cross-Entropy. Why does this happen in the context of "front-to-back" ambiguity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (True/Candidate pos, RX pose, AoA, SNR) → Physical feature extraction (Eq. 14) → z (8-dim vector) → MLP (Input dim 8 → 64 → 16 → 1) with ReLU activations → Scalar score gθ (Logit) → Softmax-like normalization over candidates (Eq. 13)
- **Critical path:** The feature transformation (Eq. 14) is the most brittle part; incorrect log-scaling of distance or SNR clipping will immediately degrade convergence. The gradient flow through the log-sum-exp in the loss function drives the separation between true and candidate scores.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Gaussian vs. MC-CLE - Gaussian baselines are faster (predicting μ, Σ parameters) but strictly unimodal. MC-CLE is computationally heavier (requires sampling/evaluating many candidates) but captures multi-modal uncertainties and ambiguous geometries. Candidate Count (K) - Higher K yields better partition function approximation but increases memory/compute per batch.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Uniform Prediction: Loss L ≈ 0. The model outputs a constant score for all inputs. Check learning rate or initialization.
  - Mode Collapse: The posterior is a sharp spike at the receiver location or a fixed point. Check if position inputs are correctly normalized.
  - Gaussian Drift: If visualizations look like smooth blobs in complex scenarios, the network may be under-fitting; consider increasing hidden layer width.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Overfit Sanity Check: Train on a single RX-TX pair with a fixed candidate set. Verify the loss goes to -log(K) to ensure the architecture can theoretically represent the function.
  2. Ablation on Candidate Set Size (K): Run training with K ∈ {10, 100, 1000}. Plot validation CEL vs. K to find the point of diminishing returns.
  3. Ambiguity Visualization: Generate a scenario where the TX is directly behind the RX (Front-Back ambiguity). Visualize the heatmap to confirm the model produces two distinct lobes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1: NLOS Extension
Can the MC-CLE framework be extended to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments, particularly where the environment map is unknown? The conclusion explicitly states future work will consider NLOS settings with and without knowledge of obstacles. This remains unresolved because the current evaluation is restricted to LOS free-space scenarios, while NLOS introduces complex multi-path propagation that fundamentally alters the posterior distribution shape.

### Open Question 2: Multiple Measurements Integration
How can the framework efficiently integrate multiple measurements (e.g., temporal or multi-BS) to refine the posterior distribution? Section II-A notes the focus on "single measurement circumstance" and explicitly states multiple measurements will be discussed in future work. This is unresolved because incorporating multiple measurements requires a mechanism to fuse sequential data without simply increasing input dimensionality.

### Open Question 3: 3D Scaling
Does the Monte Carlo partition function approximation remain computationally tractable and accurate when scaling from 2D to 3D localization? The method restricts the problem to 2D "for simplicity," yet the Monte Carlo sum suffers from the curse of dimensionality. As the spatial dimension increases, the number of candidates required grows exponentially, potentially making training unstable or slow.

## Limitations
- Empirical scope limited to 2D LOS simulation with no evaluation in NLOS conditions
- Reported improvements are relative to uniform baseline rather than absolute performance metrics
- Computational cost of MC-CLE (requiring evaluation of many candidate locations) is not discussed
- Does not address real-world measurement noise beyond simulation parameters

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (Contrastive likelihood estimation):** High - theory is well-established and implementation details are explicit
- **Mechanism 2 (Physical feature preprocessing):** Medium - intuition is clear but empirical ablation studies on feature design are not provided
- **Mechanism 3 (Capturing multi-modal posteriors):** Medium - demonstrated on specific front-back ambiguity case but not systematically evaluated across diverse scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate MC-CLE performance in NLOS conditions with varying levels of obstruction to test the robustness of the physical feature transformations
2. Measure and compare the computational runtime of MC-CLE versus Gaussian baselines at inference time, including memory requirements for candidate storage
3. Conduct an ablation study varying the candidate set size K during training to determine the minimum effective size for stable gradient estimates
