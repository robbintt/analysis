# The Computation of Generalized Embeddings for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition using Contrastive Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.12904
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12904
- Reference count: 11
- This study explores unsupervised contrastive learning for underwater acoustic target recognition, achieving competitive performance compared to supervised baselines using only unlabeled data.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) by exploring unsupervised contrastive learning on unlabeled acoustic data. A Conformer-based encoder is trained using Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) loss on unlabeled recordings from a single hydrophone, producing generalized embeddings. These embeddings are then used for downstream classification tasks including ship type and marine mammal vocalization recognition across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance compared to supervised contrastive learning baselines, demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization and reduced dependence on labeled data. The framework shows potential for broader underwater acoustic analysis applications while requiring only abundant unlabeled recordings.

## Method Summary
The approach employs unsupervised pre-training of a Conformer encoder using VICReg loss on unlabeled underwater acoustic data from a single hydrophone. The encoder is trained on 30GB of Ocean Network Canada hydrophone recordings, processed into 2-second 128-bin Mel spectrograms. Four augmentation types (none, Gaussian noise, low-pass filtering, and MixUp) are applied to create positive pairs. The pre-trained encoder is then evaluated through linear probing on downstream ship classification and marine mammal vocalization tasks using Deepship, ShipsEar, and Watkins datasets. A 2-layer MLP Expander converts the Conformer output to 8196-dimensional embeddings for VICReg optimization.

## Key Results
- Unsupervised VICReg pre-training achieves competitive accuracy and F1 scores compared to supervised contrastive learning baselines
- The framework demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, performing well on benchmarks not seen during pre-training
- Only unlabeled recordings are required for pre-training, reducing dependence on expensive labeled data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The VICReg loss combines invariance to augmentations, variance maximization, and covariance reduction to create discriminative embeddings without labels. By training on diverse unlabeled acoustic data from a single hydrophone, the model learns general acoustic features that transfer effectively to multiple downstream tasks. The Conformer architecture's ability to capture both local and global acoustic patterns, combined with the MixUp augmentation's creation of novel positive pairs, enhances the model's robustness and generalization capability.

## Foundational Learning
- **VICReg Loss**: Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization combines three terms to create discriminative embeddings without negative pairs. *Why needed:* Avoids collapse without requiring negative samples. *Quick check:* Monitor variance term during training to ensure it doesn't drop to zero.
- **Conformer Architecture**: Hybrid CNN-transformer model effective for sequential data. *Why needed:* Captures both local acoustic patterns and global temporal dependencies. *Quick check:* Verify receptive field covers full 2-second window.
- **MixUp Augmentation**: Creates positive pairs by mixing samples from nearby temporal locations. *Why needed:* Increases data diversity and robustness. *Quick check:* Confirm temporal sampling respects file boundaries.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Audio File -> Mel Spectrogram -> Conformer Encoder -> Expander MLP -> VICReg Loss

**Critical Path:** The pipeline from raw audio through Mel spectrogram conversion to the Conformer encoder and Expander represents the critical path for feature extraction and embedding generation.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The use of VICReg instead of SimCLR eliminates the need for negative pairs but requires careful balancing of variance and covariance terms. The MixUp augmentation increases computational complexity but improves generalization.

**Failure Signatures:** Embedding collapse (zero variance) indicates improper VICReg weight balancing. Poor downstream performance suggests inadequate augmentation diversity or insufficient pre-training data.

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify Mel spectrogram computation and ensure consistent 128-bin resolution across all datasets
2. Test VICReg loss implementation with simple synthetic data to confirm variance and covariance terms behave as expected
3. Validate MixUp augmentation by visualizing mixed spectrograms and confirming temporal sampling follows the specified normal distribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does re-labeling ship classes based on physical propulsion characteristics (e.g., engine type, number of blades) improve classification accuracy compared to standard AIS categories?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that current classes have high internal spread and overlap, suggesting "a solution to this problem could be to create classes based on the characteristics of the ship... instead of the first-level Automatic Identification System (AIS) categorization."
- Why unresolved: The study evaluates performance on existing benchmark datasets which rely on broad AIS categories, leaving the physical-relevance of the learned embeddings untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study where models are trained and evaluated on a dataset labeled with specific machinery attributes rather than general vessel types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does incorporating diverse unlabeled data from multiple hydrophones (varying locations/depths) impact the generalizability of the embeddings compared to the single-hydrophone approach?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper utilizes a "proof of concept" architecture trained on data from a single hydrophone, but explicitly states in the Discussion that the framework "can be extended by incorporating more diverse underwater acoustical data from multiple publicly available hydrophones."
- Why unresolved: The current results rely on data from a specific location (ONC, Vancouver), leaving the effects of diverse environmental acoustic conditions on the unsupervised pre-training process unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study pre-training the Conformer on a multi-location dataset and evaluating downstream performance on geographically distinct benchmarks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the unsupervised VICReg framework effectively generalize to non-biological, event-based acoustic analysis tasks such as climate change monitoring or nuclear test detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude that by incorporating more data, the "framework could translate better to other underwater acoustic analysis tasks, such as climate change monitoring and nuclear bomb test detection."
- Why unresolved: The paper only validates the framework on ship classification and marine mammal vocalization tasks; performance on transient or geophysical event detection remains hypothetical.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the pre-trained encoder to downstream tasks involving seismic events or anthropogenic events distinct from ship noise to verify embedding versatility.

## Limitations
- The Conformer architecture lacks complete specification (d_model and FFN dimensions), preventing exact reproduction
- MixUp implementation details are ambiguous, particularly the temporal neighborhood sampling procedure
- Pre-training requires substantial GPU memory (A100 40GB) due to large batch size requirements

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The overall framework design (VICReg pre-training → linear probing), dataset sources and splits, and evaluation metrics are clearly specified and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence:** The augmentation pipeline is specified, but the MixUp implementation detail (temporal neighborhood sampling) could materially affect the learned representations.

**Low Confidence:** Exact numerical performance metrics (accuracy and F1 scores) cannot be reproduced without the missing architectural parameters and complete MixUp implementation.

## Next Checks

1. **Verify MixUp Implementation:** Implement the temporal sampling with μ=center_time and σ=50 seconds, ensuring correct handling of file boundaries and dataset chunking.

2. **Test Conformer Width Sensitivity:** Experiment with standard small Conformer configurations (d_model=144 and d_model=256) to determine which width achieves results closest to the reported performance.

3. **Monitor VICReg Variance Term:** During pre-training, track the variance component of the VICReg loss to detect and prevent embedding collapse, adjusting covariance weight (ν) as needed.
