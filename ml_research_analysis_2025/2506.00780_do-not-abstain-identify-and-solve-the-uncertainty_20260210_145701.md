# Do not Abstain! Identify and Solve the Uncertainty

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00780
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00780
- Reference count: 40
- Current LLMs struggle to identify uncertainty sources and default to evasive responses

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) struggling to identify and solve uncertainty sources in queries. Current approaches rely on evasive responses, overlooking opportunities to address uncertainty and improve response quality. To tackle this, the authors introduce ConfuseBench, a benchmark focusing on three types of uncertainty: document scarcity, limited capability, and query ambiguity. They propose a method to judge uncertainty based on the uniqueness of inquiry answers and enhance inquiry generation through InteractDPO, an on-policy training method. Experiments show that current models like GPT-4o struggle to classify uncertainty sources accurately, often attributing issues to query ambiguity while overlooking capability limitations. The proposed approach significantly improves uncertainty classification accuracy and answer quality, demonstrating the efficacy of addressing uncertainty through targeted inquiry generation and adaptive interaction strategies.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a three-step framework: first, generate an inquiry highlighting the confusing aspect of the query; second, analyze the uniqueness of the inquiry's answer to classify the uncertainty source (objective fact → document scarcity; multiple valid answers → ambiguity; incoherent/repetitive → capability limitation); third, take appropriate action (retrieval, clarification, or chain-of-thought reasoning). They enhance this with InteractDPO, an on-policy training method that generates preference pairs based on actual interaction outcomes rather than fixed offline data. The model is trained to generate inquiries that, when followed by appropriate actions, lead to improved answer quality compared to baseline responses.

## Key Results
- Current models like GPT-4o achieve only 0.4938 Uncertainty Classification Accuracy (UCA), with systematic over-attribution to query ambiguity
- The proposed answer-based classification approach improves UCA to 0.6062
- InteractDPO training significantly outperforms both vanilla DPO and OnlineDPO in generating high-quality inquiries
- Models correctly identify capability limitations only 19% of the time, defaulting to user-blame clarification requests

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Inquiry-to-Source Mapping via Answer Properties
- **Claim**: The uncertainty source can be inferred by analyzing properties of the inquiry's answer rather than the inquiry text itself.
- **Mechanism**: Generate a follow-up inquiry highlighting the confusing aspect. If the inquiry's answer is a single objective fact (e.g., "What is the population of X?"), the uncertainty stems from document scarcity → trigger retrieval. If multiple answers fit appropriately, it indicates query ambiguity → trigger clarification. If the inquiry incoherently rephrases the original query, it signals capability limitation → trigger chain-of-thought reasoning.
- **Core assumption**: The information needed to classify uncertainty is more accessible in the inquiry's answer space than through direct introspection of the query.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "judge the source of uncertainty based on the uniqueness of the inquiry's answer"
  - [section 5.1]: "If the answer to inquiry is an objective fact, the retrieval system can effectively provide the required information. If multiple answers fit the inquiry appropriately, further clarification is necessary."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct support; related work on uncertainty decomposition exists but focuses on data/model splits rather than actionable source identification.
- **Break condition**: If the inquiry is low-quality (e.g., semantically empty or misaligned with the query), answer-based classification degrades. Inquiry quality is a gating factor.

### Mechanism 2: On-Policy Preference Formation Through Real Interaction
- **Claim**: Training with interaction-grounded preference pairs (chosen/rejected based on actual answer improvement) outperforms offline DPO or LLM-judged preferences.
- **Mechanism**: During training, the model generates an inquiry, interacts with a retrieval system or simulated user, and produces an answer. If the answer improves over the baseline, the inquiry is marked "chosen"; otherwise, "rejected." These pairs drive DPO updates. Unlike standard DPO (fixed offline pairs) or OnlineDPO (LLM-as-judge), InteractDPO uses ground-truth interaction outcomes.
- **Core assumption**: The quality of an inquiry is best measured by downstream answer utility, not linguistic plausibility.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 5.2]: "If the trained model successfully generate an inquiry to solve the original query, it will be selected as the chosen inquiry, otherwise the rejected inquiry to conduct on policy DPO training."
  - [table 6]: InteractDPO achieves 0.6062 UCA vs. vanilla 0.5431 and onlineDPO 0.5923.
  - [corpus]: Related work (HALT, TruthRL) uses reinforcement learning for truthfulness but does not specifically address inquiry generation with real feedback loops.
- **Break condition**: If the simulated user/retrieval system provides noisy or inconsistent responses, preference labels become unreliable, degrading training signal.

### Mechanism 3: Uncertainty Type Disentanglement Reduces False Ambiguity Attribution
- **Claim**: Models systematically misattribute uncertainty to query ambiguity, especially weaker models; explicit source classification corrects this bias.
- **Mechanism**: By forcing a three-way classification (document scarcity vs. capability vs. ambiguity) and tying each to a distinct action (retrieval, CoT, clarification), the model is constrained to acknowledge capability limitations rather than defaulting to user-blame.
- **Core assumption**: Models can learn to recognize their own limitations when given explicit categories and action mappings.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [table 4]: For GPT-4o, precision for "ambig" is 0.41 with recall 0.76; for Llama-3-70B, "ambig" recall is 0.97 (near-total over-attribution).
  - [section 4]: "models prefer to categorize questions as ambiguous and request the user for clarification."
  - [corpus]: Consistent with related work on overconfidence and misaligned abstention (e.g., HALT, MedAbstain), though this paper specifically quantifies the ambiguity bias.
- **Break condition**: If the classification prompt is under-specified or the model lacks sufficient self-awareness, it may still default to the high-recall "ambiguous" category.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
  - **Why needed here**: InteractDPO extends DPO by generating preference pairs from real interactions rather than pre-collected data.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain how the DPO loss uses implicit rewards without training a separate reward model?

- **Concept: Uncertainty Decomposition (Aleatoric vs. Epistemic)**
  - **Why needed here**: This paper operationalizes a three-way split (document, capability, ambiguity) rather than the traditional data/model dichotomy.
  - **Quick check question**: How would you map "document scarcity" and "limited capability" onto the standard aleatoric/epistemic framework?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - **Why needed here**: One of the three uncertainty-solving strategies is triggering retrieval when the inquiry's answer is an objective fact.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the standard pipeline for RAG, and where would inquiry-based retrieval fit?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Query + Documents → Inquiry Generator → Inquiry → Answer Analyzer (with preset answer injection) → Source Classifier → Action (retrieval/clarification/CoT) → Final Answer
- **Critical path**: Query + Documents → Inquiry Generator → Inquiry → Answer Analyzer (with preset answer injection) → Source Classifier → Action (retrieval/clarification/CoT) → Final Answer
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Answer-based classification adds inference cost (requires generating and testing answers) but improves classification accuracy (0.6062 vs. 0.4938 for GPT-4o baseline).
  - InteractDPO requires live interaction during training; simpler to implement with simulated user (GPT-4o) but may not transfer to real users.
- **Failure signatures**:
  1. **High ambiguity recall, low precision**: Model defaults to clarification; check if answer uniqueness test is being bypassed.
  2. **Low inquiry quality score**: Inquiry generator is producing paraphrases; may need more training data or stronger base model.
  3. **Inconsistent DPO training loss**: Interaction feedback is noisy; verify retrieval/user simulation stability.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline classification**: Prompt GPT-4o or a smaller model to classify uncertainty source directly (no inquiry); measure UCA and compare to table 3.
  2. **Ablate answer-based verification**: Use only inquiry-based classification (skip answer uniqueness test); compare UCA to table 5 "inquiry" vs. "answer" rows.
  3. **InteractDPO vs. DPO**: Train a 7B model with InteractDPO and vanilla DPO on the same preference data; measure inquiry quality and answer quality per table 6 and table 10.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can the classification framework be extended to distinguish finer-grained uncertainty sources, such as differentiating factual knowledge deficits from background information needs?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that "lack of documents may correspond to deficiencies in factual knowledge or background information," each potentially requiring different databases.
- **Why unresolved**: The current ConfuseBench aggregates these distinct needs under the single label of "document scarcity," leading to a generic retrieval strategy.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Extending the benchmark to sub-categorize scarcity types and evaluating model accuracy in routing queries to specific specialized databases.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can models dynamically select advanced reasoning strategies (e.g., Tree of Thought) for capability limitations instead of defaulting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT)?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors note in the Limitations that while CoT is used for capability limits, "there are also cases that necessitate the use of methods like Tree of Thought or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)."
- **Why unresolved**: The proposed solution currently maps all capability limitations to CoT, failing to leverage or select more robust algorithms for complex logical problems.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Ablation studies on the "limited capability" subset measuring performance gains when the model is trained to choose between CoT, ToT, and MCTS.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Does InteractDPO performance generalize to real human interactions, given the training relies on GPT-4o to simulate user clarifications?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The methodology utilizes "User-GPT" to simulate user responses during the on-policy training, assuming users provide optimal clarifications.
- **Why unresolved**: Real-world users may provide ambiguous, irrelevant, or uncooperative responses, which the simulated environment likely fails to capture.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A human-in-the-loop evaluation comparing the inquiry success rates of models trained with User-GPT versus those trained on human interaction logs.

## Limitations
- **Prompt sensitivity in uncertainty classification**: The answer-based classification approach is sensitive to prompt engineering and may not be robust to variations.
- **Generalizability of InteractDPO**: Performance gains may be specific to synthetic interactions and may not transfer to real-world user interactions.
- **Scalability and inference overhead**: The answer-based classification approach adds computational overhead, potentially limiting practical deployment.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core observation that models systematically over-attribute uncertainty to query ambiguity (supported by quantitative evidence in Table 4 showing high recall but low precision for ambiguity classification across multiple model sizes).
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of InteractDPO (supported by comparative results in Table 6, but the on-policy training approach has limited prior validation and may not generalize beyond synthetic interactions).
- **Medium confidence**: The answer-based classification mechanism (supported by improved UCA in Table 5, but the approach is sensitive to prompt engineering and the specific implementation details are not fully specified).

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the prompts used for inquiry generation, classification, and answer generation to measure robustness. Test whether the 0.6062 UCA from InteractDPO degrades significantly with minor prompt modifications.

2. **Real-user interaction validation**: Deploy the trained model with actual users rather than GPT-4o simulation. Measure whether the accuracy improvements in synthetic settings translate to real-world interactions, particularly for the capability-limited cases where models tend to misclassify.

3. **Inference cost benchmarking**: Measure the latency and computational overhead of the full pipeline (inquiry generation → answer uniqueness testing → action selection) compared to direct response generation. Quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off to assess practical deployment feasibility.
