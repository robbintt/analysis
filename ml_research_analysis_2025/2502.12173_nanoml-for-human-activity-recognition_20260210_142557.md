# nanoML for Human Activity Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.12173
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12173
- Reference count: 18
- Achieves 96.34% and 96.67% accuracy on UCI-HAR with only 56nJ and 104nJ per sample

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates the application of Differentiable Weightless Neural Networks (DWNs) to Human Activity Recognition (HAR), achieving competitive accuracies of 96.34% and 96.67% while consuming only 56nJ and 104nJ per sample, with an inference time of just 5ns per sample. DWNs were implemented and evaluated on an FPGA, showcasing their practical feasibility for energy-efficient hardware deployment. Compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, DWNs achieve up to 926,000x energy savings and 260x memory reduction. These results position DWNs as a nano-machine learning (nanoML) model for HAR, setting a new benchmark in energy efficiency and compactness for edge and wearable devices.

## Method Summary
The approach uses Differentiable Weightless Neural Networks with raw 9-axial sensor signals (128 samples per segment) from smartphones. Signals are converted to 20-bit Distributive Thermometer Encoding, then processed by a single layer of LUT-4s (10k or 20k units). The LUT values and input mappings are trained using Extended Finite Difference (EFD) gradient approximation with Adam optimizer. No preprocessing or hand-crafted features are used. The system achieves one inference per clock cycle on FPGA (200MHz), with final classification via popcount aggregation.

## Key Results
- 96.34% and 96.67% accuracy on UCI-HAR with 56nJ and 104nJ per sample energy consumption
- 5ns inference time per sample on FPGA
- Up to 926,000x energy savings and 260x memory reduction compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods
- Model sizes of 19.5KiB and 39.1KiB for 10k and 20k LUT configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: LUT-based computation
Replacing arithmetic-heavy neurons with Look-Up Tables (LUTs) drastically reduces energy and latency by substituting Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations with memory addressing. A LUT-4 maps 4 input bits directly to a 1-bit output via a stored pattern, requiring zero floating-point math and allowing one inference per clock cycle.

### Mechanism 2: Distributive Thermometer Encoding
Continuous sensor signals are converted into unary binary vectors (e.g., magnitude 3 becomes `11100`), preserving ordinal information while ensuring binary compatibility with LUTs. This is implemented at the sensor level, avoiding expensive preprocessing like FFT or statistical feature extraction.

### Mechanism 3: Extended Finite Difference (EFD)
EFD approximates gradients for discrete LUT entries, enabling gradient-based training of otherwise non-differentiable memory arrays. This allows LUT values and Learnable Mappings to be optimized via standard techniques like Adam and SGD.

## Foundational Learning

- **Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) Dimension**: Explains why a single LUT can replace multi-neuron DNN structures due to exponentially higher capacity ($2^n$ vs $n+1$). Quick check: Why can a single LUT-4 replace a small perceptron network for certain patterns?

- **Unary (Thermometer) Encoding**: Converts continuous values to unary binary vectors (e.g., 3 → `11100`), preserving magnitude relationships better than binary encoding. Quick check: How does thermometer encoding preserve the magnitude relationship (3 > 2) better than standard binary encoding (`011` vs `010`)?

- **Population Count (Popcount)**: Final aggregation layer that counts '1' bits in the output vector to determine class activation. Quick check: If Class A has `11000` and Class B has `10101`, which class wins in a popcount aggregation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw sensor signals (9 channels × 128 samples) → Distributive Thermometer Encoding (20-bit unary) → LUT-4 layer (10k-20k units) → Learnable Mappings → Popcount aggregation

- **Critical path**: Input-to-LUT addressing, where specific bits from the encoded stream must be routed to the input pins of specific LUTs to trigger the correct pattern recognition cascade

- **Design tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. Energy (20k LUTs: 96.67% at 104nJ vs 10k LUTs: 96.34% at 56nJ); LUT Size (LUT-4 chosen over larger LUTs to balance complexity and required stages)

- **Failure signatures**: Underfitting if LUT count is too low or encoding resolution is too coarse; Synthesis failure on FPGA if Learnable Mappings create unroutable logic

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement only the Thermometer Encoder on FPGA to verify raw sensor data conversion without timing errors
  2. Train 10k vs 20k LUT models and measure F1-score delta to validate marginal accuracy gain (~0.3%) vs hardware cost
  3. Test "Sitting" vs. "Standing" classification on held-out subject to validate performance on most confusable static activities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can DWNs maintain competitive accuracy when extended to multi-modal sensor fusion (e.g., combining accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate, and environmental sensors)?
- What additional energy and area efficiency gains can be achieved through custom ASIC implementation of DWNs compared to FPGA deployment?
- How do the reported energy savings hold when preprocessing costs for comparison models are accurately quantified?
- Can DWNs close the remaining accuracy gap (0.98-1.31%) to state-of-the-art transformers while preserving nanojoule-level energy consumption?

## Limitations

- DWN applicability to other HAR datasets beyond UCI-HAR remains untested
- Thermometer encoding quantization to 20-bit unary may be dataset-specific and sensitive to sensor noise
- EFD gradient approximation quality is critical but lacks extensive ablation studies
- FPGA results may not translate directly to ASIC implementations due to programmable routing overhead

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Energy efficiency claims (56nJ/104nJ) and FPGA inference time (5ns) are directly measured and verifiable
- **Medium Confidence**: Comparative advantage over deep learning methods is valid for UCI-HAR but needs validation on other datasets
- **Low Confidence**: DWN novelty assessment is limited by scope of provided literature review

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate DWNs on WISDM and PAMAP2 HAR datasets to verify 96% accuracy is not dataset-specific and measure energy consumption scalability
2. Introduce controlled noise (±5%, ±10%) to sensor signals to measure accuracy degradation and verify thermometer encoding stability
3. Use FPGA synthesis results to estimate ASIC power consumption and compare against the 926,000x energy savings claim
