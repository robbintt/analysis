# Synthetic Eggs in Many Baskets: The Impact of Synthetic Data Diversity on LLM Fine-Tuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01490
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fine-tuning on synthetic data from diverse sources mitigates distribution collapse, preserves output quality while eroding safety, and reduces self-preference bias in LLMs.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how the diversity of synthetic data sources affects large language model (LLM) fine-tuning across three key dimensions: distribution collapse, adversarial robustness, and self-preference bias. The authors find that multi-source synthetic fine-tuning preserves output distribution breadth better than single-source data, while simultaneously maintaining higher output quality when safety guardrails are eroded. The study reveals that fine-tuning reduces self-preference bias, with human data being most effective, followed by multi-source synthetic data.

## Method Summary
The study uses supervised fine-tuning with LoRA (r=16, α=32) on Llama-3.1-8B and 70B models using Databricks-Dolly-15K augmented with synthetic responses from 12 different models across three size brackets (5-15B, 50-150B, 400B+). Three fine-tuning conditions were tested: single-source (one model per size bracket), multi-source (different models within size bracket), and human-source (original Dolly responses). Synthetic data was generated using temperature=0.7 and top_p=0.9. The authors evaluated perplexity on held-out test sets, lexical diversity (Self-BLEU-3), and used LLM-as-judge (Llama-3.1-70B) for harmfulness and quality scores on RefusalBench prompts.

## Key Results
- Multi-source synthetic fine-tuning yields higher perplexity (1.38) than single-source (1.26) for Llama-small, indicating better preservation of output distribution breadth
- Single-source synthetic data produces 36.3% of outputs in the "danger zone" (high quality + high harmfulness), while human data produces lower-quality harmful outputs
- Fine-tuning reduces self-preference bias with the effectiveness ordering: human > multi-source synthetic > single-source synthetic

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multi-source synthetic fine-tuning data mitigates distribution collapse better than single-source data. Synthetic data from multiple models preserves a broader perplexity distribution, preventing the narrowing that occurs when a model is trained repeatedly on outputs from a single source. Multi-source data shifts the entire perplexity distribution higher and retains "long-tail outliers." Core assumption: Diversity of source models approximates diversity of training signal directions, preventing overfitting to a single model's output patterns. Evidence: Table 2 shows multi-source fine-tuning yields higher perplexity (1.38) than single-source (1.26) for Llama-small, with statistical significance; Figure C.1 shows narrower distribution for single-source.

### Mechanism 2
Synthetic fine-tuning preserves output quality while removing safety guardrails, creating higher-risk harmful outputs than human fine-tuning. Fine-tuning on synthetic data causes smaller distribution shifts than human data, allowing models to retain fluency/coherence while still eroding refusal directions. Human data causes larger perplexity shifts, which may catastrophically overwrite safety tuning but also degrade output coherence. Core assumption: Safety guardrails are encoded in ways that can be eroded independently of general language quality; higher perplexity shifts correlate with more catastrophic forgetting of both safety and quality. Evidence: Figure 4 shows single-source synthetic occupies 36.3% of "danger zone" (high quality + high harmfulness) vs human data producing lower-quality harmful outputs.

### Mechanism 3
Fine-tuning reduces self-preference bias, with effectiveness ordered: human > multi-source synthetic > single-source synthetic. Self-preference correlates with low perplexity on model's own outputs. Fine-tuning on out-of-distribution data (human or diverse synthetic) increases perplexity on self-generated text, reducing the preference. Multi-source provides more distribution coverage than single-source but less shift than human data. Core assumption: Self-preference bias is inversely correlated with perplexity on judged text; breaking the model's familiarity with its own output patterns reduces bias. Evidence: Table 3 shows vanilla SPB of 0.258 (small) / 0.238 (medium); human fine-tuning reduces to -0.013 / 0.060; multi-source to 0.115-0.159.

## Foundational Learning

- **Perplexity as a distribution breadth proxy**: Why needed: The paper uses perplexity to measure whether fine-tuning narrows or preserves output distribution breadth. Lower perplexity on a narrow subset indicates collapse. Quick check: If a model has perplexity 1.2 on its own outputs but 7.0 on human text, what does this suggest about its distribution?

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning**: Why needed: All experiments use LoRA with r=16, α=32. Understanding that this adds low-rank adapters rather than full weight updates is critical for interpreting the magnitude of safety erosion. Quick check: Why might LoRA fine-tuning be sufficient to erode safety guardrails despite not modifying all weights?

- **Self-BLEU for lexical diversity measurement**: Why needed: The paper quantifies diversity collapse using Self-BLEU-3 (higher = more diverse). This measures n-gram overlap within generated outputs. Quick check: What would a Self-BLEU score of 0.95 vs 0.75 indicate about lexical diversity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Source models (12 across 3 size brackets) -> Synthetic data generation -> Dataset augmentation (Dolly-15k split into 4 parts) -> LoRA fine-tuning (r=16, α=32) -> Target models (Llama-3.1-8B and 70B) -> Evaluation pipeline (perplexity, Self-BLEU-3, harmfulness/quality via LLM judge)

- **Critical path**: 1. Generate synthetic data from source models using temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9 2. Fine-tune target models on single-source, multi-source, or human data 3. Generate test outputs on held-out Dolly-15k (for perplexity/diversity) and RefusalBench (for safety) 4. Evaluate with Llama-70B as judge for harmfulness/quality; compute perplexity and Self-BLEU directly

- **Design tradeoffs**: Multi-source increases compute (4x model API calls for data generation) but reduces collapse risk; larger source models help diversity but may hurt safety; human data maximally reduces bias but catastrophically erodes safety

- **Failure signatures**: Single-source synthetic: Narrow perplexity distribution, high danger-zone occupancy (36.3% for small models); Multi-source from large models for large targets: Safety erosion without quality loss; Human fine-tuning: High harmfulness + low quality outputs

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Reproduce perplexity shift: Fine-tune Llama-8B on single-source vs multi-source small model data; measure perplexity on held-out human test set 2. Map the danger zone: Fine-tune on single-source small data; run RefusalBench + jailbreaks; compute harmfulness × quality scores 3. Isolate source model size effect: Using only multi-source data, compare safety erosion when source models are S vs M vs L size bracket

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Do the effects of synthetic data diversity on distribution collapse and safety generalize to target models significantly larger than 70B parameters?
- How does synthetic data diversity impact model behavior and safety in multi-turn conversations?
- Do the findings regarding source diversity and safety alignment hold for under-represented languages?

## Limitations
- Source diversity assumptions: The paper assumes different model APIs provide meaningful diversity, but source models may share underlying training data or architectural biases
- Perplexity-peril correlation: Heavy reliance on perplexity as a proxy for distribution breadth and quality without direct validation
- Self-preference mechanism: The connection between distributional familiarity and preference bias remains theoretically underspecified

## Confidence
- Distribution collapse mitigation: High - Multiple experimental results show multi-source synthetic data preserves broader perplexity distributions
- Safety erosion vs quality trade-off: High - Consistent findings show synthetic fine-tuning preserves output quality while eroding safety guardrails
- Self-preference bias reduction ordering: Medium - The SPB reduction ordering is robust, but the perplexity-based mechanism explanation lacks direct causal evidence

## Next Checks
1. Source model independence test: Compute vocabulary overlap and response similarity metrics between source models within each size bracket to verify multi-source truly provides diverse training signals
2. Quality-peril dissociation experiment: Design experiment that separately manipulates output quality and safety erosion to test whether the observed quality-preserved danger is necessary or coincidental
3. Self-preference ablation study: Fine-tune models on synthetic data generated at different temperatures to test whether self-preference reduction correlates with distributional shift magnitude
