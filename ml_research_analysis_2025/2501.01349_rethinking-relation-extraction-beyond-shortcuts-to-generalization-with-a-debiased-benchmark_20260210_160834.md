# Rethinking Relation Extraction: Beyond Shortcuts to Generalization with a Debiased Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.01349
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01349
- **Reference count**: 11
- **Primary result**: MixDebias significantly improves relation extraction models on DREB (debiased benchmark) while maintaining or improving performance on original datasets by combining data-level augmentation and model-level debiasing.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses entity bias in relation extraction, where models rely on entity mentions rather than contextual information. The authors propose DREB, a debiased benchmark created by replacing entities with alternatives from Wikidata, evaluated for naturalness using perplexity and bias scores. They also introduce MixDebias, combining data-level augmentation (generating entity-replaced samples with KL divergence constraints) and model-level debiasing (using causal effect estimation and debiased focal loss). MixDebias significantly improves model performance on DREB while maintaining or improving results on original datasets. The benchmark and method effectively mitigate entity bias and provide a more reliable evaluation framework for relation extraction models.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes DREB, a debiased benchmark for relation extraction that addresses entity bias by replacing named entities with alternatives from Wikidata. DREB uses two evaluators: Bias Evaluator (neural network trained to predict relations from entity mentions alone) and PPL Evaluator (GPT-2 perplexity for naturalness). The authors also introduce MixDebias, a training method that combines data-level augmentation (RDA) with model-level debiasing (CDA). RDA generates entity-replaced samples and uses KL divergence to encourage stable predictions across augmentations. CDA uses causal effect estimation to isolate and downweight entity-biased predictions through debiased focal loss. The combined method significantly improves performance on DREB while maintaining or improving results on original datasets.

## Key Results
- MixDebias improves LUKE performance on DREB by 19.6 F1 points while improving original test set F1 by 0.7 points
- Ablation shows RDA contributes more to DREB gains (16-38 F1 points) than CDA (0.07-0.55 F1 points)
- DREB samples show lower perplexity and bias scores compared to original test sets
- MixDebias outperforms competitive baselines including R-Drop, CoRE, and R-Drop+CoRE on both DREB and original datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Entity replacement breaks pseudo-correlations between entity mentions and relation labels.
- Mechanism: DREB substitutes named entities with type-matched alternatives from Wikidata, forcing models to rely on contextual patterns rather than memorized entity-relation associations. The Bias Evaluator quantifies residual bias by training a network to predict labels from entity mentions alone; the PPL Evaluator (GPT-2 perplexity) filters for naturalness.
- Core assumption: The bias captured by the Bias Evaluator accurately reflects entity-reliance rather than other dataset artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DREB utilizes Bias Evaluator and PPL Evaluator to ensure low bias and high naturalness."
  - [section 3] "We preprocess the relation extraction training set D with φ(x) to construct a synthetic dataset D_EntityBias, which allows us to model the entity bias directly."
  - [corpus] Related work (arXiv:2506.11381) addresses entity bias via Variational Information Bottleneck, suggesting entity bias is a recognized problem with multiple mitigation strategies.
- Break condition: If replacement entities are semantically incompatible with the original context, PPL scores will be high and samples filtered; if bias scores remain high after filtering, the replacement pool may be insufficient.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: KL divergence regularization (RDA) forces stable predictions across entity substitutions.
- Mechanism: For each training sample, an augmented version is generated via entity replacement. The model computes probability distributions P (original) and P_aug (augmented); symmetric KL divergence L_RDA penalizes divergence between them. This prevents the model from making entity-specific predictions.
- Core assumption: Entity-type information is sufficient for disambiguation while entity identity is dispensable for relation prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "This process is guided by a Kullback-Leibler Divergence constraint that encourages the model to produce probability distributions P and P_aug that are as similar as possible."
  - [section 4] Ablation shows removing RDA drops DREB F1 by 16-38 points across datasets.
  - [corpus] R-Drop (cited in paper) uses similar KL-based consistency but lacks entity-specific focus.
- Break condition: If β (KL weight) is too high, the model may underfit to valid entity signals; if too low, debiasing effect is negligible.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Causal effect estimation isolates and downweights entity-biased predictions.
- Mechanism: CDA computes P_bias = P - λP_context, where P is the full-input prediction and P_context is the prediction with entities masked. This estimates the contribution of entity mentions to the prediction. Debiased Focal Loss L_CDA = -(1 - P_bias^j) log P^j reduces emphasis on samples where entity bias dominates.
- Core assumption: The difference P - P_context cleanly captures entity-specific bias rather than other contextual factors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "CDA method uses causal effect estimation to build a bias model which assesses the degree of entity bias in each sample."
  - [section 6] Ablation: removing CDA causes smaller drops than RDA (0.07-0.55 F1), suggesting RDA is primary and CDA complementary.
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence for this specific causal decomposition; related work (CoRE) uses counterfactual analysis similarly but post-hoc.
- Break condition: If λ is mis-specified, P_bias may be negative or too small; ablation shows optimal λ ≈ 0.2.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: KL Divergence
  - Why needed here: Core to RDA; measures distributional difference between original and augmented predictions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why symmetric KL (average of both directions) is used rather than one-way?

- Concept: Causal Effect Estimation (Total Effect / Direct Effect)
  - Why needed here: CDA treats entity presence as an intervention; P - P_context approximates the causal effect of entity mentions on predictions.
  - Quick check question: What confounders might violate the assumption that P - P_context isolates entity bias?

- Concept: Perplexity as Fluency Metric
  - Why needed here: PPL Evaluator filters unnatural entity replacements; lower perplexity indicates more fluent text.
  - Quick check question: Why might a language model's perplexity not fully capture semantic coherence after entity substitution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - DREB Construction: Wikidata entity pool → Entity replacement → Bias Evaluator (neural classifier on entity-only) → PPL Evaluator (GPT-2) → Top-K selection
  - MixDebias Training: EntityDict → On-the-fly augmentation → Dual forward pass (original + augmented) → KL loss (RDA) + Context-only forward pass → Bias estimation → Debiased Focal Loss (CDA) → Combined loss L_MixDebias

- Critical path:
  1. Build EntityDict from training data (entity → type mapping).
  2. For each batch: sample replacement entities → generate augmented input.
  3. Forward pass: original input → P; augmented input → P_aug; context-only (entities masked) → P_context.
  4. Compute L_RDA = 0.5 * (D_KL(P||P_aug) + D_KL(P_aug||P)).
  5. Compute P_bias = P - λ·P_context, then L_CDA = -(1 - P_bias^j) log P^j.
  6. L_MixDebias = L_CDA + β * L_RDA.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - External vs. internal entity sources: Paper uses training-derived EntityDict to avoid introducing lexical bias; limits diversity.
  - β (KL weight) vs. λ (causal scaling): Higher β → stronger debiasing but risk of underfitting; λ ≈ 0.2 optimal per ablation.
  - PPL filtering threshold: Stricter thresholds improve naturalness but reduce candidate pool.

- Failure signatures:
  - DREB F1 << original F1: Model is entity-dependent; debiasing insufficient.
  - Original F1 drops significantly: Over-regularization; reduce β.
  - PPL Evaluator rejects most candidates: Entity replacement pool too small or type-mismatched.
  - Negative P_bias values: λ too high; reduce toward 0.2.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline: Train LUKE or IRE on TACRED, evaluate on both original test and DREB; expect ~30-50 F1 gap.
  2. Ablate RDA vs. CDA: Train with only RDA (β > 0, no CDA), only CDA (β = 0), and both; compare DREB F1 and original F1.
  3. Hyperparameter sweep: Vary β ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0} and λ ∈ {-0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6}; plot BME scores to find optimal region.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the performance of large generative language models (LLMs) compare to encoder-based models like LUKE and IRE on the DREB benchmark?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The introduction explicitly mentions that LLMs exacerbate entity bias by relying on parametric knowledge, yet the experimental evaluation focuses exclusively on encoder-based models (LUKE and IRE).
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the MixDebias method, which relies on fine-tuning specific loss functions, translates effectively to prompt-based learning or instruction tuning used for generative LLMs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Evaluation of prominent generative LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama) on the DREB benchmark to measure their susceptibility to entity bias compared to the debiased baselines.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the DREB construction strategy be effectively generalized to document-level relation extraction where cross-sentence dependencies exist?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper explicitly states the datasets used (TACRED, TACREV, Re-TACRED) belong to the "sentence-level relation extraction category," leaving the utility of this method for document-level tasks unexplored.
- **Why unresolved:** Entity replacement in multi-sentence contexts risks breaking coreference chains and logical flow, and it is uncertain if the PPL Evaluator is sufficient to maintain naturalness in longer texts.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying the entity replacement and PPL filtering strategy to a document-level dataset (e.g., DocRED) and analyzing the semantic coherence of the generated pseudo-samples.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the assumption of linear subtraction in the causal effect estimation ($P - \lambda P_{context}$) sufficient to capture complex, non-linear entity biases?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The CDA component formulates bias probability as a linear difference, and the ablation study suggests the model-level CDA is less effective than the data-level RDA, potentially indicating a limitation in the causal modeling.
- **Why unresolved:** The interaction between entity mentions and context may be multiplicative or attention-based rather than additive; a linear subtraction might fail to disentangle these features completely.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study replacing the linear causal subtraction with a non-linear disentanglement module to see if the model-level performance gap relative to RDA closes.

## Limitations

- DREB construction details remain partially unspecified, particularly the Bias Evaluator architecture (described only as "neural network") and context-only input format for CDA
- The generalizability of DREB beyond TACRED-style datasets is untested, and the method's effectiveness on zero-shot or few-shot settings is unknown
- Optimal hyperparameters (β, λ) are shown through ablation but not explicitly stated for main results, requiring readers to infer values

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Entity bias exists in RE models and negatively impacts generalization (well-established in literature, validated by large DREB-original F1 gaps)
- **Medium confidence**: MixDebias effectively mitigates entity bias (supported by ablation showing RDA/CDA contributions, but hyperparameter sensitivity unaddressed)
- **Medium confidence**: DREB is a valid evaluation framework (perplexity and bias scores support naturalness, but external validation on other datasets missing)
- **Low confidence**: Optimal β and λ values for MixDebias (only ablation ranges provided, no final specification)

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Apply DREB construction methodology to DocRED or SemEval-2010 Task 8 and evaluate whether MixDebias maintains effectiveness on entity-debiased samples from these datasets.
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary β ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0} and λ ∈ {-0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6} on TACRED, measuring BME scores to identify optimal regions and quantify sensitivity to these critical values.
3. **Ablation on context-only input format**: Compare three variants for P_context computation—(a) entity masking with [MASK], (b) entity removal, (c) entity replacement with type markers—measuring impact on both DREB and original F1 to determine which format best isolates entity bias without harming legitimate context learning.
