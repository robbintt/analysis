# Synthesizing and Identifying Noise Levels in Autonomous Vehicle Camera Radar Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.00584
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00584
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: 54.4% overall accuracy in identifying 11 noise levels across camera-radar datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving robustness in autonomous vehicle perception systems by simulating realistic sensor failures in camera-radar datasets. The authors develop a synthetic data augmentation pipeline that models three types of camera degradations (blurring, exposure changes, and additive noise) and three radar degradations (ghost point generation, false negatives, and noise-induced measurement shifts). They implement a baseline lightweight neural network for noise recognition, achieving 54.4% overall accuracy in identifying 11 noise levels across 12,341 images and radar point clouds. The camera-only noise recognizer achieves 62.19% accuracy, while the radar recognizer achieves 20.79% accuracy. This approach enables plug-and-play integration with existing detection methods and allows for adaptive responses based on detected noise levels, potentially improving system robustness when deployed in real-world vehicles.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves creating a synthetic data augmentation pipeline for camera and radar sensors that models physical degradation mechanisms. Camera degradation uses Gaussian blur (ksize = 2×round(Nlvl)+1), exposure changes (kernel × (1+3×Nlvl)), and additive noise (σ=Nlvl). Radar degradation generates ghost points from uniform angular sampling, removes low-RCS points based on SNR thresholds (SNR' = SNR × 10^(-N/100)), and adds measurement shifts derived from the Cramér-Rao bound. A U-Net architecture processes camera images while 1D convolutional networks process radar point clouds, both classifying into 11 noise level categories (0-100% in 10% increments).

## Key Results
- Overall noise recognition accuracy of 54.4% across 11 noise levels
- Camera-only recognition achieves 62.19% accuracy
- Radar-only recognition achieves 20.79% accuracy
- Pipeline processes 12,341 images and radar point clouds from nuScenes mini dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Physically-grounded noise synthesis enables recognition transfer to real-world failures. The augmentation pipeline encodes domain knowledge from radar physics (radar equation, Cramér-Rao bound) and optics (Gaussian blur kernels). Camera blur uses ksize = 2×round(Nlvl)+1 to model focus failures; radar SNR degradation follows SNR' = SNR × 10^(-N/100), directly linking noise level to received power physics. Ghost points sample RCS from empirical distributions, preserving multipath artifact statistics. Core assumption: Synthetic failures generated from first-principles physics approximate real sensor degradation modes closely enough for recognition to transfer. Evidence: Equations (1-2) define degradation functions; equations (8-11) derive SNR∝σ/r⁴ from radar equation; equation (13) applies Cramér-Rao bound for accuracy degradation.

### Mechanism 2
Classification framing with coarse quantization (11 levels) enables stable training despite sparse radar point clouds. The 11-class output discretizes continuous noise (0-100%, step 10%), converting ill-posed regression into tractable classification. U-Net encoder-decoder extracts spatial noise signatures from 900×1600 images via 4-layer compression/expansion; 1D convolutions process radar point cloud features (x,y,z,vx,vy,Vcomp,RCS) before dense classification. Separate camera/radar recognizers allow modality-specific feature extraction before fusion. Core assumption: 10% noise level granularity is sufficient for downstream control decisions; finer quantization would not improve utility. Evidence: Camera network: "U-NET of 7 layers (4 in, 3 out)"; Radar: "three 1D convolutional layers followed by two dense layers"; Camera accuracy 62.19% vs. radar 20.79%—large gap suggests radar sparsity limits feature extraction.

### Mechanism 3
Pre-detection noise recognition enables modular robustness without retraining detection networks. Noise recognition operates on raw sensor data upstream of detection pipelines, producing a noise level token that downstream systems can consume. This decoupling allows "plug-and-play integration with existing detection methods" per the authors. The lightweight architecture (single RTX 3060 training) ensures inference overhead is negligible compared to detection networks. Core assumption: Detection networks have implicit failure thresholds that can be externally monitored and mitigated without architectural changes. Evidence: "plug-and-play integration with existing detection methods and allows for adaptive responses based on detected noise levels"; "our methods takes place before any feature extraction, allowing an easy switch to another detection method".

## Foundational Learning

- **Radar equation and SNR**: Understanding Pr ∝ σ/r⁴ is essential to grasp why RCS-ruled false negatives remove low-RCS points first at higher noise levels, and why ghost point generation samples from empirical RCS distributions. Quick check: If a target at 50m with RCS=10m² has SNR=20dB, what SNR would a target at 100m with RCS=1m² have (assuming same noise power)?

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio in decibels vs. linear scale**: Paper defines Nlvl such that N% noise = N/10 dB decrease. Understanding dB-to-linear conversion (SNR' = SNR × 10^(-N/100)) is required to implement radar degradation correctly. Quick check: A 60% noise level corresponds to how many dB decrease? What is the linear SNR ratio at this level?

- **Cramér-Rao bound for parameter estimation**: Equation (12) states accuracy ∝ 1/√SNR, which justifies why noise-induced shifts in range/angle/velocity increase with noise level. This theoretical grounding distinguishes physics-based synthesis from arbitrary noise injection. Quick check: If SNR decreases by a factor of 4, by what factor does the lower bound on estimation variance increase?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Camera Pipeline: Raw image (900×1600×3) → [Gaussian blur / Exposure kernel / Additive noise] → Degraded image → U-Net (4 encoder + 3 decoder) → Dense(11) → Camera noise level (0-100%)
  Radar Pipeline: Point cloud (N×18 features) → [Ghost points / RCS filtering / Measurement shifts] → Degraded cloud → Conv1D×3 → Dense×2 → Dense(11) → Radar noise level (0-100%)
  Fusion: Camera_level + Radar_level → System noise estimate → Downstream detection/control

- Critical path: Radar noise synthesis is the bottleneck—it requires per-point SNR calculation (σ/r⁴), accuracy re-estimation via Cramér-Rao, and drawing from multiple distributions (position, velocity, RCS). This is O(N) per point per frame vs. O(1) image convolution for cameras. Optimize radar synthesis first if latency is critical.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Quantization granularity: 11 levels (10% steps) simplifies classification but limits precision—authors note levels can exceed 100% for extreme degradation. Consider 21 levels (5% steps) if control system requires finer granularity.
  - Separate vs. joint recognizers: Separate networks achieve 62% (camera) and 21% (radar)—joint training might improve radar via camera features, but loses modularity. Table I shows radar is the weak link; consider transformer cross-attention if modularity can be sacrificed.
  - Training data scale: Only 5 scenes from nuScenes mini dataset used (19680 camera images, 6501 radar clouds). Full nuScenes has 1000 scenes—significant headroom for accuracy improvement.

- Failure signatures:
  - Radar recognition at 20.79% accuracy: Confusion matrix likely shows high off-diagonal mass—radar may only reliably distinguish 0% vs. >60% noise, not intermediate levels. This suggests current architecture is insufficient for radar's sparse, high-dimensional feature space.
  - Night data excluded: Camera training excludes night scenes "as it is considered as an unlabeled adverse scenario"—deployed system may fail at night when noise patterns differ from daytime synthetic augmentation.
  - Sensor-specific noise only: Pipeline models camera/radar failures independently—real-world scenarios may have correlated failures (e.g., rain degrades both simultaneously) not captured by independent Nlvl dials.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate synthesis realism: Apply augmentation pipeline to clean nuScenes frames, run pre-trained detector (e.g., BEVDet, CaR1), plot detection mAP vs. synthesized noise level. If mAP degradation curve matches expected physics (exponential decay with SNR), synthesis is validated.
  2. Architecture search for radar: Replace Conv1D×3 with PointNet-style permutation-invariant layers or graph convolutions treating points as nodes. Evaluate on held-out noise levels to test generalization. Target: >40% radar accuracy.
  3. Joint camera-radar recognizer with cross-attention: Implement late-fusion classifier that takes camera and radar embeddings, applies multi-head attention, outputs fused noise level. Compare against separate recognizers on accuracy and inference time.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the integration of the proposed noise recognition module into a full perception stack lead to statistically significant improvements in object detection or tracking accuracy under degraded conditions? The authors claim the method enables "adaptive responses" and "plug-and-play integration," but experiments only report the classification accuracy of the noise recognizer itself, not the performance of a downstream object detector utilizing this information. A comparative study showing the NDS (NuScenes Detection Score) or AMOTA (Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy) of a baseline detector with and without the noise-recognition adapter on the synthesized noisy data would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Can a model trained exclusively on this synthetic noise pipeline generalize to identify real-world sensor failures caused by physical phenomena (e.g., actual lens moisture or hardware EM interference)? The entire methodology relies on synthetic data augmentation to simulate real-world interferences, without validation against a dataset of actual recorded sensor failures. Testing the pre-trained noise recognition network on a held-out dataset containing labeled real-world sensor degradation (e.g., the DAWN dataset or proprietary failure logs) would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How does the noise recognition accuracy scale when training is expanded beyond the current 5 scenes to the full 1,000 scenes available in the nuScenes dataset? The authors explicitly state in the Conclusion: "we currently limited our training to 5 scenes out of the 1000 provided by nuScenes" as a limitation and avenue for future work. It is unclear if the low radar recognition accuracy (20.79%) is due to the inherent sparsity of the data or simply a lack of training diversity. A training curve analysis showing recognition accuracy convergence when the model is trained on the full dataset versus the current mini-subset would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Radar noise recognition accuracy (20.79%) is substantially lower than camera accuracy (62.19%), suggesting the current architecture is inadequate for processing sparse radar point clouds
- Study excludes night scenes, creating a deployment gap where the system may fail when noise patterns differ from daytime synthetic augmentation
- Independent modeling of camera and radar noise doesn't capture correlated failure modes (e.g., rain affecting both sensors simultaneously) that occur in real-world scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Physically-grounded noise synthesis mechanism is well-supported by radar equation derivations and optical blur modeling. SNR degradation follows established physics (SNR' = SNR × 10^(-N/100)) and the Cramér-Rao bound application is theoretically sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: Classification framing with coarse quantization is practical but may be insufficient for downstream control systems requiring continuous noise estimates. The 11-level discretization trades precision for stability, but adequacy threshold is not validated.
- **Low Confidence**: Modular robustness claim lacks direct evidence. While the paper asserts plug-and-play integration, there's no demonstration that external noise recognition actually improves downstream detection accuracy compared to integrated end-to-end approaches.

## Next Checks
1. Validate synthetic degradation realism: Apply the augmentation pipeline to clean nuScenes frames and measure detection mAP degradation across noise levels. Compare against expected exponential decay with SNR to confirm physics-based synthesis matches real-world behavior.
2. Architecture search for radar recognition: Replace the current Conv1D pipeline with permutation-invariant architectures (PointNet-style or graph convolutions) to better handle radar's sparse, high-dimensional feature space. Target improvement to >40% accuracy.
3. Test correlated sensor failure modes: Extend the synthesis pipeline to model correlated degradations (e.g., rain affecting both camera and radar simultaneously) rather than independent Nlvl parameters. Evaluate recognition accuracy on these realistic multi-sensor failure scenarios.
