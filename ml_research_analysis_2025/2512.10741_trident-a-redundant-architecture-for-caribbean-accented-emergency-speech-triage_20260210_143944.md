# TRIDENT: A Redundant Architecture for Caribbean-Accented Emergency Speech Triage

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10741
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10741
- Reference count: 19
- System provides queue prioritization for Caribbean-accented emergency calls using ASR confidence, content indicators, and bio-acoustic distress signals.

## Executive Summary
TRIDENT addresses emergency call handling disparities for Caribbean English speakers by providing a dispatcher-support system that integrates Caribbean-tuned ASR, entity extraction, and bio-acoustic distress detection. The system reframes low ASR confidence as a valuable prioritization signal, routing calls with high distress and low transcription confidence to immediate human review. TRIDENT enables offline operation and respects clinical authority of established ESI/START protocols. The architecture provides structured inputs to dispatchers rather than making triage decisions, ensuring Caribbean-accented callers receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

## Method Summary
TRIDENT implements a three-layer architecture processing emergency call audio through parallel ASR, NLP entity extraction, and bio-acoustic distress detection. Whisper Medium with LoRA fine-tuning handles transcription, while Llama 3 8B (4-bit quantized) extracts clinical entities and urgency indicators. Librosa-based feature extraction computes distress scores from F0, jitter, RMS energy, and pitch variation. The system prioritizes calls into five queues based on a three-dimensional decision matrix, with offline operation capability for Caribbean settings lacking reliable internet connectivity.

## Key Results
- System architecture validated through component integration, but no end-to-end evaluation on Caribbean emergency calls performed
- Three-dimensional prioritization matrix conceptually sound but thresholds unvalidated (confidence 0.7, distress 0.5, content 50)
- Framework respects clinical authority by supporting rather than replacing ESI/START protocols

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: ASR Failure as Distress Signal
Low transcription confidence combined with elevated bio-acoustic distress indicates a caller in crisis whose speech has shifted toward basilectal registers. Acute stress → impaired executive function → reduced inhibition of dominant language variety → basilectal reversion → ASR confidence degradation, while simultaneously producing elevated F0, pitch instability, and increased vocal energy. Core assumption: Stress-induced dialect reversion is systematic and detectable, not random variation.

### Mechanism 2: Content Extraction Captures Calm Urgency
Semantic entity extraction identifies life-threatening emergencies reported by composed callers without elevated vocal stress. LLM-based content analysis classifies hazard category, life-threat level, vulnerable populations, and escalation status from transcripts—independent of paralinguistic features—enabling appropriate prioritization of urgent content delivered calmly. Core assumption: LLM semantic understanding generalizes sufficiently to Caribbean creole variants despite limited training data.

### Mechanism 3: Three-Dimensional Complementary Coverage
Integration of confidence, content, and concern signals provides robust prioritization by compensating for individual signal blind spots. Parallel processing ensures that calm reporters of urgent events (high content, low concern) and distressed callers with unintelligible speech (low confidence, high concern) both receive appropriate priority. Core assumption: Threshold values (confidence 0.7, distress 0.5, content 50) correctly separate urgent from non-urgent cases.

## Foundational Learning

- **Creole Continuum and Stress-Induced Code-Switching**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that Caribbean speakers shift along the acrolect-mesolect-basilect spectrum under cognitive load explains why ASR fails precisely when accuracy matters most.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a professional who speaks Standard English at work might revert to basilectal speech during an emergency?

- **Bio-Acoustic Stress Markers**
  - Why needed here: The distress detection layer relies on F0, jitter, pitch variation, and energy as correlates of psychological stress; understanding their reliability and sex-dependence is critical for threshold calibration.
  - Quick check question: Why does the system weight F0 coefficient of variation more heavily (0.35) than absolute F0 elevation (0.30)?

- **ESI and START Triage Protocols**
  - Why needed here: TRIDENT explicitly supports—rather than replaces—these clinical frameworks; entity extraction must map to actual decision points.
  - Quick check question: What ESI decision point would extracted entities "not breathing" and "unresponsive" support?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Audio input → Parallel ASR + Bio-acoustic extraction → NLP entity extraction → Queue prioritization engine → Dispatcher interface

- **Critical path:**
  1. Incoming audio → parallel ASR (10s/30s audio) and bio-acoustic extraction (real-time)
  2. Transcript → NLP entity extraction (2–5 tokens/sec)
  3. All three signals → Queue Prioritization Engine → priority assignment
  4. Early exit path: If D > 0.8 AND C < 0.4, route to Q1 at ~12 seconds

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Whisper Medium vs. Large: Madden scaling law suggests data > model size for Caribbean varieties; Medium enables edge deployment
  - 4-bit quantization: Reduces accuracy marginally but required for 8GB RAM constraint
  - Threshold placement: 0.7 confidence threshold unvalidated; conservative placement risks over-flagging
  - Queue priority only: System does not make clinical triage decisions—tradeoff between AI capability and clinical authority preservation

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High false-positive distress: Relaxed female speakers with naturally high F0 may trigger elevated scores
  - Entity extraction errors on creole: LLM may misclassify or hallucinate when transcript quality degrades
  - Queue flooding during surge: If too many calls hit Q1-IMMEDIATE, prioritization becomes meaningless
  - Latency bottleneck: 45–60 second processing precludes real-time use; only viable for queued calls

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Threshold calibration study: Run simulated calls with known ground-truth urgency through the system; measure precision/recall at different confidence/distress/content thresholds; identify optimal operating points for Caribbean populations.
  2. Component ablation: Test system performance with each layer disabled individually; quantify marginal contribution of bio-acoustics vs. content analysis vs. Caribbean-tuned ASR.
  3. Sex-stratified distress validation: Collect F0 baseline and stress-response data from Caribbean male and female speakers; verify that sex-normalized features (CV, jitter) maintain sensitivity without introducing bias.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does TRIDENT's three-dimensional queue prioritization align with expert dispatcher judgment on real Caribbean emergency calls? The authors state in Section 6.1 that the "Validation gap" is the "most critical" limitation, noting the matrix "has not been validated against expert dispatcher judgments." Caribbean emergency speech corpora do not exist; current claims rely on component evaluations rather than end-to-end testing. Evidence to resolve it: End-to-end evaluation comparing system queue assignments against triage decisions made by trained dispatchers on real emergency audio.

### Open Question 2
Do sex-normalized bio-acoustic features effectively mitigate bias given the physiological differences in fundamental frequency (F0) between male and female Caribbean speakers? Section 6.1 notes "residual bias risks remain" because "stressed male speakers with naturally low F0 may not contribute sufficiently" to distress scores, while relaxed female speakers might trigger false positives. Current thresholds are calibrated on general literature rather than Caribbean-specific acoustic data, and validation lacks sex-stratified analysis. Evidence to resolve it: A validation study with sex-stratified analysis on Caribbean emergency calls to calibrate population-appropriate thresholds.

### Open Question 3
What are the optimal precision-recall tradeoffs for the system's multiple heuristic thresholds (confidence 0.7, distress 0.5, content 50)? Section 6.1 identifies "Threshold sensitivity" as a limitation, stating these values "were selected based on literature but have not been rigorously optimized." The paper has not yet performed sensitivity analysis to determine if these cut-offs maximize clinical utility or queue efficiency. Evidence to resolve it: Sensitivity analysis on labeled emergency data to identify threshold values that minimize false negatives for high-priority cases.

## Limitations
- No end-to-end validation on actual Caribbean emergency calls; system remains untested in real-world conditions
- Threshold values (0.7, 0.5, 50) unvalidated and may produce systematic misrouting
- LLM's ability to generalize to Caribbean creole variants unproven without specific fine-tuning

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (ASR Failure as Distress Signal): Low confidence. Theoretical framework established but empirical validation absent.
- Mechanism 2 (Content Extraction for Calm Urgency): Medium confidence. Technically feasible but LLM generalization to creole unproven.
- Mechanism 3 (Three-Dimensional Complementary Coverage): Low confidence. Logically sound but threshold values unvalidated.

## Next Checks

1. **Stress-Induced Dialect Reversion Validation**: Collect audio from Caribbean speakers under controlled stress conditions (simulated emergencies) and measure ASR confidence degradation correlated with sociolinguistic register shifting. Quantify whether basilectal reversion under stress is systematic and detectable by current ASR systems.

2. **Creole Semantic Understanding Benchmark**: Evaluate the LLM entity extraction layer on a labeled corpus of Caribbean emergency calls with ground-truth clinical urgency. Measure precision/recall for critical entities (not breathing, unresponsive, bleeding) in creole contexts versus standard English to quantify dialectal generalization gaps.

3. **Bio-Acoustic Distress Threshold Calibration**: Record F0 baselines and stress responses from Caribbean male and female speakers under controlled conditions. Validate that sex-normalized features (CV, jitter) maintain sensitivity without introducing systematic bias, and optimize distress thresholds for the target population.
