# Probing Syntax in Large Language Models: Successes and Remaining Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03211
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03211
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Structural probes extract syntactic dependencies from LLM representations but accuracy strongly declines with increasing linear distance and syntactic depth between words, while surprisal has little impact; probes outperform baselines but show biases toward short dependencies and interference from nearby nouns.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how well structural probes can extract syntactic dependencies from large language model representations, focusing on the influence of structural and statistical factors. Using controlled sentence stimuli and naturalistic data, the authors find that probe accuracy is strongly affected by linear distance and syntactic depth between words, but less so by word predictability (surprisal). Probes often incorrectly bind both subject and nearby attractor nouns to the verb, mirroring human parsing attraction effects. Despite these limitations, structural probes still outperform baseline models based on raw activations or simple distance heuristics, indicating they do capture some syntactic structure. The work highlights current limitations and provides a benchmark of controlled stimuli for future probe evaluation.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate structural probes on LLM representations using both controlled sentence stimuli and naturalistic data. They systematically vary linear distance and syntactic depth between words to test probe sensitivity to structural factors, and measure the impact of surprisal to assess sensitivity to statistical factors. Probe performance is compared against baselines (raw activations and distance heuristics) and across multiple metrics. The controlled stimuli allow for precise manipulation of dependency properties, while naturalistic data provides ecological validity.

## Key Results
- Probe accuracy strongly declines with increasing linear distance and syntactic depth between words.
- Surprisal (word predictability) has little impact on probe accuracy.
- Probes outperform baselines but show biases toward short dependencies and interference from nearby nouns.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Structural probes can extract syntactic dependencies from LLM representations by learning linear projections of hidden states, but their accuracy is constrained by the distance and depth of dependencies. The probes tend to favor short, shallow dependencies, reflecting a bias in how syntactic information is distributed across layers and tokens. Attraction effects—where nearby nouns interfere with correct dependency assignment—mirror known patterns in human parsing, suggesting probes may capture some human-like processing limitations. The limited influence of surprisal indicates that syntactic structure is not strongly modulated by statistical predictability in these models.

## Foundational Learning
- **Structural Probes**: Linear models that map LLM hidden states to syntactic dependency trees; needed to evaluate how much syntax is encoded in representations; check: probe can recover gold-standard parse trees from annotated data.
- **Linear Distance vs. Syntactic Depth**: Linear distance is the number of tokens between words; syntactic depth is the number of intervening syntactic nodes; needed to disentangle structural from statistical confounds; check: controlled stimuli vary one factor while holding others constant.
- **Surprisal**: Negative log probability of a word given its context; used to measure statistical predictability; needed to test if syntactic processing is modulated by frequency; check: high-surprisal words do not systematically reduce probe accuracy.
- **Attraction Effects**: Misattachment of a verb to a nearby noun instead of its true subject; needed to compare probe errors to human parsing; check: probe errors mirror those found in psycholinguistic studies.
- **Controlled vs. Naturalistic Stimuli**: Controlled stimuli allow systematic manipulation of dependency properties; naturalistic data reflects real-world complexity; needed to balance experimental control with ecological validity; check: probe trends are consistent across both stimulus types.
- **Baseline Models**: Simple models (e.g., raw activations, distance heuristics) used for comparison; needed to establish that probes capture more than trivial patterns; check: probe performance exceeds baseline performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
LLM Hidden States -> Structural Probe (Linear Projection) -> Dependency Predictions -> Evaluation (vs. Gold Parses)

**Critical Path**
1. Extract LLM hidden states for each token in input sentences.
2. Apply linear structural probe to project hidden states into dependency space.
3. Decode predicted dependency arcs from probe outputs.
4. Compare predicted arcs to gold-standard parses (controlled or naturalistic).
5. Compute accuracy metrics as a function of distance, depth, and surprisal.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Linear probes are interpretable and efficient but may miss nonlinear syntactic patterns.
- Controlled stimuli enable systematic evaluation but may not fully capture naturalistic complexity.
- Comparing only a few baselines limits understanding of probe performance relative to more sophisticated alternatives.

**Failure Signatures**
- Probe accuracy drops sharply for long-range or deep dependencies.
- Attraction effects: misbinding of verbs to nearby attractor nouns.
- Limited sensitivity to surprisal, suggesting syntactic structure is not strongly modulated by word predictability.

**First Experiments**
1. Evaluate probe accuracy on controlled stimuli varying only linear distance (holding depth constant).
2. Test probe performance on naturalistic data with varying surprisal values.
3. Compare probe accuracy to a simple distance-based baseline across all stimuli.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Whether probe performance trends hold for morphologically rich languages or diverse treebanks.
- If improved probe architectures (e.g., nonlinear or multi-layer models) could mitigate observed biases.
- Whether the observed effects generalize beyond subject-verb dependencies to other dependency types.

## Limitations
- Findings are based primarily on English stimuli; cross-linguistic robustness is uncertain.
- Controlled stimuli may not fully capture the complexity and noise of naturalistic data.
- Focus on subject-verb dependencies means other dependency types are not examined.

## Confidence
- High: Probe accuracy declines with increasing linear distance and syntactic depth.
- Medium: Surprisal has little impact on probe accuracy.
- Medium: Probes outperform baselines, though only a few simple baselines are compared.

## Next Checks
1. Test probe performance on morphologically rich languages and non-English treebanks to assess cross-linguistic robustness.
2. Evaluate whether nonlinear or multi-layer probe architectures reduce distance and depth biases.
3. Extend the analysis to other dependency types (e.g., object extraction, coordination) to determine if the observed effects generalize beyond subject-verb relations.
