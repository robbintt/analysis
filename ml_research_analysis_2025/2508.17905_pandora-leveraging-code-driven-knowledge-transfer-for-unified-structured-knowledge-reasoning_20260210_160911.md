# Pandora: Leveraging Code-driven Knowledge Transfer for Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.17905
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17905
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces PANDORA, a unified structured knowledge reasoning framework using Python Pandas code as a universal representation

## Executive Summary
PANDORA presents a unified framework for structured knowledge reasoning across tables, databases, and knowledge graphs by leveraging Python Pandas code as a universal representation. The framework converts diverse structured knowledge into a shared BOX format and uses code execution feedback to enable knowledge transfer between different reasoning tasks. This approach breaks down barriers between traditional task-specific reasoning systems and enables cross-task learning capabilities.

The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among unified approaches while competing effectively with task-specific methods. By unifying the representation and reasoning process through code, PANDORA achieves strong effectiveness in cross-task knowledge transfer, as validated across six different benchmarks.

## Method Summary
PANDORA employs a code-driven approach to unify structured knowledge reasoning by converting tables, databases, and knowledge graphs into a shared BOX format that can be processed using Python Pandas operations. The framework leverages the execution feedback from code to enable knowledge transfer across different structured knowledge types. This unified representation allows the system to learn reasoning patterns that transfer between tasks, rather than requiring separate models for each structured knowledge format. The approach represents a shift from traditional task-specific methods toward a more generalized reasoning framework.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unified structured knowledge reasoning methods
- Demonstrates effective cross-task knowledge transfer capabilities across six benchmarks
- Competes favorably with specialized task-specific approaches despite unified architecture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of PANDORA stems from its use of Python Pandas code as a universal language for structured knowledge operations. By representing different knowledge types in a common BOX format, the framework enables code execution to serve as both the reasoning mechanism and the knowledge transfer channel. The feedback from code execution provides natural supervision signals that guide learning across tasks, while the Pandas API offers a rich set of operations that can express complex reasoning patterns across diverse structured data formats.

## Foundational Learning
- Structured knowledge formats (tables, databases, knowledge graphs) - Understanding these formats is crucial as PANDORA unifies reasoning across all three
- Python Pandas operations - The framework relies on Pandas as a universal representation language for structured data manipulation
- Knowledge transfer mechanisms - Essential for understanding how reasoning patterns learned on one task can benefit others
- Code execution feedback - Critical for understanding how PANDORA uses execution results to guide learning
- Unified reasoning frameworks - Provides context for why a unified approach offers advantages over task-specific methods

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Knowledge Source -> BOX Format Converter -> Pandas Code Generator -> Code Execution Engine -> Feedback Processor -> Reasoning Output

**Critical Path:**
BOX Format Conversion → Pandas Code Generation → Code Execution → Feedback Processing → Knowledge Transfer

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Unified representation vs. format-specific optimization
- Code-driven reasoning vs. direct neural approaches
- Cross-task transfer benefits vs. potential loss of task-specific specialization

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor BOX format conversion leading to incorrect code generation
- Execution failures due to unsupported operations in target knowledge format
- Limited transfer when reasoning patterns are too domain-specific

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Verify BOX format conversion accuracy for each structured knowledge type
2. Test Pandas code generation for basic operations across different formats
3. Validate code execution feedback quality and its impact on reasoning performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to English-language benchmarks with specific structured data types
- Reliance on Python Pandas may not capture all nuances of different structured knowledge types
- Potential performance limitations on highly specialized domains or non-tabular data structures

## Confidence

**Major Claim Clusters Confidence:**
- Claims about PANDORA's effectiveness on unified reasoning tasks: High confidence
- Claims about cross-task knowledge transfer capabilities: Medium confidence
- Claims about state-of-the-art performance relative to unified methods: High confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments with non-English structured knowledge sources to validate cross-lingual capabilities and identify potential language-specific limitations
2. Perform systematic ablation studies on the BOX format conversion process to determine the impact of different representation choices on reasoning performance
3. Test PANDORA's performance on emerging structured knowledge types not covered in the current benchmarks, such as temporal knowledge graphs or streaming data tables
