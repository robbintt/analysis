# A High-accuracy Calibration Method of Transient TSEPs for Power Semiconductor Devices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.05005
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05005
- Reference count: 0
- Proposed method achieves 30% reduction in mean absolute error for junction temperature monitoring in SiC MOSFETs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a high-accuracy calibration method for transient thermal sensitive electrical parameters (TSEPs) to improve junction temperature monitoring in power semiconductor devices. The method addresses three key sources of calibration error: temperature differences between the chip and heating plate during dual pulse tests, the influence of stray parameters and coupled parameters like bus voltage, and random measurement errors following a logarithmic Gaussian distribution. Experimental validation using threshold voltage as a TSEP example on SiC MOSFETs demonstrates a 30% reduction in mean absolute error compared to conventional methods, without additional hardware costs. The method is generalizable to various transient TSEPs across different power device types.

## Method Summary
The method employs a three-pronged approach: temperature compensation based on thermal analysis to correct for chip-to-plate temperature differences during dual pulse tests, identification of coupled parameters through stray parameter analysis (particularly bus voltage effects), and repeated measurements to characterize random measurement errors following a logarithmic Gaussian distribution. The calibration process involves performing dual pulse tests with 50 repeated measurements per condition, applying temperature compensation using thermal resistance calculations, and training a fully-connected neural network (26-neuron hidden layer with ReLU activation) using Bayesian regularization to model the relationship between threshold voltage, bus voltage, and junction temperature.

## Key Results
- 30% reduction in mean absolute error compared to conventional calibration methods
- Method validated on SiC MOSFET C2M0080120D using threshold voltage as TSEP example
- Generalization capability demonstrated across different power device types
- No additional hardware costs required for implementation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Analytical compensation for load-current-induced temperature rise improves accuracy of ground-truth temperature labels during calibration.
- **Mechanism**: Calculates temperature difference between device junction and heating plate by solving for power loss and applying thermal resistance, then adds this offset to plate set-point to determine true junction temperature.
- **Core assumption**: Thermal resistance R_th,jp and linearized relationship between on-state resistance R_ON and temperature remain stable during calibration.
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions temperature compensation strategy; Section III.B provides equations (5)-(7) defining thermal analysis.
- **Break condition**: If device degrades significantly (e.g., solder fatigue), R_th,jp may drift, rendering static compensation factor invalid.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Including bus voltage as input feature accounts for stray parameter coupling that distorts threshold voltage measurement.
- **Mechanism**: High bus voltages increase di/dt during switching via parasitic capacitances, reducing detection time of threshold voltage and resulting in lower measured V_TH. Neural Network models this non-linear interaction.
- **Core assumption**: Stray inductances and capacitances of test setup are constant, and observed variation is primarily due to applied V_bus.
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions influence of stray parameters and coupled parameters like bus voltage; Section III.C analyzes Eq (14) and Fig. 15 demonstrating negative correlation.
- **Break condition**: If power loop stray parameters change (e.g., re-probing or fixture modification), trained NN model will fail to generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Repeated measurements allow handling of random errors following Logarithmic Gaussian Distribution, which simple averaging cannot correct.
- **Mechanism**: Transient measurement errors follow asymmetric LGD, implying hidden variable. Method uses repeated sampling (k=50) to characterize distribution rather than relying on single data point.
- **Core assumption**: Random error distribution is stationary during calibration measurement burst and intrinsic to transient measurement process.
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions random measurement errors following logarithmic Gaussian distribution; Section III.D states LGD function used to fit errors.
- **Break condition**: If external noise sources (e.g., EMI) with different statistical properties dominate, LGD assumption may break down.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Dual Pulse Test (DPT)
  - **Why needed here**: Standard experimental setup used to generate thermal and electrical data for calibration.
  - **Quick check question**: Why is second pulse in DPT used for measuring TSEP rather than first?

- **Concept**: Thermal Sensitive Electrical Parameters (TSEPs)
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding that parameters like V_TH are proxies for temperature is core principle being calibrated.
  - **Quick check question**: Does threshold voltage (V_TH) of SiC MOSFET typically increase or decrease as junction temperature rises?

- **Concept**: Thermal Resistance (R_th)
  - **Why needed here**: Physical property that bridges conversion of electrical power loss into temperature offset for compensation.
  - **Quick check question**: If load current I_L doubles, by what factor does temperature difference ΔT_j-p increase, assuming constant resistance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Measured TSEP (V_TH), Operating Parameters (V_bus, I_L), Heating Plate Temp (T_plate) -> Temp Compensation Module (calculates ΔT) -> Feature Engineering (repeated sampling) -> Fully-connected Neural Network (1 hidden layer, 26 neurons, ReLU) -> Compensated Junction Temperature (T_j)

- **Critical path**: 1) Perform Dual Pulse Test with repeated measures (k=50) per condition. 2) Execute Temperature Compensation logic to correct T_plate labels. 3) Train Neural Network using corrected T_j labels and coupled inputs (V_TH, V_bus).

- **Design tradeoffs**: Calibration Time vs. Accuracy - collecting 50 samples per point improves noise handling but drastically increases calibration duration. Model Complexity - Neural Network captures non-linear V_bus coupling but introduces overfitting risks addressed only by Bayesian regularization.

- **Failure signatures**: Systematic Offset - monitoring error scales with load current (I_L), indicating Temperature Compensation failure. Voltage Dependency - monitoring error shifts when V_bus changes, indicating failure to account for coupled parameters. High Variance - predictions fluctuate wildly, suggesting insufficient repeated measures or changing noise distributions.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Validate TC Strategy - run DPT at fixed current (6A) and compare estimated T_j with/without Temperature Compensation formula against IR camera reference. 2) Quantify Coupling Effect - fix T_j and I_L, sweep V_bus (200V to 300V), and plot measured V_TH to confirm negative correlation. 3) End-to-End Verification - deploy trained NN on DC-DC converter operating at 100kHz and calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduction against conventional linear regression baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Static thermal resistance assumption may break down if device degrades (e.g., solder fatigue changes R_th,jp)
- V_bus coupling model assumes constant stray parameters; fixture modifications could invalidate trained neural network
- Log-Gaussian Distribution assumption for random errors may not hold if external noise sources dominate

## Confidence
- Temperature Compensation Mechanism: Medium - Well-defined equations but dependent on accurate R_th,jp characterization
- Coupled Parameters Modeling: Medium - Demonstrates correlation but assumes stable test setup parameters
- Random Error Handling: Low - Novel statistical approach with limited supporting evidence in literature

## Next Checks
1. Validate Temperature Compensation: Compare predicted ΔT_j-p against IR camera measurements during calibration at varying load currents
2. Quantify V_bus Coupling: Fix Tj and iL, sweep V_bus from 200V to 300V, and plot measured V_TH to confirm negative correlation
3. End-to-End Verification: Deploy trained NN on 100kHz DC-DC converter and calculate MAE reduction versus conventional linear regression baseline using IR camera reference
