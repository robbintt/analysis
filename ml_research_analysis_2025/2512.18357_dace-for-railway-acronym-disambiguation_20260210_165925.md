# DACE For Railway Acronym Disambiguation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18357
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18357

- Primary result: DACE achieved 0.9069 F1 score, ranking first in TextMine'26 French railway acronym disambiguation competition

## Executive Summary
This paper presents DACE, a framework for acronym disambiguation in specialized railway documentation that combines dynamic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, contextual example selection, and ensemble aggregation of large language models. The system adapts prompt complexity based on acronym ambiguity, grounds predictions with external domain knowledge from railway glossaries, selects balanced in-context examples, and aggregates outputs from multiple models to improve stability. Evaluated on the TextMine'26 French railway dataset, DACE achieved an F1 score of 0.9069, ranking first in the competition. The approach effectively handles low-resource and unseen acronyms while reducing hallucinations, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness across both public and private test sets.

## Method Summary
DACE employs a four-component framework: Dynamic Prompting switches between Template A (few-shot for seen acronyms) and Template B (strict zero-shot for unseen with ambiguous candidates); Retrieval Augmented Generation grounds predictions using a custom Knowledge Base of railway glossaries and documentation; Contextual Selection uses BM25 retrieval with balanced sampling to provide few-shot examples; and Ensemble Aggregation combines predictions from Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro using cascaded voting logic with competence fallback. The system processes inputs by classifying acronym ambiguity, selecting appropriate templates and retrieval strategies, constructing prompts with KB knowledge, and aggregating ensemble predictions through majority voting with tie-breaking.

## Key Results
- Achieved 0.9069 F1 score on private TextMine'26 test set, ranking first in competition
- Dynamic Prompting contributed most significantly, raising private F1 to 0.8940
- Ensemble aggregation improved stability by correcting idiosyncratic hallucinations across models
- System effectively handles low-resource scenarios and reduces hallucination through KB grounding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dynamic Prompting with Ambiguity-Conditioned Template Switching
The system uses a switching function that selects between two templates: Template A (standard few-shot) for seen acronyms with sufficient training examples, and Template B (strict disambiguation with explicit reasoning steps) for unseen acronyms with high morphological overlap among candidates. Template B enforces definition matching and favors technically specific expansions. This addresses the limitation of static prompts that cannot simultaneously handle frequency-biased errors from unbalanced few-shot demonstrations and hallucinations on unseen terms.

### Mechanism 2: Domain Knowledge Grounding via Retrieval Augmented Generation
A hybrid retrieval mechanism queries a curated Knowledge Base (aggregated from public railway glossaries, SNCF documentation, and training set expansions) to retrieve candidate long forms, their definitions, and usage examples. This explicit grounding replaces reliance on parametric memory, which may lack long-tail domain knowledge. By conditioning the model on explicit, domain-authenticated knowledge rather than relying solely on its parametric memory, predictions remain aligned with technical semantics.

### Mechanism 3: Ensemble Aggregation with Cascaded Voting Logic
The ensemble broadcasts the same prompt to multiple models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 4.1 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro), collects prediction sets, and applies cascaded logic: restrict voting to high-performing, complementary models; majority vote with tie-breaking via designated model; fallback to single best model if consensus is low. This approach corrects idiosyncratic hallucinations and mitigates stochastic variance by assuming individual LLMs exhibit different error patterns that can be cancelled out through aggregation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: In-Context Learning**
  - Why needed here: DACE relies on few-shot prompting without fine-tuning; understanding how examples condition LLM behavior is essential
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why semantically similar demonstrations improve generalization over random examples?

- **Concept: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: External knowledge injection is a core component; you must understand retrieval indexing and knowledge grounding
  - Quick check question: How does RAG differ from simply prepending static knowledge to a prompt?

- **Concept: Ensemble Learning and Error Diversity**
  - Why needed here: The aggregation module assumes models make different errors; understanding diversity metrics is critical for subset selection
  - Quick check question: Why does majority voting fail when models have correlated errors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Ambiguity Classifier -> Template Selector -> (BM25 Retriever OR zero-shot) -> Knowledge Base lookup -> Prompt Builder -> Ensemble Orchestrator -> Cascaded voting -> Final prediction

- **Critical path:**
  Input text → Ambiguity Classifier → (Template A + BM25 retrieval) OR (Template B + zero-shot) → KB lookup → Prompt construction → Ensemble inference → Cascaded voting → Final prediction

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Template B reduces hallucinations but may underperform on standard cases where context is key (Template B alone scored 0.8368 vs. Template A's 0.8571)
  - Larger ensembles increase robustness but also latency and cost
  - Balanced sampling prevents frequency bias but may exclude highly similar useful examples

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High disagreement among ensemble members → triggers fallback; indicates ambiguous context or KB gaps
  - Template B misfiring on seen acronyms with high overlap → may over-constrain and miss correct expansion
  - Zero-shot on unseen acronyms with no KB coverage → likely hallucination

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline validation: Run single-model inference with Template A only on held-out data; measure F1 and identify failure modes (unseen acronyms, high-overlap candidates)
  2. Ablation by component: Disable one module at a time (RAG, dynamic switching, ensemble) to quantify each contribution; compare to Table 2 results
  3. KB coverage analysis: Log KB lookup hit/miss rates; correlate misses with error instances to identify glossary expansion priorities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the DACE framework be effectively extended to multilingual scenarios where training resources are scarce?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly states future research will focus on "extending DACE to multilingual scenarios," noting that prior work showed LLMs suffer degradation in non-English languages
- Why unresolved: The current study evaluated the framework exclusively on French railway documentation; it is unknown if the dynamic prompting and retrieval mechanisms transfer to languages with different morphological structures or less available technical glossaries
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of DACE on multilingual acronym disambiguation benchmarks (e.g., comparing performance on French vs. German vs. Portuguese technical corpora)

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does integrating structured knowledge graphs provide superior grounding compared to the current textual glossary approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "integrating structured knowledge graphs as an additional retrieval source" as a specific direction for future research
- Why unresolved: The current RAG module relies on aggregated text glossaries and documentation; the potential performance gain from explicit relational reasoning over structured graphs remains unquantified
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing the current text-based retrieval against a knowledge-graph-augmented retrieval system on the same test set

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can automatic prompt optimization algorithms outperform the manually designed templates (Template A vs. Template B) used in the study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion proposes a "systematic exploration of automatic prompt optimization" as a promising direction, acknowledging the current prompts are manually engineered
- Why unresolved: The framework currently relies on a hand-crafted switching function based on heuristics (Jaccard similarity); it is uncertain if automated prompt tuning could find more optimal instruction strategies
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments where prompts are generated/tuned automatically (e.g., using OPRO or GRPC) against the static templates used in the paper

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the DACE wrapper enable smaller, open-source models to match the performance of proprietary models like Claude or Gemini?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes in Related Work that smaller models like LLaMA 2 "exhibited even lower stability" on disambiguation tasks, yet the DACE ensemble only utilizes high-end proprietary models
- Why unresolved: While DACE improves robustness, it was tested only on strong commercial LLMs; it remains unclear if the framework's components (RAG, Dynamic Prompting) are sufficient to close the capability gap for smaller, cost-effective models in low-resource industrial settings
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the full DACE pipeline using open-source models (e.g., LLaMA 3, Mistral) to see if the framework elevates their F1 scores to levels comparable with the reported Claude/Gemini baseline

## Limitations

- Exact threshold values for Template B activation and specific ensemble voting configuration are not disclosed, limiting reproducibility
- KB construction relies on assumptions about external glossary sources that may not generalize beyond French railway documentation
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on French railway terminology, raising questions about cross-domain generalization
- System's performance on truly unseen acronyms remains partially untested since the private test set may still contain some training-seen examples

## Confidence

**High Confidence** in claims regarding: (1) DACE's overall effectiveness in achieving first-place ranking (0.9069 F1); (2) The contribution of Dynamic Prompting and RAG grounding to performance gains (evidenced by systematic ablation results in Table 2); (3) The general architecture's ability to reduce hallucinations through external knowledge grounding.

**Medium Confidence** in claims about: (1) The specific threshold values for template switching; (2) The exact ensemble voting logic and subset selection; (3) The generalizability of results to non-railway or non-French domains.

**Low Confidence** in claims regarding: (1) The absolute necessity of all four components working in concert (could some be redundant?); (2) The scalability of KB construction to other specialized domains; (3) The robustness against truly novel acronyms with no training or KB support.

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the Jaccard similarity threshold τ for Template B activation and measure the impact on F1 score across different acronym ambiguity levels to identify optimal operating points.

2. **KB Coverage Gap Analysis**: Quantify the proportion of test acronyms that lack KB coverage, then artificially remove KB support for a random subset of seen acronyms to measure performance degradation and hallucination rates.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply DACE to an English acronym disambiguation dataset (e.g., scientific literature) with minimal KB adaptation to assess performance drop and identify which components are most domain-dependent.
