# The Impact of Audio Watermarking on Audio Anti-Spoofing Countermeasures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20736
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20736
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Audio watermarking degrades anti-spoofing performance with increasing watermark density, addressed by KPWL framework which adapts models to watermark-induced domain shifts while preserving original-domain spoofing detection capability

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the previously unexplored vulnerability of audio anti-spoofing systems to audio watermarking techniques. The research reveals that as watermark density increases, Equal Error Rates (EER) in anti-spoofing performance degrade significantly. To address this critical security gap, the authors construct watermark-augmented datasets and propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework, which enables models to maintain spoofing detection accuracy even when watermarked audio is present.

The proposed KPWL framework represents a significant advancement in robust anti-spoofing technology by effectively handling the domain shift introduced by watermarking while preserving the model's original detection capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that KPWL consistently outperforms baseline approaches on watermarked evaluation sets without sacrificing clean-data accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

## Method Summary
The authors construct watermark-augmented datasets by embedding watermarks at various densities into existing audio anti-spoofing datasets. They then propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework, which uses domain adaptation techniques to help anti-spoofing models learn to distinguish between genuine and spoofed audio even when watermarks are present. The framework preserves knowledge from the original domain while adapting to the watermark-induced domain shift, allowing the model to maintain performance across both clean and watermarked audio conditions.

## Key Results
- Equal Error Rates increase systematically with higher watermark density
- KPWL framework consistently outperforms baseline approaches on watermarked evaluation sets
- KPWL preserves original-domain spoofing detection capability without sacrificing clean-data accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The KPWL framework works by explicitly modeling the domain shift introduced by audio watermarking. Rather than treating watermarking as noise to be ignored, the framework learns to leverage watermark features as additional discriminative information while maintaining the core anti-spoofing detection capability. This knowledge-preserving approach ensures that the model doesn't lose its ability to detect spoofing attacks in clean audio while gaining robustness to watermarked conditions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Audio watermarking techniques**: Methods for embedding imperceptible information into audio signals - needed to understand the attack vector against anti-spoofing systems
- **Domain adaptation**: Machine learning approaches for handling distribution shifts between training and test data - critical for understanding how KPWL handles watermark-induced changes
- **Equal Error Rate (EER)**: Standard metric for evaluating binary classification systems at the operating point where false acceptance equals false rejection rates - essential for measuring anti-spoofing performance
- **White-box vs black-box attacks**: Different threat models based on attacker's knowledge of the system - important for understanding the scope of current evaluation
- **Knowledge preservation in transfer learning**: Techniques for maintaining performance on source domains while adapting to target domains - central to KPWL's effectiveness

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Data Preparation -> Watermark Embedding -> KPWL Framework -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**
Original dataset → Watermark augmentation → KPWL adaptation → EER evaluation on watermarked test sets

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Complexity vs robustness: KPWL adds computational overhead but significantly improves watermark resilience
- Domain preservation vs adaptation: Framework must balance maintaining original detection capability while adapting to watermarked audio
- Watermark density vs detection accuracy: Higher watermark density provides better protection but increases computational cost

**Failure Signatures**
- Degradation in EER as watermark density increases beyond optimal thresholds
- Loss of original-domain spoofing detection capability if knowledge preservation is insufficient
- Computational bottlenecks during real-time inference with high watermark densities

**3 First Experiments**
1. Baseline EER measurement on clean audio without watermarking
2. EER measurement across increasing watermark densities to establish degradation curve
3. KPWL performance comparison against baseline on watermarked evaluation sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses exclusively on white-box attacks, leaving black-box attack scenarios unexplored
- Evaluation limited to specific audio watermarking techniques, potentially missing variations with alternative algorithms
- KPWL framework's generalization to unseen spoofing attacks beyond trained dataset unverified
- Computational overhead during real-time inference not quantified

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core finding that watermark density directly correlates with increased EER in anti-spoofing systems is well-supported by empirical evidence

**Medium Confidence**: KPWL framework demonstrates consistent performance improvements, though primarily validated on constructed watermark-augmented datasets

**Medium Confidence**: Claim that KPWL preserves original-domain spoofing detection capability is supported but could benefit from larger-scale real-world validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate KPWL framework performance against black-box watermarking attacks to assess robustness beyond white-box scenarios
2. Test framework's generalization capability across diverse, unseen spoofing attack types not present in original training data
3. Conduct real-world deployment trials to measure computational overhead and performance under practical operating conditions with varying audio quality and environmental factors
