# The Script is All You Need: An Agentic Framework for Long-Horizon Dialogue-to-Cinematic Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.17737
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17737
- **Reference count**: 24
- **Primary result**: Agentic framework significantly improves script faithfulness (+0.4 points) and Visual-Script Alignment (7+ points gain) over baseline video models

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of generating long-form, coherent cinematic videos from sparse dialogue by introducing an agentic framework centered on script generation. The system bridges the semantic gap between high-level narrative concepts and low-level video synthesis through a two-stage pipeline: first generating detailed cinematic scripts from dialogue using a fine-tuned language model, then orchestrating state-of-the-art video models with a cross-scene continuous generation strategy. The framework demonstrates significant improvements in both script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across multiple video generation models, with human evaluation confirming superior creative quality of generated scripts. Analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off in current models between visual spectacle and strict script adherence.

## Method Summary
The framework employs three specialized agents: ScripterAgent converts dialogue into structured cinematic scripts through a two-stage training process (SFT + GRPO alignment), DirectorAgent orchestrates video model invocation using frame-anchoring for continuity across scenes, and CriticAgent evaluates outputs using an LLM-based scoring system. The ScripterAgent fine-tunes Qwen-Omni-7B on ScriptBench dataset with a hybrid reward combining structural checks and human preference modeling. DirectorAgent implements shot-based segmentation with 10-second duration limits and continuous generation across scene boundaries. The system is evaluated using multiple metrics including Script Faithfulness, Visual-Script Alignment (VSA), and human ratings across seven dimensions.

## Key Results
- Script Faithfulness scores improve by +0.4 points over baseline models
- VSA scores show gains exceeding 7 points across all tested video models
- Human evaluation confirms superior creative quality of generated scripts
- Different video models exhibit trade-offs between visual appeal and script adherence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by creating a structured intermediate representation (cinematic script) that bridges the semantic gap between sparse dialogue and visual generation. The ScripterAgent's two-stage training (SFT for format learning, GRPO for alignment with expert preferences) produces scripts that are both structurally valid and narratively coherent. The DirectorAgent's frame-anchoring mechanism ensures visual continuity across scene boundaries by conditioning each new scene on the final frame of the previous one. This approach allows the system to leverage existing video models' strengths while providing the structured guidance needed for long-form coherence. The CriticAgent provides consistent evaluation across multiple dimensions, enabling systematic improvement of the pipeline.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Diffusion Models for Video Synthesis**
  - Why needed here: The DirectorAgent orchestrates existing SOTA video models (likely diffusion-based) to generate final output, requiring understanding of their principles and conditioning mechanisms
  - Quick check question: Can you explain, in simple terms, how a diffusion model generates a video from noise and a text prompt?

- **Concept: LLM Fine-Tuning and Alignment (SFT & RLHF/GRPO)**
  - Why needed here: The ScripterAgent is a Qwen-Omni-7B model fine-tuned in two stages, making understanding SFT and reinforcement learning objectives crucial
  - Quick check question: What is the primary difference in objective between SFT and a reinforcement learning-based alignment stage like GRPO?

- **Concept: Multimodal Inputs and Contextual Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The ScripterAgent processes trimodal context (dialogue, audio, character positions) to infer narrative context and emotional intent
  - Quick check question: How can audio data (tone, pacing) provide information that text dialogue alone might miss, and how would a model incorporate this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: ScriptBench dataset -> ScripterAgent (SFT + GRPO) -> DirectorAgent (frame-anchoring + shot segmentation) -> Video Model -> CriticAgent evaluation

- **Critical path**: The quality of ScripterAgent's output is the system's linchpin. If generated scripts are structurally invalid or narratively incoherent, the DirectorAgent and video models cannot produce coherent videos regardless of their capabilities. The RL alignment stage is the most critical training step.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Script Detail vs. Video Model Fidelity**: Highly detailed scripts increase faithful generation chances but risk overwhelming the video model's context window
  - **Automation vs. Control**: The framework is fully automated, removing human-in-the-loop for creative decisions, mitigated by RL alignment with expert preferences
  - **Frame-Anchoring vs. Free Generation**: Frame-anchoring ensures continuity but may constrain the video model's ability to generate novel transitions

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Identity Drift**: Characters changing appearance between shots indicates frame-anchoring failure or insufficient video model conditioning
  - **Narrative Incoherence**: Visually impressive but story-incoherent videos suggest ScripterAgent logical plan failures or DirectorAgent segmentation errors
  - **Teleportation/Physical Irrationality**: Impossible character/object movements indicating positional consistency check failures

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **ScripterAgent Ablation**: Train and evaluate a ScripterAgent with only SFT stage, compare against full model (SFT + GRPO) using AI and human rating metrics to validate RL alignment contribution
  2. **Frame-Anchoring Stress Test**: Generate video with complex scene transition (indoor to outdoor), compare visual consistency and character fidelity with frame-anchoring on vs. off
  3. **Video Model Substitution**: Use same ScripterAgent-generated script but swap underlying video model (Sora2-Pro vs HYVideo1.5), compare VSA scores to understand model adherence differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can the framework be extended to achieve precise lip synchronization and fine-grained action alignment in generated videos?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion states, "Future research could focus on enhancing fine-grained control, such as precise lip synchronization."
- **Why unresolved**: The DirectorAgent section notes that despite continuity improvements, "imperfect lip synchronization and residual misalignment of fine-grained actions remain."
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Successful integration of lip-sync loss function or auxiliary model yielding high alignment scores (e.g., LSE-C/D) without degrading visual fidelity or Script Faithfulness.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can video generation models be optimized to simultaneously excel at both visual spectacle and strict script adherence?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The analysis reveals a "fundamental trade-off in current SOTA models between visual spectacle and strict script adherence," with different models excelling at opposing objectives
- **Why unresolved**: Current architectures optimize for one dimension at expense of other (Sora2-Pro prioritizes visual appeal, HYVideo1.5 prioritizes narrative integrity)
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A single model achieving state-of-the-art scores in both Visual Appeal and Script Faithfulness, or mechanism to dynamically weight these objectives during generation.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can the system adapt to dynamically generate content in diverse cinematic styles beyond the training data domain?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The Conclusion identifies "developing adaptive models that can dynamically generate content in diverse cinematic styles" as key future research area
- **Why unresolved**: ScripterAgent trained on ScriptBench with expert-guided templates and high-fidelity cutscenes, potentially limiting generalization to abstract or non-standard film styles
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Demonstration of framework successfully generating videos in varied genres (noir, surrealism) with distinct stylistic adherence, evaluated via human preference studies.

## Limitations
- **Dataset Availability**: Core ScriptBench dataset not publicly released, making independent verification impossible
- **Commercial Model Access**: Claims of superiority over Sora2-Pro and Veo3.1 cannot be independently validated due to lack of access
- **Framework Specificity**: Approach tightly coupled to specific video models and annotation pipelines, generalizability unclear

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Technical feasibility of three-agent architecture well-established, SFT+GRPO training pipeline standard practice
- **Medium Confidence**: Reported improvements in script faithfulness (+0.4 points) and VSA scores (7+ points) plausible but require independent verification
- **Low Confidence**: Claims of superiority over commercial models cannot be independently validated due to access limitations

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset Replication Test**: Attempt to replicate ScriptBench dataset construction using publicly available cinematic dialogue clips and described annotation pipeline, compare generated scripts against human-written references
2. **Framework Substitution Experiment**: Replace DirectorAgent's video model with publicly accessible alternative (Wan2.5 or HYVideo1.5) while keeping ScripterAgent output constant, measure whether performance improvements persist
3. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Apply trained ScripterAgent to dialogue from different domain (podcast transcripts or theatrical plays), evaluate whether generated scripts maintain structural validity and narrative coherence
