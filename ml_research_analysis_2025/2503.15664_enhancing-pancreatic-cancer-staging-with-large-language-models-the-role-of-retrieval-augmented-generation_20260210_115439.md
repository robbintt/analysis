# Enhancing Pancreatic Cancer Staging with Large Language Models: The Role of Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.15664
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15664
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: RAG-enabled LLM (NotebookLM) achieved 70% staging accuracy vs 35-38% for baseline models

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates whether retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can enhance large language models' performance in pancreatic cancer staging. Using Japan's pancreatic cancer staging guidelines as external knowledge, researchers compared NotebookLM (an RAG-enabled model) against Gemini 2.0 Flash with and without retrieval-augmented knowledge (REK). Across 100 fictional clinical cases, NotebookLM demonstrated significantly higher accuracy in both cancer staging (70% vs 35-38%) and TNM classification (80% vs 50-55%). The study also found that NotebookLM accurately retrieved and presented REK excerpts with 92% accuracy, providing transparency for clinical decision-making.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated two LLMs using Japan's pancreatic cancer staging guidelines as reliable external knowledge. Researchers created 100 fictional clinical cases and assessed staging accuracy across three model configurations: NotebookLM (RAG-enabled), Gemini 2.0 Flash with REK, and Gemini 2.0 Flash without REK. The primary metrics included cancer staging accuracy, TNM classification accuracy, and the accuracy of REK excerpt retrieval and presentation. All models were tested under identical conditions using the same case set and evaluation criteria.

## Key Results
- NotebookLM achieved 70% cancer staging accuracy compared to 38% and 35% for Gemini 2.0 Flash with and without REK
- TNM classification accuracy was 80% for NotebookLM versus 55% and 50% for the baseline models
- REK excerpt retrieval and presentation accuracy was 92% for NotebookLM

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RAG improves LLM performance by providing access to reliable, up-to-date medical guidelines during inference. The retrieval component fetches relevant excerpts from authoritative staging guidelines, which the generation component then uses to inform its staging decisions. This approach addresses the knowledge cutoff limitation of standard LLMs while maintaining the reasoning capabilities of the base model. The transparency of showing retrieved sources also builds trust with clinical users.

## Foundational Learning
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**: Combines information retrieval with text generation to provide LLMs with current external knowledge
  - Why needed: Standard LLMs have knowledge cutoffs and cannot access real-time medical guidelines
  - Quick check: Verify the retrieval component successfully fetches relevant guideline excerpts
- **Pancreatic cancer staging systems**: Classification frameworks (like TNM) that determine cancer progression and treatment planning
  - Why needed: Accurate staging directly impacts treatment decisions and patient outcomes
  - Quick check: Confirm the staging guidelines used are the current clinical standard
- **Clinical decision support systems**: AI tools designed to assist rather than replace medical professionals
  - Why needed: Ensures the technology complements physician expertise while maintaining safety
  - Quick check: Validate that model outputs are presented as recommendations with source attribution

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Clinical cases → RAG retriever → Knowledge base (staging guidelines) → LLM → Staging classification → REK excerpt presentation
- **Critical path**: Case input → Guideline retrieval → Context integration → Staging decision → Source attribution
- **Design tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. latency (retrieval adds processing time), transparency vs. information overload (showing all sources vs. key excerpts)
- **Failure signatures**: Incorrect staging from outdated guidelines, hallucination when retrieval fails, over-reliance on retrieved context
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Test retrieval accuracy with different query formulations, 2) Compare staging accuracy using full vs. summarized guidelines, 3) Evaluate performance across different cancer types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based entirely on fictional clinical cases rather than real patient data
- Sample size of 100 cases may not capture full clinical variability
- Comparison limited to single RAG model against one baseline without exploring alternative architectures

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: RAG-enabled LLMs achieve significantly higher staging accuracy (70%) compared to baseline models (35-38%)
- **Medium confidence**: RAG improves transparency through accurate retrieval and presentation of external guidelines (92% accuracy)
- **Medium confidence**: The staging accuracy improvements translate to meaningful clinical utility, though this requires validation with real clinical data

## Next Checks
1. Validate findings using real patient pathology reports and clinical records from multiple institutions to assess performance in authentic clinical settings
2. Conduct prospective clinical studies comparing RAG-augmented LLM recommendations with expert oncologist staging decisions in real-time
3. Test the approach across different cancer types and staging systems to evaluate generalizability beyond pancreatic cancer
