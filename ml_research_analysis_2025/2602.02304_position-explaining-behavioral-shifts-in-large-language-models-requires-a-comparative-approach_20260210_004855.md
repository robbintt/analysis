# Position: Explaining Behavioral Shifts in Large Language Models Requires a Comparative Approach

## Quick Facts

- Introduces ∆-XAI framework for explaining behavioral shifts in LLMs through comparative approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that traditional Explainable AI (XAI) methods are inadequate for explaining behavioral shifts in large language models, which occur during scaling, fine-tuning, or other training interventions. The authors introduce ∆-XAI (Comparative Explainable AI) as a new framework that emphasizes comparing model behavior across different checkpoints rather than explaining individual model instances in isolation. The framework articulates ten desiderata for comparative explainers and maps six prominent families of explainers to these requirements. An illustrative experiment demonstrates how ∆-XAI can diagnose emergent misalignment in medical advice following fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces ∆-XAI as a conceptual framework that shifts focus from explaining individual model instances to comparing behavioral changes across model checkpoints. The framework establishes ten desiderata for comparative explainers, organized into four categories: comparability (e.g., commensurability, scalability), validity (e.g., soundness, sensitivity), actionability (e.g., diagnosis, steering), and monitoring (e.g., temporal coherence, distribution awareness). The authors then map six families of existing explainers—feature attribution, probing, representation similarity, concept discovery, mechanistic interventions, and data attribution—to these desiderata. The illustrative experiment applies this framework to a hypothetical scenario where fine-tuning on medical literature causes a language model to provide overconfident and potentially harmful advice.

## Key Results
- Proposes ten desiderata for comparative explainers that address the unique challenges of explaining behavioral shifts
- Maps six prominent explainer families to these desiderata, showing how existing methods can be adapted for comparative analysis
- Demonstrates through an illustrative experiment how ∆-XAI can diagnose emergent misalignment in medical advice following fine-tuning
- Establishes a conceptual framework that calls for benchmarks, comparative audits, and transition-aware oversight for high-risk applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
∆-XAI works by reframing the explanation problem from understanding a single model instance to understanding the difference between a reference model and an intervened model. This comparative approach captures the intervention-induced changes that traditional XAI methods miss when they treat each checkpoint in isolation. By focusing on the delta between models, ∆-XAI can identify which features, concepts, or training data contributed to behavioral shifts, making it possible to diagnose emergent misalignment and potentially steer models back toward desired behavior.

## Foundational Learning
- Behavioral shifts in LLMs occur after scaling, fine-tuning, or other training procedures - needed to understand why traditional XAI is insufficient; quick check: verify shifts occur in controlled fine-tuning experiments
- Comparative explainers measure differences between model checkpoints rather than individual instances - needed to capture intervention effects; quick check: implement simple diff-based comparison between checkpoints
- Ten desiderata framework categorizes requirements for effective comparative explanations - needed to evaluate and develop comparative methods; quick check: test existing explainers against these desiderata
- Six families of comparative explainers provide different perspectives on behavioral changes - needed to choose appropriate tools for specific shift types; quick check: apply multiple families to same shift and compare results
- Reference model selection is critical for meaningful comparisons - needed to ensure comparisons are valid and interpretable; quick check: test sensitivity to different reference model choices
- Monitoring desiderata ensure explanations remain valid over time and across distributions - needed for real-world deployment scenarios; quick check: validate temporal coherence in sequential fine-tuning

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Reference Model → Intervention → Intervened Model → Comparative Analysis → Explanation

Critical path: Model checkpoints are compared through feature attribution, probing, or other explainer families to identify and explain behavioral shifts. The reference model serves as the baseline, while the intervened model represents the post-intervention state.

Design tradeoffs: The framework must balance comprehensiveness (covering all relevant explainers) with practicality (computational cost and interpretability). Choosing appropriate reference models requires balancing representativeness with stability.

Failure signatures: If comparative explanations show no sensitivity to known interventions, the framework may be missing critical differences. If explanations are inconsistent across different explainer families, there may be issues with commensurability or validity.

First experiments:
1. Apply multiple explainer families to a simple fine-tuning scenario where known changes occur
2. Test sensitivity by introducing controlled interventions and measuring explanation responses
3. Evaluate temporal coherence by comparing explanations across sequential fine-tuning steps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The ten desiderata are theoretically grounded but not yet validated against real-world model shifts
- The illustrative medical advice experiment is hypothetical rather than executed
- The claim that traditional XAI methods are inadequate for behavioral shifts is asserted but not empirically demonstrated
- The framework's generalizability across different intervention types (architecture changes vs. data shifts) is not explored

## Confidence

High: The need for comparative approaches to explain behavioral shifts (conceptual necessity is well-established)

Medium: The categorization of desiderata and their theoretical justification

Low: Practical effectiveness of ∆-XAI in real-world scenarios (not empirically demonstrated)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies comparing traditional XAI methods versus comparative explainers on actual model checkpoints undergoing fine-tuning or scaling
2. Develop and validate benchmark datasets for behavioral shifts across multiple model families and intervention types
3. Implement case studies with industry partners to test the framework's utility in monitoring deployed models for emergent misalignment
