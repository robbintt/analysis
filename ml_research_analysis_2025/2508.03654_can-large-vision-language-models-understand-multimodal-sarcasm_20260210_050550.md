# Can Large Vision-Language Models Understand Multimodal Sarcasm?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.03654
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03654
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: LVLMs show poor zero-shot performance on multimodal sarcasm tasks, improved significantly by a training-free framework integrating object extraction and external knowledge.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) tasks, revealing significant limitations in their ability to detect and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The authors identify insufficient visual understanding and lack of conceptual knowledge as primary causes for poor performance. To address these issues, they propose a training-free framework that enhances LVLMs by incorporating fine-grained object extraction and external conceptual knowledge from ConceptNet. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements across multiple LVLMs, with GPT-4o's sarcasm detection accuracy increasing from 65.9% to 75.3%, and significant gains in sarcasm explanation quality metrics for models like InstructBLIP.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate LVLMs on MSA tasks through comprehensive experiments, finding poor zero-shot performance due to visual understanding gaps and conceptual knowledge limitations. They propose a training-free framework that integrates fine-grained object extraction and external conceptual knowledge from ConceptNet to enhance LVLMs' sarcasm interpretation capabilities. The approach is evaluated across multiple LVLMs for both sarcasm detection and explanation tasks, showing significant improvements without requiring model fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o's sarcasm detection accuracy improved from 65.9% to 75.3% (+14.2%) using the proposed framework
- InstructBLIP showed substantial gains in sarcasm explanation quality across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics
- The training-free approach demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple LVLMs for both detection and explanation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed framework works by addressing two key limitations in LVLMs: insufficient visual understanding and lack of conceptual knowledge. By integrating fine-grained object extraction, the framework provides detailed visual information that helps LVLMs better interpret the visual context of sarcastic content. The external conceptual knowledge from ConceptNet supplements the model's understanding with relevant semantic relationships and common-sense knowledge that are often crucial for detecting and explaining sarcasm, which frequently relies on implicit meanings and cultural references.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA)**: Understanding sarcasm that spans both visual and textual modalities; needed to evaluate LVLMs on complex real-world sarcasm scenarios.
- **Zero-shot Learning**: Model performance without task-specific training; quick check: compare model outputs on MSA tasks before any adaptation.
- **BLEU/ROUGE/METEOR**: Automated metrics for evaluating text generation quality; needed to quantify improvements in sarcasm explanation outputs.
- **ConceptNet**: A semantic network containing general knowledge about concepts and their relationships; needed to provide LVLMs with external contextual knowledge for sarcasm interpretation.
- **Fine-grained Object Extraction**: Detailed identification of objects and their attributes in images; needed to provide LVLMs with precise visual information for multimodal understanding.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Image + Text -> Object Extractor -> ConceptNet Knowledge Retrieval -> Enhanced Input -> LVLM -> Output (Detection/Explanation)

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from multimodal input through object extraction and knowledge augmentation to the LVLM inference. The quality of object extraction and relevance of ConceptNet knowledge directly impacts the LVLM's ability to detect and explain sarcasm.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The training-free approach avoids computational costs and data requirements of fine-tuning but may be limited by the quality of external knowledge sources and the LVLM's ability to effectively integrate augmented inputs. The framework trades model-specific optimization for generalizability across different LVLMs.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor sarcasm detection may indicate inadequate object extraction (missing key visual cues) or irrelevant ConceptNet knowledge (distracting from the sarcastic context). Low-quality explanations suggest the LVLM struggles to synthesize the augmented visual and conceptual information into coherent interpretations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare sarcasm detection accuracy on a held-out MSA dataset using baseline LVLM versus LVLM with object extraction only
2. Evaluate the impact of ConceptNet knowledge quality by testing with different knowledge relevance thresholds
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of visual understanding versus conceptual knowledge enhancement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR) may not fully capture nuanced aspects of sarcastic interpretation quality
- External knowledge sources like ConceptNet may introduce cultural or contextual biases that limit generalization
- The training-free approach may not scale well to more complex multimodal scenarios beyond tested datasets

## Confidence

- **Low Confidence**: The claim that insufficient visual understanding is the primary cause of poor sarcasm detection performance
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the proposed training-free framework in improving both detection and explanation tasks
- **High Confidence**: The baseline finding that LVLMs exhibit poor zero-shot performance on multimodal sarcasm analysis tasks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to determine the relative contribution of visual understanding versus conceptual knowledge enhancement in the proposed framework
2. Evaluate the framework's performance on out-of-domain datasets and diverse cultural contexts to assess generalization capabilities and potential bias issues
3. Perform human evaluation studies to validate the quality of sarcasm explanations beyond automated metrics, particularly focusing on nuanced aspects of sarcastic interpretation
