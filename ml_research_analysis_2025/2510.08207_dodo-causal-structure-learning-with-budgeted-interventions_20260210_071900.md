core_contribution: DODO introduces a causal structure learning algorithm that enables
  an autonomous agent to infer the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of its
  environment through targeted interventions. The core idea is to iteratively apply
  interventions on each variable, observe the effects, and use statistical hypothesis
  testing (two-sample t-tests) to detect potential causal links.

# DODO: Causal Structure Learning with Budgeted Interventions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.08207
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08207
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** DODO achieves near-perfect F1 scores in causal structure learning with interventional data, outperforming purely observational baselines PC and NOTEARS.

## Executive Summary
DODO introduces an autonomous agent approach for inferring causal structures through budgeted interventions. The algorithm iteratively applies targeted interventions, uses statistical hypothesis testing to detect potential causal links, and employs partial correlation analysis to prune indirect connections. Evaluation on synthetic DAGs demonstrates superior performance over observational methods when sufficient intervention budget is available, particularly in resolving causal ambiguities that cannot be addressed through observational data alone.

## Method Summary
DODO's approach centers on active causal discovery through interventional data collection. The method works by systematically intervening on each variable in the system, observing the resulting changes, and using two-sample t-tests to identify statistically significant causal relationships. Following initial link detection, the algorithm applies partial correlation analysis to distinguish direct causal connections from those mediated through intermediate variables. This two-stage process allows DODO to construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the underlying causal structure of the environment. The approach is specifically designed to work within budget constraints, making it suitable for scenarios where interventions are costly or limited.

## Key Results
- DODO achieves near-perfect F1 scores in the most challenging configuration tested
- Outperforms NOTEARS (F1 plateau at 0.7) and PC (F1 plateau at 0.3) on synthetic DAGs
- Consistently superior performance across varying graph sizes (5, 10, 20 nodes) and densities when sufficient budget is available

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm leverages the fundamental advantage of interventional data over observational data in causal discovery. By actively manipulating variables and observing the effects, DODO can break symmetries and resolve ambiguities that arise from purely observational correlations. The statistical testing framework provides a principled way to distinguish true causal effects from random fluctuations, while the partial correlation pruning step ensures that only direct causal relationships are retained in the final DAG structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs):** Why needed: Represents causal relationships without cycles. Quick check: Can all causal relationships be represented without feedback loops?
- **Statistical hypothesis testing:** Why needed: Distinguishes real causal effects from noise. Quick check: Are p-values below significance threshold for detected relationships?
- **Partial correlation:** Why needed: Identifies direct relationships by controlling for mediators. Quick check: Does correlation persist after conditioning on intermediate variables?
- **Intervention vs. observation:** Why needed: Interventions provide stronger causal identification than passive observation. Quick check: Can the same causal structure be identified from observational data alone?
- **Budget constraints:** Why needed: Real-world interventions are often costly. Quick check: Does performance degrade as intervention budget decreases?
- **Causal ambiguity resolution:** Why needed: Multiple DAGs can generate identical observational distributions. Quick check: Does interventional data uniquely identify the true DAG?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Variables -> Interventions -> Observations -> Statistical Tests -> Link Detection -> Partial Correlation Analysis -> DAG Construction
- **Critical path:** Intervention → Observation → Statistical Testing → Link Detection → Pruning → Final DAG
- **Design tradeoffs:** Active interventions provide stronger causal identification but require budget; statistical testing balances sensitivity and specificity; pruning step assumes linear relationships
- **Failure signatures:** False positives from insufficient sample sizes; missed connections from conservative thresholds; incorrect pruning from violated linearity assumptions
- **First experiments:** 1) Test on small DAG with known structure to verify basic functionality, 2) Vary intervention budget to assess performance degradation, 3) Compare statistical testing methods (t-test vs. other approaches)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on synthetic DAGs with controlled parameters, limiting real-world generalizability
- Evaluation focused on small graphs (up to 20 nodes), leaving scalability uncertain
- Pruning step assumes linearity and stationarity, which may not hold in all domains

## Confidence
- Claims of DODO's superiority over observational baselines: High for synthetic experiments, Medium for real-world extrapolation
- Interventional data resolving observational ambiguities: High (theoretically well-supported)
- Comparative results against NOTEARS and PC: High for specific experimental conditions
- Performance on larger, more complex systems: Low (not tested)

## Next Checks
1. Test DODO on real-world datasets with known causal structures to assess practical applicability
2. Evaluate scalability to larger graphs (50+ nodes) to understand computational and performance limits
3. Compare against more recent interventional baselines beyond PC and NOTEARS to strengthen relative performance claims
