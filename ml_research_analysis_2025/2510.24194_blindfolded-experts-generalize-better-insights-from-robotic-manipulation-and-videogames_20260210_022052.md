# Blindfolded Experts Generalize Better: Insights from Robotic Manipulation and Videogames

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24194
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24194
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Using blindfolded experts in behavioral cloning improves generalization to unseen tasks by forcing exploratory behavior

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces "blindfolded" experts for behavioral cloning, where experts demonstrate tasks with partially masked observations. The theoretical analysis shows that generalization error scales with the square root of task information over the number of tasks, suggesting less information leads to better generalization. Empirically, cloning blindfolded experts significantly outperforms standard cloning on unseen Procgen maze and heist levels, as well as on real-robot peg insertion tasks. The approach is particularly effective when fewer training tasks are available.

## Method Summary
The method involves collecting demonstrations from experts who play with partially masked observations (the "blindfold"), while storing the full unmasked observations in the dataset. A behavioral cloning policy is then trained on these unmasked observations. The key insight is that the blindfolded expert must employ exploratory strategies rather than task-specific shortcuts, leading to more generalizable policies. The approach uses history-dependent policies (GRU/Transformer architectures) to handle the partial observability induced by the blindfold.

## Key Results
- Cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better than standard cloning on unseen Procgen maze and heist levels
- Success rates improve from ~70% to ~96% on real-robot peg insertion test shapes
- The generalization advantage is more pronounced when fewer training tasks are available
- Blindfolded experts exhibit longer trajectories and higher state-coverage entropy, indicating more exploratory behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reducing task information available to the demonstrator lowers the generalization error bound.
- Mechanism: The theoretical bound shows error scales with √(I/m), where I is mutual information between task T and expert's internal representation Z. By masking observations, the demonstrator cannot rely on task-specific shortcuts.
- Core assumption: The expert remains capable of solving the task despite the information bottleneck.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] generalization error scales with √I/m; [section 3] analysis of generalization induced by information bottleneck; Related work on transformation-based generalization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Blindfolded experts exhibit more exploratory behavior, which generalizes better than goal-optimal behavior.
- Mechanism: With partial observations, the expert must explore to infer task structure, producing longer trajectories with higher state-coverage entropy.
- Core assumption: Exploration strategies are more transferable across tasks than optimal task-specific policies.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "blindfolded" expert compelled to employ non-trivial exploration; [section 4.1] trajectories longer for blindfolded experts; Related work on constrained demonstrators.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cloning blindfolded experts improves generalization especially when fewer training tasks are available.
- Mechanism: The √(I/m) term dominates when m is small, making reducing I more beneficial.
- Core assumption: The exploratory strategy learned is sufficiently task-agnostic to apply to held-out tasks.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "generalizes better with fewer demonstrated tasks"; [section 4.2] advantage more significant with fewer training shapes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Mutual Information IZ;T**
  - Why needed here: Core theoretical quantity controlling generalization bound; must understand information bottleneck principle.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why reducing IZ;T without increasing Egen improves the bound?

- Concept: **Bayes-Optimal Policies under Partial Observability**
  - Why needed here: Blindfolded experts are assumed to act optimally given their restricted observations.
  - Quick check question: How does a Bayes-optimal policy differ from a fully-informed optimal policy in a POMDP setting?

- Concept: **Behavioral Cloning with History-Based Policies**
  - Why needed here: Exploratory behavior is non-Markovian; policies must process observation sequences.
  - Quick check question: Why does cloning a history-dependent expert require a recurrent or attention-based policy architecture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Observation encoder (ResNet-10/18) -> Fully Connected layers -> GRU (1024 hidden units) -> Policy Head
- Critical path:
  1. Define task distribution and train/test split
  2. Design domain-appropriate blindfold
  3. Collect demonstrations with masked expert observations but store unmasked observations
  4. Train BC policy on unmasked observation-action pairs using NLL loss
  5. Evaluate on held-out tasks
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Blindfold strength: Too weak → no exploration; too strong → task becomes unsolvable
  - Policy capacity: Must be sufficient to model history-dependent behavior
  - Data quantity: BF-experts produce longer trajectories; match total steps vs. match trajectory count for fair comparison
- Failure signatures:
  - πBC overfits to training tasks (train score rises, test score degrades)
  - πBF−BC fails to reach expert performance on training tasks (insufficient policy capacity or optimization issues)
  - Test performance collapses when blindfold is domain-inappropriate
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Procgen maze with k=100 training levels; compare πBC vs πBF−BC on test levels
  2. Ablation: Vary blindfold strength; plot test success rate vs. IZ;T proxy (state entropy)
  3. Transfer to new domain (e.g., robotic reaching with masked goal position)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can the optimal degree of blindfolding be systematically determined to balance induced exploration with task solvability?
- Does the theoretical generalization bound scaling with √(I/m) hold for continuous action spaces?
- Can the "blindfold" mechanism be automated or learned rather than manually designed for each domain?

## Limitations
- The blindfold design is domain-specific and requires manual tuning for each task type
- Theoretical bounds rely on bounded error for blindfolded experts, which may not hold for severe masking
- The method's effectiveness across fundamentally different domains (beyond image-based and robotic manipulation) remains untested

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Empirical results showing BF-Expert policies generalize better than standard Expert policies
- **Medium Confidence**: Theoretical generalization bound relating √(I/m) to task performance
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that blindfolding is most beneficial with fewer training tasks

## Next Checks

1. Implement mutual information estimation between tasks and expert representations under varying blindfold intensities to empirically verify the √(I/m) relationship.

2. Apply the blindfolded expert approach to a fundamentally different domain such as language-based tasks or tabular reinforcement learning to test domain generality.

3. Systematically vary blindfold intensity and measure both the blindfolded expert's success rate and resulting policy's generalization performance to identify operational limits.
