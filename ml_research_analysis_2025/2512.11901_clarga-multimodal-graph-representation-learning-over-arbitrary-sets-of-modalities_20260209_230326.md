# CLARGA: Multimodal Graph Representation Learning over Arbitrary Sets of Modalities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11901
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11901
- Authors: Santosh Patapati
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 91.4% accuracy on DAIC-WoZ depression detection dataset

## Executive Summary
CLARGA is a general-purpose multimodal fusion architecture that works with any number and type of modalities without changing the underlying framework. It learns how modalities should inform one another by building an attention-weighted graph over their features and passing messages along this graph with a multi-head Graph Attention Network. The model also handles missing modality inputs through a learnable mask token and is trained with a hybrid objective combining supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss.

## Method Summary
CLARGA is a multimodal fusion architecture that builds an attention-weighted graph over modality features and uses Graph Attention Networks to learn inter-modality relationships. The model employs modality-specific encoders to extract features, creates a learnable mask token for handling missing modalities, and trains using a hybrid objective combining supervised and contrastive losses. The architecture is designed to be modality-agnostic and scalable.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91.4% accuracy on DAIC-WoZ depression detection dataset, surpassing all previous approaches
- Consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art models across 7 diverse datasets
- Demonstrates robustness to missing inputs, maintaining higher accuracy than comparison models when modalities are dropped

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CLARGA works by learning modality relationships through graph attention networks, allowing each modality to inform others based on learned attention weights. The learnable mask token enables robust handling of missing modalities without architectural changes. The hybrid training objective combining supervised and contrastive losses helps the model learn both task-specific and general multimodal representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)**: Why needed - to model relationships between modalities; Quick check - verify message passing correctly aggregates neighbor information
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Why needed - to combine information from different data types; Quick check - ensure consistent feature dimensions across modalities
- **Contrastive Learning (InfoNCE)**: Why needed - to learn meaningful representations; Quick check - verify temperature parameter is properly tuned
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Why needed - to weigh modality importance dynamically; Quick check - inspect attention weight distributions

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Modality Encoders -> Graph Construction -> GAT Layers -> Fusion Layer -> Decoder
- **Critical Path**: Input → Encoder → Graph Attention → Aggregation → Prediction
- **Design Tradeoffs**: GAT provides flexibility but adds computational overhead; hybrid loss balances task performance with representation quality
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance with missing modalities suggests mask token learning issues; degraded accuracy indicates GAT attention problems
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test with single modality to verify encoder functionality; 2) Test with two modalities to validate graph construction; 3) Evaluate with controlled missing modality patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Implementation details for modality encoders and decoder are not fully specified
- Missing comparison with certain key baselines like ViT, UNITER, and CLIP
- No runtime efficiency comparisons provided

## Confidence
High: Core architectural innovation and mathematical formulation are sound
Medium: Performance claims supported but lack key baseline comparisons
Low: Scalability claims not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies testing the contribution of contrastive InfoNCE loss versus supervised loss
2. Test robustness to systematic missing modality patterns beyond random dropout
3. Empirically validate computational complexity claims by measuring performance as modalities scale from 2 to 10+ modalities
