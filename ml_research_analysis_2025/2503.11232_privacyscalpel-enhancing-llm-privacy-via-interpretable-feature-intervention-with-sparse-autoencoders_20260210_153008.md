# PrivacyScalpel: Enhancing LLM Privacy via Interpretible Feature Intervention with Sparse Autoencoders

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.11232
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11232
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: Reduces email leakage from 5.15% to 0.0% while maintaining 99.4% utility

## Executive Summary
PrivacyScalpel is a privacy-preserving framework for large language models that leverages sparse autoencoders and interpretability techniques to mitigate Personally Identifiable Information leakage. The method identifies layers encoding PII-rich representations through feature probing, disentangles privacy-sensitive features using k-Sparse Autoencoders, and applies targeted interventions including feature ablation and vector steering. Evaluated on Gemma2-2b and Llama2-7b fine-tuned on the Enron dataset, PrivacyScalpel achieves significant privacy improvements while maintaining model utility, demonstrating that feature-level interventions provide superior privacy-utility trade-offs compared to neuron-level approaches.

## Method Summary
PrivacyScalpel operates by first identifying the transformer layer most sensitive to PII encoding using linear probes trained on residual activations. It then trains k-Sparse Autoencoders on activations from this layer to disentangle polysemantic neuron activations into sparse, monosemantic feature representations. Privacy-sensitive features are identified by their activation magnitude on PII-containing sequences. Targeted interventions are applied to these features during inference, either by ablating the top-k features or steering their representations away from PII patterns. The framework is specifically evaluated on email address leakage in models fine-tuned on the Enron dataset.

## Key Results
- Reduces email leakage from 5.15% to 0.0% on adversarial prompts while maintaining 99.4% utility
- Ablation with k=2000 features achieves 0.0% leakage with only 0.4% utility degradation
- Top-k Probe Steering method reduces leakage to 1.05% with 99.56% utility preservation
- Methods remain effective even with only 1% of training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** PII information is concentrated in specific transformer layers, enabling targeted intervention at a single hook point.
- **Mechanism:** Linear probes trained on residual activations discriminate between PII and non-PII sequences; the layer achieving highest validation accuracy is selected as the intervention target. For Gemma2-2b, Layer 9 yields ~94.7% accuracy.
- **Core assumption:** PII encoding is layer-localized rather than uniformly distributed across the network.
- **Evidence anchors:** Feature Probing identifies layers encoding PII-rich representations; Layer 9 selected based on validation accuracy; PATCH uses similar layer-targeted approaches.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** k-Sparse Autoencoders disentangle polysemantic neuron activations into sparse, monosemantic feature representations where privacy-sensitive features become isolatable.
- **Mechanism:** The SAE encoder expands activations (d_emb → h=65536) and applies TopK sparsity (k=512 active features), forcing each latent dimension to encode a single interpretable concept. Privacy-sensitive features are identified by magnitude ranking on PII-containing sequences.
- **Core assumption:** Monosemantic features better isolate PII concepts than polysemantic neurons, enabling precise ablation without collateral damage.
- **Evidence anchors:** SAE disentangles privacy-sensitive features; TopK enforces sparsity on latent features; SAE-based approaches isolate interpretable concepts.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Targeted interventions on identified PII features—ablation or vector steering—suppress leakage while preserving downstream task performance.
- **Mechanism:** (1) Ablation zeros top-k PII features in latent space; (2) Steering adds negative direction vector (z' = z + α·v, α<0) shifting representations away from PII. Interventions apply only to the last token during generation to minimize error propagation.
- **Core assumption:** PII generation at inference time depends primarily on the final token's feature activations.
- **Evidence anchors:** Intervention methods reduce leakage from 5.15% to 0.0% while maintaining 99.4% utility; interventions applied only to last token's latent features; PATCH demonstrates circuit patching for privacy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Polysemanticity vs. Monosemanticity**
  - **Why needed here:** The core hypothesis is that SAE features are more intervenable than raw neurons because each feature encodes one concept.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might ablating a single neuron harm both PII suppression and factual recall simultaneously?

- **Concept: Residual Stream Architecture**
  - **Why needed here:** Probing and intervention target residual stream activations, not attention outputs or MLP hidden states.
  - **Quick check question:** At what point in a transformer block does the residual stream accumulate information from the previous layer?

- **Concept: TopK Sparsity and Dead Latents**
  - **Why needed here:** The auxiliary loss prevents feature collapse; understanding this is critical for debugging SAE training.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to inactive features during TopK, and how does the auxiliary loss address them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
Input Prompt → LLM Forward Pass → Extract Activations at Layer l*
                ↓
        SAE Encoder: z = TopK(W_enc(a_l - b_pre))
                ↓
        Intervention: z' = zero_topk(z) OR z' = z + α·v
                ↓
        SAE Decoder: â_l = W_dec·z' + b_pre
                ↓
        Replace Activation → Continue Generation

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Probe training:** ~42K PII/non-PII sequences from Pile → identify layer l* with highest accuracy
  2. **SAE training:** Separate 1% Pile subset (~1B tokens) → learn 65536-dim sparse features (k=512)
  3. **Feature ranking:** D_top-k (1538 email sequences) → rank features by activation magnitude
  4. **Steering vector computation:** D_prob → train probe on latent features OR compute mean-diff

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **k (sparsity):** Lower k → sparser, more interpretable, but higher reconstruction error
  - **α (steering intensity):** Larger |α| → stronger suppression but utility degradation (α=-300 drops utility to 53.83%)
  - **Ablation vs. Steering:** Ablation is direct but destructive; steering preserves structure but requires accurate direction
  - **Intervention scope:** Last-token only minimizes disruption; full-sequence may be more thorough but propagates SAE error

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Utility drops >2%: α too aggressive or ablated k too large
  - Leakage persists after intervention: Wrong layer, misidentified features, or SAE reconstructs PII despite ablation
  - Incoherent generation: SAE reconstruction MSE too high—retrain with higher k or check auxiliary loss

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Probe validation sweep:** Train probes on all 26 layers; confirm Layer 9 peak accuracy holds on held-out adversarial prompts
  2. **SAE reconstruction fidelity check:** Pass prompts through SAE at Layer 9 without intervention; verify leakage rate matches baseline (5.15%)
  3. **Ablation privacy-utility curve:** Sweep k∈{100, 500, 1000, 2000} on D_adv; plot leakage vs. utility to find operating point

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can PrivacyScalpel effectively mitigate leakage of sensitive information beyond email addresses, such as financial records, phone numbers, and personal identifiers?
- **Basis in paper:** "In future, we will explore extending PrivacyScalpel to mitigate other forms of sensitive information leakage beyond email addresses, such as financial records and personal identifiers."
- **Why unresolved:** The current work only evaluates email leakage on the Enron dataset; different PII types may have distinct encoding patterns in model representations, potentially requiring different probing strategies or intervention techniques.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments applying PrivacyScalpel to datasets containing financial data, phone numbers, SSNs, and other PII types, demonstrating consistent leakage reduction across categories.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can PrivacyScalpel be integrated into real-time inference settings while maintaining acceptable latency for privacy-sensitive applications?
- **Basis in paper:** "Additionally, integrating PrivacyScalpel with real-time inference settings could further enhance its applicability in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and legal AI applications."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not measure computational overhead or inference latency introduced by SAE encoding, decoding, and intervention steps.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks measuring latency overhead per token, throughput degradation, and memory footprint during real-time generation with PrivacyScalpel enabled.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Are PrivacyScalpel's interventions robust against adaptive adversarial attacks designed to bypass feature-level protections?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper evaluates only static adversarial prompts from existing benchmarks; no analysis of whether attackers could craft prompts or fine-tuning strategies that evade SAE-based interventions.
- **Why unresolved:** Privacy defenses may create a false sense of security if adversaries can discover alternative prompting strategies that reactivate PII leakage through different feature pathways.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Adaptive attack experiments where adversaries iteratively refine prompts or use gradient-based optimization to probe for residual PII leakage pathways after intervention.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does PrivacyScalpel generalize effectively across diverse model architectures, sizes, and training domains beyond the tested Gemma2-2b and Llama2-7b on Enron data?
- **Basis in paper:** The evaluation is limited to two specific models and one email-centric dataset; layer selection and feature encoding patterns may differ significantly across architectures and training corpora.
- **Why unresolved:** PII encoding locations and SAE feature distributions likely vary with model scale, architecture choices, and training data composition.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Cross-architecture experiments on models like Mistral, Pythia, or GPT variants, tested across datasets from different domains (medical, legal, customer service).

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends on accurate layer localization; if PII distributes uniformly across layers, the framework's targeted approach may fail
- SAE-based interventions may introduce computational overhead during inference that hasn't been characterized for real-time applications
- The framework's robustness against adaptive adversarial attacks that specifically target SAE-based protections remains untested

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The mathematical framework (SAE encoding/decoding, TopK sparsity, linear probing) is sound and reproducible. The baseline leakage reduction from 5.15% to 0% is clearly demonstrated with specific k and α values.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that SAE-based interventions outperform neuron-level approaches is supported by the results, but lacks direct comparison to ablation baselines at the neuron level within the same experiments.
- **Low Confidence:** The assumption that Layer 9 will consistently encode PII across different models and datasets. The probing methodology's transfer from synthetic Pile data to adversarial prompts is not rigorously validated.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-model probing validation:** Apply the layer probing methodology to Llama2-7b and other architectures to verify Layer 9 consistently encodes PII, or identify model-specific patterns.
2. **SAE feature interpretability audit:** Perform feature dictionary analysis on the learned SAE features to confirm monosemanticity and directly map top-ranked features to PII concepts.
3. **Multi-token intervention test:** Implement full-sequence intervention (not just last token) and compare privacy-utility trade-offs to quantify the scope limitation's impact.
