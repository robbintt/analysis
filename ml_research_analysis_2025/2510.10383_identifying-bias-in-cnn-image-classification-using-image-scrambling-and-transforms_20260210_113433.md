- Proposes scrambling and transform methods to detect CNN classification bias when background information is unavailable

## Executive Summary
This study introduces innovative techniques for detecting classification bias in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when background information is not explicitly available. The research proposes two complementary methods: image scrambling, which randomly shuffles image tiles to disrupt patterns, and image transforms (Fourier, Wavelet, and Median filtering) that help recover background noise and distinguish contextual from irrelevant features. Experiments across six datasets (natural, synthetic, and hybrid) demonstrate that both approaches effectively identify biases in CNN classification. Notably, cropped background segments and scrambled images achieved higher accuracies than random chance, suggesting CNNs learn from hidden patterns. The transform methods, particularly Wavelet and Median combinations, successfully differentiated biases between natural and synthetic datasets, reducing accuracy for natural data while improving it for synthetic data. These findings underscore the critical importance of evaluating CNN reliability through bias detection before trusting high classification accuracy.

## Method Summary
The study employs two primary bias detection methods: image scrambling and image transforms. The scrambling method divides images into tiles and randomly shuffles them to disrupt learned patterns, testing CNN robustness to background information. The transform methods include Fourier, Wavelet, and Median filtering techniques to recover background noise and distinguish contextual information from irrelevant features. Six datasets were used: natural, synthetic, and hybrid combinations. Experiments measured classification accuracy on scrambled images, cropped background segments, and transformed images to identify bias patterns. The study analyzed how different transforms affected natural versus synthetic dataset classifications differently.

## Key Results
- Both scrambling and transform methods effectively identified classification biases in CNNs
- Cropped background segments and scrambled images yielded higher accuracies than random chance, indicating CNNs learn from hidden patterns
- Wavelet and Median transforms, especially in combination, successfully differentiated biases between natural and synthetic datasets
- Transform methods reduced accuracy for natural data while improving it for synthetic data, highlighting their potential for bias detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methods work by disrupting or analyzing the spatial relationships and patterns that CNNs use for classification. Scrambling breaks learned associations between foreground objects and background contexts, forcing the network to rely on different features. Transform methods like Wavelet and Median filtering separate different frequency components and spatial details, revealing which aspects of the image contribute to classification decisions. When CNNs maintain high accuracy on scrambled or transformed images, it indicates they've learned from contextual patterns rather than just object features, revealing potential bias in the training data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Image scrambling methodology**: Why needed - to disrupt spatial patterns and test CNN reliance on background information; Quick check - verify scrambling maintains image statistics while destroying semantic content
- **Transform techniques (Fourier, Wavelet, Median)**: Why needed - to analyze different frequency and spatial components that contribute to classification; Quick check - confirm transforms preserve relevant information while filtering noise
- **Background context bias**: Why needed - to understand how CNNs use environmental cues beyond object features; Quick check - compare classification accuracy on foreground-only versus full images
- **Natural vs synthetic dataset characteristics**: Why needed - to identify how different data sources create different bias patterns; Quick check - analyze feature distributions across dataset types

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input images -> Scrambling/Transform processing -> CNN classification -> Accuracy evaluation -> Bias analysis
- **Critical path**: Image preprocessing (scrambling/transforms) → CNN feature extraction → Classification → Bias detection through accuracy patterns
- **Design tradeoffs**: Scrambling destroys semantic content but preserves statistics vs. transforms preserve some structure while revealing frequency components
- **Failure signatures**: High accuracy on scrambled images indicates background pattern learning; uniform accuracy across transforms suggests no bias detection capability
- **First experiments**: 1) Test scrambling on simple CNNs with controlled datasets; 2) Compare single vs. combined transform effectiveness; 3) Validate bias detection across multiple CNN architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental design relies on relatively controlled conditions and specific dataset characteristics
- Study does not address interactions between scrambling patterns and different CNN architectures
- Interpretation of higher accuracy from scrambled images may conflate genuine bias with scrambling methodology artifacts
- Limited testing on only six datasets restricts broader applicability claims

## Confidence
- Medium: The experimental design demonstrates effectiveness but has limited generalizability and relies on specific conditions

## Next Checks
1. Test scrambling and transform methods across a wider variety of CNN architectures and depth configurations to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate which specific background features contribute most to bias detection
3. Validate methods on real-world, multi-source datasets where ground truth bias information is available for comparison
