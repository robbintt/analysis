# Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation for Emotion Recognition
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.23076
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23076
- Reference count: 40
- This work proposes Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), achieving state-of-the-art performance in multimodal emotion recognition from physiological signals

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses multimodal emotion recognition using physiological signals, where emotions manifest as coordinated responses across central (brain) and autonomic (body) systems. Traditional self-supervised learning approaches rely on pairwise contrastive objectives that fail to capture higher-order interactions across multiple modalities. The authors propose MFMC, a principled framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective, enabling the capture of complex joint interactions without pairwise contrastive losses.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), which optimizes a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective to capture higher-order multimodal dependence. The framework derives a tight sandwich bound for the DTC objective and optimizes it using functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) with a trace surrogate approach. This allows MFMC to directly capture joint multimodal interactions across physiological signals (EEG, EDA, EMG) without relying on pairwise contrastive losses, addressing the limitation of existing SSL methods in modeling coordinated brain-body responses.

## Key Results
- MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%
- MFMC improves subject-independent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 27.5% to 33.1% using EDA signal alone
- MFMC remains highly competitive within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MFMC works by maximizing higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation objective, which captures coordinated interactions across multiple physiological signal modalities simultaneously. The sandwich bound optimization with FMCA-based trace surrogate enables efficient learning of these complex joint distributions without the limitations of pairwise contrastive approaches. This principled approach directly models the coordinated brain-body responses that characterize emotional states, rather than learning modality-specific representations independently.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Dual Total Correlation (DTC)** - A measure of higher-order dependence between multiple random variables that generalizes mutual information to capture joint interactions beyond pairwise relationships. Needed because pairwise contrastive losses cannot capture coordinated multimodal responses. Quick check: Verify DTC equals sum of mutual informations minus total correlation for three variables.

2. **Functional Maximum Correlation Analysis (FMCA)** - An optimization framework for maximizing correlation between function spaces, enabling non-linear dependence capture. Needed to handle the complex, non-linear relationships in physiological signals. Quick check: Confirm FMCA reduces to standard CCA when using linear kernels.

3. **Trace Surrogate Optimization** - A computational technique for efficiently optimizing matrix-based objectives. Needed to make the sandwich bound optimization tractable for high-dimensional physiological signals. Quick check: Verify the trace surrogate provides a valid upper bound for the original objective.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Raw physiological signals -> MFMC encoder network -> Joint representation space -> Classification head
Critical path: Signal preprocessing -> MFMC objective optimization -> Feature extraction -> Emotion classification
Design tradeoffs: Higher-order dependence capture vs computational complexity; unified joint representation vs modality-specific processing
Failure signatures: Poor performance on unseen subjects suggests insufficient generalization; degradation with additional modalities indicates overfitting to specific signal combinations
First experiments:
1. Compare MFMC performance against pairwise contrastive baselines on single-modality setups
2. Evaluate robustness to noise and artifacts in physiological signals
3. Test scalability by incrementally adding modalities and measuring computational overhead

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The sandwich bound derivation assumes smoothness conditions that may not hold for real-world physiological data with artifacts and noise
- The approach focuses exclusively on three specific physiological signal types (EEG, EDA, EMG), leaving unclear how well it generalizes to other multimodal combinations
- Computational efficiency for real-time emotion recognition applications is not thoroughly evaluated

## Confidence
High confidence: The mathematical formulation of the Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation framework is rigorous and well-grounded in information theory. The improvement over pairwise contrastive methods is theoretically sound.
Medium confidence: The experimental results show consistent improvements across multiple datasets, but the absolute performance gains vary significantly between subject-dependent and subject-independent settings. The robustness claims need further validation on additional datasets.
Low confidence: The computational efficiency of the trace surrogate optimization at scale, particularly for real-time emotion recognition applications, is not thoroughly evaluated.

## Next Checks
1. Test MFMC on additional multimodal physiological datasets with different sensor combinations to assess generalizability beyond the three datasets used in the paper.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each component (DTC objective, sandwich bound, FMCA trace surrogate) to quantify their individual impact on performance.
3. Evaluate the computational overhead and runtime performance compared to baseline SSL methods, particularly for subject-independent protocols with large participant pools.
