## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.12680
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12680

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Vision-G1, a vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning to improve general visual reasoning. The authors address the limited scope of current reasoning VLMs by curating a large RL-ready dataset from 46 sources across 8 domains (infographic, mathematical, spatial, cross-image, GUI, medical, common sense, general science). They propose an influence-function-based data selection method to filter low-quality instances and a difficulty-based filtering strategy to select training data matching the model's current capability. Multi-round RL training is then performed with a data curriculum to progressively enhance reasoning. Vision-G1-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance on 17 benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
Vision-G1 addresses the limited scope of current vision-language models by curating a large RL-ready dataset from 46 sources across 8 domains. The authors propose an influence-function-based data selection method to filter low-quality instances and a difficulty-based filtering strategy to select training data matching the model's current capability. Multi-round RL training is then performed with a data curriculum to progressively enhance reasoning. The model is evaluated on 17 benchmarks, where Vision-G1-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming similar-sized VLMs and even proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Flash.

## Key Results
- Vision-G1-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance on 17 benchmarks
- Outperforms similar-sized VLMs and proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Flash
- Demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across diverse visual reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of Vision-G1 stems from its comprehensive data curation strategy and reinforcement learning approach. By curating data from 46 sources across 8 diverse domains, the model is exposed to a wide range of visual reasoning scenarios. The influence-function-based data selection method ensures high-quality training instances, while the difficulty-based filtering strategy tailors the training data to the model's current capability. Multi-round RL training with a data curriculum allows the model to progressively improve its reasoning abilities. This combination of diverse, high-quality data and adaptive training methodology enables Vision-G1 to achieve superior performance across various benchmarks and domains.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Used to train the model for improved reasoning capabilities. Why needed: Enables the model to learn through interaction and feedback, optimizing for reasoning performance. Quick check: Verify the RL algorithm implementation and reward structure.
- **Influence Functions**: Employed for data selection to filter low-quality instances. Why needed: Ensures the training dataset contains high-quality examples that contribute positively to model learning. Quick check: Validate the influence function calculation and its correlation with instance quality.
- **Curriculum Learning**: Implemented through difficulty-based filtering and multi-round training. Why needed: Allows the model to learn progressively, starting from easier tasks and advancing to more complex ones. Quick check: Confirm the difficulty metric accurately reflects task complexity and model capability progression.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Pre-trained VLM -> Influence Function-based Data Selection -> Difficulty-based Filtering -> Multi-round RL Training -> Vision-G1

**Critical Path:**
The critical path for Vision-G1's development is: Pre-trained VLM → Influence Function-based Data Selection → Difficulty-based Filtering → Multi-round RL Training. This path ensures that the model is trained on high-quality, appropriately challenging data through an adaptive curriculum.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Data curation vs. model architecture complexity: The authors chose to focus on extensive data curation rather than complex architectural modifications, relying on the quality and diversity of training data to drive performance improvements.
- Influence function computational cost vs. data quality: Using influence functions for data selection is computationally expensive but results in a higher-quality training set, potentially leading to better model performance.
- Multi-round RL vs. single-stage training: The multi-round approach with difficulty-based filtering allows for more targeted and efficient learning but requires careful management of the training process and data curriculum.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Overfitting to curated dataset: If the model performs well on benchmarks but poorly on out-of-distribution tasks, it may indicate overfitting to the specific data curation strategy.
- Ineffective difficulty scaling: If the model plateaus in performance despite multiple RL rounds, it could suggest that the difficulty-based filtering is not accurately matching the model's capabilities or that the curriculum is not sufficiently challenging.
- Influence function limitations: If the model's performance is inconsistent across different domains, it may indicate that the influence function-based selection is not capturing all aspects of instance quality or relevance.

**First Experiments:**
1. Benchmark performance comparison: Test Vision-G1 against baseline VLMs and proprietary models on the 17 reported benchmarks to verify the claimed state-of-the-art performance.
2. Ablation study on data curation methods: Compare the performance of Vision-G1 trained with different combinations of influence function-based selection and difficulty-based filtering to isolate their individual contributions.
3. Out-of-distribution generalization test: Evaluate Vision-G1 on visual reasoning tasks not included in the curated dataset to assess its true generalization capabilities.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The reported performance gains rely heavily on the quality and representativeness of the curated dataset, which itself depends on the influence function-based selection method.
- The claim of achieving state-of-the-art performance on 17 benchmarks should be interpreted cautiously, as direct comparisons with proprietary models may not account for differences in inference-time compute or architectural advantages.
- The model's generalization across diverse domains is demonstrated through benchmark performance, but real-world robustness in novel or out-of-distribution scenarios is not explicitly tested.

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- The methodology for data curation using influence functions and difficulty-based filtering is technically sound and well-documented.

**Medium confidence:**
- The reported benchmark performance improvements, though impressive, depend on the quality of the curated dataset and the choice of evaluation metrics.
- The claim of strong generalization across 8 domains is supported by benchmark results but lacks real-world validation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of the influence function-based data selection versus difficulty-based filtering on final model performance.
2. Test the model on out-of-distribution visual reasoning tasks not included in the curated dataset to assess true generalization.
3. Perform a controlled comparison with GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Flash using identical computational resources and inference settings to ensure fair evaluation.
