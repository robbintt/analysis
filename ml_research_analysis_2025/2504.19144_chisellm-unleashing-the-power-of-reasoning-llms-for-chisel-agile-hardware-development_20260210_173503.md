## Executive Summary
This paper presents ChiseLLM, a solution addressing the challenge of Large Language Models (LLMs) struggling with Chisel code generation for Agile Hardware Development. The authors identify that existing LLMs produce syntax errors and limited design variability when generating Chisel code. ChiseLLM introduces a comprehensive approach including data processing and transformation, prompt-guided reasoning trace synthesis, and domain-adapted model training to overcome these limitations. The solution constructs high-quality datasets from public RTL code resources and guides models to adopt structured thinking patterns through prompt enhancement methods.

The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both syntax correctness and variability design ability compared to baseline models. ChiseLLM-7B and ChiseLLM-32B models achieved 18.85% and 26.32% improvements in syntax correctness respectively, while increasing variability design ability by 47.58% compared to baseline reasoning models. The models achieve performance comparable to commercial models in certain tasks while maintaining cost-effectiveness with parameter sizes below 32B. The datasets and models are publicly available, providing high-performance, cost-effective solutions for HCL-Based AHDM.

## Method Summary
ChiseLLM introduces a comprehensive approach to improve LLM performance in Chisel code generation through three main components. First, it implements data processing and transformation techniques to construct high-quality datasets from public RTL code resources, addressing the data scarcity problem in hardware description language generation. Second, it employs prompt-guided reasoning trace synthesis that guides models to adopt structured thinking patterns through enhanced prompt engineering methods. Third, it utilizes domain-adapted model training to fine-tune base models specifically for Chisel generation tasks. The approach focuses on improving both syntax correctness and design variability, which are critical for effective hardware development.

## Key Results
- ChiseLLM-7B improved syntax correctness by 18.85% over base models
- ChiseLLM-32B improved syntax correctness by 26.32% over base models
- Variability design ability increased by 47.58% compared to baseline reasoning models
- Models achieved performance comparable to commercial models in certain tasks
- Cost-effective solutions with parameter sizes below 32B

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of ChiseLLM stems from its systematic approach to addressing the specific challenges of Chisel code generation. By combining high-quality dataset construction with structured reasoning guidance and domain-specific fine-tuning, the models learn to generate syntactically correct Chisel code with greater design variability. The prompt-guided reasoning trace synthesis enables models to follow logical problem-solving patterns, while the domain adaptation ensures the models understand hardware-specific constraints and best practices. This comprehensive approach allows ChiseLLM to overcome the limitations of general-purpose LLMs in hardware description language generation.

## Foundational Learning

**Chisel Hardware Description Language** - A domain-specific language for describing digital hardware. *Why needed*: Chisel provides higher-level abstractions than traditional HDLs while maintaining hardware precision. *Quick check*: Verify models can generate syntactically valid Chisel modules with proper parameterization.

**Agile Hardware Development Methodology** - An iterative approach to hardware design that emphasizes rapid prototyping and continuous refinement. *Why needed*: Enables faster development cycles and earlier detection of design issues. *Quick check*: Assess if generated code supports modular design and easy modification.

**Reasoning Trace Synthesis** - The process of generating structured logical reasoning paths for problem-solving. *Why needed*: Helps LLMs follow systematic approaches rather than producing random outputs. *Quick check*: Verify generated reasoning traces lead to logically consistent solutions.

**Domain-Adapted Fine-Tuning** - Specialized training process where models are fine-tuned on task-specific data. *Why needed*: General LLMs lack the specialized knowledge required for hardware description languages. *Quick check*: Compare performance on hardware-specific vs general programming tasks.

**Prompt Engineering for Code Generation** - Designing input prompts that guide LLMs toward desired output formats and behaviors. *Why needed*: Effective prompts can significantly improve code quality and consistency. *Quick check*: Test different prompt structures for code generation effectiveness.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Processing -> Prompt Enhancement -> Domain Adaptation -> Model Fine-Tuning -> Code Generation

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are the data processing pipeline and domain adaptation, as they directly impact the model's ability to generate syntactically correct and functionally appropriate Chisel code.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The model size (7B vs 32B parameters) represents a tradeoff between performance and computational efficiency. Smaller models are more cost-effective but may sacrifice some capability, while larger models provide better performance at increased computational cost.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include syntax errors in generated Chisel code, limited design variability, and inability to handle complex hardware constraints. Models may also struggle with tasks outside their training distribution.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison of syntax correctness between ChiseLLM and general-purpose LLMs on identical Chisel generation tasks
2. Variability assessment measuring the diversity of design solutions generated for the same hardware specification
3. Functional validation by synthesizing generated Chisel code and testing against hardware design specifications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on syntax correctness and variability design ability, without assessing functional correctness or performance metrics
- Limited comparison with commercial models without statistical significance testing or confidence intervals
- Narrow scope of evaluation tasks makes it difficult to assess generalizability across different hardware design problems
- Cost-effectiveness claims based on parameter count comparisons rather than comprehensive benchmarking

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Improvements in syntax correctness and variability design ability metrics are well-documented and reproducible based on the described methodology.

**Medium confidence**: Generalization of improvements across different hardware design tasks is plausible but not thoroughly validated.

**Low confidence**: Claims about performance comparable to commercial models and overall cost-effectiveness require additional validation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comprehensive functional validation by synthesizing generated Chisel code and verifying that the resulting hardware implementations meet design specifications and constraints.

2. Perform head-to-head benchmarking with commercial models using identical evaluation tasks, including statistical significance testing and cost analysis across different deployment scenarios.

3. Evaluate the models on a diverse set of hardware design problems representing different complexity levels and application domains to assess generalizability beyond the training data distribution.
