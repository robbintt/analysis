core_contribution: BatonVoice is a new framework for controllable speech synthesis
  that leverages the linguistic intelligence of LLMs by decoupling instruction understanding
  from speech generation. Inspired by "operationalism," the framework uses an LLM
  as a "conductor" to interpret text instructions into explicit vocal features (e.g.,
  pitch, energy), which are then fed into a specialized TTS model ("orchestra") to
  synthesize the final speech.

# BatonVoice: An Operationalist Framework for Enhancing Controllable Speech Synthesis with Linguistic Intelligence from LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26514
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26514
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: BatonVoice achieves 57.6% emotion accuracy on English benchmarks, outperforming best closed-source model (48.6%)

## Executive Summary
BatonVoice introduces a novel operationalist framework that decouples instruction understanding from speech generation in controllable speech synthesis. The framework leverages large language models (LLMs) as "conductors" to interpret text instructions into explicit vocal features, which are then synthesized by a specialized TTS model ("orchestra"). This separation enables the framework to harness LLM linguistic intelligence without requiring manual instruction annotations. Through a three-stage training pipeline using automatically generated data, BatonVoice demonstrates superior performance in emotional speech synthesis and exhibits remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization capabilities.

## Method Summary
BatonVoice operates on an operationalist principle where speech instructions are converted into explicit textual vocal features (pitch, energy, speaking rate) by an LLM, then synthesized by a dedicated TTS model. The framework uses a three-stage pipeline: pre-training on TTS data, supervised fine-tuning on instruction-to-feature pairs, and preference optimization using pairwise comparisons. All training data is automatically generated without manual annotation. The core model, BatonTTS, learns to synthesize speech from these feature descriptions while maintaining linguistic coherence and emotional expressiveness.

## Key Results
- Achieves 57.6% emotion accuracy on English benchmarks, surpassing best closed-source model (48.6%)
- Demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-lingual generalization to Chinese without additional training
- Scales performance with LLM capability, validating the framework's design principles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from decoupling the complex task of instruction understanding from speech generation. By converting abstract instructions into explicit textual vocal features, the system transforms an ambiguous, context-dependent problem into a well-defined, structured one. The LLM's linguistic intelligence is leveraged to parse instructions and extract meaningful vocal parameters, while the TTS model focuses purely on high-quality synthesis from these explicit features. This separation allows each component to specialize, with the LLM handling the semantic complexity of instructions and the TTS model optimizing for acoustic quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Operationalism in AI**: Converting abstract concepts into measurable, explicit representations. Why needed: Enables systematic control of speech parameters that are otherwise difficult to specify directly. Quick check: Can the framework generate consistent outputs for identical feature descriptions?
- **Instruction-to-Feature Mapping**: Transforming natural language instructions into structured vocal parameters. Why needed: Bridges the gap between human intentions and machine-executable speech synthesis commands. Quick check: Do the generated features correlate with human perception of the intended expression?
- **Zero-shot Cross-lingual Generalization**: Applying learned patterns to unseen languages without additional training. Why needed: Demonstrates the framework's ability to capture universal speech characteristics beyond language-specific patterns. Quick check: How does performance vary across languages with different prosodic systems?
- **Preference Optimization in TTS**: Using pairwise comparisons to refine synthesis quality. Why needed: Captures nuanced human preferences that are difficult to encode through explicit rules. Quick check: Do human raters prefer preference-optimized outputs over baseline models?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM (conductor) -> Feature Extraction -> BatonTTS (orchestra) -> Speech Synthesis

**Critical Path**: Instruction Input → LLM Processing → Vocal Feature Generation → TTS Synthesis → Output Speech

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades direct instruction-to-speech synthesis for a two-stage process that requires more computational resources but enables better controllability and leverages LLM capabilities. This adds latency but provides more interpretable control mechanisms and better generalization.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- LLM misinterpretation of instructions leading to incorrect feature extraction
- TTS model inability to synthesize from certain feature combinations
- Degradation in cross-lingual performance on languages with different prosodic structures
- Preference optimization getting stuck in local optima with limited comparison data

**First Experiments**:
1. Test framework with simple, unambiguous instructions to establish baseline functionality
2. Evaluate cross-lingual generalization on a diverse language sample (5-10 languages)
3. Perform ablation study removing preference optimization to quantify its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the framework's limitations and potential extensions. Key uncertainties include how the system performs on languages with significantly different phonotactic structures or tonal systems beyond the tested Chinese example, and whether the preference optimization stage effectively captures the full complexity of human preferences for speech synthesis. The authors also question how well the framework handles fine-grained prosodic control that requires implicit understanding of linguistic context, as explicit feature descriptions may not capture all nuances of natural speech.

## Limitations
- Performance claims rely on automatically generated data without human verification of instruction interpretation quality
- Cross-lingual generalization tested only on Chinese, leaving uncertainty about performance on other language families
- Explicit feature descriptions may struggle with fine-grained prosodic control requiring implicit linguistic context
- Framework's effectiveness depends on LLM capability, creating a potential bottleneck in the pipeline

## Confidence
- High confidence in the technical implementation of the three-stage training pipeline and core methodology
- High confidence in empirical results showing superior emotion accuracy on English benchmarks
- Medium confidence in cross-lingual generalization claims due to limited language testing
- Medium confidence in scalability claims with LLM capability, requiring validation across different architectures

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic human evaluation studies where annotators verify the accuracy of LLM-generated vocal features against ground truth speech characteristics across multiple languages and speaking styles.

2. Test the framework's cross-lingual generalization on a diverse set of 5-10 languages spanning different language families, including tonal languages, languages with complex prosody, and low-resource languages.

3. Perform ablation studies isolating the contributions of each training stage (pre-training, SFT, preference optimization) and varying LLM sizes to quantify their individual impact on final synthesis quality and controllability.
