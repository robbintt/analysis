# Revenue Maximization Under Sequential Price Competition Via The Estimation Of s-Concave Demand Functions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.16737
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16737
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Dynamic pricing policy achieves price convergence at rate O(T^{-1/7}) and regret O(T^{5/7}) under shape-constrained demand estimation.

## Executive Summary
This paper studies price competition among multiple sellers who simultaneously set prices and observe demand over a selling horizon. The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. The authors propose a dynamic pricing policy based on semi-parametric least-squares estimation under shape constraints. When all sellers employ this policy, their prices converge at a rate of O(T^{-1/7}) to the Nash equilibrium prices that would arise under full information. Each seller incurs a regret of O(T^{5/7}) relative to a dynamic benchmark policy.

## Method Summary
The SPE-BR algorithm operates in two phases. During exploration (first τ ∝ T^{5/7} periods), sellers estimate their demand function parameters using semi-parametric least-squares estimation under s-concavity constraints. The exploration phase is split: κτ samples estimate the linear index θ via normalized linear regression, while (1-κ)τ samples estimate the non-parametric link function ψ via shape-constrained least squares. During exploitation, sellers play their best-response price based on estimated demand. The algorithm exploits the structure of single-index models and proves that the joint best-response operator is a contraction mapping, ensuring convergence to Nash equilibrium despite incomplete information.

## Key Results
- Prices converge to Nash equilibrium at rate O(T^{-1/7}) when all sellers use SPE-BR
- Individual regret scales as O(T^{5/7}) relative to dynamic benchmark
- Novel sup-norm concentration results established for shape-constrained least squares estimator
- Equilibrium existence proven under s-concavity and monotonicity assumptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Semi-parametric least-squares estimation (LSE) under s-concavity constraints enables the uniform convergence required to bound regret, which standard L_2 convergence fails to guarantee.
- **Mechanism:** The algorithm treats demand as a Single Index Model (SIM) y_i = ψ_i(⟨θ_i, p⟩). By enforcing monotonicity and s-concavity constraints, it derives sup-norm concentration inequalities ensuring estimated demand remains close to true demand everywhere, not just on average.
- **Core assumption:** True demand link function ψ_i is s-concave (s_i > -1) and monotone increasing; exploration prices follow elliptically symmetric distribution.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints"; Section 2 states "L_2 convergence alone is insufficient to establish a regret bound, but uniform (supremum-norm) rate suffices."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The game converges to a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE) because the joint Best Response Operator Γ is a contraction mapping.
- **Mechanism:** Each seller updates price based on competitors' previous prices. The paper proves that the function mapping all prices to best-response prices has Lipschitz constant L_Γ < 1, ensuring any initial deviation from equilibrium shrinks geometrically over time.
- **Core assumption:** Influence of competitors' prices on a seller's optimal price is strictly weaker than influence of seller's own price (Assumption 3.6: sup_i ‖γ_i‖_1 / β_i < 1).
- **Evidence anchors:** Assumption 3.6 generalizes Li et al. (2024) result that Γ is a contraction with L_Γ < 1; Remark 5.8 states dynamics converge to pure Nash equilibrium without collusive behavior.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Splitting exploration phase into two distinct stages (one for index θ, one for link ψ) is necessary to establish theoretical bounds, as joint estimation lacks required uniform convergence guarantees.
- **Mechanism:** Stage 1 estimates linear parameter θ using normalized linear regression. Stage 2, conditional on θ̂_i, estimates non-parametric link function ψ_i using shape-constrained least squares. This separation allows independent application of consistency results for linear part and new sup-norm concentration results for shape-constrained part.
- **Core assumption:** Data from Stage 1 and Stage 2 are independent; sellers adhere to "common exploration phase" length.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 4 describes each seller choosing proportion κ_i of initial data points to estimate θ_i and subsequent points to estimate ψ_i; Appendix I.3 explains joint estimation lacks required uniform convergence.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Single Index Models (SIM)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core structural assumption for the demand function. It generalizes linear models by assuming demand depends on prices through a single linear combination θ^T p passed through a non-linear link ψ.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why E[y|p] = ψ(θ^T p) is more flexible than a linear model but more tractable than a fully non-parametric multivariate regression?

- **Concept: Contraction Mapping & Fixed Points**
  - **Why needed here:** The proof of equilibrium existence and convergence relies on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. You must understand that if a map shrinks distances (L < 1), repeated application converges to a single fixed point.
  - **Quick check question:** If the Lipschitz constant L_Γ were exactly 1.0, would the convergence proof in Equation (9) still hold?

- **Concept: Concentration Inequalities (Sup-norm vs. L_2)**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard regression analysis often proves convergence "on average" (L_2). This paper requires "worst-case" convergence (sup-norm) to ensure best-response optimization doesn't encounter unexpected spikes in estimated demand curve.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is sup_{u∈U} |ψ̂(u) - ψ(u)| ≤ ε a stronger condition than ∫(ψ̂ - ψ)^2 ≤ ε?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Exploration Module (Linear Sub-module -> Shape-Constrained Sub-module) -> Exploitation Module (Best Response Optimizer) -> Environment (N agents interacting simultaneously)

- **Critical path:** The accuracy of Best Response in Exploitation phase is entirely dependent on sup-norm error of Shape-Constrained Estimator. If ψ̂ deviates significantly at optimum, resulting price will be suboptimal.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Exploration Length (τ):** Paper optimally sets τ ∝ T^{5/7}. Longer exploration improves estimation (reducing "estimation error" term) but wastes time on random pricing (increasing "exploration cost" term).
  - **Split Ratio (κ):** Balancing data between estimating θ vs. ψ. Too little data for θ ruins index projection; too little for ψ ruins shape fit.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Oscillating Prices:** If prices do not settle, check Assumption 3.6 (L_Γ < 1). Market may be too competitive (high cross-elasticity γ).
  - **Boundary Saturation:** If estimated demand is flat or violates monotonicity, shape constraint solver may be misconfigured or data insufficient.
  - **Slow Convergence:** If convergence slower than O(T^{-1/7}), verify exploration distribution is elliptically symmetric.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check (Contraction):** Implement Best Response map with known parameters (skip estimation). Set β high and γ low; verify prices converge to theoretical NE in one step. Then increase γ until convergence fails.
  2. **Estimation Accuracy (Sup-norm):** Fix price vector and generate synthetic data. Run two-phase estimator. Plot true ψ vs. ψ̂. Verify maximum error decreases as n^{-2/5} (ignoring logs) as per Theorem D.6.
  3. **Regret Scaling:** Run full algorithm for varying horizons T ∈ {100, 1000, 5000}. Plot log(Regret) vs log(T). Verify slope approximately 5/7 ≈ 0.71.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the shape parameter s_i (defining degree of s-concavity) be estimated online rather than assumed known?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 7 states "estimating the s_i's themselves... remains to be explored," noting that while they assume these are known, in practice this may not be the case.
- **Why unresolved:** Current algorithm uses s_i as hard constraint for non-parametric least squares estimation. Estimating s_i introduces circular dependency where shape constraint depends on function estimate, potentially destabilizing contraction mapping required for Nash equilibrium convergence.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A consistent estimator for s_i that can be incorporated into dynamic pricing policy without violating theoretical guarantees of regret and equilibrium convergence.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Is it possible to achieve uniform convergence for a joint estimator of parametric and non-parametric components (θ_i, ψ_i)?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 7 identifies this as key theoretical goal, noting that currently θ_i and ψ_i are estimated on split data to ensure consistency, whereas joint estimator would leverage full sample size.
- **Why unresolved:** Existing results for joint estimators (e.g., Balabdaoui et al., 2019) only provide L_2 convergence, but regret analysis requires uniform (supremum-norm) concentration rates which are harder to establish for joint semi-parametric models.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A proof of concentration inequality for joint least-squares estimator under s-concavity establishing uniform convergence rate, or counter-example showing rate degrades.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can exploration-exploitation trade-off be bypassed by designing algorithm that uses entire history of prices and demands without distinct exploration phase?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 7 lists this as "ambitious direction," aiming to avoid "incomplete learning" where prices might converge to area yielding little information for parameter estimation.
- **Why unresolved:** Standard certainty-equivalence controls often lead to incomplete learning. Developing purely adaptive policy that maintains price diversity for estimation while competing for revenue requires balancing convergence to Nash equilibrium with persistence of excitation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Policy design and analysis showing price trajectory remains sufficiently rich for consistent estimation while achieving sublinear regret relative to full-information benchmark.

## Limitations

- The efficiency of the s-concavity least-squares estimator remains uncertain as designing efficient algorithms for this specific constraint is acknowledged as an open problem
- The contraction assumption (L_Γ < 1) is restrictive and the algorithm fails when cross-price sensitivities increase beyond a threshold
- The method relies on the demand function being s-concave, with no empirical validation for violations of this assumption

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The convergence rate of O(T^{-1/7}) to Nash equilibrium is well-supported by the contraction mapping framework and derivation of Γ as a contraction. The regret bound of O(T^{5/7}) follows directly from uniform estimation error bounds and structure of best-response optimization.
- **Medium confidence:** The two-stage estimation procedure (first θ, then ψ) is theoretically justified through sup-norm concentration results. However, practical efficiency of solving s-concave LSE remains uncertain due to open algorithmic question.
- **Low confidence:** The generalizability of shape-constrained approach to demand functions that are not s-concave. The paper doesn't provide empirical validation for violations of this assumption.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to s-concavity violation:** Generate synthetic demand data with known non-s-concave link function (e.g., bimodal or multi-modal). Run SPE-BR algorithm and measure whether prices still converge and whether regret remains bounded. Compare against standard no-regret algorithm.

2. **Cross-price sensitivity stress test:** Systematically vary the cross-price coefficient γ across sellers while holding β fixed. Identify threshold where L_Γ approaches 1 and measure breakdown in convergence rates. Compare empirical convergence to theoretical prediction from Assumption 3.6.

3. **Estimation efficiency benchmarking:** For fixed s-concave demand function, measure actual sup-norm error of shape-constrained estimator as function of exploration samples. Compare against theoretical rate O(n^{-2/5}) and against standard (non-shape-constrained) non-parametric estimator.
