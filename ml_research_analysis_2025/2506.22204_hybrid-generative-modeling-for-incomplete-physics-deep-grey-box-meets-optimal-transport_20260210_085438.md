# Hybrid Generative Modeling for Incomplete Physics: Deep Grey-Box Meets Optimal Transport

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.22204
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22204
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: OT grey-box models outperform black-box models on joint evaluation metrics (MMD, C2ST, N-RMSE) in physics translation tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of translating between unpaired distributions in physics applications where simulations from incomplete models differ from real-world observations. The authors propose a hybrid generative modeling approach that combines deep grey-box modeling with Optimal Transport methods. Their method learns conditional optimal stochastic maps between source (model) and target (data) distributions while preserving the structure of input samples with minimal change. The approach integrates OT maps in data space with grey-box models that explicitly incorporate known physics dynamics, ensuring correct usage of physics parameters while maintaining interpretability.

## Method Summary
The proposed method learns a conditional optimal stochastic map $\mathcal{T}_X$ from a source distribution $\mu$ (simulations from imperfect physics models) to a target distribution $\nu$ (real-world observations). The key innovation is integrating Optimal Transport (OT) in data space with grey-box models that explicitly incorporate known physics dynamics. The approach uses a discriminator $\mathcal{D}$ trained via an adversarial objective to minimize OT distance between generated samples and target data. The grey-box component preserves physical interpretability by incorporating known dynamics into the model structure, while the OT component handles the distributional shift between model and reality.

## Key Results
- OT grey-box models significantly outperform black-box models on joint evaluation metrics (MMD, C2ST, N-RMSE) across damped pendulum, reaction diffusion, and advection diffusion systems
- Grey-box models maintain smooth dynamics and stable predictions, whereas black-box models can produce physically implausible trajectories
- The method demonstrates superior ability to learn conditional mappings while preserving physical interpretability in stochastic settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the structure of known physics while correcting for systematic biases through Optimal Transport. By combining differentiable physics models (grey-box) with OT maps, the method can learn conditional mappings that respect physical constraints while adapting to real-world data distributions. The adversarial training ensures that the generated samples match the target distribution in marginal statistics, while the grey-box structure ensures that the learned transformations remain physically meaningful.

## Foundational Learning
- Optimal Transport theory: Needed for measuring and minimizing distributional differences between model and real data; quick check: verify Wasserstein distance computation
- Grey-box modeling: Required to incorporate known physics while allowing data-driven corrections; quick check: confirm physics parameters remain bounded during training
- Neural ODEs: Essential for learning continuous-time dynamics that respect physical laws; quick check: ensure ODE solver stability across training iterations
- Adversarial training: Critical for aligning generated and target distributions; quick check: monitor discriminator loss convergence
- Unpaired distribution matching: Core challenge addressed by the method; quick check: verify marginal distributions align post-training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Real Data $\rightarrow$ Discriminator $\rightarrow$ OT Map $\rightarrow$ Grey-Box Model $\rightarrow$ Generated Samples

**Critical Path:** The pipeline flows from target data through the discriminator, which guides the OT map, which transforms grey-box model outputs into realistic samples. The grey-box model itself processes physics parameters through known dynamics before OT correction.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method balances physical fidelity (through grey-box constraints) against distributional alignment (through OT). This creates tension between preserving physics structure and achieving perfect target distribution matching. The approach sacrifices some distributional accuracy for interpretability and physical consistency.

**Failure Signatures:** Black-box models may produce physically implausible trajectories or unstable dynamics. The OT component may struggle with high-dimensional spaces or very sparse target data. Grey-box models may be too constrained to capture all real-world phenomena if the underlying physics is poorly understood.

**First Experiments:**
1. Train on damped pendulum with known analytical solution to verify basic functionality
2. Compare grey-box vs black-box performance on reaction diffusion with controlled parameter variation
3. Test robustness to noise by adding observation noise to target data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the OT-based framework be extended to perform simultaneous physics parameter inference ($\theta$) alongside the generative task?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state their method "focuses specifically in the generative setting - without involving any physics parameter inference," distinguishing it from VAE-based grey-box approaches.
- Why unresolved: The current adversarial setup optimizes the marginal distribution $\hat{\nu}(y)$ but lacks a mechanism to regularize or recover the conditional parameters $\theta$ from target samples.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified architecture incorporating an encoder to infer $\theta$ from $y$, validated by high accuracy in parameter recovery tests.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the methodology be adapted for non-differentiable physics models or black-box commercial simulators?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion lists a limitation: "Grey-box models require differentiable physics models and may introduce computational complexity."
- Why unresolved: The proposed integration relies on backpropagation through the ODE solver (Neural ODE) to train the hybrid model $f_\phi \circ f_p$, which is impossible if $f_p$ has no analytical gradient.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of the framework using surrogate gradients or derivative-free optimization techniques on a non-differentiable source model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the approach maintain robustness when applied to real-world experimental data with observation noise and unmodeled external forcings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The evaluation is restricted to synthetic numerical experiments (damped pendulum, reaction-diffusion) where the Data Generating Process (DGP) is analytically defined and simulated.
- Why unresolved: Real-world systems often violate the assumption that the DGP differs from the model only by "missing terms," potentially degrading the Optimal Transport map's ability to correct the physics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the method to physical experimental datasets (e.g., fluid dynamics or structural monitoring) with unpaired observations.

## Limitations
- Computational cost of Optimal Transport methods may become prohibitive for high-dimensional systems or large datasets
- Method assumes incomplete physics models provide meaningful structural information, which may not hold for highly complex or poorly understood systems
- Evaluation relies primarily on synthetic data generation; real-world experimental validation remains limited

## Confidence
- Performance claims (black-box vs grey-box): High confidence
- OT + grey-box integration: Medium confidence
- Interpretability claims: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Validate the approach on experimental datasets from real-world physics systems, particularly those with significant model mismatch and stochastic behavior
2. Test scalability to higher-dimensional systems (e.g., fluid dynamics, multi-body systems) to assess computational efficiency and accuracy retention
3. Perform ablation studies systematically removing the physics constraints to quantify their contribution to performance gains across different system complexities
