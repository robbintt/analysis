- EthicsMH is a pilot dataset of 125 ethically charged mental health scenarios designed to evaluate AI systems' ethical reasoning

## Executive Summary
EthicsMH introduces a structured pilot benchmark for assessing AI ethical reasoning in mental health contexts. The dataset contains 125 scenarios across five ethical subcategories: confidentiality, bias (race and gender), and autonomy vs. beneficence for adults and minors. Each scenario includes multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. Developed through a human-in-the-loop process combining LLM generation with expert validation, EthicsMH enables assessment of AI systems not only on decision accuracy but also on explanation quality and alignment with professional norms. The structured schema supports research on fairness, ethical alignment, and sensitivity to patient-centered concerns.

## Method Summary
EthicsMH was constructed through a three-stage human-in-the-loop pipeline. First, ChatGPT was prompted with structured JSON templates to generate draft scenarios across five subcategories. Second, a mental health professional systematically reviewed each batch for realism, ethical trade-off quality, and stakeholder completeness. Third, expert feedback drove regeneration of scenarios to address identified issues. The final dataset contains 125 scenarios with eight structured fields each, including decision options, expected reasoning, stakeholder viewpoints, and real-world impact assessments. The approach balances scalability through synthetic generation with quality control through expert review.

## Key Results
- Pilot dataset of 125 structured mental health ethical scenarios covering confidentiality, bias, and autonomy-beneficence tensions
- Multi-field schema enables evaluation of decision accuracy, reasoning quality, stakeholder consideration, and real-world impact awareness
- Human-in-the-loop methodology combines LLM efficiency with expert validation to ensure clinical fidelity
- Structured viewpoints from multiple stakeholders (patient, therapist, legal, cultural, family) expose model blind spots in ethical reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured multi-field schema enables evaluation of both decision selection and reasoning quality, not just output correctness.
- Mechanism: Each scenario encodes decision options, expected reasoning, model behavior guidance, real-world impact, and stakeholder viewpoints. This creates multiple supervision signals: models can be assessed on whether their justifications align with professional norms, whether they consider diverse stakeholders, and whether they recognize downstream consequences—not merely whether they select the "correct" option.
- Core assumption: Expert-aligned reasoning in the dataset reflects professionally valid ethical judgment that models should approximate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Each scenario is enriched with structured fields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This structure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of explanation quality and alignment with professional norms."
  - [section 5] "Rather than only presenting a narrative case, the dataset provides structured fields that enable systematic analysis of decisions, reasoning processes, and stakeholder impacts."
  - [corpus] Related work (P-ReMIS) examines pragmatic reasoning in mental health but does not provide the structured multi-field annotation schema EthicsMH introduces.
- Break condition: If model responses are evaluated solely on option selection without examining reasoning alignment, the mechanism degrades to standard multiple-choice benchmarking.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Human-in-the-loop construction with iterative expert review mitigates synthetic artifact risks while preserving scale efficiency.
- Mechanism: LLMs generate draft scenarios from structured prompts; mental health professionals systematically review each batch for realism, ethical trade-off quality, and stakeholder completeness. Expert feedback drives regeneration rather than direct editing, preserving coherent narrative structure while improving clinical fidelity.
- Core assumption: Expert review catches clinically implausible or ethically oversimplified scenarios that pure synthetic generation would miss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "Every batch underwent systematic review by a mental health professional, who assessed whether the dilemmas were realistic, whether the ethical trade-offs were well-posed, and whether the stakeholder perspectives reflected actual therapeutic contexts."
  - [section 9] "While the scenarios were generated synthetically via large language models, every case was iteratively reviewed and refined by a mental health expert. This human-in-the-loop process mitigates, but does not eliminate risks of oversimplification, artificial phrasing, or subtle biases inherent to model outputs."
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence directly validates the effectiveness of this specific human-in-the-loop pipeline; comparative studies would be needed.
- Break condition: If expert reviewers apply inconsistent criteria across batches or lack domain expertise, quality variance increases and synthetic artifacts persist.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explicit multi-stakeholder viewpoint encoding exposes model blind spots in ethically contested scenarios.
- Mechanism: Each scenario includes structured viewpoints from patient, therapist, legal, cultural, and family perspectives. Models can be evaluated on whether their reasoning acknowledges these competing interests, revealing systematic omissions (e.g., consistently neglecting caregiver perspectives or cultural variation).
- Core assumption: Ethical reasoning quality correlates with explicit consideration of multiple stakeholder positions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "Viewpoints: Perspectives from multiple stakeholders (e.g., Patient, Therapist, Caregiver, Legal/Ethical) to encourage multi-view ethical reasoning."
  - [section 6] "EthicsMH enables diagnostic evaluations by providing explicit expected reasoning and multi-stakeholder viewpoints against which model explanations and decisions can be compared."
  - [corpus] PsychEthicsBench evaluates LLMs against Australian mental health ethics but uses a different evaluation framing; direct comparison of stakeholder encoding approaches is not available.
- Break condition: If models are prompted or fine-tuned to parrot viewpoints without genuine reasoning integration, evaluation signals become performative rather than diagnostic.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Bioethical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice)**
  - Why needed here: EthicsMH scenarios are explicitly structured around tensions among these principles (e.g., autonomy vs. beneficence for adults and minors). Understanding the framework is prerequisite to interpreting expected reasoning fields.
  - Quick check question: In a scenario where a competent adult refuses life-saving treatment, which principle supports their refusal and which supports intervention?

- Concept: **Multi-stakeholder ethical analysis**
  - Why needed here: Each scenario encodes viewpoints from patients, clinicians, families, and legal/cultural contexts. Evaluators must recognize that ethically defensible decisions often require balancing incompatible interests.
  - Quick check question: Name three stakeholders whose interests may conflict in a minor's mental health treatment decision.

- Concept: **Benchmark validity vs. reliability**
  - Why needed here: EthicsMH is explicitly a pilot (n=125) intended as a methodological blueprint, not a statistically robust benchmark. Distinguishing validity (measures what it claims) from reliability (produces consistent results) is essential for appropriate use.
  - Quick check question: Why does small sample size limit generalizable claims about model ethical reasoning capabilities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Scenario records -> JSON schema with 8 fields -> Subcategory stratification (5 categories × 25 scenarios) -> Evaluation surfaces (decision accuracy, reasoning alignment, stakeholder coverage, impact awareness)

- Critical path:
  1. Load scenario and present to model via appropriate prompt template
  2. Extract model's selected option and free-text reasoning
  3. Compare option against expected answer; analyze reasoning against expected_reasoning and viewpoints fields
  4. Log failure modes: option errors, stakeholder omissions, consequence blindness, oversimplified reasoning

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Pilot scale (125) vs. statistical power**: Small size enables rapid iteration and expert validation but precludes robust benchmarking claims
  - **Synthetic generation vs. ecological validity**: LLM-assisted creation improves scalability but may introduce subtle artifacts despite expert review
  - **Single-region perspective vs. cultural coverage**: Current version reflects limited cultural context; ethical norms vary significantly across jurisdictions

- Failure signatures:
  - Model selects correct option but provides reasoning that ignores key stakeholders (gaming the benchmark)
  - Model consistently defaults to paternalistic or autonomy-absolutist positions across all scenarios (ethical rigidity)
  - Model hallucinates legal requirements or jurisdictional rules not present in scenario (overconfident prescription)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Zero-shot baseline**: Present scenarios with standard prompt; measure option accuracy and qualitatively assess reasoning alignment with expected_reasoning field.
  2. **Stakeholder probing**: Modify prompt to explicitly require listing considered stakeholders before reasoning; compare coverage against encoded viewpoints.
  3. **Cross-category analysis**: Evaluate whether model performance differs across subcategories (e.g., better on confidentiality than bias scenarios), revealing systematic blind spots.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can evaluation metrics be designed to capture explanation quality and professional alignment in mental health AI?
- How do current state-of-the-art LLMs perform on the EthicsMH benchmark regarding decision accuracy and reasoning fidelity?
- How can the dataset be expanded to validly represent diverse cultural norms and legal frameworks in mental health practice?

## Limitations
- Pilot-scale size (125 scenarios) restricts statistical generalizability and precludes robust benchmarking claims
- Synthetic generation process may embed subtle cultural or linguistic artifacts despite expert review
- Current dataset reflects single-region ethical perspective, limiting applicability across different healthcare systems
- No baseline model evaluations included, leaving performance assessment to the community

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The structured multi-field schema design and its utility for evaluating reasoning quality beyond simple option selection
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the human-in-the-loop pipeline in mitigating synthetic artifact risks
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about systematic model blind spots across ethical subcategories

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-cultural validation**: Replicate the scenario generation process with mental health professionals from different regions/jurisdictions to assess cultural transferability and identify systematic perspective biases.

2. **Expert agreement study**: Have multiple mental health professionals independently evaluate a random sample of 25 scenarios to quantify inter-rater reliability on scenario quality, ethical trade-off appropriateness, and stakeholder viewpoint completeness.

3. **Model behavior replication**: Test the same scenarios with multiple state-of-the-art language models (at least 3 different models) to determine whether observed patterns in ethical reasoning and stakeholder consideration are consistent or model-specific.
