## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of streaming unlearning, where data deletion requests arrive incrementally rather than in batches, causing performance degradation and inefficiency in existing methods. The authors propose SAFE (Stream-Aware Forgetting), a novel streaming unlearning algorithm that formalizes unlearning as a distribution shift problem and estimates the altered distribution without requiring access to the original training data. SAFE incrementally updates model parameters using a risk estimator that balances retaining performance on remaining data while enforcing forgetting on deleted data.

The theoretical analysis establishes an O(√T + VT) error bound on streaming unlearning regret, significantly tighter than previous methods. Experiments across four datasets (MNIST, Fashion, CIFAR10, TinyImagenet) and multiple deep learning models show that SAFE consistently achieves the best or near-best performance in terms of remaining accuracy, forgetting accuracy, and test accuracy while being up to 9x faster than competing methods.

## Method Summary
SAFE formalizes streaming unlearning as a distribution shift problem where the original data distribution D is altered to D' after deletions. The algorithm incrementally updates model parameters by estimating the altered distribution from deletion requests alone, without requiring access to the original training data. It uses a risk estimator that balances two objectives: maintaining performance on the remaining data distribution and enforcing forgetting of the deleted data. The incremental update mechanism processes each deletion request sequentially, making it suitable for real-time streaming scenarios. Theoretical analysis provides a regret bound of O(√T + VT), where T is the number of time steps and V represents the variance in the distribution shift estimation.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 9x faster unlearning compared to competing methods
- Maintains superior or near-best performance across remaining accuracy, forgetting accuracy, and test accuracy metrics
- Demonstrates O(√T + VT) regret bound, significantly tighter than previous streaming unlearning approaches
- Validated across four datasets (MNIST, Fashion, CIFAR10, TinyImagenet) and multiple deep learning architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SAFE works by treating streaming unlearning as a distribution shift problem rather than requiring explicit access to deleted data. By estimating the altered data distribution from deletion patterns, it can incrementally update the model without the computational overhead of retraining or storing original data. The risk estimator effectively balances the dual objectives of forgetting deleted data while preserving performance on remaining data through careful parameter updates that account for the changing data distribution over time.

## Foundational Learning
- Distribution shift estimation: Critical for adapting the model to the altered data distribution after deletions; quick check involves validating the accuracy of distribution estimation against ground truth.
- Streaming regret bounds: Provides theoretical guarantees on performance degradation over time; quick check requires verifying the O(√T + VT) bound holds across different streaming scenarios.
- Incremental parameter updates: Enables real-time processing of deletion requests without full retraining; quick check involves measuring update time and accuracy trade-offs.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Deletion requests -> Distribution shift estimator -> Risk estimator -> Model parameter updater -> Updated model
Critical path: Each deletion request triggers distribution estimation, which feeds into risk calculation, leading to parameter updates that are applied to the model.
Design tradeoffs: Balances computational efficiency against accuracy by avoiding full retraining but potentially sacrificing some precision in distribution estimation.
Failure signatures: Poor distribution estimation leading to suboptimal forgetting, or excessive parameter updates causing model instability.
First experiments: 1) Test on synthetic streaming data with known deletion patterns, 2) Evaluate performance on MNIST with incremental deletions, 3) Compare against baseline unlearning methods on CIFAR10.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical assumptions about distribution shift estimation may not hold for complex deep learning models with non-IID distributions
- Performance comparisons limited to specific architectures and may not generalize to larger-scale problems
- Distribution shift estimation approach may fail when deletion patterns are sparse or adversarial

## Confidence
- Theoretical regret bound analysis: Medium confidence (relies on idealized assumptions)
- 9x speedup claim: Medium confidence (measured against limited baselines, hardware-dependent)
- Distribution shift estimation approach: Medium confidence (assumes deletable data distribution can be accurately modeled)

## Next Checks
1. Test SAFE's performance on long-tailed and non-IID streaming data distributions where deleted data constitutes a significant portion of certain classes
2. Evaluate scalability on larger models (e.g., transformers) and higher-resolution datasets to verify computational advantages
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of distribution shift estimation versus other algorithmic choices in SAFE
