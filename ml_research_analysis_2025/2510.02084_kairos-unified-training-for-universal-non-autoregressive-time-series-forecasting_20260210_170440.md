# KAIROS: Unified Training for Universal Non-Autoregressive Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.02084
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02084
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: KAIROS achieves forecasting performance on par with state-of-the-art autoregressive models, but with constant-time inference regardless of forecast horizon.

## Executive Summary
KAIROS introduces a unified training framework for universal non-autoregressive time series forecasting that addresses the critical challenge of efficient, accurate forecasting at web scale. The key innovation is the Scenario-Aware Generative Experts (SAGE) component, which uses a mixture-of-experts architecture to directly model segment-level multi-peak distributions and mitigate mode collapse. By predicting all future segments simultaneously in a single forward pass, KAIROS maintains constant inference time regardless of forecast horizon while matching the accuracy of autoregressive models. Evaluated on six benchmarks, the framework demonstrates significant efficiency gains without sacrificing predictive performance.

## Method Summary
KAIROS is a non-autoregressive (NAR) time series forecasting framework that uses an encoder-decoder architecture with adaptive granularity patching to tokenize input history. The core innovation is SAGE, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) layer that assigns multiple specialized experts to each forecast segment, enabling diverse predictions and preventing mode collapse. The model incorporates learnable exogenous vectors (LEV) and Segment Causal Residual Noise (SCRN) to capture latent variability and ensure temporal coherence. Training uses a combined loss function with MSE/MAE prediction loss, load balancing loss, and patch uniformity loss. The framework achieves zero-shot forecasting capability through pre-training on BLAST (321B observations).

## Key Results
- KAIROS achieves MSE/MAE performance comparable to state-of-the-art autoregressive models across six benchmark datasets
- Inference time remains nearly constant across different prediction lengths, while AR-based models show linear latency increase
- SAGE is the primary driver of accuracy, with auxiliary components (LEV, SCRN) providing limited additional benefit
- Ablation study confirms that expert collapse and insufficient experts lead to over-smoothing and degraded performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Segment-Level Parallel Decoding (NAR)
- **Claim**: Non-autoregressive decoding reduces inference latency to a constant factor regardless of forecast horizon
- **Mechanism**: Predicts all future segments simultaneously in a single forward pass rather than sequentially
- **Core assumption**: Temporal dependencies can be captured at segment level without strict sequential generation
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract states constant inference speed; Section 5.3 shows KAIROS maintains constant time while AR models scale linearly
- **Break condition**: If segments are too long or dependencies are strictly recursive across distant steps, parallel assumption may fail

### Mechanism 2: Mode Disentanglement via Scenario-Aware Experts (SAGE)
- **Claim**: Assigning multiple experts to specific forecast segments prevents mode collapse better than single predictor
- **Mechanism**: MoE layer with gating network routes inputs to specialized experts trained to predict distinct "plausible futures"
- **Core assumption**: Variability in time series can be decomposed into discrete scenarios learnable by different experts
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions diverse predictions and mitigating mode collapse; Section 5.4 ablation confirms SAGE as dominant contributor
- **Break condition**: If expert count is insufficient or gating network fails to differentiate scenarios, performance degrades to single predictor baseline

### Mechanism 3: Causal Residual Noise (SCRN)
- **Claim**: Structured noise from previous segment predictions improves temporal coherence between independent parallel segments
- **Mechanism**: Lightweight module refines current segment's prediction using learnable noise embedding conditioned on previous segment's output
- **Core assumption**: Segments need explicit local continuity correction that global encoder fails to provide
- **Evidence anchors**: Section 4.3 describes SCRN mechanism; Section 5.4 ablation shows marginal or negative benefits in some cases
- **Break condition**: If refinement signal conflicts with expert's specialized prediction, it acts as noise degrading accuracy

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Mode Collapse / Over-smoothing**
  - **Why needed here**: Central failure mode KAIROS solves - when model trained on multi-future possibilities outputs average of all possibilities rather than sharp predictions
  - **Quick check question**: If I train a model on dataset where Y is either +10 or -10 with equal probability, does model predict 0 (collapsed) or ±10 (distinct modes)?

- **Concept**: **Non-Autoregressive (NAR) vs. Autoregressive (AR) Decoding**
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding speed/accuracy tradeoff - AR is sequential (slow, high accuracy); NAR is parallel (fast, historically lower accuracy)
  - **Quick check question**: Does inference time increase as I request longer forecast horizon? (Yes for AR, No for NAR)

- **Concept**: **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**
  - **Why needed here**: Core engine of KAIROS (SAGE) uses MoE - must understand how "gating network" selects which "expert" processes current input
  - **Quick check question**: How does model decide which expert to use for specific time segment? (Answer: Learned gating network)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input History -> Adaptive Granularity Patching -> Encoder -> SAGE (MoE) -> LEV + SCRN -> Output Segments
- **Critical path**: Implementing SAGE module is highest priority - paper states it's primary driver of accuracy, while other modules are marginal
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Accuracy vs. Complexity (SAGE): Increasing experts improves mode coverage but increases parameter count
  - Coherence vs. Noise (SCRN): Paper shows SCRN is unstable - treat as optional/experimental
  - Exogenous Vectors (LEV): Ablation shows these often degrade performance - consider omitting initially
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Over-smoothed output: Indicates expert collapse (gating failure) or insufficient experts
  - Discontinuous segments: Suggests SCRN failure or lack of temporal conditioning
  - Slow Inference: Accidentally using sequential decoding logic instead of parallel segment generation
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline Validation**: Implement Encoder + SAGE only, validate against "Baseline + SAGE" row in Table 3
  2. **Inference Speed Benchmark**: Measure latency against prediction_length, verify flat line vs linear growth of AR baselines (Fig 5)
  3. **Ablation on Expert Count**: Vary k (active experts) and E (total experts) to replicate sensitivity analysis in Appendix Table 8/Figure 6

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can causal refinement mechanisms be designed to complement rather than conflict with specialized predictions generated by segment-level mixture-of-experts?
- **Basis in paper**: Authors state future work must focus on designing refinement strategies that reinforce rather than conflict with expert predictions, noting current SCRN module sometimes acts as disturbance
- **Why unresolved**: SCRN provided only marginal benefits or offset gains in ablation, suggesting refinement signal conflicts with experts' specialized outputs
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Refined mechanism that consistently improves MSE/MAE when added to SAGE configuration across all benchmark datasets without trade-off in inference speed

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can latent exogenous variability be modeled effectively in non-autoregressive frameworks without introducing stochastic noise that degrades forecast accuracy?
- **Basis in paper**: Authors report Learnable Exogenous Vectors (LEV) "often degrade performance" because they struggle to distinguish informative latent factors from stochastic perturbations
- **Why unresolved**: Attempt to capture hidden external factors via learnable vectors resulted in noise amplification and overfitting
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Method for modeling exogenous factors that demonstrates statistically significant positive performance gain over baseline in ablation study

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can non-autoregressive architectures surpass autoregressive foundation models in absolute accuracy, rather than just matching them while offering efficiency gains?
- **Basis in paper**: Authors claim KAIROS delivers performance "comparable" or "on par" with state-of-the-art models, framing NAR as "scalable paradigm" rather than strictly superior accuracy model
- **Why unresolved**: While KAIROS solves efficiency bottleneck, results show it trades blows with AR models rather than establishing clear dominance in predictive power
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Large-scale evaluation where NAR model strictly outperforms best available AR baselines on majority of benchmark datasets and horizons

## Limitations

- Evaluation primarily focuses on accuracy and inference speed but doesn't adequately address robustness to noisy or irregular time series data common in real-world applications
- While claiming universality, evaluation is limited to six datasets (mostly energy and weather), raising questions about generalizability to domains like finance or healthcare
- Paper doesn't provide comprehensive cost-benefit analysis comparing parameter efficiency of KAIROS against simpler NAR alternatives, making practical deployment trade-offs unclear

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core claim that KAIROS achieves constant-time inference regardless of forecast horizon is well-supported by direct experimental evidence (Figure 5) and aligns with NAR decoding properties. Claim that SAGE is primary driver of accuracy is strongly supported by ablation study (Table 3).

**Medium Confidence**: Claim that KAIROS matches AR model accuracy while maintaining NAR speed is supported by main results table, but margin of improvement over other NAR models is modest (1-2% on average). "Web-scale" applicability claim is more marketing than technical.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about effectiveness of SCRN and LEV are weakly supported - SCRN actually shows negative effects in some cases (Table 3), and LEV often degrades performance (Table 2). These components appear included more for completeness than proven utility.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate KAIROS on datasets with injected noise, missing values, and irregular sampling intervals to assess real-world applicability beyond clean benchmark data

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Test model on time series from fundamentally different domains (financial markets, medical monitoring, sensor networks) to validate "universal" forecasting claim across diverse data distributions

3. **Parameter Efficiency Analysis**: Compare parameter count, memory usage, and training/inference energy consumption of KAIROS against both AR baselines and simpler NAR alternatives to quantify practical cost of additional complexity
