# A Multi-Objective Evaluation Framework for Analyzing Utility-Fairness Trade-Offs in Machine Learning Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.11120
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11120
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Novel multi-objective evaluation framework for analyzing utility-fairness trade-offs in ML systems using Pareto Front analysis and five complementary performance indicators

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive multi-objective evaluation framework for analyzing trade-offs between utility and fairness in machine learning systems. The framework leverages Pareto Front analysis to identify non-dominated solutions and uses five complementary performance indicators (Hypervolume, Uniform Distribution, Overall Pareto Spread, and two Nondominated Vector Generation metrics) to characterize solution quality. Through radar chart visualization and measurement tables, the framework provides both qualitative and quantitative assessment of ML systems across multiple dimensions including convergence, diversity, and system capacity. The approach is validated through simulations and an empirical study on a medical imaging dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in comparing different ML strategies for decision-makers in fairness-critical applications.

## Method Summary
The framework takes test datasets and model predictions as input, filters non-dominated solutions to form a Pareto Front, and computes five MOO performance indicators. These indicators are normalized to [0,1] and visualized via radar charts while also presented in measurement tables. The method supports both white-box systems (multiple solutions across tuning parameters) and black-box systems (single solution point). For empirical validation, the authors use the Harvard Glaucoma Fairness dataset with Pareto HyperNetworks to generate 25 sub-networks optimizing for accuracy and equalized odds fairness across race and gender attributes. The framework calculates HV, UD, OS, and ONVG/ONVGR metrics to comprehensively characterize the trade-off landscape.

## Key Results
- Framework successfully distinguishes between ML systems with different utility-fairness trade-off characteristics using five complementary MOO indicators
- HV metric proves most reliable for overall system discrimination, particularly when other indicators conflict
- Radar chart visualization with polygon area calculation provides compact, interpretable comparison across systems
- Empirical study on HGF dataset demonstrates framework's ability to reveal subtle differences between fairness-aware ML strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The framework enables comprehensive comparison of ML systems across multiple conflicting objectives by leveraging Pareto Front analysis
- **Mechanism:** Uses dominance relationships from Multi-Objective Optimization to identify non-dominated solutions where no other solution can improve one objective without degrading another
- **Core assumption:** Conflicting objectives exist such that improving one degrades another, creating meaningful trade-offs amenable to PF analysis
- **Evidence anchors:** Section III-B defines Pareto optimality and dominance relationships; similar approaches used in fairness-aware insurance pricing

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Five complementary performance indicators jointly characterize PF quality across convergence, diversity, and capacity dimensions
- **Mechanism:** Hypervolume captures convergence-diversity jointly; UD measures distribution uniformity; OS measures spread toward ideal extremes; ONVG/ONVGR quantify cardinality of non-dominated solutions
- **Core assumption:** These indicators together sufficiently capture the multidimensional quality of trade-off systems for decision-making
- **Evidence anchors:** Section III-B1 provides explicit formulations; simulations show HV reliability when other indicators conflict

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Radar chart visualization with polygon area calculation provides compact, interpretable summary for comparing multiple ML systems
- **Mechanism:** Normalizes all indicator scores to [0,1], plots as radar chart, and computes polygon area using Surveyor's formula
- **Core assumption:** Equal weighting of indicators is appropriate for overall quality assessment
- **Evidence anchors:** Section III-C explains area calculation benefits; Section V acknowledges equal weighting limitation

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pareto Optimality and Dominance**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework rests on identifying non-dominated solutions and characterizing their distribution
  - Quick check question: Given two solutions with utilities (0.8, 0.7) and fairness scores (0.6, 0.9) in a maximization problem, which dominates the other, if any?

- **Concept: Multi-Objective Optimization Performance Metrics**
  - Why needed here: Understanding what HV, UD, OS, ONVG, ONVGR each measure is essential to interpret radar charts correctly
  - Quick check question: Why does HV uniquely capture both convergence and diversity, while UD and OS do not?

- **Concept: Fairness Definitions in ML (Equalized Odds, Demographic Parity)**
  - Why needed here: The framework is model-agnostic to specific fairness metrics, but practitioners must select appropriate ones for their context
  - Quick check question: In a medical diagnosis task, why might equalized odds be preferred over demographic parity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Test dataset + predictions -> Filter non-dominated solutions -> Compute 5 MOO indicators -> Normalize to [0,1] -> Generate radar chart + measurement table

- **Critical path:**
  1. Obtain predictions across tuning parameters (white-box) or single point (black-box)
  2. Identify non-dominated solutions using dominance relation
  3. Set reference/nadir point appropriately for each objective
  4. Compute HV (most discriminative), then UD, OS, ONVG, ONVGR
  5. Handle edge cases (single-solution systems -> skip UD/OS)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Equal vs. weighted indicators: Current design uses equal weighting; extensible to dynamic weighting
  - Black-box vs. white-box: White-box enables richer diversity/convergence analysis
  - Computational cost: HV scales exponentially with number of objectives

- **Failure signatures:**
  - ONVG/ONVGR = 1.00 for all systems (black-box single-solution case)
  - UD/OS undefined (fewer than 2 non-dominated solutions)
  - HV contradicts other indicators (use HV as primary decision criterion)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce UC-1 simulation: Two black-box systems with single solutions - verify only HV is discriminative
  2. Reproduce UC-3 simulation: Two white-box systems with multiple solutions - validate all 5 indicators produce meaningful differences
  3. Apply to HGF dataset with different utility metric: Swap accuracy for F1-score - assess whether ranking changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can dynamic weighting schemes for MOO performance indicators improve decision-making accuracy when certain indicators are less relevant than others?
- **Open Question 2:** Do alternative performance indicators such as Inverted Generational Distance provide better computational efficiency while maintaining discriminative power as the number of fairness objectives scales?
- **Open Question 3:** How robust is the framework's system ranking to variations in the reference point selection for Hypervolume calculation?

## Limitations
- Equal weighting of five indicators may not reflect domain-specific priorities
- HV computational complexity grows exponentially with number of objectives
- Framework assumes meaningful trade-offs exist between objectives

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Pareto Front analysis correctly identifies non-dominated solutions; HV metric reliably captures convergence and diversity; radar chart visualization effectively communicates multi-dimensional comparisons
- **Medium Confidence:** Equal weighting provides balanced assessment; framework generalizes across architectures; simulation results translate to real-world settings
- **Low Confidence:** Effectiveness with >3 objectives; performance when objectives don't conflict; sensitivity to specific fairness metric choices

## Next Checks
1. **Objective Conflict Sensitivity Test:** Systematically evaluate framework behavior when varying correlation between utility and fairness objectives from strongly negative to strongly positive
2. **Scalability Benchmark:** Apply framework to synthetic problems with 4-6 objectives, comparing HV performance against IGD and measuring computational time scaling
3. **Weighting Scheme Sensitivity:** Implement dynamic indicator weighting based on domain priorities and re-evaluate HGF dataset comparison, measuring how different weighting schemes affect system rankings
