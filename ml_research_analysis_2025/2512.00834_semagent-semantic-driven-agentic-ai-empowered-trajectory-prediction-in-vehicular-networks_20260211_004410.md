## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurate trajectory prediction in vehicular networks by integrating semantic communication with Agentic AI. The proposed SemAgent framework employs a multi-agent collaborative approach, where feature extraction agents derive compact representations from vehicle trajectories, semantic analysis agents perform contextual reasoning, and trajectory prediction agents combine these insights with historical data. The system operates in both vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication modes, using semantic communication to transmit task-relevant information rather than raw data, thereby reducing overhead and enhancing environmental understanding. Extensive experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate that SemAgent significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

## Method Summary
The SemAgent framework integrates semantic communication with a three-agent architecture for trajectory prediction. The system processes 8-second trajectory clips (3s history → 5s prediction) using KANLinear-based semantic encoder/decoder modules. The feature extraction agent computes motion, statistical, and spatiotemporal features; the semantic analysis agent performs contextual reasoning about traffic conditions; and the trajectory prediction agent fuses these inputs with historical data. The semantic communication module compresses 384-dimensional features to 32 dimensions before transmission over an AWGN channel, then reconstructs them at the receiver. The framework supports both V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure) and V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication modes with configurable channel bandwidth ratios.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low SNR conditions (0dB)
- Demonstrates consistent performance gains across varying prediction horizons (1s, 3s, 5s)
- Shows robust performance with semantic communication reducing bandwidth requirements by transmitting compact feature vectors instead of raw trajectory data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Compression for Channel Resilience
Transmitting task-relevant semantic features rather than raw bitstreams maintains prediction accuracy even under degraded channel conditions. The system uses a semantic encoder (KANLinear layers) to compress high-dimensional trajectory and environmental data into compact feature vectors (e.g., 384 to 32 dimensions). This reduces bandwidth usage and filters out non-essential information before transmission over a noisy wireless channel (AWGN). Core assumption: The "meaning" of the traffic scene can be captured in lower-dimensional vectors without losing critical decision-making utility.

### Mechanism 2: Decoupled Agentic Reasoning
Decomposing trajectory prediction into specialized roles (Feature Extraction, Semantic Analysis, Prediction) allows for better handling of environmental context than monolithic black-box models. Instead of a direct history-to-future map, a Feature Agent extracts statistical/kinematic features, and a Semantic Agent (implied LLM-based) interprets these to detect anomalies or congestion. This structured context is fed to the Prediction Agent. Core assumption: Intermediate semantic reasoning provides better priors for future motion than raw historical coordinates alone.

### Mechanism 3: Collaborative Prediction Fusion (V2I/V2V)
Fusing local historical data with external semantic data (from RSUs or neighbors) corrects for local perception blind spots. In V2I, the vehicle acts as a "reasoning client" using global RSU data. In V2V, vehicles exchange future predicted trajectories to resolve mutual conflicts. Core assumption: Neighboring agents share truthful and accurate trajectory intents.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Semantic Communication (SemCom)**
- Why needed: Replaces traditional bit-transmission with "meaning" transmission. Goal is to preserve *task performance* (predicting coordinates), not signal reconstruction fidelity.
- Quick check: If channel noise increases, should the semantic encoder increase redundancy or reduce semantic detail?

**Concept: Agentic AI Workflow**
- Why needed: The system is not a single neural net; it is a pipeline of specialized agents. Understanding the separation between "perception" (Feature Agent) and "logic" (Semantic Agent) is key to debugging.
- Quick check: Which agent is responsible for detecting a "sudden congestion" event versus calculating the velocity of a car?

**Concept: Trajectory Error Metrics (ADE/FDE)**
- Why needed: The paper optimizes for Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE). These differ in sensitivity to long-term drift vs. immediate accuracy.
- Quick check: If a car predicts a lane change correctly but gets the timing wrong by 0.5s, which metric (ADE or FDE) is likely to suffer more?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
- RSU Node: Data Source -> Feature Extraction Agent -> Semantic Analysis Agent -> Semantic Encoder -> Channel Encoder
- Vehicle Node: Channel Decoder -> Semantic Decoder -> Trajectory Prediction Agent -> (Output: Predicted Path)
- V2V Module: Local History -> Local Agents -> Tx (SemCom) <-> Rx (SemCom) -> Neighbor Fusion

**Critical path:** The link between the Semantic Analysis Agent (outputting the structured report) and the Semantic Encoder is critical; if the report format drifts, the encoder may fail.

**Design tradeoffs:** The paper trades computational overhead (running multiple agents) for bandwidth efficiency and robustness to low SNR.

**Failure signatures:**
- Semantic Hallucination: The Semantic Agent invents traffic patterns not supported by the feature extraction data.
- Channel Collapse: At SNR < 0 dB (if tested), the KANLinear decoder may output "dead" features (zeros), causing the prediction agent to default to simple linear extrapolation.

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Ablation Check: Run the LLM-only baseline vs. SemAgent (V2I) to verify the 2x improvement claimed in Section VI-C.
2. SNR Stress Test: Incrementally lower SNR from 20dB to 0dB and plot the degradation of ADE to verify the "graceful degradation" claim.
3. Schema Validation: Test the V2V mode with and without neighbor trajectory exchange to quantify the specific contribution of cooperative fusion.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can the SemAgent framework generalize effectively to complex urban driving environments with traffic signals, pedestrians, and heterogeneous road users, given it was validated exclusively on highway data? The experimental evaluation was restricted to the US-101 highway subset of the NGSIM dataset, which lacks the complex intersections and traffic control devices handled by the semantic analysis agent.

**Open Question 2:** Is the computational latency of the LLM-based Agentic AI modules compatible with the strict real-time constraints of autonomous driving safety systems? The framework relies on Large Language Models for the feature extraction and semantic analysis agents to perform contextual reasoning, but the paper does not report the inference time or computational overhead of these agents.

**Open Question 3:** How robust is the trajectory prediction against semantic noise or "hallucinations" generated by the reasoning agents, and how do these high-level errors impact safety compared to raw data noise? The semantic analysis agent detects anomalies (e.g., accidents, road closures) based on features; however, the paper only evaluates positional errors against SNR levels, not the accuracy of the semantic reasoning itself.

## Limitations
- Implementation Dependency on LLM Backbone: Performance gains are heavily contingent on specific LLM used for semantic analysis and prediction agents.
- NGSIM Dataset Limitations: Experiments conducted on highway data may not scale to complex urban scenarios with mixed traffic.
- Multi-Agent Synchronization Assumptions: V2V mode assumes reliable, low-latency exchange of predicted trajectories without adequately addressing prediction staleness at high speeds.

## Confidence

**Semantic Communication Performance Claims:** High - The mechanism of semantic compression for channel resilience is theoretically sound and the 47.5% improvement under low SNR is well-supported by experimental design.

**Agentic AI Architecture Benefits:** Medium - While the multi-agent decomposition is conceptually valid, specific performance gains from the three-agent structure would benefit from more direct ablation studies.

**V2V Cooperative Fusion Claims:** Low - The paper asserts trajectory prediction improves through V2V exchange but provides limited quantitative analysis of how this compares to V2I-only approaches.

## Next Checks

1. **LLM-Agnostic Performance Test:** Implement SemAgent framework with at least two different LLM backbones to verify the 47.5% SNR improvement is architecture-dependent rather than model-dependent.

2. **Urban Dataset Validation:** Test the complete SemAgent pipeline on an urban driving dataset to assess whether semantic communication benefits persist in more complex traffic scenarios.

3. **Latency-Impact Analysis:** Conduct experiments varying communication delay between V2V exchanges (0ms, 50ms, 100ms, 200ms) while keeping vehicle speed constant to quantify how prediction staleness affects trajectory accuracy.
