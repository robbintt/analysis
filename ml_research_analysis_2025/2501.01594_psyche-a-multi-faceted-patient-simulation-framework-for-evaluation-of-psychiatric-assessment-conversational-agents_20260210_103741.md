# PSYCHE: A Multi-faceted Patient Simulation Framework for Evaluation of Psychiatric Assessment Conversational Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.01594
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01594
- Reference count: 40
- Ten board-certified psychiatrists validated simulated patient utterances, achieving 93% average conformity score across seven disorders

## Executive Summary
PSYCHE is a framework for evaluating psychiatric assessment conversational agents (PACAs) using simulated patients grounded in multi-faceted psychiatric constructs. The framework defines patient profiles, histories, and behaviors based on the Mental Status Examination, enabling clinically realistic simulations. Ten board-certified psychiatrists validated the simulated patient utterances, achieving an average conformity score of 93% across seven disorders. The construct-grounded evaluation showed strong correlation (r = 0.85) with expert ratings, while ablation studies confirmed that including multi-faceted behavior instructions significantly improves patient simulation fidelity.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a 4-stage pipeline: (a) user specifies diagnosis/age/sex, (b) GPT-4o sequentially generates MFC-Profile → MFC-History → MFC-Behavior, (c) PSYCHE-SP (GPT-4o) interviews PACA using these constructs, (d) evaluator extracts Construct-PACA from PACA's report and compares against Construct-SP using PSYCHE RUBRIC. The evaluation uses weighted scoring (wImpulsivity=5, wBehavior=2, wSubjective=1) to prioritize safety elements, with G-Eval for open-ended elements.

## Key Results
- Ten board-certified psychiatrists validated simulated patient utterances, achieving 93% average conformity score across seven disorders
- Construct-grounded evaluation showed strong correlation (r = 0.85) with expert ratings
- Ablation study confirmed that including multi-faceted behavior instructions significantly improves patient simulation fidelity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Providing a multi-faceted construct (MFC) to a simulated patient yields higher clinical fidelity than simple "act-like-a-patient" prompts. The MFC (comprising Profile, History, and Behavior) acts as a detailed psychiatric schema. By explicitly defining symptoms, history, and behavioral instructions (based on the Mental Status Examination), the LLM is constrained to a consistent persona, mitigating the "helpful assistant" bias where models typically organize answers too neatly. Evidence: ablation study results show PSYCHE-SP significantly outperforms non-MFC versions in "Speech characteristics" and "Affect."

### Mechanism 2
Comparing an agent's extracted report (Construct-PACA) against the ground truth (Construct-SP) serves as a valid quantitative proxy for expert psychiatric evaluation. Instead of evaluating "chat quality," this mechanism evaluates "information gathering accuracy." If the PACA correctly identifies the pre-defined elements embedded in the SP, it demonstrates functional competence. Evidence: strong correlation ($r = 0.85$) with expert ratings demonstrated through scatter plots.

### Mechanism 3
Sequential generation of the patient construct (Profile → History → Behavior) improves internal consistency and manageability for the LLM. Generating a full psychiatric profile in one pass often leads to logical contradictions or "lost-in-the-middle" context issues. By chaining the generation, the system ensures the patient's current mental state is a plausible derivative of their background. Evidence: methods section states this approach mitigates context issues and generates more consistent behavior.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Mental Status Examination (MSE)**
  - **Why needed here**: The PSYCHE framework relies heavily on "MFC-Behavior," which is explicitly based on MSE categories (mood, affect, insight, thought process). You cannot debug the SP's prompt without understanding the difference between *mood* (subjective) and *affect* (objective).
  - **Quick check question**: Can you distinguish between a patient having "depressed mood" vs. "restricted affect"?

- **Concept**: **Construct Validity in Evaluation**
  - **Why needed here**: The framework uses a "construct" (a structured definition of the patient) as the ground truth. Understanding that this is a proxy for reality (simulating a complex human via JSON) is vital for interpreting the PSYCHE SCORE.
  - **Quick check question**: Does a high conformity score (93%) mean the AI is sentient, or just that it adheres to the script provided in the prompt?

- **Concept**: **Rubric-based vs. Embedding-based Evaluation**
  - **Why needed here**: PSYCHE uses a specific weighted rubric (PSYCHE RUBRIC) rather than vector similarity. The weights (e.g., $w_{Impulsivity}=5$) prioritize safety over data retrieval.
  - **Quick check question**: Why would the system assign a score of 0 for underestimating suicide risk, even if the rest of the interview was perfect?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: User Input → MFC Generator (GPT-4o) → PSYCHE-SP (GPT-4o) → PACA → Evaluator
- **Critical path**: The **MFC Generation** → **Utterance Simulation** interface. If the MFC JSON is malformed or the SP prompt fails to enforce the MFC, the evaluation loop is invalid.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Safety vs. Realism**: The study notes a 0% conformity score for "Homicide risk" in Bipolar Disorder due to GPT-4o's internal safety filters
  - **Specificity vs. Generalizability**: Fixed values for high-stakes elements (e.g., Suicide Risk fixed to "High" for MDD profiles) force training on difficult scenarios
- **Failure signatures**:
  - "Helpful Patient" Syndrome: SP organizes symptoms chronologically and uses medical terminology
  - Role Reversal: SP accidentally adopts doctor's role, asking "How can I help you?"
  - Insight Drift: SP alternates inconsistently between "denying illness" and "seeking help"
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Ablation of MFC-Behavior**: Run simulation with only MFC-Profile, expect significant drop in "Affect" and "Speech characteristic" fidelity
  2. **Weight Sensitivity Analysis**: Vary weights ($w_{Impulsivity}$ vs. $w_{Behavior}$) to test correlation robustness (Results show min $r=0.78$)
  3. **Safety Jailbreak Test**: Attempt to force SP to reveal system prompt using "System error" or "Role reversal" prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can the PSYCHE framework be effectively extended to evaluate agents assessing disorders outside the initial seven target conditions or other medical domains? The authors expect extension to other psychiatric or medical assessment procedures, but validation exists only for seven specific disorders.
- **Open Question 2**: How can the framework overcome base LLM safety alignments that currently prevent the simulation of high-risk behaviors necessary for clinical realism? The simulation of "Homicide risk" in Bipolar Disorder failed completely (0% conformity) due to GPT-4o's internal policies.
- **Open Question 3**: Can the simulation of nuanced clinical concepts, particularly distinct stages of "insight," be improved to match expert expectations? The study found low conformity for "Insight" in OCD and PTSD (50%), attributed to LLM's lack of understanding of various insight stages.

## Limitations
- Human validation scalability: 93% conformity depends on expert validation of only 40 utterance pairs across seven disorders, with unclear generalizability
- Safety filter artifacts: Framework's handling of high-stakes elements raises questions about whether simulation captures realistic clinical variability or creates artificial scenarios
- Correlation interpretation: Strong r=0.85 correlation with expert ratings lacks confidence intervals or p-values, and could reflect shared biases

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Multi-faceted construct approach improves simulation fidelity compared to simple prompts (supported by ablation study)
- **Medium Confidence**: Construct-grounded evaluation correlates well with expert ratings (r=0.85), though limited validation data reduces certainty
- **Low Confidence**: Framework's ability to handle safety-critical elements without safety filter interference, and whether sequential generation consistently prevents contradictions

## Next Checks
1. **Inter-rater reliability assessment**: Have multiple board-certified psychiatrists independently validate 100+ randomly sampled patient utterances across all seven disorders to establish confidence intervals for conformity scores
2. **Safety filter boundary testing**: Systematically test whether framework can simulate rare but clinically important scenarios without LLM safety filters suppressing outputs, using 50 safety-critical scenarios
3. **Natural variability validation**: Generate 1000 patient profiles per disorder and compare symptom distributions against real-world clinical data to assess whether fixed-value approach constrains clinical diversity
