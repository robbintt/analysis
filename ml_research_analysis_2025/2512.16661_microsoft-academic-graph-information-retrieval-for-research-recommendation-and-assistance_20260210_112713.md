# Microsoft Academic Graph Information Retrieval for Research Recommendation and Assistance

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.16661
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16661
- **Reference count:** 1
- **Primary result:** Proposed GNN-based citation retriever underperforms BM25 and SBERT baselines (Recall@10 47.43% for hybrid approach vs 0.24% for proposed model)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a GNN-based retriever with attention pruning for academic citation recommendation. The system processes paper queries by identifying a seed node through semantic similarity, then uses a GAT-based attention retriever to find relevant citations within an expanded subgraph. An LLM re-ranking step attempts to improve results. When evaluated on a 1,000-paper test subset from Microsoft Academic Graph, the proposed approach significantly underperforms traditional baselines like BM25 and SBERT, achieving only 0.24% Recall@10 compared to 47.43% for a hybrid approach. The LLM re-ranking did not provide meaningful improvements, likely due to limited subgraph context and the semantic complexity of academic queries.

## Method Summary
The approach processes academic paper queries to recommend citations using a three-layer GATConv architecture with ELU activations and attention pruning. For each query, semantic similarity identifies a seed node, then the retriever expands the subgraph for L hops and prunes nodes below attention threshold σ. The system generates embeddings from concatenated title, abstract, keywords, and DOI using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim). Evaluation metrics include Precision@10, Recall@10, MRR, and nDCG@10. An optional LLM re-ranking step uses meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct (8-bit quantized) to re-order top candidates. The method was implemented in PyTorch and PyG on NVIDIA L4 GPU.

## Key Results
- Proposed GNN-based retriever achieved only 0.24% Recall@10 on test subset
- BM25 and SBERT baselines significantly outperformed the proposed model
- Hybrid approach combining methods achieved best performance (Recall@10 of 47.43%)
- LLM re-ranking did not significantly improve retrieval quality
- Poor performance attributed to graph sparsity (170 edges for 8,967 nodes)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper does not provide a detailed mechanism explanation for why the approach works or fails. The authors attribute poor performance primarily to graph sparsity and limited subgraph context for LLM re-ranking, but do not elaborate on the underlying technical reasons for the observed performance gap between the proposed method and baselines.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Attention Networks (GATConv)**: Used for learning node representations by attending over neighbors; needed for capturing citation relationships; quick check: verify attention weights sum to 1
- **Attention Pruning**: Removes nodes below attention threshold to reduce computation; needed for scalability; quick check: monitor subgraph size after pruning
- **Semantic Similarity Search**: Finds seed nodes matching query embeddings; needed for initial retrieval; quick check: validate cosine similarity scores
- **Knowledge Graph Verbalization**: Converts subgraph context to text for LLM; needed for re-ranking; quick check: inspect triplet format
- **Re-ranking with LLMs**: Uses language models to reorder retrieval results; needed for refinement; quick check: compare rankings before/after re-ranking

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Query -> Semantic Similarity -> Seed Node -> GATConv Retriever -> Attention Pruning -> Subgraph Expansion -> Ranking -> LLM Re-ranking -> Final Results

**Critical Path**: Query processing → Seed node identification via semantic similarity → GAT-based retrieval with attention pruning → Subgraph expansion and ranking → Optional LLM re-ranking

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational efficiency (via attention pruning) for potential accuracy loss. Using homogeneous graphs instead of heterogeneous ones simplifies implementation but may lose information. The LLM re-ranking adds computational overhead without significant quality improvement in this case.

**Failure Signatures**: Extremely low Recall@10 metrics (0.24%) indicate fundamental issues with retrieval effectiveness. Lack of improvement from LLM re-ranking suggests the subgraph context is insufficient for meaningful refinement. Graph sparsity manifests as disconnected components or minimal citation links.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify MAG subset connectivity by computing average node degree and checking the 170 edges for 8,967 test nodes
2. Implement retriever with multiple pruning thresholds (σ = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) and hop counts (L = 1, 2, 3) to establish sensitivity
3. Test retriever on a more densely connected citation graph subset to isolate whether poor performance stems from graph sparsity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Extremely low baseline performance (0.24% Recall@10) compared to traditional methods raises questions about implementation correctness
- Critical hyperparameters (attention pruning threshold σ and hop count L) are unspecified
- LLM re-ranking provides no meaningful improvement due to limited subgraph context
- GAT-based approach underperforms simpler methods like BM25 and SBERT

## Confidence
- **Major claim (model underperformance)**: Low confidence due to implementation ambiguities and anomalous baseline metrics
- **Attribution to graph sparsity**: Medium confidence, as authors acknowledge this but don't provide sufficient evidence
- **LLM re-ranking ineffectiveness**: Medium confidence based on reported results

## Next Checks
1. Verify the MAG subset connectivity by computing average node degree and ensuring the 170 edges for 8,967 test nodes are correct
2. Implement the retriever with multiple values of σ (0.1, 0.3, 0.5) and L (1, 2, 3) to establish sensitivity and determine if performance improves with different pruning thresholds
3. Test the retriever on a more densely connected citation graph subset to determine if the poor performance is indeed due to graph sparsity as claimed by the authors
