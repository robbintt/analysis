## Quick Facts

- One-line primary result: Novel normalizing flow architectures and diverse generative model applications including corn seed quality assessment, geological mapping, face anonymization, art restoration, and traffic sign detection

## Executive Summary
This thesis presents novel contributions to both generative modeling theory and practical applications. In the first part, we develop efficient normalizing flow architectures including CInC Flow with mathematically proven invertible 3×3 convolutions, Quad-coupling layers for enhanced expressiveness, and Inverse-Flow for accelerated sampling. These innovations improve computational efficiency while maintaining model performance. In the second part, we apply generative models to real-world problems: automated corn seed quality assessment using conditional GANs, geological mapping through stacked autoencoders with k-means clustering, face anonymization for autonomous driving datasets, image art restoration using diffusion models, and robust missing traffic sign detection. Key results include achieving 80% accuracy in seed classification, generating detailed geological maps from Sentinel-2 data, preserving task performance while anonymizing faces, and achieving 90.5% mean average precision for traffic sign detection. Our work advances both theoretical understanding and practical utility of generative models across multiple domains.

## Method Summary
The thesis develops CInC Flow using invertible 3×3 convolutions with triangular matrix structure (left/top padding only), Quad-coupling layers dividing input into 4 blocks for enhanced expressiveness, and Inverse-Flow which reverses computational graph for faster sampling. For applications, the corn seed quality system uses a U-Net based conditional GAN with ResNet backbone for 4-class classification; geological mapping employs stacked autoencoders with k-means clustering on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data; face anonymization replaces detected faces with diffusion model-generated content using Inpaint-Anything; art restoration uses Diffusion U-Net with Affine-Coupling Layers; traffic sign detection combines YOLOv11 with Swin Transformer for 5-class detection. Training uses Adam optimizer with learning rates ranging from 0.001 to 5e-5, and 100-1000 epochs depending on dataset complexity.

## Key Results
- CInC Flow achieves competitive bits per dimension (BPD) while enabling mathematically exact inversion without autoregressive overhead
- Inverse-Flow accelerates sampling time by orders of magnitude using standard convolution for the sampling pass
- Corn seed classification system achieves 80% accuracy in identifying broken, discolored, pure, and silkcut seeds
- Geological mapping produces detailed maps from Sentinel-2 data with quantitative cluster quality scores
- Face anonymization preserves YOLOv11 detection mAP and UNet segmentation mIoU/Dice scores while replacing identifiable features
- Traffic sign detection achieves 90.5% mean average precision for detecting normal, blur, dark, rainy, and snowy conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Triangular Convolution Matrix for Invertibility
Constraining 3×3 convolutions to have a block triangular matrix structure allows for mathematically exact inversion and efficient determinant calculation without autoregressive approaches. The method applies padding only to top and left of input (and masks specific kernel entries) to ensure resulting linear operator matrix M is block triangular. Because determinant of triangular matrix is product of diagonal entries, log-likelihood calculation becomes trivial, and inversion reduces to parallelizable back-substitution problem. Core assumption: spatial information lost by specific padding/masking scheme does not critically degrade model's ability to represent data distribution compared to full convolution matrices.

### Mechanism 2: Asymmetric Training and Sampling (Inverse-Flow)
Reversing computational graph—using inverse of convolution (inv-conv) for forward pass and standard convolution for sampling—significantly accelerates sample generation. Standard Normalizing Flows use convolution for forward pass (fast) and are slow during sampling (inverting flow). Inverse-Flow treats inverse operation as forward pass during training. Because inv-conv has derived fast parallel backpropagation algorithm, training remains viable. Crucially, sampling becomes standard convolution operation (O(k²)), highly optimized on GPUs. Core assumption: gradients computed via proposed fast backpropagation algorithm for inv-conv are accurate enough to optimize network parameters effectively despite mathematical inversion of typical forward/backward relationship.

### Mechanism 3: Generative Inpainting for Privacy Preservation
Replacing identifiable features (faces/plates) with diffusion-model-generated content preserves structural integrity of scene better than blurring, maintaining utility for downstream computer vision tasks. Instead of destroying data (blurring), system uses generative prior (Inpaint-Anything/Stable Diffusion) to synthesize plausible pixels within detected bounding box. This maintains statistical distribution of "face-like" features and lighting conditions, allowing models like YOLO or UNet to still learn spatial and semantic cues. Core assumption: downstream models rely on scene context and object geometry rather than biometric details of face.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Linear Algebra (Triangular Matrices)**
  - Why needed here: CInC Flow architecture entirely dependent on property that lower/upper triangular matrix has determinant equal to product of diagonal elements and can be inverted via simple substitution
  - Quick check question: If you have a 3x3 matrix that is upper triangular, is it always invertible? (Check: Only if diagonal elements are non-zero)

- **Concept: Change of Variables (Normalizing Flows)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how density p(x) transforms to p(z) via invertible map f, and why computing Jacobian determinant is computational bottleneck thesis attempts to solve
  - Quick check question: Why must a Normalizing Flow layer be bijective (invertible) to allow for exact likelihood estimation?

- **Concept: Diffusion Models vs. GANs**
  - Why needed here: Thesis transitions from Flow-based theory (Part 1) to Diffusion-based applications (Part 2). Understanding that Diffusion models are iterative denoisers while GANs are adversarial generators is key to understanding why "Inpaint-Anything" works well for restoration but might be slower than single-pass GAN
  - Quick check question: How does training objective of diffusion model differ from that of conditional GAN?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → Padding (Top/Left) → Masked Convolution → Jacobian Log-Det (Simple) → Output
- **Critical path:** Implementation of fast parallel backpropagation for inv-conv is most novel and critical algorithm. If implemented incorrectly, Inverse-Flow will not train efficiently
- **Design tradeoffs:** CInC vs. Emerging Convolutions: CInC potentially faster due to single-filter design but may be less expressive than Emerging Convolutions which use autoregressive factors. Inpainting vs. Blurring: Inpainting preserves dataset utility (segmentation/detection accuracy) but is computationally expensive; Blurring is fast but destroys utility
- **Failure signatures:** NaNs in loss occurs if convolution matrix diagonal entries approach zero (singular matrix) in CInC. Slow Sampling occurs if you accidentally use inv-conv path for sampling in Inverse-Flow (code must strictly use standard conv for sampling pass). Uncanny Valley in privacy anonymization, if inpainting model fails to match lighting/texture, creates "zombie" faces that degrade model trust
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Unit Test CInC: Feed random tensor through CInC layer and its mathematical inverse; verify output is exactly input (within tolerance) to prove bijectivity
  2. Speed Benchmark: Compare wall-clock time of sampling 100 images using Inverse-Flow vs. standard Glow model on MNIST
  3. Downstream Validation: Train YOLOv11 detector on dataset anonymized with Inpaint-Anything pipeline and measure mAP drop relative to non-anonymized baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Under what precise theoretical conditions do normalizing flow models optimally approximate a given target distribution, and can universal representational guarantees be established?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "It is still not fully understood under what conditions NFs will optimally approximate a given target distribution or whether they can universally represent all distributions. Further theoretical work is needed to establish stronger foundations for NF models and their limitations."
- Why unresolved: Theoretical foundations of NFs remain incomplete despite empirical success; current work relies on architectural innovations rather than complete theoretical characterization
- What evidence would resolve it: Proven theorems establishing necessary/sufficient conditions for distribution approximation, or counterexamples demonstrating non-universal representational capacity

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can optimal number of clusters (k) in unsupervised geological mapping be determined in principled, non-heuristic manner that is robust to limited ground-truth samples?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper relies on elbow method (visual interpretation) and notes: "An incorrect k value can lead to either over-segmentation or under-segmentation... The low number of rock samples can further introduce uncertainties."
- Why unresolved: Elbow method is subjective and assumes specific structure in data; limited rock samples in geological contexts make validation difficult
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of theoretically grounded k-selection criterion validated on diverse geological terrains with systematic ground-truth sampling, or proof of optimal clustering under specific geological assumptions

### Open Question 3
- Question: What architectural or training modifications are needed to achieve consistent anonymization quality across datasets with varying visibility conditions (e.g., low-light vs. well-lit street scenes)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Quality of these modified images is noticeably lower compared to those in Pvt-IDD dataset... inpainted faces generated using Inpaint-Anything are of poor quality, especially compared to those in Pvt-IDD dataset."
- Why unresolved: Current inpainting models appear sensitive to lighting and visibility conditions inherent to different geographic datasets; paper does not propose solutions for this domain shift
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of anonymization quality metrics (detection mAP, segmentation mIoU) across controlled lighting/visibility conditions, followed by demonstrated improvements via domain-adaptive training or architecture modifications

## Limitations

- CInC Flow's constrained receptive field may limit ability to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution images, potentially affecting sample quality for complex datasets
- Inverse-Flow's fast backpropagation algorithm for inv-conv lacks extensive validation, making scalability to deeper architectures or larger resolutions uncertain
- Downstream utility preservation claims for face anonymization rely on specific datasets (ECP, Pvt-IDD) that may not generalize to all autonomous driving scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: CInC Flow's mathematical invertibility and determinant calculation (block triangular matrix structure is provably correct)
- **Medium confidence**: Inverse-Flow's sampling acceleration mechanism (theoretical foundation is sound but practical implementation validation is limited)
- **Medium confidence**: Face anonymization utility preservation (experimental results show minimal performance drop but dataset-specific)

## Next Checks

1. **Architectural Expressiveness Test**: Train CInC Flow on high-resolution datasets (e.g., LSUN Bedroom) and compare sample FID scores against standard Glow to validate whether constrained receptive field limits representational capacity

2. **Scalability Analysis**: Profile inv-conv backpropagation algorithm on varying channel depths (from 3 to 512) and resolutions (32x32 to 256x256) to identify when computational overhead negates sampling speed gains

3. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Apply face anonymization pipeline to additional autonomous driving datasets (e.g., Cityscapes, BDD100K) and measure variance in mIoU and Dice score preservation across domains
