# HypoSpace: Evaluating LLM Creativity as Set-Valued Hypothesis Generators under Underdetermination

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.15614
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15614
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Primary result**: Current LLMs struggle with comprehensive exploration of admissible explanation spaces under scientific underdetermination, exhibiting mode collapse despite maintaining solution validity

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HypoSpace, a diagnostic framework that evaluates large language models as hypothesis generators under scientific underdetermination by treating them as samplers over finite hypothesis sets. The framework measures three complementary indicators—Validity (precision of observation-consistent proposals), Uniqueness (non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated admissible set)—revealing that models often maintain high validity while failing to explore complete hypothesis spaces. Evaluation across diverse structured tasks shows frontier reasoning models outperform non-reasoning baselines but still exhibit pronounced mode collapse, indicating fundamental constraints in set-valued inference rather than task difficulty.

## Method Summary
HypoSpace evaluates LLMs across three structured tasks with exactly enumerated valid hypothesis spaces: causal graph inference from perturbations, 3D voxel reconstruction under gravity constraints, and Boolean genetic interaction discovery. Models generate N independent samples per instance (N=|H_O|), which are validated against known ground truth using deterministic task-specific validators, deduplicated via canonicalizers, and scored using three complementary indicators. The framework treats LLMs as samplers and measures Validity Rate (VR), Uniqueness Rate (NR), and Recovery Rate (RR) to disentangle correctness from exploration capability, revealing mode collapse invisible to single-answer metrics.

## Key Results
- Models exhibit strong mode collapse: high Validity rates persist while Recovery rates drop below 50% as hypothesis spaces grow combinatorially
- Frontier reasoning models (GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude-Opus-4, DeepSeek-R1, Grok-4) show higher Recovery than non-reasoning models but still fail to explore complete hypothesis spaces
- Mode collapse manifests as predictable entropy saturation patterns, with cumulative information gain plateauing after few samples despite incomplete coverage
- Validity remains high across difficulty levels while both Uniqueness and Recovery degrade systematically with increasing hypothesis space size

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Treating LLMs as samplers over enumerated hypothesis spaces enables direct measurement of coverage failures invisible to single-answer metrics.
- Mechanism: The framework constructs tasks with deterministically enumerated valid sets H_O, allowing exact validity checking and coverage measurement without LLM-as-judge circularity. Models generate N independent samples, which are then validated against the known ground truth.
- Core assumption: Scientific reasoning requires exploring multiple mechanistically distinct explanations, not just finding one correct answer.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "treats LLMs as samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators"; [Section 3] "our diagnostic suite assumes that, for each instance, H_O is explicitly enumerated, enabling exact validity checks and direct measurement of coverage"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Three complementary indicators (Validity, Uniqueness, Recovery) disentangle correctness from exploration capability.
- Mechanism: Validity (VR) measures precision of observation-consistent proposals; Uniqueness (NR) quantifies non-redundancy via task-specific canonicalizers; Recovery (RR) measures coverage of the enumerated admissible set. This separation reveals mode collapse even when VR remains high.
- Core assumption: High validity combined with low recovery indicates exploration failure rather than task difficulty.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "revealing mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics"; [Section 3.1] "VR measures selection fidelity... NR quantifies non-rendundancy... RR measures coverage of the enumerated valid set"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mode collapse intensifies predictably as admissible hypothesis spaces grow combinatorially.
- Mechanism: As |H_O| increases through controlled parameters (node count, grid dimensions, operator depth), Uniqueness and Recovery degrade systematically while Validity often remains high. This indicates models converge on preferred hypothesis subsets rather than uniformly exploring the space.
- Core assumption: The controlled task domains (causal graphs, 3D voxels, Boolean programs) capture core patterns of scientific underdetermination.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 5.4] "models exhibit strong attraction to a small number of preferred hypotheses, leading to early saturation where additional sampling yields diminishing returns"; [Table 1] Shows RR dropping from ~100% to <50% across difficulty levels while VR stays high for frontier models

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Underdetermination in Scientific Inference**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework assumes multiple mechanistically distinct hypotheses can explain identical observations—a core feature of scientific reasoning often missed by single-answer benchmarks.
  - Quick check question: Given observations of {A=1, B=1}, can you list three structurally different Boolean expressions that produce this output?

- Concept: **Divergent Creativity Theory (Guilford/Torrance)**
  - Why needed here: The three indicators operationalize creativity research's fluency (Recovery), originality (Uniqueness), and appropriateness (Validity) dimensions.
  - Quick check question: Why does measuring only "appropriateness" fail to capture whether a system is creative?

- Concept: **Information-Theoretic Coverage**
  - Why needed here: The entropy-based analysis (Figure 3) provides mechanistic evidence that mode collapse manifests as premature entropy saturation rather than uniform exploration inefficiency.
  - Quick check question: If cumulative entropy plateaus after 5 queries, what does this indicate about hypothesis space exploration?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Task generators (CausalDAG, VoxelReconstruction, BooleanGenetics) -> Validators (forward simulation, projection+gravity, functional agreement) -> Canonicalizers (labeled-edge equality, voxelwise tensor equality, algebraic simplification) -> Scoring module (computes VR/NR/RR) -> Sampling protocol (N independent draws with order-respecting novelty tracking)

- Critical path:
  1. Generate instances with enumerated H_O via task constructors
  2. Run N samples per instance through target LLM with fixed prompt/decoding
  3. Validate each proposal → deduplicate via canonicalizer → compute indicators
  4. Aggregate across instances; plot RR@k curves and entropy trajectories

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exact enumeration enables precision but limits scalability to combinatorial domains
  - Task-specific canonicalizers eliminate subjectivity but may miss semantic equivalence
  - N=|H_O| sampling budget enables coverage analysis but increases API costs (see Table 2: up to 2.5M tokens/run for reasoning models)

- Failure signatures:
  - High VR + Low NR + Low RR → mode collapse (models circle same valid hypotheses)
  - High VR + High NR + Low RR → incomplete exploration with diverse sampling
  - Low VR → constraint violations or parse failures (check Figure 4a error decomposition)
  - Flat entropy curves → diminishing information gain per query

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Table 1 on a single task (e.g., Causal Inference, difficulty 1-3) to validate indicator computation against paper benchmarks
  2. Ablate sampling budget: vary N from |H_O|/4 to 2|H_O| to characterize RR@k scaling behavior
  3. Compare canonicalization strictness: relax Boolean canonicalizer to assess sensitivity of Uniqueness measurements to equivalence criteria

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can explicit memory mechanisms or entropy-seeking decoding strategies effectively mitigate mode collapse and improve Recovery Rates in LLM hypothesis generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly calls for developing methods such as "entropy-seeking decoding, explicit memory across samples, or learned proposal distributions" to map admissible hypothesis spaces.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that current models fail to explore full hypothesis spaces but does not implement or test the proposed algorithmic interventions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments implementing memory-augmented prompts or diversity-seeking sampling objectives, showing statistically significant improvements in Recovery Rates over standard sampling.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the observed degradation of Uniqueness and Recovery with increasing hypothesis space size generalize to open-ended scientific domains where valid sets cannot be enumerated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state HypoSpace "does not claim to evaluate real-world scientific discovery" and abstracts core ingredients into controlled settings, limiting ecological validity.
- Why unresolved: The diagnostic relies on deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces, which are unavailable in complex, real-world scientific inference.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on scientific benchmarks with latent or infinite hypothesis spaces, correlating the paper's metrics with proxy measures of scientific novelty (e.g., expert review).

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the superior performance of reasoning models on Recovery metrics attributable to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length or a fundamental improvement in set-valued inference capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes reasoning models outperform non-reasoning baselines on coverage, but does not isolate whether this results from extended computation (CoT) or better structural exploration.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation compares distinct model classes without ablating the specific contribution of the reasoning process (rationale generation) versus the final selection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies controlling for output token length or enforcing/denying explicit reasoning in the same base model to measure the causal impact on Recovery.

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces restricts applicability to synthetic domains rather than real-world scientific problems where H_O is infinite or intractable to enumerate
- Task-specific canonicalizers may miss semantic equivalence between hypotheses, introducing sensitivity to equivalence criteria that could affect Uniqueness measurements
- The N=|H_O| sampling budget, while enabling coverage analysis, creates substantial API costs and may not reflect practical resource-constrained scientific workflows

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Models exhibit pronounced mode collapse as hypothesis spaces grow, with Recovery degrading while Validity remains high
- **Medium confidence**: Frontier reasoning models show higher Recovery than non-reasoning models but still fail to explore complete hypothesis spaces
- **Medium confidence**: Three complementary indicators effectively disentangle correctness from exploration capability

## Next Checks
1. **Canonicalizer sensitivity analysis**: Systematically relax the Boolean canonicalizer equivalence criteria to assess how Uniqueness measurements respond to semantic equivalence judgments
2. **Sampling budget ablation**: Vary N from |H_O|/4 to 2|H_O| to characterize whether Recovery deficits are recoverable through increased sampling or represent fundamental exploration failures
3. **Cross-task transferability**: Apply the VR/NR/RR framework to a fourth domain with different combinatorial structure (e.g., symbolic regression or program synthesis) to test generalizability beyond the three implemented tasks
