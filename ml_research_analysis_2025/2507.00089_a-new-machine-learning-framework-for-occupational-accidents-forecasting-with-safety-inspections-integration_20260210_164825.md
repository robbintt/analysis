# A new machine learning framework for occupational accidents forecasting with safety inspections integration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.00089
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00089
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: LSTM-MIMO achieves up to 87% balanced accuracy for weekly accident risk forecasting using safety inspection data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a model-agnostic framework for short-term occupational accident forecasting that integrates safety inspection data. The approach models daily accident occurrence as binary time series and aggregates predictions into weekly risk assessments. Using a sliding-window cross-validation procedure and multiple machine learning algorithms—including logistic regression, tree-based models, and neural networks—the framework reliably identifies high-risk periods. Across all tested algorithms, the method delivers robust period-level performance, with LSTM-MIMO achieving up to 87% balanced accuracy. The framework transforms routine inspection data into actionable weekly and daily risk scores, enabling decision-makers to prioritize interventions and allocate resources effectively before incidents occur.

## Method Summary
The framework converts daily accident occurrence into a binary time series (accident/no accident) and conditions predictions on lagged outcomes, lagged dynamic inspection covariates, and known future calendar features. A sliding-window cross-validation procedure with an initial window of 60% of training data and a step size of 7 days tunes model hyperparameters and decision thresholds. The model outputs daily probabilities for a horizon of 7 days, which are then aggregated into binary weekly risk statuses using a calibrated threshold. Multiple algorithms are compared, including logistic regression, tree-based models, and deep learning models like LSTM-MIMO, TCN, and TFT.

## Key Results
- LSTM-MIMO achieves up to 87% balanced accuracy for weekly accident risk forecasting
- The framework delivers robust period-level performance across all tested machine learning algorithms
- Safety inspection data integration provides predictive value beyond calendar features and past accident history
- The sliding-window cross-validation procedure enables effective hyperparameter tuning and threshold calibration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Binary Time Series Modeling of Accident Occurrence
- Converting daily accident occurrence into a binary time series enables the model to capture temporal dependencies and predict short-term risk more effectively than using aggregated counts or rates. The framework models `yt` as a binary variable (1 if at least one accident occurs on day t, 0 otherwise), conditioning predictions on lagged outcomes, lagged dynamic inspection covariates, and known future calendar features.

### Mechanism 2: Integration of Leading Indicators via Safety Inspection Covariates
- Using continuous, proactive data from safety inspections as dynamic covariates provides an early warning signal that improves short-term accident forecasting beyond what lagging indicators can achieve. The framework ingests structured features derived from inspection reports (e.g., number of hazardous situations, severity median, improvement actions) as dynamic inputs to the prediction model.

### Mechanism 3: Period-Level Aggregation for Stable Risk Assessment
- Aggregating daily probabilistic predictions into a binary weekly risk status improves reliability and actionability by smoothing daily noise and aligning with organizational planning cycles. The model produces daily probabilities for a horizon of H days, and a week is flagged as risky if any day's probability exceeds a calibrated threshold.

## Foundational Learning

- **Binary Time Series & Binary Classification**: The core prediction task is framed as binary classification (will an accident happen or not?) over a sequence of days, different from regression. Quick check: Can you explain why modeling accident *occurrence* as a binary sequence might be more useful for prevention planning than predicting a daily accident *rate*?

- **Multi-step Forecasting Strategies (DirRec vs. MIMO)**: The framework produces a forecast for a horizon of H days into the future. Understanding how models generate this sequence is key. Quick check: What are the trade-offs between a recursive strategy (using yesterday's prediction to inform today's) and a direct strategy (predicting all days from the same input data)?

- **Evaluation Metrics for Imbalanced Data**: Accidents are rare (the paper notes strong class imbalance, e.g., <5% of days have accidents). Standard accuracy is misleading. Quick check: If a model predicts "no accident" every single day and achieves 95% accuracy, why is this considered a failure? Which metric would reveal this failure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Preprocessing -> Feature Engineering -> Model Core -> Aggregation/Decision Layer -> Evaluation Protocol

- **Critical path**:
  1. Inspections are conducted and reports are digitized
  2. Reports are parsed into daily feature vectors
  3. The chosen model is trained on historical pairs using sliding-window cross-validation
  4. For a new forecast, the model takes recent history and future calendar and outputs daily probabilities for the next H days
  5. The system applies threshold τ and aggregates to produce the final "Safe/Risky" weekly status

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Model Choice: Simple, interpretable models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) vs. complex, high-performance deep learning models (LSTM, TFT)
  - Forecast Horizon (H): Shorter horizons (e.g., 3 days) are more timely but noisier; longer horizons (e.g., 7 days) are more stable and aligned with weekly planning
  - Threshold (τ): A lower threshold increases recall (fewer missed accidents) but lowers precision (more false alarms)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Model outputs constant probability: If the model fails to learn, it may output the base rate probability for all future days
  - Degradation over time: If inspection quality or work conditions drift, the model trained on past data will lose accuracy
  - Over-reliance on calendar features: If the model leans too heavily on them, it may fail to predict accidents that defy the typical weekly rhythm

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement the "Naive" (last week's pattern) and "Rolling Frequency" baselines on your historical data
  2. Implement the sliding-window cross-validation and train at least three diverse models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM-MIMO)
  3. Take the best-performing model and retrain it without the dynamic inspection covariates, using only lagged outcomes and calendar features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does the integration of Natural Language Processing to extract semantic features from textual inspection reports improve predictive performance?
- Does a cost-sensitive learning approach yield better operational outcomes than balanced accuracy optimization when explicitly weighing costs of false alarms against missed accidents?
- Can a global forecasting approach capturing cross-departmental dependencies outperform the independent local models currently used?
- Does an alternative weekly aggregation strategy better capture risk accumulation than the current "max-pooling" approach?

## Limitations
- The binary time series approach relies on weak temporal autocorrelation, which may fail in settings with more random accident patterns
- The integration of safety inspection data assumes inspections are reliable and timely indicators of risk, with no validation of inspection quality
- Period-level aggregation may mask critical daily variations, especially for high-impact, low-frequency events
- Performance is evaluated on a single dataset with specific characteristics (low daily accident rates, structured inspection reports)

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The methodological framework (sliding-window cross-validation, binary time series modeling, period aggregation) is well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: The core claims about LSTM-MIMO achieving 87% balanced accuracy are supported by the presented results, but the narrow evaluation dataset and lack of ablation studies limit broader claims
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the general superiority of inspection-integrated models over baselines are not fully substantiated

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on Inspection Features**: Remove the dynamic inspection covariates and retrain the best-performing model to quantify the marginal value of inspection data integration
2. **Generalization Test on External Dataset**: Apply the framework to a different occupational safety dataset with distinct accident patterns and inspection protocols to test robustness
3. **Calibration and Threshold Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the decision threshold τ and evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall to assess threshold stability over time
