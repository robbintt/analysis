core_contribution: This study investigates the effectiveness of using cone penetration
  test (CPT) data for predicting lateral spreading during earthquakes. An autoencoder
  is proposed to extract latent features from 200 CPT profiles of soil behavior type
  index (Ic) and normalized cone resistance (qc1Ncs), compressing them into ten informative
  features while preserving critical information.

# Investigating the effect of CPT in lateral spreading prediction using Explainable AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.13389
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13389
- Reference count: 5
- This study uses autoencoders to extract latent CPT features that improve lateral spreading prediction accuracy to over 83%

## Executive Summary
This study proposes using autoencoders to automatically extract informative latent features from CPT profiles for predicting lateral spreading during earthquakes. The approach compresses 200-point CPT profiles (soil behavior type index and normalized cone resistance) into 10 latent features each while preserving critical information. These latent CPT features, combined with site parameters, are used to train XGBoost models that predict lateral spreading occurrences for the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The latent feature-based models significantly outperform models using conventional CPT metrics or no CPT data.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs two autoencoders to compress CPT profiles into latent features. CPT data from 12,000 profiles is regularized to 200 points per profile (5cm intervals), reshaped to 10x20, and augmented with positional encoding. Separate autoencoders process the soil behavior type index (Ic) and normalized cone resistance (qc1Ncs), each compressing 200 points to 10 latent features. These 20 latent features are combined with five site parameters (PGA, GWD, L, slope, elevation) and used to train an XGBoost classifier for lateral spreading prediction. SHAP analysis is applied to interpret the importance of latent features in model predictions.

## Key Results
- Models using latent CPT features achieved over 83% accuracy in predicting lateral spreading
- The most important latent feature (Ic3) corresponds to soil behavior at 1-3 meter depths
- Latent feature-based models outperformed conventional CPT metric-based models and models without CPT data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The autoencoder approach works by learning compressed representations of CPT profiles that capture the most relevant information for lateral spreading prediction. By reducing 200-point profiles to 10 latent features, the model identifies the most critical patterns in soil behavior while filtering noise. The positional encoding preserves depth information, allowing the model to learn depth-dependent relationships. XGBoost then uses these compact, informative features to make accurate predictions about lateral spreading occurrences.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Cone Penetration Test (CPT)**: A method to measure soil resistance by pushing a cone into the ground; provides continuous profiles of soil properties.
   - Why needed: Core data source for soil characterization in liquefaction studies
   - Quick check: Verify Ic and qc1Ncs values are within expected ranges for the region

2. **Soil Behavior Type Index (Ic)**: Classification index that characterizes soil behavior based on normalized cone resistance and friction ratio.
   - Why needed: Key CPT-derived parameter for identifying soil types prone to liquefaction
   - Quick check: Ensure Ic values fall within expected bounds (0-4) for the soil types present

3. **Autoencoder**: Neural network architecture that learns compressed representations by encoding input data to a latent space and decoding back to reconstruction.
   - Why needed: Automatically extracts informative features from high-dimensional CPT profiles
   - Quick check: Monitor reconstruction loss during training to ensure meaningful compression

4. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: Game-theoretic approach to explain individual predictions by computing feature contributions.
   - Why needed: Interprets the importance of latent features in the final model predictions
   - Quick check: Verify SHAP values sum to the difference between model output and baseline

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: NZGD CPT profiles -> Autoencoder (Ic) -> 10 latent features; NZGD CPT profiles -> Autoencoder (qc1Ncs) -> 10 latent features; Site parameters + 20 latent features -> XGBoost -> Lateral spreading prediction

Critical path: CPT profile preprocessing (Ic/qc1Ncs computation, regularization) -> Autoencoder training (feature extraction) -> Feature concatenation (site parameters + latent features) -> XGBoost training (classification) -> SHAP analysis (interpretation)

Design tradeoffs: The paper chose 10 latent features to balance dimensionality reduction with information preservation, acknowledging this limits reconstruction of abrupt stratigraphic changes. This compression enables faster model training and reduces overfitting risk while still capturing the most relevant soil characteristics for lateral spreading prediction.

Failure signatures: If autoencoder reconstruction error is high, the latent features may not preserve critical information, leading to poor model performance. If XGBoost performance is similar with or without CPT features, the autoencoder may be over-regularizing or the latent features may be uninformative. If SHAP analysis shows uniform feature importance, the model may not be capturing depth-specific relationships.

Three first experiments:
1. Train autoencoders with varying numbers of latent features (5, 10, 15, 20) and measure reconstruction error and downstream model performance
2. Apply SHAP analysis to individual CPT profiles to verify the depth-specific interpretation of important latent features
3. Compare model performance when using raw CPT profiles vs. latent features to quantify the value of dimensionality reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How can the trade-off between dimensionality reduction and the preservation of abrupt stratigraphic changes in CPT profiles be optimized to minimize reconstruction error?
2. Does the autoencoder feature extraction approach generalize to lateral spreading prediction in regions with different geological characteristics than Christchurch?
3. How can the physical interpretation of the remaining latent features (beyond Ic3) be deciphered to fully explain the soil mechanics driving the predictions?

## Limitations
- The study uses only one earthquake case (2011 Christchurch), limiting generalizability claims
- Critical implementation details like autoencoder architecture specifications and XGBoost hyperparameters are not provided
- The approach may not capture abrupt stratigraphic changes due to limited latent feature dimensionality

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the autoencoder concept and its application to CPT profile compression
- **Medium confidence** in the reported performance metrics (83% accuracy) given missing training details
- **Low confidence** in the broader claims about automation and generalizability due to single-dataset validation

## Next Checks
1. Reconstruct original CPT profiles from latent features and compute RMSE to verify autoencoder information preservation
2. Perform ablation study: train XGBoost with subsets of latent features (e.g., top 5 by SHAP importance vs. bottom 5) to quantify each feature's contribution
3. Test the trained model on a different earthquake dataset (e.g., 2010-2011 Canterbury sequence) to evaluate generalizability beyond Christchurch 2011
