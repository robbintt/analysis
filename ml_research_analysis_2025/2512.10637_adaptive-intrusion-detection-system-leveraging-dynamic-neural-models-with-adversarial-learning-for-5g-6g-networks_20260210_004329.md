# Adaptive Intrusion Detection System Leveraging Dynamic Neural Models with Adversarial Learning for 5G/6G Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10637
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10637
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Proposed IDS achieves 82.33% accuracy on NSL-KDD dataset with robustness to data poisoning and zero-day attacks

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an adaptive intrusion detection system for 5G/6G networks that combines CTGAN-based data augmentation, dynamic neural networks, and batch-incremental learning to address challenges of data scarcity, imbalance, and evolving cyber threats. The framework demonstrates resilience against data poisoning attacks and zero-day threats while maintaining continuous adaptation capabilities without full retraining. Experimental results on the NSL-KDD dataset show competitive performance against baseline models, with particular effectiveness in detecting minority attack classes through synthetic data generation.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a three-stage pipeline: (1) CTGAN-based synthetic data generation with mode-specific normalization to address class imbalance, (2) dynamic neural network architecture with flexible hidden layers (max 50 units) that adapts based on input complexity and batch thresholds, and (3) batch-incremental learning with memory component for continuous adaptation. The system processes NSL-KDD data into 13 features after preprocessing, generates 1000 synthetic samples per attack type, and trains using 50 epochs with batch size 10 triggering architectural changes. Training occurs on Google Colab with H2O Web UI, incorporating adversarial robustness checks and optional retraining triggers.

## Key Results
- Achieves 82.33% accuracy for multiclass classification on NSL-KDD dataset
- Demonstrates robustness against 20% label-flipping data poisoning attacks
- Shows resilience to zero-day attacks through incremental learning capability
- Outperforms baseline models in both binary and multiclass classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: CTGAN-Based Adversarial Data Augmentation
- Claim: Synthetic data generation using Conditional Tabular GANs mitigates class imbalance and data scarcity while improving robustness to poisoning attacks.
- Mechanism: CTGAN employs mode-specific normalization (Variational Gaussian Mixture modeling) to handle multi-modal column distributions, and conditional training-by-sampling to generate statistically coherent synthetic samples. By training on both real and synthetic data, the model learns a broader decision boundary that is less sensitive to label corruption.
- Core assumption: The synthetic data preserves the statistical properties of legitimate traffic while covering underrepresented attack categories; mode collapse does not significantly degrade sample diversity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The core method combines CTGAN-based synthetic data augmentation... to address data scarcity, imbalance, and evolving attack patterns."
  - [section IV-B] "This GAN readily avoids data imbalance issues as we can conditionally generate imbalanced samples from it as well."
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; neighbor papers focus on GAN-based evasion (UAV cyber-attacks) and OOD detection but not CTGAN-specific augmentation for IDS.
- Break condition: If synthetic samples diverge significantly from real attack distributions (e.g., mode collapse, unrealistic feature combinations), the model may overfit to synthetic patterns and generalize poorly to actual network traffic.

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic Neural Network Architecture with Adaptive Capacity
- Claim: A dynamic neural network that adjusts its architecture based on input characteristics can handle unmodeled dynamics and missing/unstructured values better than fixed architectures.
- Mechanism: The network uses flexible hidden layers (maximum 50) that expand or contract based on input sample distribution and model capacity requirements. Dynamic preprocessing and imputation modules conditionally handle missing values at inference time. Batch size threshold (10) triggers architectural dynamism.
- Core assumption: The relationship between input complexity and required network depth can be captured by heuristics (batch size thresholds, sample distribution metrics); dynamic imputation does not introduce systematic bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-D] "The dynamic neural network consists of a feed-forward neural network... The module list of the dynamic neural network consists of the flexible hidden layers that change based on the input sample distribution and the model capacity."
  - [section I] "Dynamic neural nets can successfully handle this kind of input and demonstrate functional behavior in the presence of unmodeled dynamics."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for dynamic neural architectures in IDS; neighbors focus on static models with temporal encodings or LLM enhancements.
- Break condition: If the heuristics triggering architectural changes are poorly calibrated (e.g., batch threshold too low/high), the network may under-utilize capacity or incur unnecessary computational overhead.

### Mechanism 3: Batch-Incremental Learning for Concept Drift Adaptation
- Claim: Batch-incremental learning enables continuous model updates with new attack patterns without full retraining, reducing computational cost while preserving prior knowledge.
- Mechanism: The model accumulates new samples until batch size is reached, then performs partial updates. A memory component stores representative samples from previous distributions. For "hypothetical attacks," synthetic data is generated via conditional sampling and distribution tampering, then fed into incremental updates.
- Core assumption: The memory component can sufficiently represent historical attack distributions; catastrophic forgetting is mitigated by the retraining module and adversarial robustness checks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The dynamic neural network's flexible architecture and incremental learning capability enable continuous adaptation to new threats without costly retraining."
  - [section IV-C] "The batch-learning method is used to update the existing model when the input size is equal to the batch size. This learning method also demands a need for additional memory component in the system."
  - [corpus] Weak support; neighbor papers do not explicitly address incremental learning mechanisms for IDS.
- Break condition: If memory component capacity is insufficient or new attack distributions diverge sharply from historical patterns (severe concept drift), the model may experience catastrophic forgetting or fail to converge on new attack signatures.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN)**
  - Why needed here: CTGAN is the data augmentation engine that resolves class imbalance and scarcity. Understanding mode-specific normalization and conditional sampling is essential for diagnosing synthetic data quality issues.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why mode-specific normalization (VGM) is necessary for tabular data with multi-modal column distributions, versus standard min-max normalization?

- Concept: **Incremental/Continual Learning (Batch vs. Instance)**
  - Why needed here: The framework's ability to adapt without full retraining hinges on batch-incremental learning. Distinguishing concept drift from true incremental learning determines update strategy.
  - Quick check question: What is the trade-off between batch-incremental and instance-incremental learning in terms of memory footprint, latency, and convergence stability?

- Concept: **Data Poisoning and Label Flipping Attacks**
  - Why needed here: The threat model explicitly simulates label-flipping attacks at 20% corruption. Understanding how adversarial training mitigates this informs both defense design and red-team testing.
  - Quick check question: How does label flipping differ from backdoor poisoning, and why might adversarial training with synthetic data provide resilience against the former but not necessarily the latter?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Preprocessing Module -> CTGAN Augmentation Module -> Dynamic Neural Network -> Incremental Learning Controller -> Retraining Module
- Critical path:
  1. Raw NSL-KDD data → Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, 13-feature extraction)
  2. Preprocessed data → CTGAN (synthetic sample generation)
  3. Combined real + synthetic data → Dynamic Neural Network (initial training)
  4. New traffic → Incremental batch accumulation → Partial model update
  5. Periodic adversarial robustness check → Optional retraining trigger
- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Memory vs. Compute**: Batch-incremental learning reduces compute but requires memory component for historical samples.
  - **Synthetic Data Volume vs. Realism**: More synthetic samples improve coverage but risk distribution drift if CTGAN quality degrades.
  - **Dynamic Architecture Flexibility vs. Stability**: Flexible layers adapt to input complexity but may introduce convergence instability.
- Failure signatures:
  - **Mode collapse in CTGAN**: Synthetic samples cluster around limited modes; class imbalance persists despite augmentation.
  - **Catastrophic forgetting**: Model accuracy on older attack types drops sharply after incremental updates.
  - **Dynamic imputation bias**: Systematic errors in missing value handling skew predictions for specific attack categories.
  - **Batch threshold misconfiguration**: Incremental updates trigger too frequently (high overhead) or too rarely (stale model).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Train dynamic neural network on original NSL-KDD (no augmentation, no incremental learning) to establish accuracy/F1 baseline for multi-class and binary classification across DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R.
  2. **CTGAN augmentation ablation**: Compare model performance with vs. without synthetic data augmentation across varying synthetic sample counts (500, 1000, 2000 rows); measure impact on minority classes (R2L, U2R).
  3. **Incremental learning stress test**: Simulate concept drift by introducing NSL-KDD test set attacks not present in training (zero-day simulation); measure accuracy degradation with vs. without batch-incremental learning enabled, tracking learning time and memory consumption.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper explicitly identifies the potential for improvement through "the addition of flexible dropout layers with regularization" to increase accuracy and mitigate adverse effects, though this was not implemented in the current work.

## Limitations
- The framework relies entirely on the legacy NSL-KDD dataset, which lacks characteristics of modern 5G/6G traffic environments.
- The threat model focuses primarily on label-flipping attacks, not addressing more sophisticated poisoning strategies like backdoor insertion.
- Key implementation details for the dynamic architecture mechanism and incremental learning controller are described conceptually but not concretely specified.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core architecture combining CTGAN augmentation with dynamic neural networks for IDS is technically sound and addresses legitimate challenges in 5G/6G networks.
- **Medium confidence**: The reported accuracy metrics and zero-day attack resilience, as experimental details are sparse and lack statistical validation.
- **Low confidence**: The specific implementation details of the dynamic architecture mechanism and incremental learning controller, which are described conceptually but not concretely specified.

## Next Checks
1. **Statistical validation**: Run the complete pipeline 10 times with different random seeds and report mean accuracy ± confidence intervals for both multi-class and binary classification tasks.
2. **Distribution similarity analysis**: Quantitatively compare synthetic data distributions against real data using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and visualize feature distributions to verify CTGAN quality.
3. **Catastrophic forgetting test**: After incremental learning updates with new attack patterns, systematically evaluate model performance degradation on previously learned attack types to validate the memory component's effectiveness.
