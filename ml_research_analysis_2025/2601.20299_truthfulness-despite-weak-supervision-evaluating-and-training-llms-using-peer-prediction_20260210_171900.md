# Truthfulness Despite Weak Supervision: Evaluating and Training LLMs Using Peer Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.20299
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20299
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Peer prediction enables reliable LLM evaluation and training without ground truth by leveraging mutual predictability between responses.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces peer prediction as a method for evaluating and training large language models without requiring ground truth labels. The approach uses mutual predictability between model responses to incentivize honest and informative answers, drawing from mechanism design research on incentive compatibility. Theoretically, the method is proven to be resistant to deception even when the expert is much weaker than the participants. Empirically, peer prediction-based training recovers most truthfulness lost due to malicious fine-tuning, even when the reward signal comes from a model 55 times smaller. On evaluation, peer prediction shows an inverse scaling property: resistance to deception increases as the capability gap between participants and experts widens, outperforming LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, which become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x their size. The method enables reliable evaluation and training of strong models with weak supervision.

## Method Summary
The method evaluates and trains LLMs by computing peer prediction scores that measure how well one participant's answer predicts another's, using an expert model to estimate log probabilities. Algorithm 1 calculates scores as log P(target|source) - log P(target) for each source-target pair across all expert models. For training, high-scoring responses are paired with low-scoring ones to create contrastive samples for direct preference optimization (DPO). The theoretical foundation relies on Bayesian Nash equilibrium analysis showing honest reporting is optimal when participants share correlated beliefs, with inverse scaling providing additional robustness when capability gaps exist.

## Key Results
- Peer prediction scores recover 87.3% of truthfulness lost to malicious fine-tuning, outperforming LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.
- Inverse scaling property: deception resistance improves as capability gap widens, with peer prediction outperforming LLM-as-a-Judge at 5-20x gaps.
- Theoretical guarantees hold even when the expert model is 55 times smaller than participant models.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Mutual Predictability as a Proxy for Truthfulness
Honest and informative answers better predict other participants' answers than deceptive ones, enabling evaluation without ground truth. The peer prediction score for a source answer A_s measures the log-probability improvement when an expert uses A_s to predict a target's answer A_t: `S = log Pr(A_t | A_s) - log Pr(A_t)`. Honest answers reveal information about the world state, making them more useful for predicting others who observe the same state. Core assumption: Participants' beliefs are correlated through a shared underlying state. Break condition: If participants have uncorrelated beliefs or if the task has no meaningful information content (pure guessing), scores become noise.

### Mechanism 2: Inverse Scaling—Weaker Experts Provide Stronger Deception Resistance
As the capability gap between participants and experts widens, peer prediction becomes more resistant to deception, not less. When an expert cannot solve the problem independently, it relies heavily on the source's answer. An honest source provides a genuinely useful signal; a deceptive source's misleading information causes larger prediction errors. This amplifies the score difference between honest and deceptive responses. Core assumption: Capability gaps translate to information asymmetries—stronger models have "private information" inaccessible to weaker experts. Break condition: If tasks are so easy that even weak experts can solve them independently, or so subjective that "ground truth" is undefined, the mechanism provides less signal.

### Mechanism 3: Ensemble Diversity Restores Incentive Compatibility Under Prior Disagreement
When participants and experts have different "worldviews" (priors), increasing population size restores approximate incentive compatibility. With many participants and experts drawn from the same prior distribution D, a would-be deceiver cannot tailor lies to specific individuals. The score aggregates over diverse perspectives, making honest reporting the best strategy in expectation. Core assumption: Bounded pointwise mutual information across participants and bounded probability ratios across priors. Break condition: If priors vary unboundedly or if participants can coordinate collusion strategies, guarantees degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE)**
  - Why needed here: The paper proves honest reporting is a BNE—the optimal strategy for each agent given others' strategies. Understanding BNE clarifies why the mechanism works at equilibrium, not necessarily for naive models.
  - Quick check question: If all other participants report honestly, does a single participant gain by deviating to deception? (Answer: No, by Theorem 1.)

- **Concept: Logarithmic Scoring Rule**
  - Why needed here: The expert's auxiliary score uses log probabilities to incentivize faithful probability reporting. Proper scoring rules ensure calibrated predictions.
  - Quick check question: Why use log probability rather than raw probability? (Answer: Log scoring is strictly proper—maximized only by reporting true beliefs.)

- **Concept: Mutual Information / Pointwise Mutual Information**
  - Why needed here: The source score measures how much information A_s provides about A_t. This connects directly to the theoretical analysis (I_0 bounds PMI).
  - Quick check question: If two answers are independent, what happens to the peer prediction score? (Answer: log P(A_t|A_s) = log P(A_t), so score = 0.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Question Q -> [n Participants] -> Generate answers {A_1, ..., A_n} -> For each (source s, target t, expert j) triplet: Expert predicts A_t using Q, A_s -> Compute log Pr_j(A_t | A_s) - log Pr_j(A_t) -> Aggregate scores -> Ranking or DPO pairs

- **Critical path:** The structured dialogue prompt that elicits log-probabilities. This is where implementation quality matters most—the expert must genuinely condition on the source answer. Prompt engineering errors will collapse the mechanism to noise.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Population size (n, m): Larger populations improve deception resistance but increase computational cost by O(n²m). Paper uses n=2–16, m=1–6.
  - Expert capability: Smaller experts provide better deception resistance for strong participants (inverse scaling), but may struggle with weak participants. Match expert to expected participant capability.
  - Answer format: Free-form requires longer context and careful prompt design; MCQ simplifies probability computation but may lose reasoning signal.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Collusion: When deceptive participants constitute ≥50% of the population and the expert is similar-capability, honest answers may be penalized. Mitigation: Use weak experts with strong participants.
  - Prior mismatch without diversity: If all experts share a biased prior not representative of participants, scores become systematically skewed. Mitigation: Increase expert diversity.
  - Uninformative tasks: On subjective domains (humanities ρ=0.02), scores weakly predict correctness. Peer prediction works best on STEM/reasoning tasks with verifiable structure.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity check with known ground truth: Run peer prediction on MMLU-style questions (MCQ, known answers). Verify that honest participants score higher than deceptive ones, and that scores correlate with accuracy.
  2. Scaling sweep: Fix participant model (e.g., Llama-8B), vary expert size (135M→7B). Plot deception resistance vs. capability gap. Expect inverse scaling curve.
  3. Training loop test: Fine-tune a small model (e.g., Qwen-0.5B) on deceptive answers, then attempt recovery using DPO with peer prediction scores. Compare recovery rate vs. LLM-as-a-Judge baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: Can peer prediction mechanisms be made robust against coordinated collusion when multiple participants strategically coordinate their deceptive responses?
  - Basis in paper: Our theorems focuses on the punishment on unilateral deception, and does not consider collusion among participants, which is a challenging problem that requires further research.
  - Why unresolved: Theoretical guarantees only cover unilateral deception; experiments show that when deceptive participants constitute a majority (≥50%), honest participants can be penalized rather than rewarded, breaking the mechanism's reliability.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Formal proofs extending Theorem 2 to collusion-resistant settings, or Byzantine fault tolerance-style bounds showing how many colluding agents can be tolerated while preserving incentive compatibility.

- **Question**: What factors explain peer prediction's stronger performance in STEM/reasoning domains versus weaker performance in knowledge-based and subjective domains?
  - Basis in paper: The reason underlying such a phenomenon could be subject of future research, and we hypothesize that the reason is due to lower disagreement in priors in STEM domains.
  - Why unresolved: The hypothesis about prior disagreement remains untested; the correlation between domain characteristics and peer prediction effectiveness is empirically observed but theoretically unexplained.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring prior disagreement across domains and correlating it with peer prediction performance, or theoretical analysis relating the L₀ constant in Assumption 1 to domain properties.

- **Question**: How does peer prediction perform when the expert model itself is adversarial or trained to maximize confusion rather than provide honest probability estimates?
  - Basis in paper: The paper assumes experts "report honestly" in theoretical analysis and uses auxiliary expert scores for "future-proofing," but all experiments use benign experts.
  - Why unresolved: Theoretical guarantees require expert honesty, but practical deployment may involve compromised or strategically-behaving expert models.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with experts trained to maximize participant confusion or with explicitly adversarial objectives, testing whether auxiliary expert scores effectively deter expert deception.

## Limitations

- Peer prediction's effectiveness degrades on subjective domains (humanities ρ=0.02) where "truth" is genuinely contested and prior disagreement is high.
- The mechanism is vulnerable to collusion when deceptive participants constitute a majority (≥50%) and the expert is similar-capability.
- Theoretical guarantees require bounded pointwise mutual information and probability ratios across participants, which may not hold for all domains.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The peer prediction mechanism's theoretical foundation (Theorem 1, Theorem 2) and its empirical demonstration of recovering truthfulness after malicious fine-tuning. The inverse scaling property's basic existence is well-supported.
- **Medium confidence**: The generalizability of inverse scaling across diverse domains, particularly subjective humanities topics. The exact population size thresholds required for approximate incentive compatibility in practice.
- **Low confidence**: The mechanism's performance with participants exhibiting correlated but systematically biased reasoning, and its behavior with extremely large capability gaps (>100x) beyond the tested range.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain generalizability test**: Apply peer prediction to a humanities dataset (e.g., RACE or MCTest) and measure the correlation between peer prediction scores and ground truth correctness. Compare this to the STEM correlation (ρ=0.7971) to quantify the subjective task limitation.

2. **Prior disagreement simulation**: Construct a synthetic experiment where participants have systematically different priors on a factual question (e.g., historical interpretation), measure peer prediction scores, and test whether ensemble diversity (Theorem 2) restores incentive compatibility as participant/expert population sizes increase.

3. **Capability gap saturation point**: Extend the scaling sweep beyond 100x capability gaps to determine whether inverse scaling continues or plateaus. This would clarify the practical limits of using weaker experts to evaluate stronger models.
