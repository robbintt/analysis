# Real-Time Intuitive AI Drawing System for Collaboration: Enhancing Human Creativity through Formal and Contextual Intent Integration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19254
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19254
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Real-time collaborative AI drawing system with sub-two-second latency that preserves structural fidelity while enabling semantic transformation through dual intent integration.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a real-time collaborative AI drawing system that transforms user sketches into stylized artworks while preserving both formal intent (structural and compositional attributes) and contextual intent (semantic and thematic meaning). The system combines Concave Hull-based masking with ControlNet-driven structural conditioning and CLIP-based vision-language model extraction to enable synchronous co-creation across multiple users. Implemented with a distributed inference architecture and touchscreen interface, the platform achieves median end-to-end latency near two seconds, supporting public installations like Graffiti-X and lowering barriers to artistic participation through AI-assisted co-creation.

## Method Summary
The system implements a two-stage pipeline where multi-touch stroke capture via TouchDesigner feeds into a distributed processing architecture. Formal intent is extracted through Canny edge detection and Concave Hull masking, while contextual intent is derived from CLIP-based vision-language model analysis. These dual signals condition a ControlNet-guided diffusion process with LoRA style adaptation, using two-stage KSampler sampling with denoising rate 0.3. The distributed architecture employs WebSocket-based queue servers, parallel GPU workers, and spatial canvas tiling to enable sub-two-second latency for multi-user collaboration.

## Key Results
- Achieves sub-two-second median end-to-end latency suitable for multi-user collaboration
- Successfully preserves structural fidelity through Concave Hull-based masking and ControlNet conditioning
- Enables synchronous co-creation across multiple users on shared canvases
- Demonstrated in public installations like Graffiti-X, lowering barriers to artistic participation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating formal and contextual intent in a unified pipeline enables coherent real-time co-creation that preserves structural fidelity while enabling semantic transformation.
- Mechanism: The system captures user strokes via TouchDesigner, extracts structural features through Canny edge detection and Concave Hull masking (formal intent), while a CLIP-based vision-language model extracts semantic descriptors (contextual intent). These dual signals condition a two-stage ControlNet-guided diffusion process with LoRA style adaptation.
- Core assumption: Edge-based structural conditioning combined with VLM-derived prompts can jointly preserve geometric intent while enabling semantic transformation without one dominating the other.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These dual intent signals are jointly conditioned in a multi-stage generation pipeline that combines contour-preserving structural control with style- and content-aware image synthesis."
  - [section 3.1] "Formal Intent—structural and compositional properties of the sketch—is preserved through Concave Hull-based masking and ControlNet-driven structural conditioning, while Contextual Intent—semantic, thematic, and affective cues—is extracted via a vision–language model (VLM)."
  - [corpus] Related work (Ibarrola et al., CICADA) demonstrates value of integrating formal intent for semantic sketch completion, supporting the dual-intent approach.
- Break condition: If denoising rate exceeds ~0.3 or edge maps are poorly extracted, structural preservation degrades and formal intent is lost. If VLM fails to extract meaningful semantic cues, contextual coherence suffers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Concave Hull-based masking enables precise boundary preservation and seamless pixel-level stitching between generated and hand-drawn regions.
- Mechanism: Unlike convex hulls or bounding boxes, Concave Hull algorithms tightly conform to drawn silhouettes, capturing stroke thickness variations. This precise masking prevents spillover during inpainting and allows gradient-aware pixel blending at mask boundaries.
- Core assumption: Tight mask conformance reduces artifacts at generation boundaries without requiring extensive post-processing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A two-stage generation process with ControlNet-based structural conditioning and LoRA-style adaptation preserves both intents."
  - [section 3.1] "This approach not only prevents unintended spillover during generation, but also allows fine adjustment of stroke thickness... enabling seamless pixel-level stitching with surrounding regions."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison for Concave Hull vs. other masking strategies; this appears to be a novel contribution.
- Break condition: If strokes are highly sparse or disconnected, Concave Hull may produce fragmented masks leading to incoherent generation regions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Distributed event-driven architecture with spatial tiling enables sub-two-second latency for multi-user synchronous collaboration.
- Mechanism: TouchDesigner clients stream stroke data via WebSockets to a central queue server. Multiple GPU workers process jobs in parallel, with the canvas spatially partitioned into tiles to minimize contention. Priority scheduling maintains low latency for interactive tasks.
- Core assumption: Spatial partitioning reduces lock contention sufficiently to maintain responsive interaction under multi-user load.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Achieving sub-two-second latency suitable for multi-user collaboration."
  - [section 3.2] "To minimize contention, the shared canvas is spatially partitioned into tiles, allowing concurrent updates in separate regions... maintain median end-to-end latency near two seconds even under peak load."
  - [corpus] FedGAI paper addresses cloud-edge collaboration for generative AI but focuses on federated learning, not real-time inference distribution; limited direct architectural comparison available.
- Break condition: If users draw in the same tile region simultaneously, contention increases and latency degrades. Queue depth monitoring and adaptive load shedding are required.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: ControlNet conditional diffusion
  - Why needed here: Enables structure-preserving image generation by conditioning on edge maps extracted from user sketches.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how ControlNet differs from standard text-conditioned diffusion, and what happens if the conditioning signal is weak?

- Concept: Vision-Language Models (VLM/CLIP) for semantic extraction
  - Why needed here: Extracts contextual intent—semantic meaning, mood, thematic cues—from visual input to guide generation prompts.
  - Quick check question: What types of visual features does CLIP encode, and what are its limitations for abstract or ambiguous sketches?

- Concept: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: Enables efficient style adaptation for background integration without retraining the full diffusion model.
  - Quick check question: How does LoRA modification differ from full model fine-tuning, and what determines which LoRA module is selected?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: TouchDesigner clients -> WebSocket queue server -> GPU workers (intent extraction, VAE encoding, ControlNet conditioning, two-stage diffusion) -> Post-processing/compositing module -> Canvas output

- Critical path:
  1. Stroke capture -> Concave Hull masking + Canny edge extraction (formal intent)
  2. CLIP-based VLM analysis -> prompt generation (contextual intent)
  3. VAE encoding + ControlNet conditioning + LoRA style selection
  4. Two-stage KSampler diffusion (coarse layout -> detail refinement)
  5. Pixel blending + seam stitching -> canvas compositing

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Denoising rate (0.3): Higher values increase creativity but reduce structural fidelity
  - Mask tightness: Tighter masks preserve formal intent but may create visible seams
  - Tile granularity: Finer tiles reduce contention but increase coordination overhead
  - Two-stage vs. single-pass generation: Adds latency but improves output quality

- Failure signatures:
  - "Ghost strokes": Generated content ignoring original stroke positions -> ControlNet conditioning failure or edge map degradation
  - "Style bleed": Background style conflicting with generated content -> LoRA mismatch or weak contextual extraction
  - "Latency spikes": Queue depth exceeding threshold -> insufficient GPU workers or tile contention
  - "Mask halo": Visible seams at stroke boundaries -> pixel blending parameters need adjustment

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline latency profiling**: Measure per-stage latency (masking, VLM, encoding, generation, compositing) under single-user load to identify bottlenecks.
  2. **Mask precision validation**: Compare Concave Hull vs. convex hull vs. bounding box masking on edge preservation metrics and user perception of stroke fidelity.
  3. **Multi-user stress test**: Simulate 4+ concurrent users drawing in overlapping vs. non-overlapping regions to validate tile partitioning effectiveness and queue scheduling behavior.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the system's notion of intent be expanded to incorporate social, spatial, and temporal context rather than relying solely on the immediate sketch content?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "Future work will extend the notion of intent beyond the sketch itself, incorporating contextual intent derived from the social, spatial, and temporal context in which creation occurs."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation derives contextual intent strictly from visual features (via VLMs) and user strokes, lacking mechanisms to sense or integrate the broader environment or interaction history.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified pipeline successfully integrating sensor data (e.g., crowd density, location, time of day) into the prompt generation or latent space conditioning, resulting in context-aware outputs distinct from the current version.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the system support evolving co-creative relationships through adaptive models that learn from repeated interactions with specific users?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors write, "We also aim to explore adaptive models that learn from repeated human–AI interactions, enabling evolving co-creative relationships."
- Why unresolved: The current system relies on pre-trained components (ControlNet, LoRA) and a distributed architecture that appears stateless regarding long-term user preferences or evolving styles.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal user study demonstrating that the system adapts its output style or structural interpretation over time based on user correction patterns, improving user satisfaction or perceived agency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the specific integration of formal and contextual intent reduce the "creative double bind" compared to baseline generative systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims the system addresses the "creative double bind" and redefines authorship, but supports this primarily through deployment descriptions and theoretical alignment rather than quantitative comparative metrics.
- Why unresolved: Without controlled experiments comparing this system against text-prompt-only or non-collaborative interfaces, it is unclear if the dual-intent mechanism significantly improves user agency or reduces tension.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled user study measuring perceived agency, authorship, and creative satisfaction between the proposed system and standard generative interfaces.

## Limitations
- Architectural details underspecified: Distributed inference architecture lacks implementation specifics needed for direct replication
- Model training details missing: LoRA training procedures, style datasets, and model checkpoints are not provided
- Performance validation scope: Limited quantitative metrics for structure preservation fidelity and semantic coherence quality

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Dual-intent integration mechanism (formal + contextual) and its implementation via ControlNet + CLIP-based VLM is technically sound and well-supported by literature
- **Medium confidence**: Concave Hull masking approach is novel but lacks comparative validation against alternative masking strategies
- **Medium confidence**: Latency claims are plausible given distributed architecture but not empirically validated across different hardware configurations or user loads

## Next Checks
1. **Latency profiling under realistic load**: Deploy the system with 4+ concurrent users on comparable hardware to measure actual end-to-end latency and identify potential bottlenecks
2. **Structure preservation benchmark**: Compare stroke fidelity preservation between Concave Hull masking and alternative approaches (convex hull, bounding box) using quantitative metrics and user studies
3. **Semantic coherence evaluation**: Assess the quality and consistency of VLM-extracted prompts across diverse sketch styles and content to validate contextual intent extraction robustness
