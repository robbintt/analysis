# Trust-Based Social Learning for Communication (TSLEC) Protocol Evolution in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.19562
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19562
- Authors: Abraham Itzhak Weinberg
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TSLEC reduces episodes-to-convergence by 23.9% compared to independent emergence (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.98)

## Executive Summary
TSLEC introduces trust-based social learning to accelerate emergent communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Agents explicitly teach successful strategies to peers, with knowledge transfer modulated by learned trust relationships that reflect teaching quality. Through experiments with 100 episodes across 30 random seeds, TSLEC demonstrates significant improvements in convergence speed, compositional protocol structure, and robustness under dynamic objectives.

## Method Summary
TSLEC extends Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration by adding explicit teaching and trust mechanisms. Each agent maintains a vocabulary, trust scores for peers, and goal vectors. During episodes, agents negotiate through 3 communication rounds, then enter teaching and adaptation phases. Teachers broadcast successful strategies with accompanying trust-weighted evaluations. Learners update trust asymmetrically (β_pos = 0.1, β_neg = 0.05) and adopt strategies only from high-trust teachers (τ > 0.7). Environmental goals adapt gradually (λ_env = 0.7) while peer goals blend at λ_peer = 0.8.

## Key Results
- Episodes-to-convergence reduced by 23.9% compared to independent emergence (p < 0.001, d = 1.98)
- Emergent protocols exhibit compositional structure (C = 0.38) without architectural constraints
- Protocols maintain robust performance under dynamic objectives (Φ > 0.867 decoding accuracy)
- Trust scores strongly correlate with teaching quality (r = 0.743, p < 0.001)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Trust-based social learning accelerates convergence by enabling agents to leverage peers' exploration rather than independently discovering strategies.
- **Mechanism:** High-performing agents encode successful strategies and broadcast teachings. Learners evaluate teacher reliability via trust scores updated asymmetrically (β_pos = 0.1, β_neg = 0.05). Only strategies from high-trust teachers (τ > 0.7) are adopted, filtering noise from low-quality knowledge.
- **Core assumption:** Trust scores accurately reflect teaching quality; asymmetric rates (positive updates 2× negative) correctly model that trust builds slowly but erodes quickly.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Trust-performance correlation r = 0.743 (p < 0.001) enables effective knowledge filtering
  - High-trust teachers (τ > 0.8) yield ∆R = +1.82±0.64 improvement versus low-trust teachers (τ < 0.4) yielding ∆R = +0.31±0.89 (t = 18.3, p < 0.001, d = 2.14)
- **Break condition:** If trust-performance correlation drops below r ≈ 0.5, or if environment changes faster than trust convergence (~53 episodes), filtering degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Social learning pressure promotes compositional protocol structure beyond what independent emergence produces.
- **Mechanism:** Teachers benefit from interpretable encodings that learners can decode. This creates selection pressure for systematic vocabularies where related concepts share symbol prefixes, enabling generalization to novel combinations.
- **Core assumption:** Compositional structure (C > 0.3 threshold) indicates genuinely systematic language rather than memorized symbol-concept pairs.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Full System achieves higher compositionality (0.383±0.042) than No Teaching (0.341±0.038, t = 4.12, p < 0.001, d = 1.05)
  - Compositional structure emerges in cooperative foraging, supporting generalizability
- **Break condition:** If concept space expands dramatically (>100 concepts) without vocabulary restructuring, compositionality scores may not generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Protocols maintain effectiveness under dynamic objectives because vocabularies encode concepts at appropriate abstraction levels.
- **Mechanism:** Goals adapt gradually (λ_env = 0.7, λ_peer = 0.8), preserving semantic mappings. Q-learning's ~7-episode adaptation time constant tracks 25-episode environmental change intervals without requiring vocabulary restructure.
- **Core assumption:** Environmental changes every 25 episodes represent realistic dynamic conditions; faster changes may exceed adaptation capacity.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Communication effectiveness remains Φ > 0.867 after environmental changes...minor drops (1-2 percentage points) are not statistically significant (t = 1.23, p = 0.22)
- **Break condition:** If change frequency increases to <10 episodes, or if concept space shifts qualitatively (new item types), decoding accuracy may degrade below functional thresholds.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Q-Learning with Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**
  - Why needed here: TSLEC builds on Q-learning as the base policy learner; understanding Q(s,a) updates and exploration-exploitation tradeoffs is prerequisite to grasping how teaching integrates with individual learning.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the paper uses `α t i ← arg max_a Q_i(s_t, a) or explore` as the fallback when no trusted peer exists?

- **Concept: Multi-Agent Credit Assignment**
  - Why needed here: Agents must attribute performance improvements to specific teachers versus their own exploration; trust updates depend on correctly identifying teaching effectiveness.
  - Quick check question: How does the paper's approach of comparing `R_j^e > R̄[e-10:e]` for teacher qualification address credit assignment?

- **Concept: Emergent Communication Protocols**
  - Why needed here: The vocabulary mechanism (lazy symbol creation, encoding/decoding) is the substrate over which social learning operates; without this foundation, teaching broadcasts would have no medium.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper use agent-specific prefixes in symbol creation, and what failure mode does this prevent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Environment -> Goal Sampling -> Negotiation (3 rounds) -> Teaching Phase -> Adaptation Phase -> Q-learning Update
- **Critical path:** Episodes 1-20: Rapid exploration, vocabulary growth, trust initialization → Episodes 20-50: Trust network formation, teaching onset, accelerated convergence → Episodes 50-100: Protocol stabilization, compositional structure emergence
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Trust threshold (0.7): Higher values slow adoption; lower values risk noise adoption. Paper shows 0.7 balances false-positive teaching rejection against exploitation delay.
  - Asymmetric trust rates: β_pos/β_neg = 2:1 reflects human trust psychology but may not be optimal for all agent populations.
  - Vocabulary prefix scheme: Ensures uniqueness but limits symbol interpretability across agents without vocabulary sharing.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Trust scores converge but teaching effectiveness η_teach drops → check if environment changed faster than trust re-convergence
  - Compositionality C < 0.2 at episode 100 → verify teaching pressure is active (No Teaching baseline should show this pattern)
  - Vocabulary size > 60 with low compression ratio → symbols being created for transient concepts; check goal stability
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Run Full System vs. No Teaching vs. Independent QL with 10 random seeds (reduced from 30) on standard 4-agent, 5-item configuration to verify 23.9% convergence improvement.
  2. **Trust ablation:** Replace asymmetric trust updates (0.1/-0.05) with symmetric (0.05/-0.05) to test sensitivity to the "trust builds slowly, erodes quickly" assumption.
  3. **Scaling probe:** Increase to N=8 agents while keeping episode count at 100 to identify if trust convergence time scales linearly or superlinearly with population size.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does TSLEC scale to larger agent populations, and what hierarchical communication architectures are needed beyond N=4 agents?
- **Open Question 2:** What theoretical convergence guarantees exist for trust-based social learning, and under what conditions does TSLEC provably converge?
- **Open Question 3:** Can emergent TSLEC protocols be grounded in natural language for human-agent collaboration?
- **Open Question 4:** Would multi-generational learning or expanded concept diversity push compositionality (C=0.38) toward human levels (0.7-0.9)?

## Limitations
- Results depend on specific parameter choices (trust threshold 0.7, asymmetric rates 0.1/-0.05, environmental change frequency every 25 episodes) that may not generalize
- Claim of compositional structure emergence "without architectural constraints" requires validation in richer semantic domains
- Trust-performance correlation (r = 0.743) is strong but not perfect, suggesting some noise in knowledge filtering

## Confidence
- Episodes-to-convergence improvement (23.9%, p < 0.001): High confidence
- Compositionality emergence (C = 0.38): Medium confidence
- Dynamic objective robustness (Φ > 0.867): Medium confidence
- Trust filtering effectiveness: High confidence

## Next Checks
1. **Trust parameter sensitivity:** Systematically vary trust threshold (0.5, 0.6, 0.8) and asymmetric rates (ratios 1:1, 3:1, 4:1) across 10 seeds each to identify optimal configurations and robustness boundaries
2. **Concept space scaling:** Test with 20 concepts (vs. current 5-10) to verify compositionality scores scale appropriately and teaching remains effective as vocabulary complexity increases
3. **Change frequency stress test:** Reduce environmental change interval from 25 to 15, 10, and 5 episodes while monitoring trust re-convergence time and decoding accuracy degradation to identify operational limits of dynamic adaptation
