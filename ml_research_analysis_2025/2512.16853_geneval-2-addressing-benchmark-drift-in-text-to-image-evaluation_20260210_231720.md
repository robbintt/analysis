# GenEval 2: Addressing Benchmark Drift in Text-to-Image Evaluation

## Quick Facts

- GenEval 2 addresses benchmark drift in text-to-image evaluation by introducing a new benchmark and evaluation method

## Executive Summary
GenEval 2 addresses a critical problem in text-to-image evaluation: benchmark drift. The original GenEval benchmark, which was well-aligned with human judgment at release, has drifted significantly as T2I model outputs evolved, resulting in up to 17.7% absolute error for current models. The new benchmark features improved coverage of visual concepts and higher compositionality, while the Soft-TIFA evaluation method combines judgments for visual primitives to better align with human judgment and demonstrate greater robustness to drift over time.

## Method Summary
GenEval 2 introduces a templated benchmark generation approach that creates prompts with atomicity levels from 3 to 10 by combining objects, attributes, relations, and counts. The Soft-TIFA evaluation method decomposes each prompt into atomic sub-questions, generates templated questions for each atom, and aggregates VQA model outputs using arithmetic mean for atom-level and geometric mean for prompt-level scores. The evaluation uses Qwen3-VL-8B as the VQA model and measures alignment with human judgment through AUROC across 23,226 human annotations.

## Key Results
- GenEval benchmark drifted from human judgment by up to 17.7% absolute error for current T2I models
- State-of-the-art models achieve only 35.8% accuracy at prompt level despite ~85% atom-level accuracy
- Performance drops from ~58% at atomicity=3 to near 0% at atomicity=10, indicating compositionality scaling failure
- Soft-TIFA shows greater robustness to benchmark drift than VQAScore, maintaining consistent alignment with human judgment over time

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Benchmark Drift from Distribution Shift
Static evaluation models lose alignment with human judgment as T2I output distributions evolve. GenEval uses a MaskFormer object detector trained on COCO (circa 2014). As T2I models trained on larger/synthetic datasets produce images with different visual distributions, the detector misclassifies objects—not because the image is wrong, but because the detector's priors are outdated. Human judgment remains relatively stable while automated judges trained on older data become progressively mismatched.

### Mechanism 2: Atomic Decomposition Reduces VQA Susceptibility to Distribution Shift
Breaking prompts into atomic sub-questions makes VQA-based evaluation more robust to image distribution changes. VQAScore asks a single holistic question ("Does this image show {prompt}?"). When image distributions shift, the VQA model's internal representation may diverge from training, degrading accuracy. Soft-TIFA decomposes into per-atom questions, reducing the semantic distance between any single question and the VQA model's training distribution—each question is simpler and more grounded.

### Mechanism 3: Compositionality Scaling Failure in Current T2I Models
T2I model accuracy degrades sharply as prompt compositionality increases, even when individual atoms are correctly generated. Current T2I models may generate each atom correctly in isolation but fail to bind them correctly in spatial/relational configurations. This suggests a binding problem—representations for individual concepts exist, but compositional reasoning requires global coordination that current architectures struggle with.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: AUROC (Area Under ROC Curve)**
  - Why needed here: Used to measure alignment between automated metrics and human judgment; distinguishes threshold-invariant ranking quality.
  - Quick check question: If a metric achieves 94.5% AUROC, does this mean it correctly classifies 94.5% of images? (No—it reflects ranking quality across thresholds, not accuracy at any single threshold.)

- **Concept: VQA-Based Evaluation**
  - Why needed here: Soft-TIFA, VQAScore, and TIFA all use VQA models as judges; understanding their limitations is critical.
  - Quick check question: Why might a VQA model correctly answer "How many cows?" but fail on "Does this image show four white bicycles in front of three plastic cows?" (Compositional queries require integrating multiple visual facts; atomic queries test single facts.)

- **Concept: Atomicity / Compositionality**
  - Why needed here: GenEval 2's core design variable; enables fine-grained diagnosis of model failures.
  - Quick check question: A prompt with atomicity 7 contains how many objects, attributes, and relations combined? (7 atoms total—compositionality is defined by atom count, not object count alone.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Benchmark Generator: Templates → Objects (40) + Attributes (18) + Relations (9) + Counts (6) → Prompts (atomicity 3-10)
  - Evaluation Pipeline: Prompt → T2I model → Image → Per-atom questions → Qwen3-VL-8B → Soft probabilities → Aggregate (AM/GM) → Score
  - Human Alignment: 23,226 annotations → Binary labels → AUROC computation

- **Critical path:**
  1. Prompt generation → T2I model inference → image generation
  2. Per-atom question generation → VQA inference → probability extraction
  3. Soft aggregation (AM for atom-level, GM for prompt-level) → benchmark score

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Geometric vs. Arithmetic Mean**: GM penalizes any low atom score (stricter prompt-level correctness); AM averages (atom-level performance view).
  - **Templated vs. LLM-Generated Questions**: Templates guarantee full coverage; LLM-generated (TIFA) may miss atoms for complex prompts.
  - **Open-Source VQA vs. GPT-4o**: Open-source (Qwen3-VL) enables reproducibility and logprob access; GPT-4o is closed-source, version-unstable, and less transparent.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Verb relation strictness**: Soft-TIFA assigns ~31% accuracy on verb skills vs. human ~65% (VQA model is stricter than humans on nuanced actions).
  - **Detector breakdown on distribution shift**: Toothbrush classified as bird when generated outside COCO-typical contexts.
  - **CLIP truncation**: SD3/Flux truncate rewritten prompts at 77 tokens, losing stylistic details.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce drift analysis**: Run GenEval's original detector on images from SD2.1 vs. Gemini 2.5 Flash Image; measure deviation from human labels on a 50-prompt subset.
  2. **Validate Soft-TIFA robustness**: Compare AUROC of VQAScore vs. Soft-TIFA using Qwen2-VL (older) and Qwen3-VL (newer) on images from models released before/after each VQA model's training cutoff.
  3. **Compositionality scaling test**: Evaluate a single T2I model on GenEval 2 prompts at atomicity 3, 5, 7, 10; plot atom-level vs. prompt-level accuracy to confirm scaling failure pattern.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Will Soft-TIFA maintain its robustness against benchmark drift over longer time horizons, or will significant distribution shifts eventually degrade its alignment similar to VQAScore?
- Basis in paper: The authors state, "However, it is entirely possible that greater distribution shift over a longer period of time may cause Soft-TIFAGM to show the same drift as VQAScore."
- Why unresolved: The study covers a 3-year window; future, more radical shifts in T2I model output distributions could overwhelm the atomic decomposition strategy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study evaluating Soft-TIFA's alignment on T2I models released 5-10 years in the future.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can evaluation methods be adapted to better align with human judgment on nuanced visual relations, specifically transitive verbs, where current VQA models are overly strict?
- Basis in paper: Appendix G notes that for transitive verbs, "VQA models are only as strong as their underlying VQA models," observing a strictness score of 31.4 compared to a human score of 65.0.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the misalignment but does not propose a mechanism to correct the VQA model's interpretation of action-oriented relations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing a VQA model or prompting strategy that closes the gap between automated and human scores on verb-related atoms.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the Soft-TIFA framework be effectively generalized to non-templated, open-ended prompts while maintaining full coverage of visual primitives?
- Basis in paper: The authors rely on GenEval 2's "templated design" to generate questions, noting that TIFA's LLM-based question generation can miss coverage on compositional prompts.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not test Soft-TIFA on free-form natural language prompts, leaving its utility for general-purpose evaluation unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying Soft-TIFA to benchmarks like GenAI-Bench or TIFA-Bench which utilize natural language prompts.

## Limitations
- Human evaluation data collected from only 8 T2I models (21,226 annotations), potentially limiting representativeness of broader T2I landscape
- Soft-TIFA's performance fundamentally tied to quality and training distribution of underlying VQA model (Qwen3-VL-8B)
- Templated prompts may not fully capture diversity and complexity of real-world user prompts

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The empirical observation of benchmark drift in GenEval (measured deviation up to 17.7% from human judgment)
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that Soft-TIFA is more robust to drift than alternatives (supported by AUROC comparisons)
- **Medium Confidence**: The finding that compositionality scaling causes performance collapse (empirically demonstrated but influenced by methodology)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-VQA Validation**: Repeat the drift robustness experiment using multiple VQA models (e.g., Qwen2-VL, GPT-4o vision) to isolate whether Soft-TIFA's drift resistance is method-dependent or VQA-model-dependent.

2. **Extended Human Judgment**: Expand human evaluation to include at least 15 additional T2I models spanning a wider temporal range (e.g., models from 2022-2025) to better characterize long-term drift patterns and validate Soft-TIFA's consistency.

3. **Real-World Prompt Generalization**: Test Soft-TIFA's performance on a dataset of user-generated prompts (e.g., from LAION or real-world usage logs) to assess whether templated-prompt findings generalize to naturalistic input distributions.
