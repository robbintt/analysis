# HySemRAG: A Hybrid Semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Automated Literature Synthesis and Methodological Gap Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.05666
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05666
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** 35.1% higher semantic similarity scores with structured field extraction vs PDF chunking, 99% citation accuracy in validated responses

## Executive Summary
HySemRAG presents a hybrid RAG framework combining ETL pipelines with multi-agent QA to automate literature synthesis and identify methodological research gaps. The system processes ~500-1300 open-access PDFs through eight-stage extraction, creating dual data products (Neo4j knowledge graph and Qdrant vector collections) that enable both complex relationship queries and semantic search. Evaluation across 643 observations demonstrates significant improvements over baseline approaches, with structured field extraction achieving 0.655 ±0.178 semantic similarity scores compared to 0.485 ±0.204 for PDF chunking.

## Method Summary
The framework employs an 8-stage ETL pipeline beginning with multi-source metadata collection and asynchronous PDF retrieval via Unpaywall. Modified Docling performs layout analysis with custom heuristics for formula merging and masked images, followed by Zotero citation management and Qwen3-32B field extraction using iterative chunking. LDA topic modeling generates semantic embeddings processed through all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for unification, then indexed into Neo4j KG and Qdrant collections. A multi-agent QA system iterates between Claude Sonnet 4 (drafting) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (evaluation) with up to three refinement cycles, achieving 68.3% single-pass success rates and 99.0% citation accuracy.

## Key Results
- Structured field extraction achieves 35.1% higher semantic similarity scores (0.655 ±0.178) compared to PDF chunking baseline (0.485 ±0.204, p < 0.000001)
- Agentic quality assurance mechanism achieves 68.3% single-pass success rates with 99.0% citation accuracy in validated responses
- Temporal performance degradation observed at -1.9% daily decline, suggesting model drift or prompt degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid retrieval approach combines semantic search, keyword filtering, and knowledge graph traversal to overcome limitations in traditional RAG architectures. The multi-layered agentic self-correction framework provides iterative quality assurance, while post-hoc citation verification ensures complete traceability. The dual data product strategy (Neo4j KG + Qdrant vectors) enables both complex relationship queries and semantic search capabilities, creating foundational infrastructure for verifiable information synthesis.

## Foundational Learning
- **Docling Layout Analysis**: Custom modifications for formula merging and masked images; needed to preserve scientific notation integrity during extraction; quick check: verify _merge_vertically_adjacent_formulas output
- **Multi-Agent QA Pipeline**: Claude Sonnet 4 drafting + Gemini 2.5 Flash evaluation with iterative refinement; needed to achieve high citation accuracy through self-correction; quick check: monitor single-pass success rates
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Neo4j schema with entity-relationship modeling; needed to enable complex relationship queries beyond simple keyword matching; quick check: validate relationship patterns between entities
- **Vector Similarity Thresholding**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings with cosine similarity threshold ≥0.55; needed to balance recall and precision in semantic search; quick check: test threshold impact on retrieval accuracy
- **Temporal Performance Monitoring**: Daily accuracy tracking to detect model drift; needed to ensure production reliability; quick check: log citation accuracy across consecutive sessions

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: PubMed/OpenAlex/Scopus APIs -> Unpaywall PDF retrieval -> Modified Docling -> Zotero citation management -> Qwen3-32B field extraction -> LDA topic modeling -> Semantic unification -> Neo4j KG + Qdrant indexing -> Multi-agent QA
- **Critical Path**: PDF retrieval → Docling extraction → LLM field extraction → Knowledge graph indexing → QA validation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Multi-agent QA increases accuracy but requires additional compute; hybrid retrieval improves coverage but adds complexity; temporal monitoring adds overhead but ensures reliability
- **Failure Signatures**: Docling misclassification of line-number margins, formula fragmentation, and daily performance degradation (-1.9%/day)
- **First Experiments**: (1) Benchmark modified Docling against standard Docling on sample PDFs, (2) Test hybrid retrieval accuracy with controlled queries, (3) Validate citation accuracy across 5-10 papers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: What specific factors drive the observed temporal instability (-1.9% daily performance decline), and can they be mitigated? The evaluation revealed this degradation but didn't isolate the mechanism (embedding drift vs prompt fatigue).
- **Open Question 2**: How robust are the custom document layout heuristics when applied to scientific domains with different formatting conventions? Current study is restricted to geospatial epidemiology.
- **Open Question 3**: How can the agentic self-correction framework be optimized to improve iterative refinement yield? The 68.3% single-pass success rate drops to 61.3% after refinement, suggesting inefficiencies.

## Limitations
- Modified Docling codebase and exact prompt configurations not publicly available, limiting reproducibility
- Performance claims rely on comparison against single baseline without ablation studies isolating component contributions
- Temporal degradation suggests potential prompt drift or embedding cache issues that could compound in production
- Evaluation corpus composition and specific query sets remain unspecified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Methodological framework description and multi-agent QA pipeline architecture
- **Medium confidence**: Quantitative performance metrics due to incomplete methodological details for baseline comparison
- **Low confidence**: Practical applicability without access to modified Docling implementation and exact prompt configurations

## Next Checks
1. Obtain and benchmark the modified Docling codebase against standard Docling on a standardized PDF corpus to verify the claimed 7.1% layout accuracy improvement
2. Replicate the semantic similarity evaluation using the same 50-sample query set with controlled document inputs to validate the 0.655 ±0.178 score versus the reported baseline
3. Conduct a longitudinal test running the QA pipeline daily for two weeks to measure citation accuracy degradation and identify whether performance decline follows the reported -1.9%/day pattern or exhibits different behavior under continuous operation
