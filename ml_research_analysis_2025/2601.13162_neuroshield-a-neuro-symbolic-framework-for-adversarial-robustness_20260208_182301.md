# NeuroShield: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Adversarial Robustness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.13162
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13162
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: 18.1% and 17.35% FGSM and PGD adversarial accuracy improvements over standard adversarial training

## Executive Summary
NeuroShield is a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances adversarial robustness by integrating symbolic rule supervision into neural networks. The approach encodes domain knowledge as logical constraints over appearance attributes like shape and color, enforcing these through semantic and symbolic logic losses during training. Evaluated on GTSRB, NeuroShield achieves significant robustness gains without reducing clean accuracy, demonstrating that symbolic reasoning can effectively complement traditional adversarial training.

## Method Summary
NeuroShield modifies a ResNet18 backbone to preserve spatial resolution for small traffic signs, then adds parallel symbolic attribute heads alongside the classification head. The framework trains using a combined loss of classification cross-entropy, symbolic logic loss (joint rule consistency), and semantic loss (KL divergence over symbolically equivalent classes). Adversarial examples are generated on-the-fly during training, with the symbolic supervision disciplining how robustness emerges through semantically consistent representations rather than brittle low-level features.

## Key Results
- FGSM-Neuro-Symbolic achieves 56.27% adversarial accuracy, a 18.1% improvement over standard FGSM adversarial training
- PGD-Neuro-Symbolic reaches 55.66% adversarial accuracy, improving by 17.35% over PGD baselines
- Clean accuracy remains high at 98.1% for FGSM-Neuro-Symbolic and 97.7% for PGD-Neuro-Symbolic variants
- Achieves comparable robustness to transformer-based LNL-MoEx using a simpler ResNet18 backbone trained for only 10 epochs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Joint symbolic logic loss disciplines how adversarial robustness is expressed by enforcing semantically consistent attribute configurations under perturbation.
- **Mechanism:** The joint rule loss (L_joint) evaluates whether all symbolic attributes (shape, color, category, icon) are jointly consistent with the predicted class. When combined with adversarial training, gradients from this loss force the shared backbone to organize features so that robustness emerges through rule-consistent representations rather than brittle low-level cues.
- **Core assumption:** Symbolic attributes are learnable from raw pixels without manual feature engineering, and the soft implication formulation can meaningfully capture class-attribute logical relationships.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Domain knowledge is encoded as logical constraints over appearance attributes such as shape and color, and enforced through semantic and symbolic logic losses applied during training."
  - [section 2] "The joint rule loss does not by itself create robustness, but when combined with adversarial training it disciplines how robustness is expressed, steering the network toward decision regions where both class predictions and symbolic attributes remain jointly stable under attack."
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; neighbor papers discuss neuro-symbolic integration but not this specific joint loss mechanism.
- **Break condition:** If symbolic attributes cannot be reliably predicted from the backbone features (low attribute accuracy), the joint loss provides noisy supervision and may degrade rather than improve robustness.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Semantic loss improves interpretability and robustness by allowing the model to distribute confidence across symbolically equivalent classes rather than forcing a single hard label.
- **Mechanism:** The semantic loss uses KL divergence between the predicted class distribution and a soft target distribution q over all classes sharing the same symbolic attributes. This makes model errors more interpretable (e.g., confusing two speed limit signs rather than a speed limit with a stop sign) while providing regularization.
- **Core assumption:** Symbolically equivalent classes form a meaningful grouping that the model should treat as internally interchangeable.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "symbolic rule supervision into neural networks to enhance both adversarial robustness and explainability"
  - [section 2] "This loss allows it to distribute confidence across all symbolically valid classes (e.g., all speed limit signs). This makes the model's mistakes more interpretable."
  - [corpus] Semantic loss concept aligns with Xu et al. (reference 9) but corpus lacks direct validation of this specific formulation.
- **Break condition:** If the symbolic equivalence groupings are poorly defined or overly broad, the semantic loss may encourage ambiguous predictions without meaningful robustness gains.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Adaptive weight allocation focuses symbolic supervision on currently weak components, encouraging balanced feature learning.
- **Mechanism:** The importance weights w_j in the joint loss are updated at each epoch based on symbolic attribute accuracy—components with lower accuracy receive higher weights. This creates a curriculum-like effect where the model prioritizes correcting its weakest symbolic predictions.
- **Core assumption:** Attribute accuracy during training is a reliable proxy for which symbolic components need additional supervision.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 2] "Components with lower accuracy (e.g., shape, text, or icon) receive higher weights, which encourages the model to focus more on correcting those inconsistencies during training."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for this adaptive weighting mechanism.
- **Break condition:** If attribute accuracy oscillates or is noisy across epochs, adaptive weights may cause unstable training dynamics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Adversarial training (FGSM/PGD)**
  - Why needed here: NeuroShield builds on standard adversarial training as a baseline. Understanding how FGSM (single-step) and PGD (iterative) generate adversarial examples at ε=8/255 is essential to interpret the robustness gains.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why PGD generally produces stronger adversarial examples than FGSM under the same perturbation budget?

- **Concept: Soft logic / fuzzy truth values**
  - Why needed here: The symbolic logic loss uses soft implications T(A⇒B) with continuous truth values in [0,1], not hard binary constraints.
  - Quick check question: What does T(A⇒B)=1 indicate versus T(A⇒B)<1 in Equation 4?

- **Concept: Shared representation learning**
  - Why needed here: A single 512-dim backbone feature vector feeds both classification and symbolic heads—understanding multi-task gradient interactions is critical.
  - Quick check question: If classification loss decreases but logic loss increases, what might be happening in the shared representation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → Modified ResNet18 backbone (3×3 initial conv, no max pooling) → 512-dim global feature vector → Classifier head (512→43 for GTSRB classes) and Symbolic MLP heads (512→128→d_attr for each attribute)

- **Critical path:** The backbone modification (removing max pooling, using 3×3 conv) preserves spatial resolution for small traffic signs—this must not be reverted. The joint symbolic loss L_joint must be computed over all attributes simultaneously, not independently.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Training epochs (10) vs. overfitting risk: Short training encourages symbolic reasoning over dataset memorization but may underutilize model capacity.
  - λ_logic adaptive vs. fixed: Adaptive increases pressure on uncertain predictions but introduces hyperparameter sensitivity.
  - Symbolic head architecture: Lightweight MLPs keep overhead low but may lack capacity for complex attributes.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High clean accuracy, low adversarial accuracy without symbolic training → symbolic loss not integrated properly.
  - Clean accuracy drops significantly (e.g., PGD-Clean baseline at 7%) → adversarial signal overpowering clean supervision.
  - Attribute predictions near random (≈1/n_classes) → symbolic heads not learning; check gradient flow from L_joint.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Train standard ResNet18 with FGSM adversarial training only (no symbolic losses) and verify ~45% FGSM accuracy on GTSRB to match Table 1.
  2. **Ablation on L_joint vs. independent L_logic:** Compare robustness when using per-attribute logic losses (Eq. 5) versus the unified joint loss (Eq. 6) to validate the paper's claim that joint loss is critical.
  3. **Epoch sensitivity:** Train NeuroShield variants for 5, 10, and 20 epochs to test whether the 10-epoch constraint is necessary or if performance continues improving with longer training.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can NeuroShield be extended to support chained logical inference or the dynamic generation of symbolic rules from foundational knowledge?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states future work involves extending "symbolic reasoning beyond static rule checks toward chained logical inference" to handle uncertainty.
- **Why unresolved:** The current framework relies on static class-wise dictionaries for attributes like shape and color, limiting adaptability to novel scenarios.
- **Evidence:** Successful application of the framework to dynamic driving scenarios where intermediate rules are derived rather than pre-encoded.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can the framework be optimized for edge devices using lightweight backbones or quantization without compromising symbolic robustness?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state they aim to "adapt our framework for edge devices... by exploring lightweight backbones, early exits, and quantized inference."
- **Why unresolved:** While inference costs are currently low, the feasibility of maintaining the precision required for symbolic consistency during model compression is untested.
- **Evidence:** Benchmarks showing maintained adversarial accuracy and logic consistency on resource-constrained hardware using the proposed optimizations.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the symbolic supervision approach transfer to less structured datasets where attribute definition is ambiguous?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper evaluates exclusively on GTSRB, a dataset with highly structured visuals, while comparing against baselines tested on general datasets like CIFAR-10.
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the method's reliance on explicit attribute maps (shape, color, icon) is viable for complex, natural scenes where such symbols are not distinctly defined.
- **Evidence:** Evaluation of NeuroShield on diverse datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10) demonstrating that logic losses improve robustness even when symbolic attributes are abstract.

## Limitations

- The exact definitions of symbolic attributes (shapes, colors, icons, categories) and their mappings to GTSRB classes are not specified, requiring manual domain knowledge encoding
- Critical hyperparameters including loss weights (λ_logic, λ_semantic), adaptive weight update rules, optimizer settings, and batch size are unspecified
- The 10-epoch training constraint appears to be a design choice that may limit model capacity utilization, but its necessity is not empirically validated
- Performance comparison relies heavily on standard adversarial training baselines without exploring other state-of-the-art robust training methods

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The fundamental mechanism that joint symbolic logic loss combined with adversarial training improves robustness by enforcing semantically consistent representations
- **Medium confidence:** The adaptive weight allocation mechanism's effectiveness, as it lacks direct corpus support and depends on noisy attribute accuracy signals
- **Medium confidence:** The semantic loss interpretability claims, which are conceptually sound but lack direct empirical validation in the paper

## Next Checks

1. **Symbolic attribute definition validation:** Implement the symbolic attribute mappings and verify that attribute prediction accuracy exceeds random chance (>50%) before testing robustness gains
2. **Loss component ablation:** Systematically disable the semantic loss and adaptive weighting to isolate the contribution of the joint logic loss to robustness improvements
3. **Epoch length sensitivity:** Extend training to 20-30 epochs while monitoring both clean accuracy and adversarial robustness to determine if the 10-epoch constraint is optimal or limiting
