# Communication Enables Cooperation in LLM Agents: A Comparison with Curriculum-Based Approaches

- A one-word "cheap talk" channel increased cooperation from 0% to 48.3% in a 4-player Stag Hunt game

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates two approaches for eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems: direct communication and curriculum learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt game, a one-word "cheap talk" channel dramatically increased cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust coordination mechanism. In contrast, curriculum learning proved highly sensitive to design choices - a pedagogical sequence through progressively complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game with Punishment. Qualitative analysis revealed that curricula emphasizing defection-equilibrium games induced "learned pessimism," where agents overgeneralized lessons from short-horizon games to contexts where cooperation was viable. The findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons embedded in game sequences.

## Method Summary
The study compared two coordination mechanisms in LLM agents: direct communication through a one-word "cheap talk" channel versus curriculum learning approaches. The Stag Hunt game tested communication effects with four agents choosing between cooperative (Stag) and selfish (Hare) actions, with a simple word-based communication channel added to one condition. For curriculum learning, agents progressed through a sequence of games with increasing complexity, starting from simpler coordination problems and advancing to more challenging social dilemmas. Performance was measured through cooperation rates and aggregate payoffs across multiple game iterations, with qualitative analysis of agent behavior patterns.

## Key Results
- One-word communication channel increased cooperation from 0% to 48.3% in 4-player Stag Hunt game
- Curriculum learning reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in Iterated Public Goods Game with Punishment
- Agents developed "learned pessimism" from curricula emphasizing defection-equilibrium games

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Communication provides direct information exchange that helps agents align strategies in coordination games. The one-word channel creates a simple signaling mechanism that allows agents to indicate intentions and coordinate on mutually beneficial outcomes. Curriculum learning fails when the sequence of games teaches agents to expect defection, causing them to misapply lessons from short-horizon games to situations where cooperation would be beneficial.

## Foundational Learning
- Stag Hunt game dynamics - why needed: Core coordination problem where individual and collective incentives can conflict
  - Quick check: Can agents learn to coordinate without communication?
- Cheap talk theory - why needed: Explains how non-binding communication can facilitate coordination
  - Quick check: Does communication content matter or just presence?
- Curriculum learning design - why needed: Shows how learning sequences can embed strategic biases
  - Quick check: What determines whether curriculum helps or harms?
- Learned pessimism concept - why needed: Explains how experience can create counterproductive strategic expectations
  - Quick check: Can agents unlearn negative strategic assumptions?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Game Environment -> LLM Agent -> Action Selection -> Outcome Evaluation -> (Communication Channel | Curriculum Module)

Critical Path: Game state presentation → Agent reasoning → Action decision → Outcome feedback → Performance assessment

Design Tradeoffs:
- Communication vs. complexity: Simple channels work well but may not scale to richer coordination needs
- Curriculum pacing: Slower progression reduces negative generalization but requires more training time
- Game selection: Must balance between teaching useful strategies and avoiding harmful lessons

Failure Signatures:
- Communication failure: Persistent miscoordination despite channel availability
- Curriculum failure: Declining performance across sequence progression
- Overgeneralization: Applying short-horizon strategies to inappropriate contexts

First Experiments:
1. Test communication effectiveness across 3-5 structurally diverse coordination games
2. Systematically vary curriculum sequence parameters to identify optimal design
3. Implement interpretability analysis to observe strategic expectation formation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Results derived from single game variants with fixed parameters may not generalize
- Only one pedagogical sequence tested across two game types
- No interpretability analysis of agent decision processes before/after training

## Confidence
- High confidence: Communication advantage in Stag Hunt due to stark performance difference and clean design
- Medium confidence: Curriculum learning is generally inferior to communication - evidence shows it can backfire when poorly designed but doesn't establish it cannot work with better sequencing
- Low confidence: "Learned pessimism" interpretation of curriculum failures without evidence of how agents represent strategic expectations

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the Stag Hunt communication experiment across 3-5 structurally diverse coordination games (e.g., Chicken, Battle of the Sexes, Prisoner's Dilemma) to test generalizability of the communication effect.

2. Systematically vary the curriculum sequence parameters (game ordering, duration, complexity progression) to identify whether the negative outcomes are design-specific or reflect a broader limitation of experience-based training.

3. Implement interpretability analysis of agent decision processes before and after curriculum training to directly observe whether strategic pessimism emerges as hypothesized, or whether other mechanisms explain the performance degradation.
