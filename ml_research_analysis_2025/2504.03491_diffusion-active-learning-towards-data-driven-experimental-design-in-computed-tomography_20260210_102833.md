# Diffusion Active Learning: Towards Data-Driven Experimental Design in Computed Tomography

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.03491
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03491
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line result:** Up to 4× reduction in measurements needed to reach target PSNR of 30 dB on structured CT datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Diffusion Active Learning (DAL), a framework combining generative diffusion models with active learning for adaptive experimental design in computed tomography. DAL trains a diffusion model on domain-specific CT data to serve as a learned prior, then uses this model to approximate the posterior distribution conditioned on current measurements. The method selects the most informative measurement angles by quantifying uncertainty in the current reconstruction estimate, with the goal of reducing data acquisition requirements and X-ray dose while improving image quality.

The approach was evaluated on three real-world tomography datasets (integrated circuits, composite materials, and lung scans) and compared to uniform acquisition and active learning with dataset-agnostic generative models. Results show that DAL achieves up to 4× reduction in measurements needed to reach a target PSNR of 30 dB, with up to 4.3× improvement in data efficiency compared to the Laplace baseline on composite materials.

## Method Summary
DAL combines pre-trained diffusion models with active learning for CT reconstruction. First, an unconditional diffusion model is trained on domain-specific CT data to learn structural priors. During active learning, the model generates conditional samples from the posterior distribution given current measurements using a "soft data consistency" approach with early stopping. The algorithm then selects the next measurement angle by computing variance across forward projections of these samples, choosing the angle with maximum variance. This process iterates until reaching the desired reconstruction quality or measurement budget.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 4× reduction in measurements needed to reach PSNR of 30 dB on structured datasets
- Outperforms uniform acquisition by up to 4.3× in data efficiency on composite materials dataset
- Reaches PSNR scores of 32.9 dB with only 50 measurements on chip dataset
- Demonstrates computational efficiency with less than two minutes per step at 512×512 resolution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Learned Structural Priors as Regularizers
The diffusion model learns an unconditional distribution of valid images (e.g., circuit layouts). During reconstruction, this distribution acts as a strong, data-dependent regularizer. Instead of fitting any solution that satisfies the measurements, the solver projects the estimate onto the manifold of "real-looking" images, effectively filling in missing information with learned structural knowledge. This works best when test data distribution matches training distribution.

### Mechanism 2: Posterior Variance as an Acquisition Signal
The variance of samples drawn from the posterior distribution (conditioned on current measurements) provides a reliable proxy for uncertainty, guiding the selection of the most informative next measurement angle. The model generates diverse samples consistent with current observations, and by applying the forward operator to these samples, it identifies projection angles where the samples disagree most. Measuring these high-variance angles maximally constrains the posterior.

### Mechanism 3: Soft Data Consistency (Efficiency Optimization)
Solving the measurement consistency optimization problem with early stopping balances reconstruction accuracy with computational speed better than full convergence. Instead of iterating until the data-consistency loss is fully minimized (costly), the method takes a fixed, small number of gradient steps. This retains the structural features from the diffusion prior while nudging the sample toward data consistency, reducing the overhead of back-propagation through the sampling chain.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Radon Transform & Filtered Back-Projection (FBP)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the physical forward model being inverted. Understanding how projections map to image space is essential to grasp why sparse angles cause artifacts (streaks) that the diffusion model must correct.
  - **Quick check question:** If you have projections at only 20 angles, why does FBP produce streaking artifacts?

- **Concept: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)**
  - **Why needed here:** The core generative engine. You must understand the forward (noising) and reverse (denoising) processes to understand how the model acts as a prior.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the "score function" (gradient of log probability) relate to removing noise from an image?

- **Concept: Bayesian Active Learning / Uncertainty Sampling**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the decision-making logic. The method relies on the premise that querying the "most uncertain" region reduces overall error fastest.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might "uncertainty sampling" fail if the model is confidently wrong (high confidence, low accuracy)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Pre-training Module -> Active Learning Loop -> Sampler -> Acquisition -> Selection -> Update
- **Critical path:** The Soft Data Consistency implementation. This differs from standard latent-diffusion approaches. Implementing the "Tweedie's formula" estimate followed by a fixed-step SGD on the measurement loss is the specific implementation that yields the reported 4× speedup over Hard Consistency baselines.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Dataset Structure vs. Gain: Expect high gains on structured data (chips/composites); expect negligible gain on unstructured/isotropic data (lungs/medical).
  - Pixel vs. Latent: The authors use pixel-space diffusion for 512×512 images for simplicity and speed, avoiding latent decoder overhead.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - OOD Hallucinations: If the test sample has a defect not in the training set, the prior will "fix" (erase) the defect.
  - Circular Uniformity: On datasets like Lung (isotropic features), the algorithm may default to near-uniform sampling because no direction offers significantly higher variance.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check: Train DDPM on MNIST (simple shapes). Implement the Radon transform. Verify that conditional sampling can reconstruct a digit from 5-10 projections.
  2. Ablation (Consistency): Compare "Hard" vs. "Soft" data consistency on a single image. Plot PSNR vs. Time to verify the claimed efficiency trade-off.
  3. Acquisition Validation: Run the full loop on the "Chip" dataset vs. "Lung" dataset. Confirm that the Chip experiment shows a clear active learning advantage over uniform sampling, while Lung does not.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can diffusion active learning transfer effectively to real-world CT acquisition where challenges like sample alignment, measurement noise, and instrument artifacts are present? The authors acknowledge that real-world tomography experimental setup introduces additional challenges including sample alignment and measurement noise, and there remains a sim-to-real gap to be addressed in future works.

### Open Question 2
How can DAL be adapted to detect out-of-distribution samples without introducing reconstruction bias toward the training distribution? The authors note that the learned prior comes at the cost of introducing reconstruction bias in cases where the measured sample is not contained in the training distribution, which is particularly relevant when the goal is to detect small deviations or defects in the samples.

### Open Question 3
What structural or statistical properties of imaging datasets predict the magnitude of active learning benefit? The authors state that gains are dataset dependent, showing improvements in particular with highly structured images, but the characterization remains qualitative without quantifying what specific image statistics predict active learning utility.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness is highly dependent on structural regularity of target dataset; minimal benefit on isotropic, unstructured datasets like lung CT scans
- Learned diffusion prior can introduce artifacts when encountering out-of-distribution samples or novel features not present in training data
- Computational overhead from generating multiple conditional samples at each active learning step, despite optimizations

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Computational efficiency claims (4× speedup vs Hard Consistency, <2 minutes per step at 512×512 resolution)
- **Medium Confidence:** 4× reduction in measurements for achieving 30 dB PSNR on structured datasets, but not uniformly across all test cases
- **Medium Confidence:** Variance-based acquisition strategy is theoretically sound but depends heavily on quality of conditional sampling

## Next Checks
1. **OOD Generalization Test:** Evaluate DAL on datasets with known structural differences from training data to quantify how the learned prior affects reconstruction of novel features and potential hallucination artifacts
2. **Sample Efficiency Analysis:** Systematically vary the number of conditional samples (k) and initial measurements (D1) to identify optimal trade-off between reconstruction quality and computational cost across different dataset types
3. **Uncertainty Calibration Validation:** Compare variance-based acquisition strategy against alternative uncertainty quantification methods (ensembles, MC dropout) on same datasets to verify diffusion posterior variance provides reliable acquisition signal
