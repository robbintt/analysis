# Universal Dynamic Regret and Constraint Violation Bounds for Constrained Online Convex Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01867
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01867
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Two new algorithms for COCO with adversarial constraints achieve optimal universal dynamic regret bounds without common feasibility assumptions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses constrained online convex optimization (COCO) where both costs and constraints can be adversarial and may not have a common feasible point. The authors propose two algorithms that achieve strong universal dynamic regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. The first uses projection onto time-varying feasible sets for optimal regret, while the second is projection-free and better suited for rapidly changing environments. Both algorithms construct surrogate cost functions to reduce the problem to standard online convex optimization.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes two main algorithms built on a template that constructs surrogate costs from historical information and calls an OCO subroutine. Algorithm 2 uses projection-based methods with ADER to achieve optimal regret of $O(\sqrt{T(1+P_T)})$ and constraint violation $O(\sqrt{T(1+P_T^*)})$. Algorithm 5 is projection-free, using AHAG to achieve regret $O((1+P_T)\sqrt{T})$ and constraint violation $O(T^{3/4} + \sqrt{T(1+P_T^*)})$. The algorithms handle adversarial constraints by incorporating constraint violations into the surrogate cost functions, allowing them to adapt to environments without common feasibility.

## Key Results
- Algorithm 2 achieves optimal universal dynamic regret $O(\sqrt{T(1+P_T)})$ and constraint violation $O(\sqrt{T(1+P_T^*)})$ using projection.
- Algorithm 5 achieves regret $O((1+P_T)\sqrt{T})$ and constraint violation $O(T^{3/4} + \sqrt{T(1+P_T^*)})$ without projection, requiring only gradient feedback.
- Both algorithms remove the common feasibility assumption found in prior work.
- The paper introduces a new Lipschitz-adaptive OCO algorithm that may be of independent interest.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by constructing surrogate cost functions that penalize constraint violations while preserving convexity. These surrogates are designed to be Lipschitz continuous and incorporate historical information about constraint violations. By reducing the constrained problem to a standard OCO problem with these carefully constructed surrogates, the algorithms can leverage existing OCO techniques while handling adversarial constraints. The projection-based approach achieves optimal regret by maintaining feasibility, while the projection-free approach trades some regret for computational efficiency in dynamic environments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Universal Dynamic Regret**: Measures performance against any comparator sequence, not just static points. Needed because it captures performance in non-stationary environments. Quick check: Verify regret bounds scale with path length $P_T$ of comparator sequence.
- **Cumulative Constraint Violation (CCV)**: Tracks total amount by which constraints are violated over time. Needed to measure feasibility in adversarial settings. Quick check: Ensure violation bounds scale with path length $P_T^*$ of feasible comparator.
- **Surrogate Cost Construction**: Technique of building modified cost functions that incorporate constraint information. Needed to reduce constrained problem to unconstrained OCO. Quick check: Verify surrogate costs remain convex and Lipschitz.
- **ADER/AHAG Subroutines**: Adaptive algorithms for OCO that handle expert advice. Needed for online learning with surrogate costs. Quick check: Test these subroutines on simple OCO problems before integrating.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
- Template Algorithm -> ADER/AHAG Subroutine -> Decision $x_t$
- Constraint Functions $g_t$ -> Surrogate Cost $\hat{f}_t$ -> OCO Algorithm
- Gradient Oracle -> Surrogate Cost Evaluation -> Parameter Updates

**Critical Path:**
1. Receive $f_t$, $g_t$ at round $t$
2. Construct surrogate cost $\hat{f}_t$ using historical data
3. Call OCO subroutine (ADER or AHAG) to select $x_t$
4. Observe feedback and update cumulative violation $Q(t)$
5. Repeat for next round

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Algorithm 2: Optimal regret vs computational cost of projection
- Algorithm 5: Projection-free vs suboptimal regret dependence on path length
- Parameter $V$ tuning: Balances exploration vs constraint satisfaction

**Failure Signatures:**
- Linear growth in CCV: Indicates incorrect surrogate cost construction or $V$ parameter too small
- Projection failures: Constraint set $X_t^*$ too complex for efficient projection
- Regret exceeding bounds: Surrogate costs not Lipschitz or gradient oracles malfunctioning

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement Algorithm 5 on simple quadratic costs with linear constraints, verify sublinear regret
2. Test ADER/AHAG subroutines independently on standard OCO benchmarks
3. Compare Algorithm 2 vs Algorithm 5 on environments with varying constraint dynamics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can we establish simultaneous lower bounds for universal dynamic regret and cumulative constraint violation in the setting without common feasibility?
- Is it possible to extend the proposed framework to bandit feedback settings where only function values are observed?
- Can the projection-free Algorithm 5 be improved to achieve the optimal regret bound of $O(\sqrt{(1+P_T)T})$ without requiring projection onto time-varying feasible sets?

## Limitations
- The projection operation in Algorithm 2 may be computationally expensive for complex constraint sets
- Algorithm 5 trades optimality for efficiency, with worse regret dependence on path length
- The paper is theoretical with no empirical validation provided

## Confidence
- **High**: Theoretical regret and constraint violation bounds are mathematically proven
- **Medium**: Practical applicability is uncertain due to lack of empirical results and computational complexity of projections
- **Medium**: Dependency on ADER subroutine implementation without specific details provided

## Next Checks
1. **Projection Feasibility Test**: Verify that projection onto $X_t^*$ can be computed efficiently (e.g., in $O(d)$ time) for the specific constraint structure used in your application
2. **ADER Implementation**: Obtain or implement the ADER algorithm (Zhang et al., 2018) and test it in a simplified OCO setting to ensure the expert selection mechanism is working correctly
3. **Gradient Oracle Check**: For Algorithm 5, confirm that the gradient oracle implementation correctly handles the surrogate cost $\hat{f}_t(x) = V f_t(x) + \Phi'(Q(t))g_t^+(x)$ and that the parameter $V$ is set according to the theoretical guidelines
