# Unlocking the Forgery Detection Potential of Vanilla MLLMs: A Novel Training-Free Pipeline

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.13442
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13442
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Training-free MLLM pipeline achieves 78.3-80.9 AUC across datasets, outperforming trained methods in forgery localization.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Foresee, a training-free pipeline that leverages vanilla MLLMs for image forgery detection and localization (IFDL). The method addresses limitations of existing trained models by using a type-prior-driven strategy and a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module. Foresee achieves superior localization accuracy and interpretability across six tampering types without requiring model training, making it a practical solution for forensic analysis in the era of AI-generated content.

## Method Summary
Foresee is a three-stage pipeline: (1) Type-prior classification uses an MLLM to classify the forgery type and select a corresponding category-specific prompt; (2) MLLM inference generates a detailed explanation and region description, with GroundingDINO localizing from the description and SAM2 producing the mask; (3) FFD module is selectively activated for copy-move forgeries, combining noise-based, block-based, and keypoint-based methods to create hint images. The approach requires no training, using GPT-5 or Gemini 2.5 Pro for inference on seven benchmark datasets including CASIA1+, Columbia, IMD2020, Coverage, NIST16, FaceApp, and OpenForensics.

## Key Results
- Achieves average AUC of 78.3-80.9 across multiple datasets
- Outperforms both trained and other training-free IFDL methods
- Shows significant improvement in localization accuracy with FFD module for copy-move forgeries
- Provides more comprehensive textual explanations compared to existing methods
- Demonstrates strong generalization capability across six tampering types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Type-prior-driven classification improves forgery localization by reducing reasoning ambiguity for the MLLM.
- **Mechanism:** The pipeline first queries the MLLM to classify tampering type, then uses a category-specific prompt containing relevant forensic artifact descriptions. This conditions the MLLM to focus on discriminative cues specific to each forgery type.
- **Core assumption:** MLLMs possess latent knowledge of forgery characteristics but apply them ineffectively with generic prompts.
- **Evidence:** Abstract states the type-prior-driven strategy "effectively unleashes the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** FFD module compensates for MLLM weakness in detecting copy-move forgeries.
- **Mechanism:** FFD uses traditional algorithms (keypoint or block matching) to detect duplicated regions, creating a hint image for the MLLM when copy-move is predicted.
- **Core assumption:** MLLMs struggle with subtle duplications but improve with explicit visual cues.
- **Evidence:** Table 7 shows significant performance increase on copy-move datasets when FFD is included.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Decoupling description from segmentation yields more precise localization.
- **Mechanism:** MLLM generates a concise region description, which is passed to GroundingDINO for bounding boxes, then to SAM2 for pixel-level masks.
- **Core assumption:** MLLMs are better at describing regions than outputting precise coordinates.
- **Evidence:** Qualitative results in Figure 4 show masks aligning closely with ground truth.

## Foundational Learning

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Essential for understanding how the pipeline decomposes IFDL into sequential steps (classify → select prompt → reason → describe → segment). *Quick check:* What are the key steps in Foresee's reasoning chain and how does each build upon the previous?
- **Training-Free vs. Fine-Tuned Methods:** Critical for evaluating the paper's central claim about generalization vs. task-specific accuracy. *Quick check:* What limitations of trained IFDL methods does Foresee aim to address?
- **Grounded Segmentation:** Necessary to understand how text prompts are converted to pixel masks using GroundingDINO and SAM2. *Quick check:* What is the input to GroundingDINO and what does it output? How does SAM2 use this output?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input image and classification prompt → Type-prior classification (MLLM) → Prompt selection → Conditional FFD module → MLLM inference (explanation + description) → Grounded segmentation (GroundingDINO + SAM2) → Output mask and explanation
- **Critical path:** MLLM inference drives the entire process; its classification determines prompt selection and its description determines final localization
- **Design tradeoffs:** Generalization vs. specificity, complexity vs. robustness, dependency on MLLM capability
- **Failure signatures:** Misclassification leading to incorrect prompt selection, hallucinated descriptions causing incorrect localization, copy-move blindness without FFD
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Reproduce type-prior ablation comparing generic vs. type-specific prompts, 2) Test FFD module impact on copy-move datasets, 3) Compare MLLM backbones (GPT-5 vs. Qwen-VL vs. Claude) to understand capability requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but raises several implicit ones regarding robustness to misclassification errors, performance with open-source MLLMs, and potential generalization of FFD to other forgery types.

## Limitations
- Dependence on proprietary MLLMs with undisclosed prompt formulations
- Modest performance gains on deepfake and AIGC manipulation types compared to traditional editing
- FFD module only benefits copy-move forgeries, not other types
- Limited analysis of failure modes and misclassification impact

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** General pipeline architecture and modular design are clearly described and logically sound
- **Medium Confidence:** Ablation studies demonstrating FFD's benefit and type-prior strategy's improvement are convincing
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about generalization across all manipulation types may be overstated given modest gains on deepfake/AIGC datasets

## Next Checks
1. **Type-Prior Ablation Validation:** Implement pipeline with and without type-specific prompts on validation subset to quantify exact contribution
2. **FFD Module Fusion Verification:** Experiment with different hint image fusion strategies to determine optimal integration for copy-move detection
3. **Open-Source MLLM Comparison:** Replace GPT-5/Gemini with open alternatives (Qwen2-VL, LLaVA) to assess performance degradation and identify minimum viable MLLM capability requirements
