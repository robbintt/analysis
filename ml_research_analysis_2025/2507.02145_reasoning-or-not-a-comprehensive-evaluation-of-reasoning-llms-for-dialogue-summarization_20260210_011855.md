# Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.02145
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02145
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Primary result**: Reasoning LLMs consistently underperform non-reasoning LLMs in dialogue summarization tasks

## Executive Summary
This study presents the first systematic comparison of reasoning and non-reasoning large language models for dialogue summarization across three paradigms: generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented summarization. The evaluation spans multiple datasets, languages, and domains, using both automatic metrics and LLM-based judges. Contrary to expectations, reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ-32B) consistently underperform their non-reasoning counterparts (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen2.5-32B) in summary quality. They produce longer, less concise summaries with higher novelty but lower coverage and factual consistency. Detailed analysis of reasoning traces reveals limited depth and integration, with excessive paraphrasing and redundancy. LLM-based evaluation aligns with automatic metrics, confirming that explicit reasoning does not improve dialogue summarization. These findings highlight the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for real-world dialogue summarization.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates reasoning LLMs (OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ-32B) and non-reasoning LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen2.5-32B) across multiple dialogue summarization datasets including AMI, SAMSum, QMSum, CrossSum, Arcee-Hare, and MMDialog. Three summarization paradigms are tested: generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented. Both automatic metrics and LLM-based judges are used for evaluation. The analysis includes examination of reasoning traces to understand why reasoning models underperform, measuring factors like depth, redundancy, and integration of reasoning steps into final summaries.

## Key Results
- Reasoning LLMs consistently produce longer, less concise summaries with higher novelty but lower coverage and factual consistency
- OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and QwQ-32B underperform non-reasoning models (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen2.5-32B) across all tested datasets and summarization paradigms
- Analysis of reasoning traces reveals limited depth and integration, with excessive paraphrasing and redundancy that doesn't translate into better summary quality
- LLM-based evaluation aligns with automatic metrics, confirming that explicit reasoning does not improve dialogue summarization performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **Dialogue summarization paradigms**: Understanding generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented summarization approaches is essential for evaluating model performance across different use cases and requirements
- **Reasoning trace analysis**: Examining the intermediate reasoning steps helps identify where explicit reasoning fails to translate into better output quality
- **Automatic evaluation metrics**: Familiarity with coverage, novelty, and factual consistency metrics is crucial for objective assessment of summarization quality
- **LLM-based judging**: Understanding how large language models can serve as evaluators for summarization tasks, including potential biases and limitations
- **Cross-dataset generalization**: Evaluating models across multiple datasets tests robustness and identifies whether findings are domain-specific or generalizable
- **Chain-of-thought prompting**: The use of explicit reasoning chains in prompting affects how models process and generate summaries

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Dataset -> Preprocessing -> Model Input (with/without reasoning prompt) -> Generation -> Evaluation (automatic metrics + LLM judge) -> Analysis

**Critical path**: Data preprocessing and prompt engineering are critical as they directly influence how models handle reasoning versus direct generation approaches

**Design tradeoffs**: Explicit reasoning vs. direct generation represents a fundamental tradeoff between computational efficiency and potential for improved reasoning quality

**Failure signatures**: Excessive verbosity, lower factual consistency, and weak correlation between reasoning trace quality and summary quality indicate where reasoning approaches break down

**3 first experiments**:
1. Compare model outputs on a single dataset using both reasoning and non-reasoning prompts
2. Analyze reasoning traces for depth and redundancy patterns
3. Validate automatic metric results with human evaluation on sample summaries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Why is there a weak correlation between the intrinsic quality of reasoning traces and the final quality of generated summaries?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 5.3 states that contrary to the hypothesis, analysis revealed "predominantly weak and statistically insignificant correlations" between reasoning process scores and summarization effectiveness, indicating a disconnect.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper evaluates the correlation but does not identify the specific failure modes in the reasoning-to-generation pipeline that cause high-quality reasoning steps to fail to translate into high-quality summaries.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A mechanistic study analyzing intermediate hidden states or attention patterns to see where the information flow from the reasoning trace breaks down during summary decoding.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can reasoning LLMs be optimized to balance abstraction and faithfulness without succumbing to verbosity and factual inconsistency?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 6 concludes that future work must develop "more nuanced modeling and evaluation strategies that effectively balance stepwise reasoning, abstraction, and faithfulness."
- **Why unresolved**: Current reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1) consistently exhibited verbosity and lower factual consistency compared to non-reasoning models across all datasets.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: The development of a fine-tuning protocol or constraint mechanism that reduces the "novelty" (abstraction) scores of reasoning models while maintaining or improving "coverage" and factual consistency metrics.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Does the "depth" of reasoning traces directly contribute to redundancy and hallucination in dialogue summarization tasks?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] Section 5.4 notes that reasoning processes often lack depth but contain "excessive paraphrasing and redundancy," while Section 5.3 shows low scores in "Depth" correlate weakly with output quality.
- **Why unresolved**: It is unclear if the observed lack of depth is a failure of the model to reason abstractly or a protective mechanism against the hallucinations often seen in open-ended generation.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An intervention study forcing higher "Depth" scores in reasoning traces (via prompting or sampling) to observe if summary quality degrades due to increased hallucination or improves due to better synthesis.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on existing benchmark datasets which may not fully represent real-world dialogue complexity and diversity
- Comparison focuses on a limited set of reasoning and non-reasoning models, potentially missing other model variations
- LLM-based judges introduce potential evaluator bias that wasn't fully explored across different judge models or prompting strategies
- Analysis of reasoning traces represents a snapshot rather than comprehensive reasoning pattern analysis

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The comparative performance results between reasoning and non-reasoning models across multiple metrics and datasets
- **Medium confidence**: The conclusions about reasoning traces and their impact on summary quality, as these depend on interpretation of internal model behavior
- **Medium confidence**: The generalizability of findings to other domains and languages beyond those tested

## Next Checks
1. Test the same model comparison on additional dialogue datasets with varying complexity, domain specificity, and conversational structures to verify generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies using the same model with and without chain-of-thought prompting to isolate the effect of explicit reasoning
3. Evaluate summaries using human judges alongside LLM-based judges to validate the consistency and reliability of automated evaluation metrics
