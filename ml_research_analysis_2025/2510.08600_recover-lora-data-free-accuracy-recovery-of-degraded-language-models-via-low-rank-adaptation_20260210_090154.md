## Executive Summary
Recover-LoRA addresses the problem of recovering model accuracy after functional degradation due to improper weight serialization or similar corruption. The authors propose a lightweight, data-agnostic approach that uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters that align the degraded model with its full-precision reference. Experiments on four small language models show Recover-LoRA recovers accuracy by 5-17% across seven datasets. The method is parameter- and data-efficient compared to baselines, requiring only 90k-120k synthetic samples and updating only LoRA adapter parameters.

## Method Summary
Recover-LoRA trains low-rank adapters (LoRA) on a functionally degraded student model by minimizing KL divergence between its logits and those of a full-precision teacher model. The method uses synthetic data generated via hybrid sampling from a tokenizer-matched model. LoRA adapters are attached to selective layers (typically K/V projections or attention/MLP layers) of the frozen degraded model. Training optimizes only the adapter parameters using KL divergence loss against the teacher's logits. The approach requires 90k-120k synthetic samples generated with greedy-first-token sampling strategy.

## Key Results
- Recovers 5-17% accuracy on degraded SLMs (Gemma2 2B, Llama3.2 1B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen 1.5B, AMD-OLMo-SFT 1B)
- Outperforms LLM QAT* (which worsens accuracy) on three out of four models
- Matches or exceeds dataset-specific LoRA finetuning in most cases
- Data-efficient, requiring only synthetic data (no original training data needed)
- Parameter-efficient, updating only LoRA adapter parameters rather than full model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Logit distillation from a full-precision teacher can restore accuracy to a weight-corrupted student model without access to original training data. The degraded model ($M_S$) is treated as a student, and the original, full-precision model ($M_T$) serves as the teacher. The training process minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output logit distributions on synthetic inputs. This alignment forces the degraded model's output behavior to match the original, effectively learning a corrective mapping that compensates for weight corruption.

### Mechanism 2
Selectively training low-rank adapters (LoRA) is a more robust recovery strategy than full-model fine-tuning when data is synthetic. Instead of updating all potentially corrupted weights, LoRA injects trainable low-rank matrices ($A, B$) into specific layers. These adapters learn an additive offset ($\Delta W$) to the frozen, corrupted weights ($W_S$). Constraining updates to a low-rank subspace reduces the model's capacity to overfit to the synthetic data, a risk observed when performing full parameter updates.

### Mechanism 3
Synthetic data generated via hybrid sampling from a tokenizer-matched model provides a sufficient training signal for recovery. Training data is generated using a "hybrid sampling" strategy: the first few tokens are generated greedily (for stability) and the rest stochastically (for diversity). This creates a synthetic dataset ($D_{syn}$) that mimics the input distribution the model would see in deployment, allowing the logit distillation process to occur without requiring scarce, labeled task data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation (Logit-based)**
  - Why needed here: This is the core loss function. Understanding how KL divergence forces a student model to match a teacher's soft probability distribution (not just hard labels) is fundamental to grasping how the recovery works.
  - Quick check question: Why is KL divergence preferred over Mean Squared Error for comparing logit distributions?

- **Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) / LoRA**
  - Why needed here: The method relies on LoRA's specific architecture (freezing base weights, training low-rank matrices). Understanding the rank ($r$) parameter and how it limits the complexity of possible updates is critical for diagnosing recovery failure.
  - Quick check question: In the equation $Y = W_{frozen}x + \alpha \cdot B A x$, which matrix elements are updated during backpropagation?

- **Concept: Model Serialization and Weight Perturbation**
  - Why needed here: This defines the problem class. One must understand how saving/loading operations (e.g., `save_pretrained()`) can introduce silent numerical errors that degrade performance without causing runtime crashes.
  - Quick check question: How does a "functional degradation" (performance drop) differ from a "structural failure" (loading error)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Inputs (degraded model $M_S$, clean teacher $M_T$, synthetic data $D_{syn}$) -> Process (generate synthetic data via hybrid sampling, initialize LoRA adapters on selective layers, train via KL distillation) -> Outputs (recovered model with functional correction via LoRA)

- **Critical path:**
  1. **Tokenizer Verification:** Confirm the degraded model and the data generation model share the exact same tokenizer.
  2. **Adapter Placement Search:** Run ablation studies to find the optimal layers for adapter placement.
  3. **Synthetic Data Generation:** Produce 90k-120k samples using hybrid sampling (greedy start, stochastic continuation).
  4. **Training:** Optimize adapters using KL divergence loss.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Placement vs. Efficiency:** Placing adapters on all Attention and MLP layers covers more potential degradation but increases trainable parameters. K/V-only placement is more efficient but may miss corruption in other layers.
  - **Data Source:** Using synthetic data avoids the need for labeled datasets (data-free) but may yield lower recovery than supervised fine-tuning for some architectures.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Negative AR%:** Indicates the recovery process worsened accuracy, likely due to overfitting (if using full-model QAT) or poor hyperparameters.
  - **Stagnant Loss:** Suggests the synthetic data is out-of-distribution or the adapter rank is too low to capture the necessary correction.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Degradation Measurement:** Introduce controlled perturbation to a model's weights and measure the accuracy drop across standard benchmarks.
  2. **Layer Ablation Study:** Train separate Recover-LoRA instances with adapters on (a) K/V projections only and (b) all attention + MLP layers to identify the most effective placement.
  3. **Data Scaling Analysis:** Train with increasing amounts of synthetic data (e.g., 30k, 60k, 90k samples) to find the minimum data required for positive accuracy recovery.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on the specific nature of degradation, with focus on weight corruption from improper serialization
- Mixed performance against SFT LoRA, with Gemma2 2B showing poorer recovery (4.1% AR% vs. 17.1% for SFT LoRA)
- Synthetic data generation may introduce distribution shift that limits recovery potential compared to real task data
- Scalability to larger models and multimodal architectures remains unexplored

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core claim that LoRA-based logit distillation can recover accuracy in functionally degraded models
- **Medium Confidence:** The superiority of Recover-LoRA over LLM-QAT* and its competitive performance against SFT LoRA
- **Low Confidence:** The general applicability to arbitrary degradation types beyond weight serialization errors

## Next Checks
1. **Degradation Type Sensitivity Test:** Systematically vary the perturbation type (e.g., random noise, structured corruption, activation clipping) and magnitude to determine the limits of Recover-LoRA's effectiveness across different failure modes.
2. **Larger Model Scaling Study:** Evaluate Recover-LoRA on medium-sized models (7B-13B parameters) to assess whether the observed recovery patterns hold as model scale increases.
3. **Cross-Architecture Teacher-Student Evaluation:** Test scenarios where the teacher and student have different architectures (e.g., decoder-only vs. decoder-encoder) to determine whether the shared vocabulary requirement is absolute.
