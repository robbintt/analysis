# NeuBM: Mitigating Model Bias in Graph Neural Networks through Neutral Input Calibration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.15180
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15180
- Authors: Jiawei Gu; Ziyue Qiao; Xiao Luo
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Up to 26.9% improvement in F1-score for minority classes in graph neural networks

## Executive Summary
NeuBM addresses class imbalance in graph neural networks through a novel neutral graph-based calibration method. The approach constructs a balanced reference graph representing average graph characteristics and uses it to recalibrate model predictions by subtracting neutral logits from original logits. Extensive experiments across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate NeuBM's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in minority class performance while maintaining strong overall performance. The method shows robust scalability, requires minimal computational overhead, and generalizes well across different GNN architectures including GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, and Graph Transformers.

## Method Summary
NeuBM introduces a neutral graph-based calibration framework that constructs a balanced reference graph representing average graph characteristics. The method first builds this neutral graph by sampling and aggregating features from minority and majority classes to create a balanced representation. During inference, NeuBM recalibrates model predictions by subtracting neutral logits (computed from the reference graph) from original logits, effectively removing bias introduced by class imbalance. The approach is model-agnostic and can be integrated with various GNN architectures without requiring architectural modifications or additional training.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 26.9% improvement in F1-score for minority classes across benchmark datasets
- Consistently outperformed existing methods in scenarios with severe class imbalance and limited labeled data
- Demonstrated robust performance across multiple GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformers)
- Showed minimal computational overhead while maintaining scalability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NeuBM works by explicitly modeling and removing bias through neutral graph calibration. The method constructs a reference graph that represents the average characteristics of the dataset, independent of class distribution. By computing neutral logits from this balanced reference and subtracting them from original predictions, NeuBM effectively neutralizes the bias that arises from imbalanced training data. This calibration step operates post-hoc, meaning it doesn't require retraining and can be applied to any pre-trained GNN model. The approach leverages the graph structure itself to identify and correct systematic biases that traditional reweighting or resampling methods might miss.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input Graph -> Neutral Graph Construction -> Pre-trained GNN -> Logit Subtraction -> Calibrated Predictions

**Critical Path**
1. Graph feature extraction and sampling
2. Neutral graph construction
3. Pre-trained GNN inference
4. Logit recalibration through subtraction

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Model-agnostic approach vs. potential architecture-specific optimizations
- Post-hoc calibration vs. training-time bias mitigation
- Computational overhead of neutral graph construction vs. performance gains

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance when graph structure is highly heterogeneous
- Calibration artifacts when neutral graph poorly represents data distribution
- Over-correction leading to degraded majority class performance

**First Experiments**
1. Ablation study removing neutral graph construction to measure its individual contribution
2. Performance comparison across varying levels of class imbalance
3. Scalability test on incrementally larger graph datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper acknowledges several open questions regarding the generalizability of NeuBM across diverse real-world graph datasets beyond the eight benchmark datasets tested. Key uncertainties include how well the method scales to extremely large graphs or graphs with highly heterogeneous structures, potential computational bottlenecks when dealing with massive graph datasets, and the method's robustness to noise in graph features.

## Limitations

- Uncertain generalizability to extremely large graphs or highly heterogeneous graph structures
- Potential computational bottlenecks with massive graph datasets
- Limited analysis of robustness to noise in graph features
- Performance dependence on quality of neutral graph construction

## Confidence

High confidence in core claims regarding minority class performance improvement and overall effectiveness across GNN architectures. Medium confidence in scalability and computational efficiency claims due to implementation-dependent factors. Medium confidence in generalization across architectures as performance may vary with specific architectural characteristics.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive testing on large-scale, real-world graph datasets (social networks, biological networks) to validate scalability claims and assess performance in diverse scenarios beyond benchmark datasets.

2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component of NeuBM (neutral graph construction, logit recalibration) and identify potential areas for optimization or improvement.

3. Implement NeuBM on edge devices or in distributed computing environments to rigorously evaluate computational overhead and memory requirements in practical deployment scenarios.
