# Statistical Taylor Expansion: A New and Path-Independent Method for Uncertainty Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2410.01223
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01223
- **Authors:** Chengpu Wang
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** Statistical Taylor expansion achieves ideal coverage for mathematical applications when input uncertainties are properly characterized

## Executive Summary
Statistical Taylor expansion introduces a novel approach to uncertainty analysis by replacing precise numerical inputs with random variables and propagating their uncertainties through mathematical operations. The method distinguishes itself by explicitly tracing dependencies through intermediate variables, making results path-independent and eliminating traditional dependency problems. By incorporating statistical distributions and sample counts, it extends conventional Taylor expansion to handle real-world uncertainty scenarios while providing rigorous validation through coverage testing.

## Method Summary
Variance arithmetic implements statistical Taylor expansion by representing values as pairs (x, δx) with sample count N and distribution type. The method computes means using Formula (2.5)/(2.8) and variances using Formula (2.6)/(2.9), enforcing convergence rules including monotonicity, stability, and positivity. Dependency tracing ensures intermediate variables maintain their functional relationships rather than being treated as independent. The approach validates uncertainty propagation through coverage testing, where normalized errors should have standard deviation ≈1 for ideal coverage. The implementation handles basic operations, transcendental functions, and matrix operations while providing source tracing to identify primary uncertainty contributors.

## Key Results
- Statistical Taylor expansion achieves ideal coverage (error deviation = 1) for polynomials and matrix operations when input uncertainties are properly characterized
- Library function errors can cause significant resonance effects requiring input noise of 10^-14 magnitude to suppress
- Variance arithmetic provides proper coverage (error deviation ∈ [0.1, 10]) for floating-point rounding errors and identifies optimal applicable ranges for algorithms
- The method enables source tracing to identify primary contributors to result uncertainty, with intermediate variable contributions being non-additive

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dependency Tracing Through Intermediate Variables
Statistical Taylor expansion produces path-independent results by explicitly tracking how input uncertainties propagate through each intermediate step, avoiding incorrect independence assumptions. When computing f(g(x)), the method maintains the functional relationship between g(x) and x in the variance calculation. For example, δ²(f·f) = δ²f² rather than treating the two f's as independent. This requires the uncorrelated uncertainty condition where all input uncertainties are uncorrelated with each other, even if input values correlate.

### Mechanism 2: Bound Moments Replace Distribution Moments
Finite sample counts N and bounded distributions require modified moments ζ(n,κ) rather than standard distribution moments. Define ζ(n) = ∫˜zⁿρ(˜z)d˜z over bounded range [ϱ,κ]. For Gaussian with κ=5, ζ(0)→1 and ζ(2)→1 as N→∞. The mean-reverting condition ζ(1)=0 determines κ from ϱ. Bounding leakage ϵ(κ)=1−ζ(0,κ) quantifies probability mass outside bounds. Convergence fails when P(x) ≥ 1/κ for log(x±δx) or (x±δx)ᶜ, causing variance to diverge.

### Mechanism 3: Coverage Testing via Normalized Error Statistics
Correct uncertainty propagation is validated when normalized errors (value error / calculated deviation) have standard deviation ≈1 and approximately Normal distribution. Compute normalized errors z = (numerical_result − known_analytic_result) / δf. If error deviation ≈ 1, the calculated uncertainty δf properly "covers" actual errors. Error deviation >>1 indicates unspecified input errors (e.g., library function errors); <<1 indicates overestimated uncertainty. Validation requires either a known precise analytic result or a value-matching condition.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Taylor Series Expansion and Higher-Order Derivatives**
  - **Why needed here:** Statistical Taylor expansion extends standard Taylor series by replacing precise x with random variable x+˜x, requiring understanding of f⁽ⁿ⁾ terms and their convergence.
  - **Quick check question:** Given f(x)=eˣ expanded around x=0, what are the first three terms and when does the series converge?

- **Concept: Probability Density Transformation Under Variable Change**
  - **Why needed here:** Distributional poles/zeros occur when derivatives f'ₓ=0 or ∞, transforming PDFs via ρ(˜y) = ρ(˜x)|dx/dy|. Critical for understanding when variance diverges.
  - **Quick check question:** If X~N(μ,σ) and Y=X², at what value of X does Y have a distributional pole, and why?

- **Concept: Floating-Point Rounding Error Distribution**
  - **Why needed here:** Variance arithmetic treats rounding errors as uniformly distributed within one ULP with δx = ULP/√3. Understanding this enables proper coverage of machine precision limits.
  - **Quick check question:** In IEEE 754 double precision, approximately how many significant bits exist, and what is the approximate machine epsilon?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** (x, δx) pairs → Bound moment calculator → Statistical Taylor engine → Numerical rules checker → Coverage validator

- **Critical path:**
  1. Characterize input uncertainty (distribution type, deviation δx, sample count N)
  2. Determine if P(x) < 1/κ for convergence-critical functions (log, power with non-integer exponents)
  3. Apply statistical Taylor formulas with dependency tracing (no intermediate variable independence assumptions)
  4. Verify coverage; if error deviation >1, add input noise incrementally until coverage achieved

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Larger κ → smaller bounding leakage but narrower convergence range for inputs
  - Higher expansion order → better accuracy but more computation and potential floating-point accumulation
  - Direct formulas vs. progressive algorithms: Progressive (e.g., moving-window regression) accumulates variance incorrectly; must use direct formulas for uncertainty even if progressive for values

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Negative variance at some expansion order: Input uncertainty exceeds upper bound (see Figures 8-11 for sin, power functions)
  - Error deviation >> 1: Unspecified input errors (library functions, modeling errors); add noise to diagnose magnitude
  - Exponentially growing uncertainties: Reused inputs without variance adjustment (Figure 20 "Unadjusted" case)
  - Structured/non-Normal error distributions: Systematic errors (Figure 27 resonance pattern from Library sine)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Polynomial residual test:** Compute Σⱼxʲ − 1/(1-x) for x∈[−1,1]. Verify error deviation ≈2.6 (Figure 12) demonstrating rounding error coverage.
  2. **Round-trip FFT with Quart vs Library sine:** For signal length 2¹⁸, compare error deviations. Quart should achieve ~1; Library requires δx≥10⁻¹⁴ noise to suppress resonance (Table 2).
  3. **2×2 matrix inversion:** Apply Formula (6.4) directly (not Gaussian elimination). Verify determinant precision correlates with condition number (Figure 16) and round-trip M×M⁻¹=I achieves error deviation <<1 (value test, Figure 15).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can statistical Taylor expansion be theoretically established for problems lacking closed-form analytic solutions, such as differential equations where only low-order numerical derivatives are available?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 11.2 states that establishing this foundation "remains an important direction for future research."
- **Why unresolved:** The method relies on dependency tracing through complete analytic expressions, which is not possible when only numerical approximations of derivatives exist.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A modified theoretical framework that defines variance propagation rules for numerical integration schemes without analytic forms.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the ideal ratio $\alpha$ represent the statistical probability that the result is bound by the ideal bounding range $\hat{\kappa}$?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 11.2 explicitly asks, "Is $\alpha$ the possibility for the result to be bound by $\hat{\kappa}$?" and calls for investigation.
- **Why unresolved:** While $\alpha$ is defined as the ratio of calculated variance to ideal variance, its precise statistical meaning as a coverage probability is hypothesized but not confirmed.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A mathematical proof or empirical study demonstrating a consistent probabilistic relationship between specific $\alpha$ values and bounding intervals.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can variance arithmetic be adapted to achieve ideal coverage for floating-point rounding errors in theoretical calculations that lack explicit input uncertainties?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 11.2 identifies this as a "key open question" because current implementations do not adjust variance for rounding errors.
- **Why unresolved:** The current method assumes explicit input uncertainties and lacks a mechanism to dynamically detect and incorporate rounding errors during execution efficiently.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A hardware or software implementation that detects rounding errors and adjusts variance in real-time to yield an error deviation of 1.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How can the definitions of bounding range $\kappa$ and bound moment $\zeta(2n)$ be extended to discrete probability distributions?
- **Basis in paper:** Section 11.2 lists the extension of statistical bounding and bound moments to discrete distributions as a needed improvement.
- **Why unresolved:** The current derivation relies on continuous integral definitions (Formula 2.2) and mean-reverting conditions specific to continuous probability density functions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A generalized formulation of bound moments valid for discrete inputs that passes distribution tests.

## Limitations

- Dependency tracing implementation for complex computational graphs lacks a general algorithm, creating a gap between theory and practice
- Convergence behavior under different distribution types remains incompletely characterized beyond Gaussian and Uniform distributions
- Performance on real-world scientific computing problems with correlated uncertainties is not demonstrated, as the uncorrelated uncertainty condition may not hold

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core mechanism of variance arithmetic for basic operations and the concept of bound moments for finite sample distributions are well-established mathematically. The statistical framework for coverage testing is clearly articulated and theoretically sound.

**Medium Confidence:** The extension from basic operations to transcendental functions through statistical Taylor expansion is mathematically valid but the practical implementation details (expansion order selection, convergence criteria) require careful calibration. The dependency tracing mechanism, while conceptually clear, lacks a general implementation algorithm.

**Low Confidence:** Claims about eliminating path dependence in all computational scenarios are not fully substantiated. The failure modes described (negative variance, resonance effects) indicate significant practical limitations requiring domain-specific workarounds.

## Next Checks

1. **General Dependency Tracing Algorithm:** Develop and validate a general algorithm for maintaining dependency relationships through arbitrary computational graphs. Test on a benchmark suite of mathematical expressions with known analytic derivatives to verify path independence.

2. **Convergence Behavior Across Distributions:** Characterize the convergence properties and appropriate κ selection for distributions beyond Gaussian and Uniform. Create a practical guide for mixed-distribution uncertainty propagation and validate with Monte Carlo simulations.

3. **Real-World Application Case Study:** Apply the method to a realistic scientific computing problem (e.g., finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics) with correlated input uncertainties. Compare results against established uncertainty quantification methods and document any practical limitations encountered.
