# Resource-Efficient and Robust Inference of Deep and Bayesian Neural Networks on Embedded and Analog Computing Platforms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24951
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24951
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both deterministic and Bayesian neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on embedded and analog hardware platforms.

## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses the challenges of deploying deep and Bayesian neural networks on resource-constrained and analog hardware. For deterministic networks, the Galen framework automates hardware-aware compression, jointly optimizing pruning and quantization. For analog accelerators, Variance-Aware Noisy Training (VANT) improves robustness under device-specific noise and nonstationary conditions. For Bayesian networks, the Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) delivers up to 4,200× speedups on embedded ARM processors, and ensemble methods like Repulsive Last-Layer Ensembles offer efficient uncertainty estimation. Photonic hardware is also explored as a platform for probabilistic inference. Together, these contributions demonstrate that algorithm-hardware co-design enables both efficiency and reliability in machine learning systems.

## Method Summary
The thesis develops algorithm-hardware co-design strategies for efficient and robust inference. Galen automates compression using sensitivity analysis and latency measurement. VANT introduces noise-aware training for analog hardware, accounting for nonstationary conditions. PFP integrates a closed-form variational inference approximation into the TVM compiler stack for embedded inference. Ensemble methods, including Repulsive Last-Layer Ensembles, are investigated for uncertainty estimation. Photonic hardware is explored for probabilistic inference, leveraging chaotic light as an entropy source.

## Key Results
- Galen enables automatic, hardware-aware compression of deterministic networks via sensitivity analysis and latency measurements.
- VANT improves robustness of analog neural network accelerators under nonstationary noise and device imperfections.
- PFP achieves up to 4,200× speedups for Bayesian inference on embedded ARM processors compared to sampling-based baselines.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Algorithm-hardware co-design enables efficiency and reliability by jointly optimizing model parameters and deployment constraints. Sensitivity analysis and latency measurements guide compression for deterministic networks, while noise-aware training addresses analog hardware imperfections. Closed-form variational approximations accelerate Bayesian inference, and ensemble diversity improves uncertainty estimation. Photonic hardware offers a novel platform for probabilistic inference by exploiting physical entropy sources.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Identifies critical network components for compression; needed to minimize accuracy loss while maximizing resource savings. Quick check: Evaluate sensitivity metric correlation with actual performance drop.
- **Noisy Training**: Trains models to be robust to hardware imperfections; needed for reliable inference on analog accelerators. Quick check: Compare robustness under device noise before/after training.
- **Variational Inference**: Approximates posterior distributions in Bayesian networks; needed for tractable uncertainty estimation. Quick check: Assess quality of uncertainty estimates via calibration metrics.
- **Ensemble Diversity**: Improves uncertainty estimation by encouraging disagreement; needed for better OOD detection. Quick check: Measure ensemble diversity and OOD detection accuracy.
- **Physical Entropy Sources**: Enable hardware-based randomness; needed for efficient probabilistic inference in photonic systems. Quick check: Characterize entropy quality and stability.
- **Compiler Integration**: Bridges algorithmic advances with embedded deployment; needed for practical, high-performance inference. Quick check: Benchmark end-to-end latency and memory usage.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Galen -> Sensitivity Analysis -> Pruning/Quantization -> Embedded Target  
VANT -> Noise Modeling -> Training -> Analog Accelerator  
PFP -> Variational Inference -> TVM Integration -> ARM Processor  
Photonic Hardware -> Chaotic Light -> Probabilistic Inference -> Optical System

**Critical Path**
For embedded Bayesian inference: Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) integrated into TVM compiler stack for efficient deployment on ARM processors.

**Design Tradeoffs**
Balancing model size and accuracy (Galen), robustness and hardware constraints (VANT), inference speed and uncertainty quality (PFP), and diversity vs. computational cost (ensembles).

**Failure Signatures**
Over-aggressive compression causing accuracy loss (Galen), training collapse under excessive noise (VANT), poor uncertainty calibration (PFP), and insufficient ensemble diversity.

**First Experiments**
1. Benchmark Galen compression on a target embedded accelerator (e.g., FPGA) with ablation studies on sensitivity analysis accuracy.
2. Validate VANT robustness on a diverse set of analog memory devices under controlled nonstationary noise.
3. Perform full-system evaluation of PFP inference on low-power ARM cores, measuring end-to-end latency, energy, and uncertainty quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the components for partial Bayesianization be automatically identified in large-scale architectures like Transformers to balance tractability with uncertainty quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 11.3 states: "Still, fundamental questions remain: which components should be Bayesian, what fraction of parameters is sufficient, and how can such structures be identified automatically?"
- Why unresolved: Current methods often rely on manual selection or heuristics, and the complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) and transformers makes manual tuning of probabilistic layers infeasible.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of an algorithm that automatically determines the optimal subset of weights or layers to model stochastically, demonstrating comparable uncertainty quality to full BNNs at a fraction of the computational cost.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Repulsive Last-Layer Ensembles (RLLEs) be trained effectively without relying on artificial out-of-distribution (OOD) repulsion samples?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 11.3 notes: "A way to train these ensembles without artificial out-of-distribution data would be highly desirable, yet the appropriate approach remains an open question."
- Why unresolved: RLLEs currently require careful calibration using specific repulsion samples (often OOD data) to maintain diversity; this reliance introduces sensitivity to data selection and limits generalizability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A training methodology for RLLEs that achieves equivalent uncertainty calibration and OOD detection performance using only in-distribution data or theoretical diversity constraints.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is there a computationally efficient sensitivity metric that can replace Walking Noise for analyzing layer-wise robustness in large neural networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 11.3 states: "What is needed in general is a cheap but informative sensitivity metric."
- Why unresolved: The Walking Noise framework provides detailed diagnostics but is computationally expensive due to repeated evaluations, preventing its application to modern large architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: A metric (e.g., based on KL-divergence) that correlates strongly with noise tolerance but can be computed in a single forward pass, successfully scaling sensitivity analysis to large networks.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can probabilistic weight representations be established in photonic hardware given the reprogramming speed limitations of materials like GST?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 10.5 identifies that "scaling these approaches to larger networks and establishing true probabilistic weight representations remain open challenges."
- Why unresolved: Current photonic prototypes use deterministic weights because reprogramming phase-change materials (GST) is too slow for the rapid sampling required by BNNs, forcing stochasticity to be implemented only in activations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A hardware design or material allowing for rapid, dynamic modulation of weight distributions, or a hybrid algorithmic approach that compensates for slow reprogramming without losing uncertainty fidelity.

## Limitations
- Lack of quantitative results for compression ratios, accuracy retention, and latency gains for Galen framework.
- Assumptions in analog hardware noise models may not generalize across foundry processes or technology nodes.
- Unspecified comparison baselines and deployment constraints for PFP inference speedups.
- Characterization metrics missing for photonic hardware entropy sources.

## Confidence
- Galen compression claims: **Low** (quantitative results not provided)
- Analog hardware robustness (VANT): **Medium** (limited device/process generalization)
- PFP speedup claims: **Medium** (unspecified baselines and deployment constraints)
- Photonic hardware entropy source: **Low** (lack of characterization metrics)

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark Galen on multiple target accelerators (e.g., FPGA, ASIC, neuromorphic) with ablation studies on sensitivity analysis accuracy.
2. Validate VANT on a diverse set of analog memory devices (ReRAM, PCM, flash) under controlled nonstationary noise conditions.
3. Perform a full-system evaluation of PFP inference on low-power ARM cores, measuring end-to-end latency, energy, and uncertainty quality on real-world datasets.
