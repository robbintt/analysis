# From Instructions to ODRL Usage Policies: An Ontology Guided Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.03301
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03301
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Up to 91.95% accuracy in generating ODRL usage policies from natural language instructions using LLM and ontology-guided prompting

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an innovative approach for automatically generating usage policies in the W3C Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) from natural language instructions. The method leverages large language models (LLMs) enhanced with the ODRL ontology and its documentation as part of the prompt. By incorporating curated descriptions and semantic insights from the ontology, the system guides the LLM to produce more accurate and semantically consistent ODRL policies. A self-correction component further refines the generated output using predefined rules to improve quality.

The approach was evaluated on 12 use cases from the cultural domain with increasing complexity, demonstrating strong performance with up to 91.95% accuracy in the resulting knowledge graph. This work addresses the challenge of bridging the gap between human-readable instructions and machine-interpretable ODRL policies, making digital rights management more accessible and efficient.

## Method Summary
The approach uses large language models to automatically generate ODRL usage policies from natural language instructions. It incorporates the ODRL ontology and its documentation directly into the prompt to guide the LLM's output. The method is enhanced with curated descriptions and semantic insights derived from the ontology to improve the quality and consistency of the generated policies. A self-correction component applies predefined rules to refine the LLM's output, addressing potential errors or inconsistencies. The system was evaluated on 12 use cases from the cultural domain, testing increasing levels of complexity to assess performance across different policy requirements.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 91.95% accuracy in generating correct ODRL policies from natural language instructions
- Successfully handled 12 use cases from the cultural domain with increasing complexity
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of ontology-guided prompting in improving LLM-generated ODRL policies
- Showed that self-correction rules can enhance the quality of generated policies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by providing LLMs with structured ontological knowledge that guides their understanding of ODRL semantics. By including the ODRL ontology and documentation in the prompt, the system gives the LLM a semantic framework to interpret natural language instructions correctly. The curated descriptions add domain-specific context that helps the model generate more accurate policies. The self-correction mechanism acts as a safety net, catching and fixing common errors that might arise from the LLM's generation process. This combination of semantic guidance and automated refinement addresses the typical challenges of converting unstructured natural language into structured policy formats.

## Foundational Learning
- **ODRL Ontology**: The W3C standard for expressing digital rights policies in a machine-readable format. Why needed: Provides the semantic framework for representing usage policies. Quick check: Verify the ontology includes necessary policy elements for your use cases.
- **LLM Prompt Engineering**: The practice of crafting effective prompts to guide LLM behavior. Why needed: Determines how well the model understands and executes the policy generation task. Quick check: Test different prompt structures to optimize output quality.
- **Knowledge Graph Validation**: Methods for assessing the correctness of structured data outputs. Why needed: Provides objective metrics for evaluating policy generation accuracy. Quick check: Ensure validation criteria align with ODRL specification requirements.
- **Self-Correction Mechanisms**: Automated systems that refine LLM outputs using predefined rules. Why needed: Improves reliability by catching and fixing common generation errors. Quick check: Test correction rules on known error patterns to verify effectiveness.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Natural Language Instructions -> LLM with ODRL Ontology Prompt -> Self-Correction Rules -> ODRL Policy Output

Critical Path: The system processes natural language instructions through an LLM enhanced with ODRL ontology documentation, then applies self-correction rules to produce the final ODRL policy. The quality of the prompt engineering and the comprehensiveness of the self-correction rules are critical determinants of success.

Design Tradeoffs: The approach trades computational overhead (from ontology inclusion and self-correction) for improved accuracy. A larger, more detailed ontology improves guidance but may increase prompt size limits. The self-correction rules must balance between catching errors and preserving legitimate variations in policy expression.

Failure Signatures: Common failures include misinterpretation of natural language instructions, generation of syntactically invalid ODRL, missing required policy elements, or incorrect semantic relationships between policy components. The self-correction mechanism may over-correct and remove valid policy variations.

First 3 Experiments:
1. Test the base LLM performance on ODRL policy generation without ontology guidance to establish baseline accuracy.
2. Evaluate the impact of different ontology prompt structures (full vs. summarized documentation) on policy quality.
3. Measure the effectiveness of individual self-correction rules by applying them to known error patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Evaluation corpus is relatively small (12 use cases from cultural domain), limiting generalizability
- Accuracy metric based on knowledge graph validation without detailed methodology for determining correctness
- Reliance on specific LLM model performance introduces variability based on model version and settings
- Self-correction mechanism effectiveness not comprehensively validated across diverse error types

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core methodology of using ODRL ontology documentation in prompts is technically sound and aligns with established LLM prompting practices.

**Medium confidence**: The reported accuracy figures are plausible given the evaluation setup, but the limited sample size and domain specificity reduce certainty about broader applicability.

**Low confidence**: The effectiveness of the self-correction component and its robustness across diverse policy generation scenarios remains uncertain without more extensive testing.

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on a larger, more diverse set of use cases spanning multiple domains beyond cultural heritage to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the ontology documentation, curated descriptions, and self-correction components to overall performance.
3. Evaluate the approach with different LLM models and parameter settings to determine robustness and identify optimal configurations.
