# Relating Piecewise Linear Kolmogorov Arnold Networks to ReLU Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.01702
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01702
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** Establishes explicit bidirectional conversions between piecewise linear KANs and ReLU networks, showing KANs can represent more linear regions per parameter.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes an explicit theoretical bridge between Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with piecewise linear activation functions and ReLU networks. The authors provide two efficient conversion procedures: one that transforms any ReLU network into an equivalent KAN (Theorem 1), and another that converts any piecewise linear KAN into a ReLU network (Theorem 2). These conversions are parameter-efficient—the ReLU-to-KAN transformation adds only a linear term in the number of neurons, while the KAN-to-ReLU transformation requires no additional non-zero parameters. The paper also demonstrates that KANs can represent finer polyhedral decompositions than ReLU networks with the same parameter budget, showing that KANs can implement more linear regions per parameter. This work enables users to leverage ReLU network trainability while benefiting from KAN interpretability, and allows deployment of existing ReLU network analysis tools to KANs.

## Method Summary
The paper provides explicit bidirectional conversion procedures between piecewise linear KANs and ReLU networks. For ReLU-to-KAN conversion, each affine layer and ReLU activation is mapped to KAN activation functions using telescoping sums of ReLU units. For KAN-to-ReLU conversion, each piecewise linear KAN activation with k+1 segments is represented as a linear combination of k ReLU units with specific weights and biases. The layer-wise conversion produces extremely wide but sparse ReLU networks where each KAN layer becomes a block-diagonal sparse weight matrix structure. The conversions are proven to be parameter-efficient, with the KAN-to-ReLU transformation requiring no additional non-zero parameters beyond those needed to represent the piecewise linear functions.

## Key Results
- Any ReLU network can be converted to an equivalent KAN with only a linear increase in neurons (Theorem 1)
- Any piecewise linear KAN can be converted to a ReLU network without additional non-zero parameters (Theorem 2)
- KANs can represent more linear regions per parameter than equivalent ReLU networks
- The KAN-to-ReLU conversion produces very wide networks with block-diagonal sparse weight matrices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Any univariate piecewise linear function (a KAN activation) can be exactly represented as a linear combination of shifted ReLU functions.
- **Mechanism:** The construction relies on a "telescoping sum" of ReLU units. By adding terms of the form $(a_{i+1} - a_i) \cdot \text{ReLU}(x - b_i)$ for breakpoints $b_i$ and slopes $a_i$, the composite function changes slope exactly at the specified breakpoints to match the target piecewise linear shape.
- **Core assumption:** The activation functions must be piecewise linear with a finite number of segments.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: Mentions "completely explicit constructions to convert a piecewise linear KAN into a ReLU network."
  - [PAGE 3]: Lemma 1 proof details the explicit weights $W^{(1)}, W^{(2)}$ and biases to represent a function $\phi$ with $n$ segments using $n$ hidden ReLU neurons.
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence; corpus focuses on KAN applications (AF-KAN, ICKAN) rather than this specific ReLU equivalence proof.
- **Break condition:** If the activation function is non-linear in a way that cannot be approximated by finite piecewise segments (e.g., requiring smooth B-sines without the appendix's monomial extensions), this specific ReLU conversion fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A KAN layer is functionally equivalent to a specific sparse, wide feedforward ReLU layer.
- **Mechanism:** Since a KAN layer sums independent univariate functions $\sum \phi_{q,p}(x_p)$, the equivalent ReLU construction processes each input dimension independently via block-diagonal weight matrices before summing. This results in a network that is extremely wide (width scales with segments $\times$ input dim) but structurally sparse.
- **Core assumption:** The operations within a KAN layer remain separable by input dimension (standard KAN definition).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [PAGE 4]: Lemma 2 demonstrates the block-diagonal matrix structure $W^{(1)}_1 \dots W^{(1)}_{n_{in}}$ used to parallelize the univariate conversions.
  - [PAGE 5]: Theorem 3 formalizes the embedding $KAN(L, n, k) \subseteq ReLU(L+1, n^2(k+1))$.
  - [corpus]: Not explicitly covered in corpus summaries.
- **Break condition:** Efficiency gains are lost if the sparse structure is not preserved by the hardware/compiler (dense matrix multiplication overhead).

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** KANs possess a higher upper bound on the number of linear regions (polyhedral complex fineness) per parameter than equivalent ReLU networks.
- **Mechanism:** The paper derives region upper bounds based on the number of segments $k$ and layer widths. The ratio of regions to parameters is mathematically shown to favor KANs, implying they can partition input space more finely with fewer learned weights.
- **Core assumption:** The count of non-zero parameters is the primary constraint on model capacity.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [PAGE 7]: Theorem 4 establishes the region upper bound $k^{n_L + \sum n_i n_{i+1}}$.
  - [PAGE 7]: Discussion compares region-to-parameter ratios, concluding the "ratio is much bigger for KANs."
  - [corpus]: Merging KANs paper (arXiv:2512.18921) supports the general premise of parameter efficiency in KANs, though via a different mechanism (federated merging).
- **Break condition:** This is a theoretical upper bound; it does not guarantee that training dynamics will actually find solutions utilizing these maximal regions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - **Why needed here:** This theorem underpins the KAN architecture, stating that multivariate continuous functions are compositions of sums of univariate functions. Understanding this explains why KANs place learnable functions on edges rather than nodes.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the placement of activation functions in KANs differ from standard MLPs based on this theorem?

- **Concept: Polyhedral Complexes**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper analyzes expressivity by counting linear regions. A "polyhedral complex" is the partition of the input space into regions where the network acts as a linear map.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does a higher number of linear regions in a polyhedral complex imply greater model expressivity?

- **Concept: Sparse Matrix Representation**
  - **Why needed here:** The KAN-to-ReLU conversion produces "very wide networks with sparse weight matrices" (Section 4.3). Understanding sparse formats (e.g., COO, CSR) is necessary to implement these conversions without memory explosion.
  - **Quick check question:** In the KAN-to-ReLU conversion, why is the resulting weight matrix block-diagonal rather than dense?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - **KAN Layer:** A matrix of univariate functions $\Phi = \{\phi_{q,p}\}$.
  - **ReLU Equivalent Layer:** An affine transformation $W^{(1)}$ (block-diagonal) $\to$ ReLU $\to$ Affine $W^{(2)}$.
  - **Conversion Logic:** Algorithms to map parameters $\{\phi\} \to \{W, B\}$ and vice versa.

- **Critical path:**
  1.  **ReLU $\to$ KAN:** Train a standard ReLU network for speed/stability.
  2.  **Convert:** Apply Theorem 1 construction to extract KAN parameters.
  3.  **Analyze/Prune:** Use the KAN's interpretability (univariate functions) to analyze or simplify the model.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Speed vs. Interpretability:** ReLU networks are 10x faster to train (Introduction); KANs are more interpretable. The paper suggests training ReLU and converting to KAN for analysis.
  - **Width vs. Depth:** Converting KAN $\to$ ReLU significantly increases network width (Theorem 3: $n^2(k+1)$) but keeps depth similar ($L+1$).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Dimensionality Explosion:** Implementing the KAN-to-ReLU conversion using dense tensors instead of sparse ones will likely OOM (Out of Memory) due to the $n^2(k+1)$ width.
  - **Loss of Exactness:** If the original ReLU network uses activations other than ReLU (e.g., LeakyReLU, GELU) without first converting them to piecewise linear approximations, the exact equivalence breaks.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1.  **Verify Equivalence:** Implement the ReLU-to-KAN conversion (Theorem 1) on a small trained MNIST MLP and verify the forward pass outputs match exactly.
  2.  **Visualizing the Edge:** Plot the univariate activation functions $\phi$ extracted from the converted KAN to visually inspect the "features" learned on the edges.
  3.  **Sparsity Test:** Implement the KAN-to-ReLU conversion (Theorem 2) and benchmark inference speed comparing a dense implementation vs. a sparse-matrix implementation to validate the "parameter efficient" claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What is the minimal parameter count required for a KAN versus a ReLU network to represent a specific arbitrary piecewise linear function?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly ask, "suppose we have a piecewise linear function $\psi$, what is the smallest (in terms of parameter count) KAN $f$ and ReLU network $g$ that can represent this function?"
- **Why unresolved:** This paper establishes that conversions are possible and provides efficiency bounds for those specific translations, but it does not determine the theoretical lower bounds for representing functions natively in either architecture.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The derivation of theoretical lower bounds for parameter counts or an algorithmic method to find the minimal architecture for a given function in both paradigms.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can polyhedral extraction methods be developed to compute the polyhedral partition and linear coefficients directly from KAN parameters?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that "Polyhedral extraction methods... for KANs would unlock further interpretability benefits," noting that such methods would elucidate how parameters affect the linear parts of the network.
- **Why unresolved:** While the authors prove that KANs admit a polyhedral complex, they do not provide the computational tools or algorithms to extract and visualize these regions from a trained model.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A algorithm that maps the learned univariate functions and weights of a KAN to its explicit polyhedral complex $C(f) = (\Omega, (\alpha_\omega, \beta_\omega))$.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the finer polyhedral decomposition capability of KANs define a distinct, more expressive functional class than ReLU networks under identical parameter budgets?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper shows KANs have a higher upper bound on linear regions per parameter, but states "further research is needed to understand what functional class is represented" by this property.
- **Why unresolved:** A higher number of potential linear regions suggests greater expressivity, but the specific functional families or approximation benefits this offers over ReLU networks have not been characterized.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis identifying specific function classes that KANs can approximate with significantly fewer parameters than ReLU networks.

## Limitations

- The theoretical proofs rely heavily on piecewise linear assumptions that may not generalize to smooth activations commonly used in practice.
- The region counting bounds are theoretical maxima that may not reflect practical network capacity during training.
- The paper lacks empirical validation, making it unclear how these conversions perform with real-world data and training dynamics.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The exact functional equivalence proofs for piecewise linear conversions (Theorems 1 and 2) are mathematically rigorous and well-established.
- **Medium Confidence:** The parameter efficiency claims and region counting bounds are theoretically sound but unverified empirically.
- **Low Confidence:** The practical implications for training dynamics, generalization, and computational efficiency remain speculative without experimental validation.

## Next Checks

1. Implement the KAN-to-ReLU conversion on a small trained model and benchmark both memory usage and inference speed comparing dense vs. sparse implementations.
2. Train a ReLU network and its KAN-converted counterpart on a simple dataset (e.g., MNIST) to verify they achieve similar accuracy and examine training stability differences.
3. Experimentally verify the region counting claims by analyzing the linear regions in converted networks and comparing against the theoretical bounds.
