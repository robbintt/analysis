# Towards Interpretable Soft Prompts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.02144
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02144
- Reference count: 15
- The paper proposes a theoretical framework for evaluating soft prompt interpretability and demonstrates that optimizing for interpretability proxies can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the interpretability of soft prompts in large language models, proposing two key desiderata: faithfulness (the unembedded prompt accurately reflects the embedded one) and scrutability (the unembedded prompt is human-interpretable). The authors evaluate existing soft prompt methods and find they fail to satisfy these criteria. They introduce new interpretability-oriented objective functions for PEZ and RLPrompt, demonstrating a fundamental trade-off between interpretability and task performance through experiments with GPT-2. The work reveals that perplexity-based metrics may be flawed proxies for human interpretability.

## Method Summary
The authors establish a theoretical framework defining interpretability through faithfulness and scrutability desiderata. They implement this framework by modifying the objective functions of two state-of-the-art prompt tuners: PEZ and RLPrompt. For PEZ, they add a perplexity-based regularization term to encourage interpretable prompts. For RLPrompt, they incorporate interpretability rewards alongside task performance rewards. The evaluation uses GPT-2 on zero-shot classification tasks, comparing the original methods with their interpretability-enhanced variants across both performance metrics and interpretability scores.

## Key Results
- Existing soft prompt methods fail to satisfy either faithfulness or scrutability desiderata
- New interpretability-oriented objectives create a trade-off between interpretability and task performance
- Perplexity-based scoring may be an unreliable proxy for human interpretability of soft prompts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works by explicitly optimizing for interpretability through modified objective functions that incorporate perplexity-based regularization. By adding interpretability constraints to the optimization process, the model learns prompt embeddings that score better on human-interpretable metrics while maintaining task performance. The theoretical framework provides clear criteria for what constitutes interpretable behavior, allowing systematic evaluation of whether optimization efforts actually improve interpretability.

## Foundational Learning

**Soft prompts** - Continuous vector representations that replace discrete text tokens as inputs to language model attention mechanisms. Needed to understand the core technique being analyzed. Quick check: Can explain how soft prompts differ from traditional discrete token prompts.

**Faithfulness** - The property that unembedded (decoded) prompts accurately reflect the meaning of embedded prompts. Critical for ensuring interpretability doesn't compromise the underlying prompt function. Quick check: Can articulate why faithfulness is necessary for reliable soft prompt interpretation.

**Scrutability** - The property that unembedded prompts are human-interpretable and meaningful. Fundamental to the goal of making soft prompts transparent to human users. Quick check: Can distinguish between mathematically interpretable and actually human-interpretable prompts.

**Perplexity as proxy** - Using language model perplexity scores to measure prompt interpretability. Needed to understand the evaluation methodology and its limitations. Quick check: Can explain why perplexity might not correlate with human interpretability judgments.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Soft prompts -> Embedding layer -> Language model attention -> Output generation

Critical path: The optimization process flows from prompt initialization through embedding, attention computation, and output generation, with interpretability objectives influencing prompt updates at each step.

Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between task performance and interpretability - stronger interpretability constraints typically reduce performance, while maximizing performance often yields less interpretable prompts.

Failure signatures: Prompts that optimize for interpretability proxies may exhibit degenerate patterns (e.g., repetitive tokens, meaningless sequences) that score well on metrics but fail human inspection.

First experiments:
1. Compare original PEZ vs interpretability-enhanced PEZ on GPT-2 zero-shot classification
2. Test RLPrompt with interpretability rewards against baseline on the same task
3. Conduct qualitative analysis of prompt patterns to verify whether high-scoring prompts are actually interpretable to humans

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper doesn't explicitly identify open questions, but the findings raise several important directions: (1) How can we develop better interpretability metrics that actually correlate with human judgments? (2) What optimization strategies can achieve both high performance and interpretability? (3) How do interpretability properties scale with model size and complexity?

## Limitations

- Experiments limited to GPT-2 on zero-shot classification tasks, limiting generalizability
- Reliance on perplexity-based metrics that the authors themselves question as flawed proxies
- Theoretical framework lacks empirical validation beyond qualitative prompt inspection
- Trade-off between interpretability and performance may be specific to tested optimization approaches

## Confidence

High confidence: Existing soft prompt methods fail interpretability desiderata - well-supported by experimental results across multiple baselines

Medium confidence: Framework provides useful conceptual structure - needs further validation of practical utility

Medium confidence: Interpretability-performance trade-off observed - may be specific to tested optimization approaches

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate interpretability framework on larger models (LLaMA, GPT-3) and diverse task types (generation, reasoning, structured output)
2. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate correlation between perplexity scores and human interpretability judgments
3. Test alternative interpretability metrics beyond perplexity (semantic coherence, activation pattern analysis)
