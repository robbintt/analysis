# CIEGAD: Cluster-Conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative Framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-Aligned Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10178
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10178
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: CIEGAD improves F1 and recall scores through cluster-conditioned interpolative and extrapolative data augmentation, particularly for long-tailed and multi-class datasets.

## Executive Summary
CIEGAD addresses data scarcity and imbalance in deep learning by generating augmented data through both interpolative and extrapolative synthesis, guided by cluster-conditioned domain profiles. The framework employs a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation to prioritize minority classes and sparse regions, using geometric constraint filtering combined with LLM-as-a-Judge for quality control. Experiments on IMDb, Yelp, Emo-6class, and Emo-13class datasets demonstrate improved F1 and recall scores, particularly in long-tailed and multi-class scenarios, while maintaining strong domain alignment and semantic diversity.

## Method Summary
CIEGAD generates augmented text data through a cluster-conditioned approach that combines geometric constraints with domain-specific guidance. The method clusters data within classes, constructs domain profiles from core and periphery examples, and uses hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation to prioritize generation resources. It employs both interpolative and extrapolative synthesis with strict geometric acceptance criteria, followed by LLM-based quality filtering. The framework operates on embedded text representations using Sentence Transformer models, with domain profiles synthesized via LLM and validated through geometric constraints and multi-dimensional LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation.

## Key Results
- Improved F1 and recall scores across IMDb, Yelp, Emo-6class, and Emo-13class datasets
- Enhanced performance particularly in long-tailed and multi-class scenarios
- Maintained strong domain alignment and semantic diversity while addressing data scarcity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Cluster-conditioned domain profiles may reduce semantic drift by grounding generation in local stylistic and topical constraints.
- **Mechanism**: The framework clusters data within classes using k-means and extracts "core" and "periphery" examples. An LLM synthesizes these into a domain profile (summary + structured info), which serves as a hard constraint during generation.
- **Core assumption**: Assumes that textual semantics map linearly or locally to the embedding space such that cluster centroids and boundaries capture meaningful stylistic variations.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] Mentions "constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning." [Section III-B] Details the construction of profiles from core/periphery examples to "preserv[e] cluster-specific linguistic features."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Geometric vector constraints likely enforce directional control, preventing generated samples from collapsing into the cluster center or drifting into unrelated semantic space.
- **Mechanism**: The system defines "Inner" ($I$) and "Outer" ($O$) sets based on distance to centroids. For interpolation, it accepts samples if the vector projection falls *between* $I$ and $O$. For extrapolation, it requires the sample to lie *beyond* the outer boundary.
- **Core assumption**: Assumes the semantic boundary of a class can be approximated by the convex hull or linear interpolation of high-dimensional embedding vectors.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Section III-D] Explicitly defines the acceptance inequalities for interpolation and extrapolation. [Fig. 3] Visualizes the mechanism of generating "inside" vs. "outside" the vector space.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Hierarchical Frequency-Geometric Allocation (HFGA) likely improves recall for long-tailed classes by prioritizing generation resources for sparse, isolated, or minority clusters.
- **Mechanism**: A priority score combines cluster size (inverse frequency), separation (distance to neighbors), and sparsity (local density). This score weights the allocation of the total generation budget, directing more LLM calls to under-represented regions.
- **Core assumption**: Assumes that "geometric isolation" in the training set correlates with "classification difficulty" or "information gain" for the model.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Section III-C] Defines the HFGA formula using weights. [Table III] Shows improved stability in recall/precision as test scale increases, suggesting robust coverage of sparse regions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Embedding Geometry & Metrics**
  - **Why needed here**: The framework relies entirely on Euclidean vs. Cosine distances to define "inner/outer" sets and "interpolation" paths. You cannot debug the geometric filters without understanding the shape of the embedding space.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain why a sample might be "close" in Euclidean distance but "far" in Cosine distance, and which metric CIEGAD uses for the final acceptance inequality?

- **Concept**: **K-Means Clustering Dynamics**
  - **Why needed here**: The quality of the "Domain Profile" depends on the stability of the clusters. CIEGAD dynamically sets $K$; understanding how $K$ affects the granularity of "domain profiles" is critical.
  - **Quick check question**: If a class has 100 samples, how many clusters would CIEGAD generate (roughly) based on Eq. 1, and does this capture style or just random noise?

- **Concept**: **LLM-as-a-Judge / Filtering**
  - **Why needed here**: Geometric filters catch structural errors, but the "LLM-as-a-Judge" is the semantic safety net.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the five dimensions the LLM Judge evaluates (Section III-E), and why is "Reason validity" critical for the extrapolation mechanism?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  1. **Cluster Engine**: Input: Raw Text → Embedder → K-Means → Cluster IDs
  2. **Profile Generator**: Input: Cluster Samples → LLM → Domain Profile Text
  3. **Allocator (HFGA)**: Input: Cluster Stats → Priority Scores → Quota per Cluster
  4. **Synthesizer**: Input: Profile + $I/O$ Sets → LLM → Candidate Text
  5. **Validator**: Input: Candidate + Geometric Constraints → Filter → LLM-Judge → Final Data

- **Critical path**: The **Synthesizer-to-Validator** loop. Generating text is easy; ensuring it satisfies the strict *inequality constraints* (Eq. 6/7) is the bottleneck. If the embedding model drifts or the LLM is too conservative, the rejection rate here spikes, increasing cost without increasing data volume.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Cost vs. Coverage**: High augmentation ratio ($\rho=2.0$) maximizes F1/Recall but doubles LLM API costs compared to $\rho=0.5$.
  - **Granularity vs. Stability**: Increasing cluster count $K$ creates more specific domain profiles but risks overfitting to small sample sets, making stable centroid calculation difficult.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Empty Clusters / Generation Loops**: If the geometric constraints (Eq. 7) are too strict for the LLM's natural output variance, the system may generate thousands of candidates but accept 0.
  - **Profile Drift**: If the "Core" examples are unrepresentative, the Domain Profile will hallucinate features, causing the LLM to generate off-topic text that passes the LLM-Judge but fails downstream training.
  - **Runaway Costs**: HFGA might assign massive quotas to a "sparse" but large cluster if parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are unbalanced.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Visual Validation**: Run the clustering and geometric pipeline on a test set. Visualize $I_{set}$, $O_{set}$, and accepted candidates in 2D (t-SNE). Verify that "interpolated" points actually sit *between* the sets.
  2. **Ablation on Constraints**: Run generation with the Geometric Filter *disabled*. Measure the Fréchet Embedding Distance (FED) to confirm it degrades, proving the filter is active and necessary.
  3. **Efficiency Sweep**: Test augmentation ratios $\rho \in \{0.2, 0.5, 1.0\}$. Plot "API Cost" vs. "F1 Score" to find the inflection point where generating more data yields diminishing returns for your specific dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can geometric constraint filters be dynamically adapted based on local cluster density or similarity to improve augmentation precision?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state, "There remains potential to design more flexible mechanisms by dynamically adjusting the strength of constraints according to local cluster density or similarity."
- **Why unresolved**: The current formulation uses a fixed margin ($\gamma$) and constraint equation, which may not be optimal for all cluster structures or densities.
- **Evidence**: Experiments comparing fixed vs. density-adaptive constraint formulations, measuring the rate of accepted samples and Fréchet Embedding Distance (FED).

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can CIEGAD be extended to complex domains requiring strict factual consistency (e.g., news, policy) without sacrificing semantic diversity?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "Future work should therefore explore mechanisms that can dynamically balance generation diversity and fidelity according to task characteristics."
- **Why unresolved**: The study was restricted to emotion recognition, where factual strictness is less critical than in domains prone to hallucination.
- **Evidence**: Application of the framework to news classification datasets with additional metrics for factual consistency or hallucination rates.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does varying the size of the inner and outer sample sets systematically affect generation direction and quality?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "A systematic analysis of how these parameters [number of samples in inner/outer sets] influence generation quality and expansion efficiency remains an important direction."
- **Why unresolved**: The set size was fixed at 10 empirically; the trade-off between computational cost, context window usage, and directional control remains unquantified.
- **Evidence**: An ablation study varying set sizes (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50) and measuring changes in the Outward Expansion Ratio (OER) and Semantic Novelty Index (SNI).

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: Is it possible to reproduce CIEGAD's precise directional control using lightweight, open-source models for resource-constrained deployment?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "Developing a lightweight implementation reproducible with open-source models remains an important step... preliminary experiments revealed that smaller open-source models struggle with precise output control."
- **Why unresolved**: The framework currently relies on high-performance proprietary APIs (GPT-4, Claude), creating barriers for reproducibility and cost-effective scaling.
- **Evidence**: Implementation using open-source models (e.g., Llama, Mistral) with evaluation of constraint satisfaction rates and domain alignment.

## Limitations

- Effectiveness depends heavily on embedding space quality; poor embeddings may cause geometric constraints to reject valid candidates or accept irrelevant ones
- LLM-as-a-Judge reliability is uncertain due to unspecified prompt templates and scoring rubrics
- Potential for domain drift when generating large volumes of augmented data, particularly with high augmentation ratios

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The geometric constraint mechanism and HFGA allocation strategy are well-defined with clear mathematical formulations. The downstream performance improvements (F1 and recall) are directly measurable and reported across multiple datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: The cluster-conditioned domain profile approach shows promise, but its effectiveness depends on the quality of clustering and the LLM's ability to synthesize meaningful profiles from core/periphery examples.

**Low Confidence**: The LLM-as-a-Judge component's reliability and consistency across different evaluation dimensions remain uncertain due to unspecified prompt templates and scoring rubrics.

## Next Checks

1. **Embedding Space Validation**: Visualize the embedding space using t-SNE or UMAP to verify that clusters capture meaningful semantic distinctions and that geometric constraints operate in semantically coherent regions.

2. **Constraint Tolerance Testing**: Systematically vary the geometric constraint thresholds (γ parameter) and similarity thresholds to measure their impact on rejection rates, data quality metrics, and downstream performance.

3. **Profile Coherence Analysis**: Evaluate the quality and consistency of generated domain profiles by measuring their semantic coherence using embedding similarity metrics and conducting human evaluation on a sample of profiles.
