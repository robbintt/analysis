# Feedback Indicators: The Alignment between Llama and a Teacher in Language Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11364
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11364
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Llama 3.1 extracted feedback indicators showed 70% acceptable correlation (|PCC| ≥ .5) with teacher ratings, with 15 indicators demonstrating high correlation (|PCC| ≥ .70) at .01 significance level

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the alignment between feedback indicators generated by the Llama 3.1 LLM and human teacher ratings for language learning submissions. Using prompts designed from teacher feedback criteria descriptions, the study extracted indicators from student submissions and compared them to teacher assessments. The results demonstrate that a majority of extracted indicators showed statistically significant correlations with teacher ratings, with some indicators exceeding expected correlation levels based on criteria descriptions. This work establishes a promising foundation for using LLMs to automatically extract formative feedback indicators that align with educational assessment standards.

## Method Summary
The study employed a correlation analysis approach to evaluate alignment between LLM-extracted indicators and teacher ratings. Llama 3.1 was prompted with descriptions of teacher feedback criteria to extract indicators from student language learning submissions. The extracted indicators were then compared to corresponding teacher ratings using Pearson correlation coefficients. The analysis focused on identifying indicators with acceptable correlation (|PCC| ≥ .5) and high correlation (|PCC| ≥ .70), examining both the strength and statistical significance of these relationships. The study specifically looked at how well the LLM could capture the nuances of teacher assessment criteria through automated indicator extraction.

## Key Results
- 70% of extracted indicators showed acceptable correlation (|PCC| ≥ .5) with at least one teacher criterion
- 15 indicators demonstrated high correlation (|PCC| ≥ .70) with statistical significance at the .01 level
- Some indicators showed stronger correlations than expected based on criteria descriptions, revealing complexity in assessment criteria

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism relies on the LLM's ability to parse and understand natural language descriptions of teacher feedback criteria, then apply this understanding to extract relevant indicators from student submissions. The correlation analysis validates that the LLM can capture meaningful patterns that align with human assessment, suggesting that LLMs can serve as reliable intermediaries for educational assessment tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC): Measures linear correlation between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. Why needed: To quantify alignment between LLM-extracted indicators and teacher ratings. Quick check: Verify that correlation values are correctly calculated and interpreted.
- Single-shot prompting: LLM generates outputs based on a single prompt without examples. Why needed: The study's approach to extracting indicators from descriptions alone. Quick check: Confirm prompt design effectively captures criteria requirements.
- Statistical significance testing: Determines whether observed correlations are likely due to chance. Why needed: To validate that correlations are meaningful rather than random. Quick check: Verify p-values are correctly calculated and significance thresholds are appropriate.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Teacher criteria descriptions -> Llama 3.1 prompt -> Indicator extraction -> Student submission analysis -> PCC calculation -> Correlation validation
**Critical Path:** The extraction and correlation analysis process where teacher criteria are converted to prompts, applied to submissions, and results are statistically validated.
**Design Tradeoffs:** Single-shot prompting offers simplicity and scalability but may miss nuanced criteria interpretations that few-shot learning could capture. The correlation threshold of |PCC| ≥ .5 balances sensitivity with specificity but may include less reliable indicators.
**Failure Signatures:** Low correlations (|PCC| < .5) indicate poor alignment between extracted indicators and teacher assessments. Unexpectedly high correlations suggest criteria complexity not captured in descriptions. No significant correlations indicate fundamental misalignment between LLM extraction and teacher expectations.
**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test prompt variations with different levels of specificity in criteria descriptions
2. Apply the extraction method to submissions from different educational levels
3. Compare single-shot prompting results with few-shot prompting approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The moderate correlation threshold (|PCC| ≥ .5) may be too lenient for educational applications requiring higher precision
- Single-shot prompting approach without exploring iterative refinement or few-shot learning
- Lack of false positive rate analysis and indicator specificity evaluation

## Confidence
**Confidence: Medium**
- Correlation analysis shows statistically significant relationships
- Study lacks detailed error analysis and mismatch investigation
- Sample size and demographic information not specified
- No validation of practical utility or teacher trust in extracted indicators

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a blind study where teachers evaluate the practical utility and accuracy of auto-extracted indicators compared to their original assessments
2. Test the approach across different educational levels, subject domains, and language proficiency levels to assess generalizability
3. Implement and evaluate an iterative prompting strategy where teacher feedback is used to refine indicator extraction over multiple rounds
