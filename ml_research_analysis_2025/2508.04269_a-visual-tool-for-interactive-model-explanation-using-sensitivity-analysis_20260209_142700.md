# A Visual Tool for Interactive Model Explanation using Sensitivity Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.04269
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04269
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: SAInT integrates global and local sensitivity analysis into a single interactive Python GUI for ML model training and explanation without programming

## Executive Summary
SAInT is a Python-based tool that enables domain experts and AI researchers to train, evaluate, and explain machine learning models through an interactive graphical interface. The system combines automated model selection, variance-based global sensitivity analysis (eFAST Sobol indices), and local explanations via LIME and SHAP. It supports regression and classification on tabular CSV data using scikit-learn and fastai. In a Titanic survival prediction use case, the tool identified passenger class, age, and siblings/spouse aboard as the most influential global features, while revealing female sex and first class as key local factors for survival. Performance tests demonstrated efficient processing of large datasets (100k samples) on low-end hardware with sub-second model training and sensitivity computation.

## Method Summary
SAInT provides a human-in-the-loop workflow where users load tabular CSV data, select input/output features, and configure normalization. The system trains multiple model configurations (RandomForest, XGBoost, MLP, Tabular ResNets) and automatically selects the best model based on lowest error. Global Sensitivity Analysis runs automatically via SALib eFAST to compute Sobol indices, identifying important features for removal in iterative refinement. Local explanations (LIME/SHAP) are computed on-demand when users click individual samples in interactive scatter plots. The tool uses one-hot encoding for categorical features and excludes rows with missing values.

## Key Results
- Titanic use case identified passenger class, age, and siblings/spouse aboard as top global features via GSA
- Sub-second processing demonstrated for 100k samples on low-end laptop
- Interactive plots enable per-instance explanation via LIME/SHAP when clicking samples
- Iterative feature selection allows progressive model refinement without programming

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Variance-based global sensitivity analysis via eFAST enables identification of the most influential input features across the entire data distribution.
- Mechanism: The Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test decomposes output variance using Fourier analysis to approximate first-order Sobol indices (main effect of single input) and total-order Sobol indices (including feature interactions). This aggregates many local evaluations into a global importance ranking.
- Core assumption: Feature importance can be meaningfully captured through variance decomposition, and features are not strongly linearly correlated (correlation splits sensitivity between features, diluting results).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "variance-based global sensitivity analysis (eFAST Sobol indices)"
  - [section 1.2]: "The Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (eFAST) is a computationally efficient variance-based method that approximates the first and total order Sobol indices by decomposing the variance of the model output using Fourier analysis"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct validation; neighbor papers address GNN/LLM explainability but not eFAST specifically.
- Break condition: Strong linear correlations between input features cause sensitivity to be distributed across correlated features, making individual importance difficult to isolate. The system detects this and raises a warning (section 4.2).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Local explanations via LIME and SHAP provide per-instance feature attributions that reveal why specific predictions were made.
- Mechanism: When a user clicks a sample in the interactive plot, LIME generates local surrogate model explanations showing prediction probabilities and feature impact direction/thresholds. SHAP produces force plots showing positive vs. negative feature contributions for that specific instance.
- Core assumption: Local surrogate models (LIME) and game-theoretic attributions (SHAP) faithfully approximate the true model's decision boundary for individual predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "local explanations via LIME and SHAP"
  - [section 2.6]: "individual samples can be selected, which triggers the computation of local explanations with optionally LIME or SHAP. The LIME explanation shows the prediction probabilities, negative and positive impact of features"
  - [corpus]: CafGa paper (FMR 0.60) discusses customization of SHAP/LIME for language models, suggesting broader validation of these methods but not specific to SAInT.
- Break condition: LSA provides only a localized view—insights from one instance do not generalize (section 1.2: "LSA only provides a localized view of the problem space for a specific situation").

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human-in-the-loop iterative refinement using GSA results enables progressive feature selection and model improvement.
- Mechanism: Users train models, evaluate via error plots, review GSA to identify low-importance features, remove those features, and retrain. This cycle allows domain experts to refine data without programming.
- Core assumption: Features with low global sensitivity can be removed without degrading predictive performance, and iterative narrowing improves model focus on relevant patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The tool enables... feature selection... and model refinement through interactive visual analytics"
  - [section 2.7]: "Features selection: Using GSA, the user can identify important features and remove unimportant input features in the next training iteration"
  - [section 3.1]: Titanic use case shows removing low-GSA features (fare, parents/children aboard) "leads to a redistribution of the GSA onto the remaining features... allowing the model to focus on the most influential features"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus validation of this specific HITL loop; related papers focus on other explanation modalities.
- Break condition: If important nonlinear feature interactions exist, removing individually low-sensitivity features may inadvertently harm performance. The paper does not report systematic validation of feature removal impact.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Sobol Indices (First-Order vs. Total-Order)**
  - Why needed here: Core output of GSA; interpreting these correctly determines whether feature interactions are present (large gap between first and total indicates interdependence).
  - Quick check question: If a feature has first-order Sobol index 0.1 and total-order index 0.4, what does this suggest about its relationship with other features?

- Concept: **LIME vs. SHAP Tradeoffs**
  - Why needed here: SAInT offers both; users must understand that LIME provides threshold-based explanations for numerical features while SHAP offers additive force-plot visualizations with different theoretical guarantees.
  - Quick check question: Which method would you prefer if you need guaranteed consistency (feature attributions sum to prediction difference from baseline)?

- Concept: **Model-Agnostic Explanation Constraints**
  - Why needed here: Both LIME and SHAP are model-agnostic, meaning they approximate behavior rather than reveal internal structure; this limits mechanistic insight.
  - Quick check question: If a domain expert asks "why does the model use this rule?", can LIME/SHAP directly answer, or do they only show "what features mattered for this prediction"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Layer -> Model Layer -> Evaluation Layer -> Sensitivity Layer -> Interface Layer
  - CSV parsing -> Model training -> Error evaluation -> GSA/LSA computation -> Dash Plotly GUI

- Critical path:
  1. Load CSV → select input/output features → configure normalization
  2. Train multiple model configurations → evaluate on train/val/test → auto-select lowest-error model
  3. GSA runs automatically on best model → user reviews Sobol indices
  4. User clicks samples in interactive plot → LSA (LIME/SHAP) computed on demand
  5. Optional: Remove low-importance features → retrain (iterative HITL loop)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Tabular-only constraint: No native image/text support; extension stated as "straightforward in principle" but not implemented
  - Single-device training: FastAI limited to one device; no distributed training
  - Automatic model selection: Based solely on lowest error; manual selection planned for future
  - Local-only storage: Privacy-preserving but no collaboration features

- Failure signatures:
  - Correlated features warning → GSA results diluted; consider PCA preprocessing
  - Models with different input features cannot be compared → requires separate user folders
  - Large gap between validation and test performance → suggests overfitting; check generalization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Load Titanic dataset, train default XGBoost and RandomForest, reproduce reported GSA rankings (passenger class, age, siblings/spouse as top features). Verify LIME/SHAP output for known survivors vs. non-survivors.
  2. **Correlation stress test**: Introduce synthetic highly-correlated features (e.g., duplicate a column with noise), confirm system raises correlation warning, and observe GSA dilution effect.
  3. **Feature removal impact**: Iteratively remove the lowest-GSA features (fare, parents/children) and measure validation error change. Assumption: paper claims improvement but does not report quantitative comparison—this validates or refutes the claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the use of SAInT by domain experts lead to significant improvements in model reliability or data quality compared to standard programming-based workflows?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "future work will include a comprehensive user study to further validate its effectiveness and usability."
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation relies on a demonstration use case (Titanic) and performance benchmarks, lacking empirical data on how the tool influences human-in-the-loop decision-making or final model performance in real-world settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled user study measuring the accuracy of bias detection, the quality of refined datasets, and the time required for model tuning when using the tool versus baseline methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the integrated sensitivity analysis framework be effectively extended to non-tabular data such as images and text without sacrificing the real-time interactivity of the interface?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note the tool is "limited to tabular data as CSV files, but extending it to image and text data is straight forward in principle."
- Why unresolved: While the authors suggest the extension is possible, image and text data require different preprocessing and visualization paradigms (e.g., highlighting pixels or tokens) which are currently unimplemented and may impact the sub-second performance cited for tabular data.
- What evidence would resolve it: An implementation of the tool supporting image/text inputs, demonstrating that LSA/GSA visualizations remain interpretable and computation remains efficient (sub-second or near real-time) for these high-dimensional data types.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the tool mitigate the dilution of sensitivity results when high linear correlations exist between input features, beyond issuing a warning or requiring manual PCA?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states, "If there is a strong linear correlation between input features, the response of the sensitivity analysis will be split between the correlating features, diluting the result."
- Why unresolved: The current solution is to warn the user or suggest manual PCA, which reduces direct interpretability of the original features. There is no integrated method to automatically handle or visually disentangle correlated features within the sensitivity analysis loop.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integration of sensitivity indices robust to correlation or a visual method that clusters/groups correlated features automatically, validated on datasets with known multicollinearity.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the computational complexity of the eFAST algorithm within the tool scale with high-dimensional tabular datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The performance evaluation cites efficient processing for 100k samples, but the Titanic use case uses only 6 features.
- Why unresolved: Variance-based methods like eFAST typically require a large number of model evaluations that grow exponentially with the number of input dimensions. It is unclear if the "sub-second" or efficient performance holds when users select datasets with hundreds or thousands of input features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking results showing the time required for Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) as the number of input features increases (e.g., 10 vs 100 vs 1000 features) while holding sample size constant.

## Limitations

- Source code not provided, preventing direct validation of integrated GUI and automated workflow
- Iterative feature removal impact not empirically validated with performance metrics
- Extension to image/text data remains theoretical with no implementation or validation
- Correlation handling limited to warnings and manual PCA without automated mitigation

## Confidence

- GSA mechanism (Sobol indices via eFAST): **High** - well-established methodology with clear theoretical grounding
- Local explanations (LIME/SHAP): **Medium** - proven methods but SAInT-specific integration not validated
- Iterative HITL refinement: **Low** - core claim but lacks quantitative validation of feature removal impact
- Performance claims (sub-second processing): **Medium** - reasonable for the tested scale but not benchmarked

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce GSA rankings**: Use Titanic dataset to verify passenger class, age, and siblings/spouse aboard consistently emerge as top features via eFAST Sobol indices
2. **Validate correlation warning**: Introduce synthetic correlated features and confirm system detects this condition with appropriate warning
3. **Test feature removal impact**: Quantify validation error change when removing lowest-GSA features to empirically validate the iterative refinement claim
