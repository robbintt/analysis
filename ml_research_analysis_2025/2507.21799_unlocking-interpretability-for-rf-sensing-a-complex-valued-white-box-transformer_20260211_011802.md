# Unlocking Interpretability for RF Sensing: A Complex-Valued White-Box Transformer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.21799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21799
- Authors: Xie Zhang; Yina Wang; Chenshu Wu
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces RF-CRATE, the first fully interpretable deep learning model for wireless sensing, achieving performance on par with black-box models while ensuring full mathematical interpretability.

## Executive Summary
RF-CRATE introduces the first fully interpretable deep learning model for wireless sensing by extending the white-box transformer CRATE to complex-valued RF data. The model is mathematically derived from complex sparse rate reduction principles, incorporating complex self-attention and residual MLP modules under the CR-Calculus framework. To address limited training data, a Subspace Regularization technique enhances feature diversity. Extensive experiments on four public datasets and a self-collected WiFi dataset show RF-CRATE achieves performance on par with engineered black-box models while ensuring full mathematical interpretability. Compared to the original CRATE, RF-CRATE delivers an average 5.08% classification gain and 10.34% regression error reduction.

## Method Summary
RF-CRATE is a complex-valued transformer architecture derived from complex sparse rate reduction principles using CR-Calculus. It processes complex-valued RF tokens (Patched CSI/Radar data) through alternating compression (RF-MSSA) and sparsification (RF-MLP) blocks, with Subspace Regularization to enhance feature diversity. The model is trained using AdamW with cosine annealing and Subspace Regularization to balance feature density across subspaces. Preprocessing varies by dataset type, including STFT for WiFi CSI and FFT for mmWave data, with specific handling for each RF modality.

## Key Results
- RF-CRATE achieves 5.08% average classification performance gain compared to the original CRATE.
- RF-CRATE reduces regression error by 10.34% on average compared to the original CRATE.
- Subspace Regularization provides an average improvement of 19.98% in feature diversity and performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Learning effective representations from complex-valued RF data may be framed as an iterative optimization of a "complex sparse rate reduction" objective.
- **Mechanism:** The model alternates between compressing features into low-dimensional subspaces (via RF self-attention) and sparsifying them (via RF-MLP). This forces the high-dimensional RF input into a parsimonious, structured latent space.
- **Core assumption:** RF sensing data possesses intrinsic parsimony, meaning task-relevant information is concentrated in sparse, low-dimensional subspaces despite high raw dimensionality.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction"; [section 3.2] "optimize the complex sparse rate reduction objective... two-step alternating minimization"; [corpus] The provided corpus focuses on complex-valued networks but lacks direct evidence for the specific "sparse rate reduction" theory, suggesting this theoretical framework is specific to the CRATE lineage.
- **Break condition:** If the underlying data distribution does not exhibit low-dimensional subspace structures (e.g., pure noise), the compression mechanism may fail to converge or discard essential information.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Deriving transformer components in the complex domain requires specialized calculus to handle non-holomorphic objective functions.
- **Mechanism:** The authors leverage CR-Calculus (Wirtinger calculus) to compute gradients of the real-valued rate reduction loss with respect to complex-valued weights. This mathematical derivation explicitly yields the "RF Self-Attention" and "RF-MLP" update rules, rather than adapting real-valued heuristics.
- **Core assumption:** The von Neumann approximation and relaxation of metric tensor constraints hold sufficiently well to create stable update rules during training.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "leveraging the CR-Calculus framework... theoretically derived self-attention"; [section 3.3] "generalize the approximate gradient descent to the complex field via the CR-Calculus framework"; [corpus] "Holographic Transformers" proposes phase-interference attention, offering a contrasting mechanism for complex attention not based on CR-Calculus.
- **Break condition:** If the optimization landscape contains singularities not addressed by the quadratic upper bound approximations, gradient descent could become unstable.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Enforcing balanced occupancy of feature subspaces improves generalization when training data is scarce.
- **Mechanism:** Subspace Regularization (SSR) adds a penalty term based on the density variance across different subspaces. This prevents the model from collapsing features into a small subset of available subspaces, promoting diversity.
- **Core assumption:** A balanced distribution of features across subspaces correlates with better generalization for RF tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Subspace Regularization technique enhances feature diversity"; [section 3.6] "encourage more balanced feature allocation across subspaces... average improvement of 19.98%"; [corpus] No direct evidence for SSR in the provided corpus; this appears to be a novel regularization technique for this architecture.
- **Break condition:** If the optimal solution for a task inherently requires unbalanced subspace usage (e.g., sparse few-class classification), SSR might constrain the model excessively.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: CR-Calculus (Wirtinger Calculus)**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard calculus fails for non-holomorphic functions (where the derivative depends on direction). Since the loss is real-valued but weights are complex, CR-Calculus provides the rigorous gradient definition required to derive the white-box layers.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why we treat a complex variable $z$ and its conjugate $\bar{z}$ as independent variables when differentiating a real-valued loss function?

- **Concept: Algorithm Unrolling**
  - **Why needed here:** The core architectural philosophy. The network is not a bag of heuristics but a literal unrolling of an iterative optimization algorithm (gradient descent on rate reduction) where each layer corresponds to one time step.
  - **Quick check question:** How does mapping an optimization iteration (e.g., gradient descent step) to a neural network layer provide "white-box" interpretability?

- **Concept: Complex Sparse Rate Reduction**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the objective function the entire architecture seeks to minimize. Understanding the trade-off between the "coding rate" (compression) and sparsity terms is essential to understanding why the model separates attention (compression) and MLP (sparsification).
  - **Quick check question:** In the context of RF sensing, why might we want to simultaneously compress data into subspaces while enforcing sparsity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input -> RF-MSSA (Multi-Head Subspace Attention) -> LayerNorm -> RF-MLP -> LayerNorm -> Real-valued linear head on CLS token modulus

- **Critical path:** The derivation of the **RF-MLP skip connection** is critical. Unlike standard ResNets where skip connections are heuristics, here the connection arises mathematically from the metric tensor derivation. Removing it breaks the theoretical "white-box" correspondence to the optimization objective.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **cReLU vs. modReLU:** The paper settles on cReLU ($\text{ReLU}(\Re(z)) + i\text{ReLU}(\Im(z))$) for performance (90.47% vs 83.61%), but this simplifies the phase handling compared to modulus-based activations.
  - **SSR necessity:** SSR is effectively mandatory for small datasets (19.98% gain), but adds hyperparameter sensitivity.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Subspace Collapse:** Features clustering in only a few heads/subspaces (detectable via the heatmaps in Fig 6) indicates insufficient regularization or learning rate issues.
  - **Training Instability:** If the metric tensor $\Omega_Z$ is not effectively constrained or learned, the gradient steps in the MLP layer may explode.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on Input Modality:** Compare raw CSI vs. DFS (Doppler Frequency Shift) spectrum to validate the claim that DFS improves cross-domain robustness (Fig 17).
  2. **SSR Impact Analysis:** Train with and without Subspace Regularization on a subset of the Widar3.0 dataset to quantify the diversity gain (Fig 16).
  3. **Activation Profiling:** Swap cReLU for modReLU or cardioid activations to verify the paper's claim that cReLU maximizes representational capacity for this specific architecture (Fig 18).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the computational complexity of RF-CRATE be reduced to support real-time inference on edge devices without sacrificing sensing performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Discussion that "addressing these computational demands without sacrificing model performance remains a direction for future exploration" regarding real-time applications on edge devices.
- Why unresolved: The current transformer-like architecture introduces considerable computational complexity that increases rapidly with input sequence length, posing challenges for resource-constrained hardware.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified architecture or optimization technique that achieves comparable accuracy on standard RF benchmarks (e.g., Widar3.0) while meeting strict latency and memory constraints on embedded hardware.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the decision-making procedures of RF-CRATE be analyzed and presented in a manner that is perceptible and understandable to human operators?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion notes that "further analysis of the decision-making procedures in a manner perceptible to humans would greatly enhance our understanding... Future work should focus on refining these interpretative techniques."
- Why unresolved: While the structural design is mathematically interpretable, the internal logic leading to specific predictions remains opaque to human intuition, limiting trust in critical applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of visualization tools or analytical methods that map internal model states (e.g., sparse codes) to physical signal phenomena (e.g., specific multipath reflections) that humans can verify.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can established signal processing theories be formally integrated into the RF-CRATE derivation to create models that align more closely with the physical principles of RF signals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that "future work can integrate established signal processing theories into model derivation to develop models that align more closely with the underlying physical principles."
- Why unresolved: The current derivation relies on general principles of sparse rate reduction, which may not explicitly encode specific domain knowledge inherent to wireless signal propagation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical framework extending the complex sparse rate reduction objective to include physical constraints (e.g., electromagnetic wave properties), resulting in improved generalization or data efficiency.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can RF-CRATE serve as a bridge to enable the co-design of Large Language Models (LLMs) and RF sensing mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that "The co-design of Large Language Models (LLMs) and sensing mechanisms presents a promising avenue for future research," proposing RF-CRATE as a potential bridge.
- Why unresolved: Current LLMs and sensing models operate largely independently; a unified architecture that leverages RF-CRATE's interpretable, transformer-like structure for multi-modal processing has not been established.
- What evidence would resolve it: A unified model architecture capable of processing both complex-valued RF data and text prompts to perform complex reasoning tasks, such as describing physical environments based on wireless signals.

## Limitations

- **Theoretical Derivation Validity**: The core mathematical derivations are not fully provided in the paper, requiring trust in the claims about the white-box nature of the architecture.
- **Self-Collected Dataset Reproducibility**: Performance on the WiP-pose and WiP-breath datasets cannot be independently verified as the data is not publicly available.
- **Generalization Beyond RF**: The method is explicitly designed and tested for RF sensing, and its applicability to other complex-valued domains remains untested.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Experimental results on the four public datasets (Widar3.0, GaitID, HuPR, OPERAnet) are reproducible in principle, given access to the data and sufficient computational resources.
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance improvements (5.08% classification gain, 10.34% regression error reduction) are stated but require careful re-implementation and validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The core theoretical claims (e.g., exact relationship between the derived complex-valued components and the sparse rate reduction objective, the necessity of CR-Calculus for stability) are difficult to verify without access to the complete mathematical derivations.

## Next Checks

1. **Public Dataset Replication**: Re-implement the model architecture and training procedure, then replicate the results on at least two of the four public datasets (e.g., Widar3.0 for classification and HuPR for regression) to confirm the stated performance improvements over baselines.

2. **Ablation of SSR**: Conduct a controlled experiment to isolate the impact of Subspace Regularization by training the model with and without SSR on a consistent dataset, measuring the reported 19.98% average improvement and analyzing the resulting subspace occupancy patterns.

3. **Theoretical Derivation Audit**: Obtain and critically review the complete mathematical derivations for the RF Self-Attention and RF-MLP layers, verifying the application of CR-Calculus and the claimed relationship to the complex sparse rate reduction objective.
