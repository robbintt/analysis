# Pretraining in Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Robot Locomotion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12363
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12363
- Reference count: 40
- Proposed method improves sample efficiency by 36.9% and task performance by 7.3% through embodiment-specific pretraining

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a three-stage pretraining method for actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms applied to robot locomotion tasks. The approach focuses on leveraging embodiment-specific knowledge through supervised pretraining of neural networks before applying reinforcement learning. By pretraining on diverse, dynamic transition data collected through exploration-based data collection, the method warm-starts the policy optimization process, leading to improved sample efficiency and task performance compared to random initialization.

## Method Summary
The proposed method consists of three stages: exploration-based data collection, pretraining, and reinforcement learning. During the first stage, diverse transition data is collected through exploration-based strategies. In the second stage, a Proprioceptive Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) is trained using supervised learning on the collected data. Finally, the pretrained weights from the PIDM are loaded into both actor and critic networks to initialize the policy optimization process for actual tasks. The authors systematically validated their approach across 9 distinct robot locomotion environments with 3 different robot embodiments, demonstrating significant improvements in sample efficiency and task performance.

## Key Results
- Average 36.9% improvement in sample efficiency compared to random initialization
- Average 7.3% improvement in task performance across all environments
- Validated across 9 robot locomotion environments with 3 different robot embodiments
- Consistent performance gains observed across diverse locomotion tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging embodiment-specific knowledge through supervised pretraining before applying reinforcement learning. By training the PIDM on diverse, dynamic transition data collected through exploration, the neural networks learn useful representations of the robot's dynamics and proprioceptive information. This initialization provides a better starting point for policy optimization compared to random initialization, reducing the number of interactions needed to achieve good performance. The pretraining effectively transfers knowledge about the robot's physical capabilities and constraints to the actor-critic architecture.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning**: Combines value-based and policy-based methods by maintaining both an actor (policy) and critic (value function). Why needed: Forms the baseline algorithm that benefits from pretraining. Quick check: Understand how actor and critic networks interact during training.

2. **Proprioceptive Inverse Dynamics Modeling**: Learning to predict actions from proprioceptive states. Why needed: Captures embodiment-specific knowledge about robot dynamics. Quick check: Verify the model can predict actions from state observations.

3. **Exploration-based Data Collection**: Strategies for gathering diverse transition data. Why needed: Provides the training data for pretraining stage. Quick check: Ensure collected data covers diverse robot behaviors.

4. **Warm-starting in RL**: Initializing neural network weights before policy optimization. Why needed: Reduces sample complexity by starting from a better initial policy. Quick check: Compare performance with and without warm-start initialization.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data Collection -> PIDM Training -> Weight Transfer -> Actor-Critic RL

Critical Path: The sequential flow from exploration-based data collection through PIDM pretraining to warm-starting the actor-critic networks represents the critical path. Each stage must successfully complete for the final RL stage to benefit from the pretraining.

Design Tradeoffs: The method trades additional pretraining computation for reduced sample complexity during RL. The exploration phase requires upfront data collection but enables better initialization. The PIDM pretraining introduces a supervised learning step that may not generalize perfectly to all tasks.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance may indicate: insufficient exploration leading to limited pretraining data, overfitting during PIDM training, or ineffective transfer of pretrained weights to actor-critic networks. Monitoring pretraining loss and early RL performance can identify issues.

First Experiments:
1. Verify that PIDM training loss decreases with training and that the model can reconstruct actions from states
2. Test weight transfer by evaluating the pretrained policy on a simple task without RL fine-tuning
3. Compare sample efficiency of the full pipeline against random initialization on a single environment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are limited to simulated environments and may not directly transfer to real robots
- Comparison only against random initialization, not against other state-of-the-art pretraining methods
- Computational overhead of additional pretraining stages not addressed

## Confidence
- Simulated-only validation: Medium
- Performance improvements vs baseline: Medium
- Generalizability to other robot types: Low
- Real-world applicability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Validate the method on a real physical robot to assess transfer from simulation to reality
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contribution of each pretraining stage
3. Compare against contemporary pretraining approaches in reinforcement learning to establish relative effectiveness
