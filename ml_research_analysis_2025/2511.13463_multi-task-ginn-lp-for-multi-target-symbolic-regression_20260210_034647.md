# Multi-task GINN-LP for Multi-target Symbolic Regression

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.13463
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13463
- **Reference count:** 34
- **Primary result:** Achieves MAE=0.71, RMSE=1.06 on Energy Efficiency and MAE=0.33, RMSE=0.45 on Sustainable Agriculture datasets while producing interpretable symbolic equations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MTRGINN-LP, a multi-task symbolic regression framework that extends the GINN-LP architecture with multi-task deep learning capabilities. The method uses a shared backbone of power-term approximator blocks (PABs) to learn common nonlinear transformations across multiple target variables, while task-specific output layers predict individual targets. A symbolic consistency loss ensures the learned neural representations can be accurately extracted as interpretable mathematical expressions. Experiments on Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Agriculture datasets demonstrate competitive predictive performance alongside high-quality symbolic equation extraction.

## Method Summary
MTRGINN-LP uses a shared backbone of Power-term Approximator Blocks (PABs) that learn multivariate Laurent polynomial terms through log-exp transformations. Each PAB computes p = ∏x_i^{w_i} where weights w_i are learned parameters. The shared backbone is followed by task-specific output layers that compute final predictions as linear combinations of PAB outputs: ŷ_t = b_t + Σ w_{t,k}·p_k. A growing network strategy automatically increases PAB count during training to adapt model complexity. The total loss combines task prediction error, symbolic consistency loss, and L1/L2 regularization: L = MSE(y,ŷ) + λ_sym·MSE(y,ŷ_sym) + λ_L1·||w||_1 + λ_L2·||w||_2².

## Key Results
- On Energy Efficiency dataset: MAE=0.71, RMSE=1.06
- On Sustainable Agriculture dataset: MAE=0.33, RMSE=0.45
- Ablation study shows symbolic loss is critical: removing it causes MAE to jump from 0.41 to 30.81 on extracted equations
- Performance improves with more PABs up to ~8 blocks, then plateaus
- Extracted symbolic equations maintain high predictive accuracy while providing interpretable relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Integrating symbolic regression with multi-task deep learning can capture inter-target dependencies and improve generalization, provided the targets share underlying functional building blocks.
- **Mechanism:** MTRGINN-LP uses a shared backbone of Power-term Approximator Blocks (PABs) that learn common nonlinear transformations (multivariate Laurent polynomial terms) from the input. Task-specific output layers then learn unique linear combinations of these shared terms to predict each target.
- **Core assumption:** The multiple target variables have some underlying relationship to the input features that can be expressed using a common set of multiplicative and power-law terms.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability."
  - [section IV.D.1] "the learned symbolic equations reveal that both targets share a similar structural form but differ in the magnitude and direction of the coefficients..."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific multi-task mechanism in symbolic regression.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A growing network architecture can automatically discover an appropriate model complexity, reducing the risk of overfitting compared to a fixed, large architecture.
- **Mechanism:** The model starts with a small number of PABs and periodically adds new, randomly initialized blocks at predefined epoch intervals, while retaining previously trained parameters.
- **Core assumption:** The optimal number of PABs is not known beforehand and a gradual, adaptive growth strategy is more effective at finding it than starting with a fixed network.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section III.C] "the model adopts a periodic growth strategy that automatically increases the number of PABs at predefined epoch intervals while retaining previously trained parameters. This strategy mitigates potential overfitting..."
  - [section IV.D.1, Figure 4] "Across all settings, increasing the maximum number of PABs consistently improves performance... [but] the performance gains become less pronounced beyond a certain point (e.g., after 8 max blocks)..."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for this specific growing mechanism in symbolic regression.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A symbolic consistency loss is the critical component for ensuring the learned neural representation can be extracted into a meaningful and accurate symbolic equation.
- **Mechanism:** During training, the model computes a "symbolic prediction" from the learned PAB weights. A symbolic loss (L_sym) is then calculated as the Mean Squared Error between the neural network's prediction and this symbolic prediction.
- **Core assumption:** Without this explicit constraint, a standard neural network's internal representation, even if predictive, will not map cleanly to a concise, human-readable equation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section IV.D.3 Ablation Study] "MTRGINN-LP (Eq.) without SL suffers a dramatic performance drop (Avg. MAE from 0.41 to 30.81)... These results suggest that the symbolic loss is crucial for extracting meaningful and accurate symbolic representations."
  - [Algorithm 1] "Compute symbolic prediction ŷ^sym... Compute consistency loss: L_sym... Compute total loss: L = L_task + λ_sym·L_sym..."
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence for this specific consistency loss mechanism.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-task Learning (MTL)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core paradigm of the paper. Understanding MTL—learning shared representations for multiple tasks—is essential to grasp how MTRGINN-LP differs from training independent models for each target.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the primary architectural difference between a multi-task learning model and a set of independent single-task models?

- **Concept: Laurent Polynomial**
  - **Why needed here:** The GINN-LP architecture is fundamentally designed to discover equations of this form. You must understand that a Laurent polynomial allows for both positive and negative exponents (e.g., x^{-1}, x^{2}), which distinguishes it from a standard polynomial.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the key difference between a Laurent polynomial and a standard polynomial?

- **Concept: Power-term Approximator Block (PAB)**
  - **Why needed here:** The PAB is the fundamental building block of the entire architecture. Understanding how it uses logarithmic and exponential activations to approximate a single power-law term like x_1^{w_1} x_2^{w_2} is crucial for understanding the model's composition.
  - **Quick check question:** What mathematical functions does a PAB use to transform input features into a power-law term?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input -> Shared PABs -> Task-specific linear combination -> Prediction
- **Critical path:** Input -> Shared PABs -> Task-specific linear combination -> Prediction. The most critical training path is the backpropagation of the total loss, especially the symbolic loss (L_sym), which shapes the PAB weights into an interpretable form.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - # of PABs vs. Interpretability: More PABs increase model capacity and accuracy but lead to longer, more complex final equations, reducing interpretability. The paper finds an optimum around 6-8 PABs for its datasets.
  - Symbolic Loss Weight (λ_sym): This is the key tuning knob. Too low, and the extracted equation fails. Too high, and it may hurt predictive performance. The paper uses 1e-2.
  - Functional Constraint: The model is inherently limited to discovering relationships expressible as linear combinations of power-law terms. It cannot find relationships requiring other functions (e.g., sine, logistic) directly.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Symbolic equation has high error: This is the signature of a missing or under-weighted symbolic loss (λ_sym ≈ 0). The ablation study shows this failure mode clearly.
  - Model underfits: The maximum number of PABs is set too low, or the growth interval is too long, preventing the model from learning complex relationships.
  - Model overfits: The growth interval is too short, or early stopping is not used effectively, leading to an unnecessarily large number of PABs that fit noise.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check with Synthetic Data: Generate data from a known multi-target Laurent polynomial. Train MTRGINN-LP and verify it recovers the correct equation and achieves near-zero error.
  2. Ablation of Symbolic Loss: On a real dataset, train one model with L_sym and one without. Compare the predictive error of the extracted equations (not the neural network) to quantify the value of the symbolic loss.
  3. Hyperparameter Scan for Model Capacity: On a new dataset, run a sweep over different initial and maximum numbers of PABs. Plot the final Avg. MAE to find the "sweet spot" where performance plateaus.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Question:** Can extending the Power-term Approximator Blocks (PABs) to support non-exponential functions (e.g., trigonometric, logarithmic) improve the recovery of symbolic expressions for physical phenomena?
- **Question:** Does replacing the uniform PAB structure with heterogeneous or dynamically adaptive blocks enhance the model's ability to capture diverse data patterns?
- **Question:** How does MTRGINN-LP performance scale regarding computational cost and negative transfer as the number of output targets (M) increases significantly?

## Limitations
- The method is inherently limited to discovering relationships expressible as Laurent polynomials and cannot find relationships requiring other mathematical functions like trigonometric or logistic terms.
- The approach's effectiveness on problems with more than two targets remains untested, as experiments were limited to datasets with exactly two targets.
- The growing network strategy's hyperparameters (initial PAB count, growth interval, max PABs) are not fully specified and may require extensive tuning for different datasets.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The ablation study conclusively demonstrates the symbolic loss is essential for extracting accurate symbolic equations from the neural network.
- **Medium Confidence:** The performance metrics (MAE, RMSE) are reported with sufficient detail, but the results are based on only two datasets with specific characteristics.
- **Low Confidence:** The paper lacks explicit comparisons against strong baselines for multi-target symbolic regression, making it difficult to assess the approach's relative performance.

## Next Checks
1. Test MTRGINN-LP on a synthetic multi-target dataset with known Laurent polynomial relationships and more than 2 targets to verify the method scales beyond the reported cases.
2. Perform an ablation study comparing MTRGINN-LP against both independent single-task GINN-LP models and strong multi-task regression baselines (like MT-DNN) without symbolic constraints to quantify the benefit of the multi-task architecture.
3. Evaluate the method's robustness by deliberately introducing noise or outliers into the training data and measuring the impact on both predictive accuracy and symbolic equation stability.
