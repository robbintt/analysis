# PERM EQ x GRAPH EQ: Equivariant Neural Networks for Quantum Molecular Learning

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Graph Permutationally Equivariant QML demonstrates superior generalizability for molecular energy and force prediction compared to non-equivariant approaches

## Executive Summary
This study compares geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) models for molecular energy and force prediction on LiH and NH3 datasets. Four methods are evaluated: Rotationally Equivariant QML, Non-Equivariant QML, Graph Permutationally Equivariant QML, and a classical equivariant neural network. The models employ a two-phase training approach with energy optimization followed by force gradient inclusion. Results demonstrate that equivariant models significantly outperform non-equivariant approaches, with Graph Permutationally Equivariant QML showing superior generalizability across folds while maintaining competitive absolute accuracy.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates four molecular learning approaches using 5-fold cross-validation on PSI4-generated quantum chemistry data for LiH and NH3 molecules. All methods use a two-phase training strategy: initial energy-only optimization (200 epochs) followed by force gradient inclusion (200 epochs). The Graph Permutationally Equivariant QML model encodes molecular graphs using Rx rotations for node features and exp(-iγH_G) for edge features, maintaining permutational equivariance through the Graph Hamiltonian. Models are evaluated using R², MAE, and RMSE metrics, with generalizability assessed via Coefficient of Variation (CoV = σ/μ) across folds. A post-correction step applies quadratic fitting for energies and linear fitting for forces.

## Key Results
- Graph Permutationally Equivariant QML achieves the best generalizability for both molecules, with significantly lower Coefficient of Variation across folds
- Classical equivariant neural network achieves the best absolute performance for LiH but shows higher variance across folds
- Non-Equivariant QML consistently underperforms all equivariant models by substantial margins
- Graph Permutationally Equivariant QML nearly matches classical model performance for NH3 while using far fewer parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of equivariant models stems from their ability to respect the fundamental symmetries of molecular systems. By maintaining rotational and permutational equivariance through the quantum encoding, these models avoid learning spurious correlations that violate physical symmetries. The two-phase training approach allows the model to first learn the energy landscape before incorporating the more challenging force gradients. The post-correction step effectively accounts for systematic biases in the quantum predictions, improving final accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Molecular Graph Representation**: Molecules are represented as graphs where nodes are atoms and edges are bonds, enabling natural encoding of molecular topology. Why needed: Captures connectivity patterns essential for chemical properties. Quick check: Verify node degrees match atomic valences.
- **Geometric Equivariance**: Models maintain invariance to rotations and translations of the molecular coordinate system. Why needed: Physical properties must be independent of molecular orientation. Quick check: Rotate input geometries and verify output consistency.
- **Quantum Circuit Encoding**: Molecular features are encoded into quantum states through parameterized rotations and entangling gates. Why needed: Quantum circuits can naturally represent complex correlations in molecular systems. Quick check: Verify unitary transformations preserve probability normalization.
- **Two-Phase Training**: Initial energy-only training followed by force gradient inclusion. Why needed: Forces are more challenging to learn than energies due to their directional nature. Quick check: Compare loss curves between phases to ensure smooth transition.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input features → Feature encoding (Rx, H_G) → Quantum circuit (rotations/layers) → Measurement → Post-correction

**Critical Path**: The most sensitive components are the feature encoding stage and the singlet initialization, as errors here propagate through the entire quantum circuit and break equivariance properties.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Classical models offer superior parameter efficiency and training stability but lack the native quantum representation. QML models capture quantum correlations more naturally but require careful initialization and training management. The Graph Permutationally Equivariant approach balances equivariance requirements with computational efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Training divergence typically occurs when force gradients are introduced too early, or when equivariant encoding is incorrectly implemented. Poor generalizability manifests as high Coefficient of Variation across folds, indicating overfitting to specific molecular configurations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify rotational invariance by training on rotated versions of the same molecule
2. Compare training curves between energy-only and energy+force phases
3. Test model performance on out-of-distribution molecular geometries

## Next Checks
1. Verify equivariant encoding implementation by testing rotational invariance of learned representations on rotated molecular geometries
2. Compare training stability between energy-only and energy+force phases to confirm the two-phase approach necessity
3. Test generalizability by training on LiH and evaluating on NH3 (or vice versa) to assess cross-molecule transfer capability
