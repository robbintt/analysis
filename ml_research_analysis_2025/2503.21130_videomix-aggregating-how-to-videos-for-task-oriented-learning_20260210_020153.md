# VideoMix: Aggregating How-To Videos for Task-Oriented Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.21130
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21130

- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: System aggregates how-to videos to help users learn tasks more efficiently by extracting outcomes, requirements, approaches, and details

## Executive Summary
VideoMix is a system designed to enhance task-oriented learning by aggregating information from multiple how-to videos. Through a formative study, the authors identified that learners seek four key types of information: outcomes, requirements, approaches/methods, and details. The system employs a Vision-Language Model pipeline to extract this information and presents it in a structured interface organized by outcomes, approaches, steps, methods, and details. This enables users to explore different approaches, view relevant video snippets, and access tips and notes.

A user study with 12 participants demonstrated that VideoMix enabled users to gain a more comprehensive understanding of tasks with greater efficiency compared to a baseline video interface. The Dynamic Approach Identification module captured 80% of possible approaches compared to 58% for baseline methods, while maintaining step accuracy. Participants valued the ability to tailor their learning experience and easily compare multiple perspectives on the same task.

## Method Summary
VideoMix uses a Vision-Language Model pipeline to extract structured information from how-to videos. The system identifies and aggregates four key information types: outcomes, requirements, approaches/methods, and details. The extracted information is presented in an interface organized by outcomes, approaches, steps, methods, and details. Users can explore different approaches, view relevant video snippets, and access tips and notes. The technical pipeline includes a Dynamic Approach Identification module that improves approach extraction compared to baseline methods.

## Key Results
- User study (N=12) showed VideoMix enabled more comprehensive task understanding with greater efficiency than baseline video interface
- Dynamic Approach Identification module captured 80% of possible approaches vs 58% for baseline methods
- Step accuracy was maintained while improving approach identification
- Participants appreciated ability to tailor learning experience and compare multiple perspectives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
VideoMix works by addressing the key challenge of information fragmentation across multiple how-to videos. By using Vision-Language Models to systematically extract and organize task-related information (outcomes, requirements, approaches, and details), the system creates a comprehensive knowledge base that users can navigate efficiently. The structured presentation allows learners to quickly identify different approaches and methods, access relevant video segments, and understand the full scope of a task without watching multiple complete videos.

## Foundational Learning

**Vision-Language Models** - AI models that can process both visual and textual information
*Why needed:* Essential for extracting structured information from video content
*Quick check:* Model correctly identifies task steps and objects in video frames

**Information Aggregation** - Process of combining information from multiple sources
*Why needed:* Single videos often lack complete task coverage
*Quick check:* System captures all major approaches and methods for a task

**Task-Oriented Learning** - Learning focused on acquiring skills to complete specific tasks
*Why needed:* Understanding how users learn from instructional videos
*Quick check:* Interface supports exploration of different approaches and methods

**Dynamic Approach Identification** - Technique for discovering multiple ways to accomplish a task
*Why needed:* Tasks often have multiple valid approaches
*Quick check:* System identifies at least 80% of known approaches for a task

**Structured Information Presentation** - Organizing extracted information in a user-friendly format
*Why needed:* Raw video content is difficult to navigate efficiently
*Quick check:* Users can quickly find specific information types they need

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Vision-Language Model Pipeline -> Information Extraction -> Structured Organization -> User Interface

**Critical Path:** Video input → Vision-Language Model processing → Information extraction (outcomes, requirements, approaches, details) → Structured organization → User interface presentation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system prioritizes comprehensive approach identification over perfect step accuracy, accepting some trade-off in step precision to capture more diverse methods. The structured interface sacrifices some natural video flow for improved information accessibility and comparison capabilities.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor video quality or unclear instruction may lead to incomplete or inaccurate information extraction. Highly variable task procedures may result in fragmented approach identification. The system may struggle with tasks requiring specialized domain knowledge not captured in training data.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test Vision-Language Model on sample videos to verify basic information extraction capability 2) Evaluate approach identification module on tasks with known multiple methods 3) Conduct user testing with simple tasks to validate interface usability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small user study sample size (N=12) limits generalizability across diverse learning preferences and task domains
- Technical evaluation focuses on approach identification without comprehensive ground truth annotation for all extracted information types
- System performance on videos with varying production quality and instructional clarity not thoroughly evaluated
- Potential biases in Vision-Language Model outputs not addressed
- Performance on standardized versus highly variable task procedures not compared

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Formative study findings about learner information needs (outcomes, requirements, approaches, details) are well-supported by the research methodology

**Medium confidence:** User study results showing efficiency gains are promising but limited by small sample size (N=12)

**Medium confidence:** Technical performance metrics for approach identification (80% vs 58%) are specific but not comprehensive across all information types

**Low confidence:** Generalizability across different task domains and video qualities due to limited evaluation scope

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a larger-scale user study (N≥30) across multiple task domains with varying complexity levels to validate learning efficiency claims and assess domain-specific performance differences

2. Perform comprehensive ground truth annotation of extracted information across all five information types to establish more robust technical accuracy metrics beyond just approach identification

3. Evaluate system performance on videos with varying production quality, instructional clarity, and presenter styles to understand robustness to real-world video heterogeneity
