# Transformer-Based Person Identification via Wi-Fi CSI Amplitude and Phase Perturbations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.12854
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12854
- Reference count: 25
- Method achieves 99.82% classification accuracy on static person identification using Wi-Fi CSI

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a transformer-based method for person identification using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) in fully static, device-free conditions. The approach leverages subtle amplitude and phase perturbations in CSI signals, which are influenced by individual anatomical characteristics, even when the subject remains motionless. A custom dataset of CSI data was collected using low-cost ESP32 devices from six participants across multiple orientations in a controlled indoor environment. A preprocessing pipeline enhances signal quality through outlier removal, smoothing, and phase calibration. The proposed dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities separately, achieving 99.82% classification accuracy on the test set. This outperforms convolutional and MLP baselines, demonstrating the discriminative potential of CSI for passive biometric identification and validating the viability of RF-based person identification using commodity Wi-Fi hardware.

## Method Summary
The method involves collecting CSI amplitude and phase data from 52 subcarriers at 100 Hz using two ESP32 devices positioned 3 meters apart. Six participants stand 1.5 meters from both antennas in six different orientations for 150 seconds each. The preprocessing pipeline applies temporal mean reduction, Hampel filtering for outlier removal, 5th-order Butterworth low-pass filtering at 10 Hz, and linear phase calibration to remove hardware-induced distortions. A dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase separately with shared hyperparameters (dmodel=32, 4 attention heads, dff=64, 1 encoder layer). Mean pooling across the temporal dimension produces fixed-length representations that are late-fused for classification. The model is trained with Adam optimizer (lr=0.001), batch size 32, cross-entropy loss, and early stopping (patience=10) for up to 50 epochs.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.82% classification accuracy on test set with 6 participants
- Outperforms MLP and CNN baselines across all metrics (precision, recall, F1)
- Dual-branch architecture provides significant improvement over single-modality approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Static human bodies produce person-specific CSI distortions that are sufficiently discriminative for identification
- Mechanism: Wi-Fi signals interact with human anatomy through absorption, reflection, and diffraction. Individual physiological characteristics (organ arrangement, tissue composition, water content) modulate this interaction, creating unique amplitude and phase perturbations even without subject motion
- Core assumption: Anatomical differences across individuals are large enough relative to hardware/environmental noise to yield stable, repeatable biometric signatures
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal"
  - [page 2]: "Recent findings suggest that the propagation of Wi-Fi signals through the human body is modulated by subject-specific internal factors, including the anatomical arrangement of organs, tissue composition, and water content"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct validation—related papers (WhoFi, HandPass, WiWho) focus on dynamic identification via gait or gestures; corpus lacks independent confirmation of static biometric mechanisms
- Break condition: If anatomical variations produce CSI perturbations smaller than environmental/hardware noise floor, discriminative power collapses

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Processing amplitude and phase in separate transformer branches captures complementary biometric information better than joint processing
- Mechanism: Amplitude encodes signal attenuation patterns (related to body absorption/reflection), while phase encodes propagation delay and scattering information. Separate attention pathways allow each modality to learn distinct temporal and cross-subcarrier dependencies before late fusion
- Core assumption: Biometric signatures manifest differently across amplitude and phase domains, with meaningful information preserved through independent encoding
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities separately and achieves 99.82% classification accuracy"
  - [page 5]: Architecture diagram (Fig. 3) shows parallel encoding streams with separate attention mechanisms
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus comparison of single-branch vs. dual-branch for CSI biometrics; gap in validation
- Break condition: If amplitude and phase carry highly redundant or inversely correlated information, dual-branch overhead provides no benefit

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Aggressive preprocessing is required to expose subtle biometric signatures beneath dominant hardware and environmental artifacts
- Mechanism: Raw CSI contains hardware-induced phase errors (CFO, SFO), amplitude outliers, and high-frequency noise. Hampel filtering removes outliers, Butterworth low-pass filtering suppresses high-frequency noise, and linear phase calibration corrects frequency-dependent distortions—collectively revealing biometric perturbations
- Core assumption: Biometric signatures occupy lower-frequency bands and survive the filtering pipeline; preprocessing removes noise without destroying discriminative features
- Evidence anchors:
  - [page 4]: Hampel filter with MAD-based outlier detection; Butterworth filter 5th order, 10 Hz cutoff
  - [page 4]: Phase calibration via linear regression removes CFO/SFO artifacts
  - [page 6-7]: Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show before/after preprocessing; Fig. 6 shows clear amplitude pattern differences between empty room and person present
  - [corpus]: Consistent with STAR and other Wi-Fi sensing papers requiring CSI denoising; preprocessing approaches are standard but parameter choices vary
- Break condition: If biometric signatures exist in filtered frequency bands or are as transient as outliers, preprocessing destroys discriminative information

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Channel State Information (CSI) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: CSI provides per-subcarrier amplitude and phase measurements that encode how the wireless channel modifies transmitted signals, forming the raw biometric input
  - Quick check question: Given Y = HX + η, explain what H represents and why extracting both amplitude and phase from H yields richer information than RSSI alone.

- Concept: Transformer self-attention for time-series
  - Why needed here: The architecture uses multi-head self-attention to model dependencies across time steps and subcarriers without convolution or recurrence
  - Quick check question: For input H ∈ R^(W×dmodel), describe how self-attention computes Q, K, V projections and why √dmodel scaling prevents gradient issues.

- Concept: Phase calibration for RF sensing
  - Why needed here: Raw CSI phase is corrupted by hardware offsets; without calibration, phase-based features are unreliable for biometric identification
  - Quick check question: Explain why CFO and SFO cause linear phase distortion across subcarriers and how Equation (11) removes this artifact.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - CSI acquisition (100 Hz) -> temporal mean reduction -> Hampel filtering (window=15, β=3) -> Butterworth denoising (10 Hz cutoff) -> phase calibration -> sliding windows (100 packets, 50% overlap) -> dual transformer encoding -> mean pooling -> late fusion -> softmax classification

- Critical path: CSI acquisition (100 Hz) -> temporal mean reduction -> Hampel filtering (window=15, β=3) -> Butterworth denoising (10 Hz cutoff) -> phase calibration -> sliding windows (100 packets, 50% overlap) -> dual transformer encoding -> mean pooling -> late fusion -> softmax classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single transformer layer: Lightweight (enables low-cost ESP32 deployment) but may limit capacity for complex biometric patterns
  - Mean pooling vs. [CLS] token: Paper tested [CLS] and found slight performance drop; simpler averaging retained
  - Separate modality branches: Enables independent feature learning but prevents early cross-modality interactions
  - Small dataset (6 subjects): Controlled evaluation but generalization claims require validation at scale

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy drops to ~94% (MLP baseline level): Temporal modeling not contributing—check attention weights or positional encoding
  - Training converges, validation diverges: Overfitting to environment-specific reflections; increase dropout or reduce model capacity
  - Phase branch underperforms amplitude: Phase calibration failing—verify linear regression is correctly applied per packet
  - Performance collapses on new room: Model learned room geometry, not person biometrics; need environment augmentation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Preprocessing ablation**: Train with Hampel only, Butterworth only, no phase calibration—identify which components are strictly necessary
  2. **Single-branch comparison**: Train amplitude-only and phase-only models to quantify modality contribution and validate dual-branch necessity
  3. **Cross-session generalization**: Collect new data with same subjects on different day/time; test whether model generalizes or requires retraining

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Scalability to larger populations**: Can the high classification accuracy be maintained when scaling the system to a significantly larger and more demographically diverse population? The current validation relies on a dataset of only six subjects, which limits the statistical power regarding the uniqueness of the extracted biometric signatures.

- **Environmental generalization**: How well does the model generalize across different physical environments and hardware configurations without retraining? The study was conducted in a single, controlled indoor environment using specific ESP32 hardware, potentially overfitting the model to specific multipath profiles.

- **Long-term stability**: Do the CSI-based biometric signatures remain stable over extended periods (e.g., days or weeks) despite natural physiological variations? The current dataset involves short acquisition windows (2.5 minutes per orientation), leaving the stability of the "inherent" body-induced signal distortions over time unproven.

## Limitations

- Small subject pool (6 participants) limits generalizability and statistical confidence
- Single-environment evaluation prevents assessment of environmental robustness
- No public dataset or code available for independent replication
- ESP32-specific CSI extraction pipeline not fully specified

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (anatomical CSI modulation): **Medium** - plausible theoretical foundation but lacks independent empirical validation for static identification
- Mechanism 2 (dual-branch superiority): **Low** - no direct comparison with single-branch alternatives provided
- Mechanism 3 (preprocessing necessity): **High** - consistent with established CSI signal processing literature

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study with 10-15 subjects in multiple environments to assess scalability and environmental robustness
2. Conduct adversarial testing with clothing variations, temporary physical changes, and signal interference to evaluate security
3. Perform ablation studies on preprocessing parameters to determine the minimum viable pipeline that maintains performance
