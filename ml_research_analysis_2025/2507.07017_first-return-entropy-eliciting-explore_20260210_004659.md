# First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07017
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07017

- Primary result: FR3E improves LLM reasoning stability and correctness on AIME24 by targeting high-uncertainty decision points via entropy-eliciting exploration.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models by addressing the problem of unstable exploration in RLVR. FR3E identifies high-uncertainty decision points in reasoning trajectories through token-wise entropy analysis and performs targeted rollouts from these points to construct semantically grounded intermediate feedback. This approach provides targeted guidance without relying on dense supervision. The method is validated on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, showing that FR3E promotes more stable training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the proportion of fully correct trajectories compared to baseline methods like GRPO++.

## Method Summary
FR3E operates by analyzing token-wise entropy in reasoning trajectories to identify high-uncertainty decision points. From these points, the framework performs targeted rollouts to generate intermediate feedback that is semantically grounded. This approach addresses the challenge of unstable exploration in RLVR by focusing on critical decision junctures rather than relying on dense supervision signals. The first-return mechanism ensures that rollouts are efficiently terminated upon reaching terminal states, while entropy-eliciting exploration prioritizes trajectories through uncertain regions of the reasoning space.

## Key Results
- FR3E demonstrates improved training stability compared to GRPO++ on mathematical reasoning tasks
- The method produces longer, more coherent reasoning responses on AIME24
- FR3E increases the proportion of fully correct trajectories in mathematical reasoning benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FR3E leverages token-wise entropy to identify decision points where the model's uncertainty is highest, indicating critical junctures in reasoning trajectories. By focusing exploration and feedback generation on these points, the method provides targeted guidance where it's most needed. The first-return mechanism ensures efficient rollout termination, preventing wasted computation on unpromising paths. This combination allows FR3E to construct intermediate feedback that is both semantically meaningful and computationally efficient, addressing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Token-wise entropy analysis**: Measures uncertainty at each token prediction; needed to identify high-uncertainty decision points; quick check: verify entropy values correlate with actual prediction difficulty
- **Reinforcement learning with value regularization (RLVR)**: Framework for training LLMs through reward-based feedback; needed as the underlying training paradigm; quick check: confirm reward signals properly guide reasoning
- **Intermediate feedback construction**: Generation of guidance signals between initial and final states; needed to provide targeted training signals; quick check: validate feedback improves trajectory quality
- **Rollout-based exploration**: Sampling trajectories from decision points; needed to evaluate alternative reasoning paths; quick check: measure rollout diversity and relevance
- **Uncertainty quantification in sequence generation**: Assessing model confidence in token predictions; needed to prioritize exploration; quick check: compare entropy with other uncertainty metrics
- **Semantic grounding of feedback**: Ensuring feedback reflects meaningful reasoning steps; needed for effective learning; quick check: human evaluation of feedback quality

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Observation -> Entropy Analysis -> Decision Point Selection -> Rollout Generation -> Intermediate Feedback -> Value Update -> Policy Improvement
**Critical path**: Token prediction → entropy calculation → high-uncertainty point identification → targeted rollout → feedback integration → policy update
**Design tradeoffs**: FR3E trades computational efficiency for targeted exploration by focusing on high-uncertainty points rather than dense supervision, potentially missing important transitions with low entropy but high reward impact
**Failure signatures**: If entropy fails to identify true decision points, the method may waste rollouts on unimportant regions; overly conservative entropy thresholds may miss critical transitions; if rollouts don't capture meaningful alternatives, feedback quality degrades
**First experiments**:
1. Verify entropy values correlate with actual reasoning difficulty on a small validation set
2. Test the sensitivity of results to entropy threshold selection
3. Compare rollout efficiency and quality against baseline random exploration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- FR3E is validated only on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24), leaving generalization to other domains uncertain
- The method depends on token-wise entropy as an uncertainty proxy, which may not reliably identify high-uncertainty decision points in all reasoning contexts
- Limited comparison against baseline methods, with only GRPO++ evaluated, restricting assessment of relative performance improvements

## Confidence
**High**: Claims about improved stability, longer and more coherent responses, and increased proportion of fully correct trajectories are supported by experimental results on AIME24. The methodological framing and approach appear technically sound within the scope of mathematical reasoning tasks.

**Medium**: The effectiveness of token-wise entropy as a general uncertainty signal for diverse reasoning problems. The claim that FR3E provides "targeted guidance without relying on dense supervision" is plausible but not thoroughly validated across tasks or models.

**Low**: Generalizability to non-mathematical reasoning domains and the robustness of entropy-eliciting exploration in noisy or sparse-reward environments.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate FR3E on non-mathematical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., coding, commonsense QA) to test domain generalizability
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the effects of first-return vs. entropy-eliciting mechanisms
3. Compare FR3E against a broader set of RL baselines (e.g., PPO, PPO+) and alternative uncertainty quantification methods
