core_contribution: This paper introduces intensionality statements, a generalization
  of the concept of extensional and intensional predicates that allows for more refined
  splitting of logic programs. By associating each predicate with a formula that specifies
  when it is considered intensional, the authors refine the dependency graph used
  for splitting to include not only predicate dependencies but also their arguments
  and context.

# Splitting Answer Set Programs with respect to Intensionality Statements (Extended Version)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.19762
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19762
- Authors: Jorge Fandinno; Yuliya Lierler
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces intensionality statements to enable more refined splitting of logic programs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to splitting answer set programs by introducing intensionality statements, which generalize the concept of extensional and intensional predicates. The authors develop a framework that associates each predicate with a formula specifying when it is considered intensional, allowing for more refined splitting of logic programs. This approach addresses limitations in previous splitting methods, particularly for programs that cannot be split using traditional techniques.

The paper provides a new Splitting Theorem for arbitrary theories and establishes sufficient conditions for its applicability. The authors demonstrate their approach through an example involving a blocks world program, showing how it can be split into subprograms based on time points - a task not possible under previous splitting methods. This work extends the theoretical foundations of answer set programming and offers practical benefits for program analysis and optimization.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce intensionality statements as a generalization of the concept of extensional and intensional predicates. By associating each predicate with a formula that specifies when it is considered intensional, they refine the dependency graph used for splitting to include not only predicate dependencies but also their arguments and context. This refined approach allows for splitting programs that were previously considered non-splittable. The paper proves a new Splitting Theorem for arbitrary theories and provides sufficient conditions for its applicability, generalizing previous results for disjunctive programs.

## Key Results
- Introduces intensionality statements to generalize extensional and intensional predicates
- Develops a refined dependency graph that includes predicate arguments and context
- Proves a new Splitting Theorem for arbitrary theories with sufficient conditions for applicability
- Demonstrates the approach on a blocks world program, showing splittable time-based subprograms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by extending the traditional concept of predicate intensionality. Instead of classifying predicates as simply extensional or intensional, the authors associate each predicate with a formula that defines its intensionality in context. This allows the splitting algorithm to consider not just which predicates depend on each other, but also when and how they depend on each other based on their arguments and the program context. The refined dependency graph captures these nuanced relationships, enabling more sophisticated splitting that respects the logical structure of the program while still producing independent subprograms.

  - Quick check: Understand the conditions and implications of the Splitting Theorem

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Answer Set Program -> Intensionality Statements -> Refined Dependency Graph -> Splitting Algorithm -> Independent Subprograms

Critical Path:
1. Input program analysis to identify predicates and their dependencies
2. Generation of intensionality statements for each predicate
3. Construction of refined dependency graph incorporating intensionality information
4. Application of splitting algorithm using the new Splitting Theorem
5. Output of independent subprograms for further analysis or execution

Design Tradeoffs:
- Precision vs. Complexity: More refined splitting increases precision but also computational complexity
- Generality vs. Applicability: The approach works for arbitrary theories but may be overkill for simple programs
- Automation vs. Manual Specification: Intensionality statements can be inferred automatically or specified manually

Failure Signatures:
- Non-splittable programs: Some programs may still resist splitting even with intensionality statements
- Inconsistent intensionality: Conflicting intensionality statements can lead to incorrect splits
- Performance degradation: The additional complexity may slow down program execution

First Experiments:
1. Implement the splitting algorithm and test it on benchmark ASP programs
2. Compare the number and size of splits produced by traditional vs. intensionality-based methods
3. Measure the impact of splitting on program execution time and memory usage

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but potential areas for future research include:
- Developing automated techniques to infer appropriate intensionality statements from existing ASP programs
- Exploring the performance implications of using intensionality statements during program execution
- Investigating edge cases where the Splitting Theorem's conditions may fail in complex programs

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation on large-scale benchmarks
- Performance implications of using intensionality statements during program execution are not explored
- Potential edge cases in the generalization from disjunctive programs to arbitrary theories are not fully examined

## Confidence

High: The correctness of the Splitting Theorem for arbitrary theories
Medium: The practical benefits of using intensionality statements for program splitting
Low: Performance implications and edge case behavior in complex programs

## Next Checks

1. Implement a prototype solver incorporating intensionality statements and benchmark it against standard ASP solvers on programs that previously could not be split

2. Systematically test the Splitting Theorem on programs with non-stratified negation and cyclic dependencies to identify potential edge cases

3. Develop automated techniques to infer appropriate intensionality statements from existing ASP programs to facilitate practical adoption
