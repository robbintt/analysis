# DHAuDS: A Dynamic and Heterogeneous Audio Benchmark for Test-Time Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.18421
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18421
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: DHAuDS benchmark shows that low momentum (≤0.75) and binary learning rate strategy significantly improve test-time adaptation stability across 124 experiments spanning 50 evaluation criteria.

## Executive Summary
DHAuDS is a benchmark designed to evaluate Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for audio classification under realistic, dynamic, and heterogeneous domain shifts. Unlike existing benchmarks, DHAuDS simulates real-world acoustic variability by applying variable corruption intensities and mixing multiple noise types across four standardized datasets: UrbanSound8K-C, SpeechCommandsV2-C, VocalSound-C, and ReefSet-C. The study evaluates three audio classification models—HuBERT, AMAuT, and CoNMix++—using a unified TTA strategy combining entropy minimization and consistency loss. Results show that TTA consistently improves performance across all benchmarks, with AMAuT achieving the highest average adaptation improvement. The authors also recommend using low momentum (≤0.75) and a binary learning rate strategy to stabilize adaptation and mitigate post-improvement degradation.

## Method Summary
DHAuDS evaluates TTA by dynamically corrupting audio samples from four datasets using 27 noise types at varying intensities. The TTA objective combines entropy minimization (L_ens) and consistency loss (L_con) between temporally shifted views of the same sample. Models are updated during inference using SGD with momentum ≤0.75 and a binary learning rate strategy (lower rate for feature extractor, higher for classifier). The benchmark defines 14 evaluation criteria per dataset, resulting in 50 distinct criteria and 124 experiments. Performance is measured using ROC-AUC (ReefSet-C), F1-score (UrbanSound8K-C), and top-1 accuracy (SpeechCommandsV2-C, VocalSound-C).

## Key Results
- AMAuT achieved the highest average adaptation improvement across all benchmarks with 124 experiments spanning 50 evaluation criteria.
- Low momentum (≤0.75) significantly stabilized adaptation and reduced post-improvement degradation observed in high-momentum settings.
- Binary Learning Rate strategy (lr_fe ≤ lr_c) effectively sustained performance gains by balancing feature retention with classifier flexibility.
- Dynamic corruption severity exposed hidden model fragility that static benchmarks miss, forcing TTA to learn general robustness.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Low optimizer momentum (≤ 0.75) stabilizes Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) by preventing error accumulation in noisy gradient streams.
- **Mechanism:** In TTA, gradients are derived from unlabeled, potentially corrupted data. High momentum accumulates the velocity of past noisy updates, causing the model to overshoot optimal minima. Low momentum dampens this trajectory, reducing oscillation and preventing the "post-improvement degradation" often observed after the first epoch.
- **Core assumption:** The gradients estimated from single unlabeled test samples under corruption are high-variance and act as noisy approximations of the true gradient.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "Key findings include the benefits of low momentum (≤0.75)... for stabilizing adaptation." [section 5.1]: "...adopting a lower momentum value (≤0.75) stabilizes test-time adaptation, reducing the decline in performance that often follows early accuracy gains." [corpus]: [SloMo-Fast]: "SloMo-Fast: Slow-Momentum and Fast-Adaptive Teachers..." validates the efficacy of slow momentum in Continual TTA.
- **Break condition:** If the corruption type is static and homogeneous (e.g., fixed Gaussian noise), high momentum may converge faster without degradation, as the gradient noise floor is lower.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A Binary Learning Rate (BLR) strategy sustains performance by balancing feature retention with classifier flexibility.
- **Mechanism:** The architecture is split into a feature extractor (CNN-Transformer) and a classifier head. By setting the feature extractor learning rate lower than the classifier rate (lr_fe ≤ lr_c), the model preserves the robust, generalizable representations learned during pre-training while allowing the classifier to rapidly recalibrate decision boundaries to the new domain.
- **Core assumption:** The pre-trained feature extractor is sufficiently robust to capture meaningful information from the corrupted audio, requiring only fine-grained tuning rather than reconstruction.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.6]: "...applying a smaller learning rate to the feature extractor than to the classifier (lr_fe ≤ lr_c) helps sustain performance gains..." [section 5.1]: "...BLR strategy effectively mitigates post-improvement degradation..." [corpus]: [Corpus evidence is weak/missing]: Specifics on BLR are distinct to this paper's contribution, though general layer-wise learning rates are standard in transfer learning.
- **Break condition:** If the domain shift is extreme (e.g., transferring from speech to bioacoustics without pre-training), the feature extractor may be too rigid to adapt, causing underfitting.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Dynamic and heterogeneous corruption severity exposes "hidden" model fragility that static benchmarks miss.
- **Mechanism:** Real-world audio shift is non-stationary. By randomly sampling corruption intensity (e.g., SNR, pitch shift) and noise types per sample rather than fixing them, the benchmark prevents the model from overfitting to a specific noise profile during adaptation. This forces the TTA mechanism to learn general robustness rather than noise-specific compensation.
- **Core assumption:** Real-world acoustic degradation behaves as a stochastic combination of severity levels and noise sources.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "...corrupted with 27 noise types at varying intensities... fails to mimic real-world variability." [section 3.3]: "...corruption intensity is not fixed but randomly drawn from a defined range for each sample." [corpus]: [DATTA]: "Domain Diversity Aware Test-Time Adaptation..." supports the need to handle dynamic/multi-domain streams rather than fixed shifts.
- **Break condition:** If the evaluation goal is strictly to measure performance against a specific, known noise standard (e.g., a specific telecom compression codec), the stochasticity of DHAuDS adds variance that confounds isolating that specific failure mode.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper assumes the reader understands that TTA differs from fine-tuning because it occurs *during inference* without access to source data or target labels.
  - **Quick check question:** How does TTA update model weights without ground-truth labels during the test phase? (Answer: Using entropy minimization and consistency losses on the test sample itself).

- **Concept:** Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
  - **Why needed here:** The core of the benchmark's "dynamic" nature is varying SNR levels to simulate loudness vs. clarity trade-offs.
  - **Quick check question:** In the context of DHAuDS, does a lower SNR value indicate cleaner or more corrupted audio? (Answer: Lower SNR = more noise relative to signal = harder adaptation).

- **Concept:** Batch Normalization Statistics
  - **Why needed here:** The paper notes that models like AMAuT require batch sizes >32 to maintain stable performance, likely due to BatchNorm layers relying on accurate batch statistics.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a batch size of 1 fail for a model using BatchNorm during TTA? (Answer: BatchNorm calculates mean/variance over the batch; a batch of 1 has zero variance and unrepresentative statistics).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Audio (1-12s, 16-44.1kHz) -> Corruption Engine (Applies WHN, EN, TST, PSH) -> Hybrid CNN-Transformer (HuBERT/AMAuT) -> TTA Engine (Entropy + Consistency Loss) -> Updated Model

- **Critical path:**
  1. Corruption: Audio sample is corrupted dynamically (random SNR/Noise type).
  2. Augmentation: Create two views (x_l, x_r) via temporal shifting.
  3. Forward Pass: Pass both views; generate logits.
  4. Loss Calc: Compute Entropy Loss (minimize uncertainty) + Consistency Loss (minimize difference between views).
  5. Update: Apply gradients using BLR (lower LR for feature extractor, higher for classifier).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - CoNMix++ vs. HuBERT/AMAuT: CoNMix++ uses pseudo-labeling which is computationally expensive and showed minimal gain; HuBERT/AMAuT use entropy/consistency which is lighter and more stable in this benchmark.
  - Dynamic vs. Static Evaluation: Dynamic (L1/L2) offers realism but higher variance in results; Static offers easier debugging but less real-world relevance.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Memory Overflow: HuBERT on VS-C requires reducing batch size to 32.
  - Negative Adaptation: CoNMix++ on TST-L1 (ReefSet-C) showed performance decline even with stabilization techniques.
  - BatchNorm Collapse: Using batch size < 32 leads to unstable metric estimates.
  - Optimizer Drift: Using momentum > 0.90 causes accuracy to peak early and then degrade.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Stability Check: Run AMAuT on US8-C with High Momentum (0.9) vs. Low Momentum (0.7) to replicate the "post-improvement degradation" curve.
  2. BLR Ablation: Compare Single LR vs. Binary LR on a corrupted SpeechCommandsV2-C subset to verify the stabilizing effect on the classifier.
  3. Scale Test: Attempt to run HuBERT on VocalSound-C (VS-C). Observe GPU memory constraints and reduce batch size to the minimum stable threshold (32) to verify BatchNorm dependency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does scaling model capacity (e.g., utilizing HuBERT Large or X-Large) improve robustness and adaptation gains on the DHAuDS benchmark under severe corruption?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note in Section 6.1 and 6.2 that they only evaluated the "Base" version of HuBERT due to GPU constraints, leaving the potential benefits of larger variants unexplored.
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the failure to reach higher accuracy on sets like US8-C is a fundamental limitation of the TTA method or a result of the specific model capacity used.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Replicating the DHAuDS experiments using HuBERT Large/X-Large and comparing the performance delta against the Base model.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can alternative pre-training strategies or multi-domain feature encoders resolve the low-baseline accuracy issue specific to the UrbanSound8K-C benchmark?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 5.2 analyzes the "Silhouette Score" and concludes that the low non-corrupted baseline accuracy of US8 (0.78) is a likely cause for its poor TTA performance compared to other datasets.
- **Why unresolved:** The current study used CochlScene for pre-training, but the feature representations may still lack the robustness required for heterogeneous urban noise.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Training models on specifically curated urban acoustic datasets and measuring the resulting shift in baseline and adapted F1-scores on US8-C.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the performance of current TTA algorithms change when applied to audio domains outside the current benchmark, such as music, underwater recordings, or industrial machinery?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6.2 explicitly lists "music, underwater recordings, or industrial machinery" as potential expansions to extend the benchmark's utility for cross-domain studies.
- **Why unresolved:** The current benchmarks cover speech, environmental, and bioacoustic (reef) sounds, but it is unknown if the entropy-minimization strategies hold for the distinct spectral and temporal characteristics of music or machinery.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Constructing new corruption sets (e.g., Music-C) using the DHAuDS framework and evaluating the existing HuBERT and AMAuT pipelines.

## Limitations
- Binary Learning Rate (BLR) hyperparameters are reported as ranges rather than specific values, making exact reproduction difficult.
- Consistency loss weight λ is not specified in the paper.
- Batch size constraints for HuBERT on larger datasets (limited to 32-33 on high-end GPUs) may affect metric stability and reproducibility.
- The paper focuses on audio classification, limiting generalizability to other modalities.
- Some failure modes (e.g., negative adaptation on TST-L1) are noted but not fully explained.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The core benchmark design (dynamic corruption with heterogeneous noise types) and its superiority over static benchmarks is well-supported by the 124 experiments across 50 criteria.
- **Medium confidence:** The specific claims about low momentum (≤0.75) and BLR effectiveness are supported by ablation studies but could benefit from broader hyperparameter sweeps.
- **Medium confidence:** The post-improvement degradation phenomenon is observed but the exact conditions triggering it need further characterization.

## Next Checks
1. Run momentum ablation studies (0.7 vs 0.9) on a representative subset to verify the stabilization claims and measure variance in the post-improvement degradation curve.
2. Test BLR with different lr_fe/lr_c ratios (including single LR as control) to confirm the optimal balance for sustaining performance gains.
3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the consistency loss weight λ across multiple corruption types to determine if the optimal value varies by domain or corruption severity.
