# Revealing Temporal Label Noise in Multimodal Hateful Video Classification

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04900

- This paper quantifies systematic temporal label noise in multimodal hateful video classification, showing that models trained on clean, segment-level labels significantly outperform those trained on noisy, video-level labels.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates temporal label noise in multimodal hateful video classification, where current video-level annotations often mislabel entire videos due to the localized nature of hate speech within longer clips. The authors extract temporally precise hate and non-hate segments from two datasets—HateMM and MultiHateClip-English—using timestamp annotations. They conduct multimodal analyses showing significant semantic overlap between segments from the same videos, indicating systematic rather than random noise. Controlled experiments reveal that models trained on clean, segment-level labels significantly outperform those trained on noisy, video-level labels, with macro F1 improvements of 19.34% and 30.45% on HateMM and MultiHateClip-English, respectively. These findings underscore the need for temporally aware detection models and improved annotation strategies.

## Method Summary
The authors extract "trimmed hate" segments (within timestamps) and "trimmed non-hate" segments (outside timestamps in hateful videos) from HateMM and MultiHateClip-English datasets. They process these clips using BERT (768-dim text), ViT (768-dim visual), and MFCC (40-dim audio) feature extractors. Models are trained using standard supervised learning with Adam optimizer (LR=1e-4, BS=16) and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. The key experiments compare models trained on clean segment-level labels versus noisy video-level labels, and test generalization from noisy to clean data.

## Key Results
- Hateful videos contain 33-59% non-hateful content by duration, with HateMM showing 58.64% trimmed non-hate segments by count
- Models trained on clean segment-level labels achieve macro F1 scores of 98.64% (HateMM) and 96.79% (MultiHateClip-English), outperforming noisy-trained models by 19.34% and 30.45% respectively
- UMAP visualizations show trimmed non-hate segments from hateful videos occupy intermediate semantic regions, overlapping with trimmed hate rather than clustering with genuinely non-hateful videos

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Video-level annotations introduce systematic (not random) label noise because hateful content is temporally localized within longer clips. When a video labeled "hateful" contains 33-59% non-hateful content by duration, models receive contradictory training signals—the same non-hateful visual/lexical features are sometimes associated with "hate" labels and sometimes with "non-hate" labels depending on which video they appear in.

### Mechanism 2
Semantic drift across temporal sequences causes trimmed non-hate segments to be semantically distinct from genuinely non-hateful videos, yet overlapping with trimmed hate segments. Hate speech expression exhibits contextual dependency and temporal continuity—transitions from neutral to hateful are gradual. Non-hate segments extracted from hateful videos retain contextual artifacts (speaker identity, topic, setting) that make them semantically intermediate.

### Mechanism 3
Label noise primarily disrupts decision boundary learning rather than representation learning. When trained on noisy video-level labels, models still learn reasonable embeddings (UMAP structure remains similar) but the classifier head receives confused supervisory signals, leading to uncertain predictions and frequent misclassifications on clean test data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for temporal label ambiguity
  - Why needed here: The paper frames video-level hate detection as a weak supervision problem—videos are "bags" containing both hateful and non-hateful "instances" (segments). MIL provides the theoretical framework for learning from such incomplete labels.
  - Quick check question: Given a bag labeled positive containing 10 instances, how would MIL assign blame/credit during training compared to standard supervised learning?

- Concept: Label noise types (systematic vs. random)
  - Why needed here: The paper argues temporal label noise is systematic—semantically correlated with content—rather than random. Systematic noise is harder to mitigate via simple resampling or regularization.
  - Quick check question: If you flipped 20% of labels via random coin flip vs. flipped labels only for videos mentioning specific topics, which would be easier for a model to handle and why?

- Concept: Macro F1 vs. accuracy for imbalanced classification
  - Why needed here: Hate detection datasets are typically imbalanced. The paper reports macro F1 improvements (19.34%, 30.45%) rather than accuracy because macro F1 weights both classes equally regardless of prevalence.
  - Quick check question: If a dataset has 90% non-hate and 10% hate videos, why might 90% accuracy be uninformative?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BERT (768-dim text) -> ViT (768-dim visual) -> MFCC (40-dim audio) -> Attention-based fusion -> Binary classifier
- Critical path: 1. Parse timestamp annotations to identify (start, end) pairs for hateful spans 2. Extract trimmed hate segments within timestamps; extract trimmed non-hate from remaining portions 3. Run modality-specific encoders on each segment independently 4. Fuse multimodal features and train classifier
- Design tradeoffs: Segment-level training reduces noise but increases sample count and may lose cross-segment context; strict timestamp adherence may miss hate adjacent to annotated boundaries (contextual dependency problem noted in audio analysis); binary hate/non-hate collapses nuanced offensive/hate distinctions used in original datasets
- Failure signatures: High training accuracy but poor noisy-to-clean generalization suggests overfitting to video-level artifacts; similar embeddings but scattered predictions on UMAP indicates decision boundary confusion rather than representation failure; high precision but low recall on hate class may indicate model is learning to detect only explicit slurs, missing contextual hate
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline noise quantification: On HateMM, compute duration ratio of trimmed hate vs. full video; verify ~33% non-hateful content claim
  2. Ablate training data granularity: Train identical architecture on (a) full videos with video-level labels, (b) trimmed segments with segment-level labels; compare macro F1 delta
  3. Probe semantic overlap: Sample 100 trimmed non-hate segments from hateful videos and 100 non-hate videos; compute cosine similarity of BERT embeddings to verify intermediate clustering pattern

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can annotation protocols be redesigned to capture the "gradual semantic transitions" of hate speech rather than discrete binary boundaries? The conclusion calls for "improved annotation strategies that account for hate speech's contextual dependencies and temporal continuity." The authors find that "semantic drift" creates overlap between hate and non-hate segments, making current timestamp-based annotations inadequate for defining precise boundaries.

### Open Question 2
Can weakly supervised learning methods (e.g., Multiple Instance Learning) effectively bridge the performance gap between noisy video-level training and clean segment-level detection? The "Noisy-to-Clean" generalization experiments show a significant performance drop (Macro F1 76.91% vs 98.64%), and the authors cite MIL in Related Work as a missed opportunity for handling label ambiguity.

### Open Question 3
Does the exclusion of "Trimmed Non-Hate" segments remove essential contextual cues necessary for accurate hate classification? Section 4.2 and 4.3 reveal high acoustic and visual similarity between trimmed hate and non-hate segments, suggesting "contextual dependency" extends beyond annotated timestamps.

## Limitations
- The core claims about systematic temporal label noise rest on the assumption that timestamp annotations accurately capture true hateful content boundaries, but no validation of annotation quality or inter-annotator agreement is provided
- The semantic overlap findings could reflect annotation bias rather than true noise, as the paper lacks direct annotation quality validation
- Controlled experiments assume perfect timestamp knowledge, which may not generalize to real-world deployment scenarios where timestamp annotations are unavailable or noisy

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Quantitative noise quantification (33-59% non-hateful content in labeled hateful videos) and clean-to-clean generalization performance
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about semantic overlap being due to systematic rather than random noise, given the lack of direct annotation quality validation
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization from controlled experiments to real-world deployment scenarios, as the experiments assume perfect timestamp knowledge

## Next Checks
1. **Annotation Quality Validation**: Compute inter-annotator agreement for timestamp annotations and conduct spot checks comparing timestamp labels against full-video human judgments to verify they represent true hateful content boundaries
2. **Contextual Contamination Analysis**: Systematically measure feature similarity between trimmed non-hate segments and genuinely non-hateful videos across all modalities to quantify the degree of semantic contamination
3. **Robustness to Annotation Error**: Conduct sensitivity analysis by randomly perturbing timestamps and measuring degradation in model performance to establish the stability of findings to annotation imprecision
