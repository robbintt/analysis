# Optimizing Supply Chain Networks with the Power of Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.06221
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06221
- **Reference count:** 33
- **One-line primary result:** GNN with identity adjacency matrix achieves lower MSE and MAE than MLP and GCN for demand forecasting in supply chain networks

## Executive Summary
This study applies Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to demand forecasting within supply chain networks using the SupplyGraph dataset. The dataset models products, manufacturing facilities, and storage locations as nodes with temporal features like production volumes and sales orders, while edges represent interdependencies. Three models—MLP, GNN, and GCN—were trained for 50 epochs with a 7:2:1 data split and Adam optimizer (learning rate 0.001). The GNN model, using fully connected layers and an identity adjacency matrix, demonstrated superior performance in demand forecasting for individual nodes. Across 30 product categories, the GNN achieved significantly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to MLP and GCN models, with some products showing MSE reductions from 60+ to near zero. The results highlight GNNs' potential to enhance predictive accuracy in supply chain operations, enabling better inventory management, production scheduling, and logistics optimization through effective modeling of temporal and relational data.

## Method Summary
The study uses the SupplyGraph dataset containing 41 product nodes, 684 edges, and 221 time points, enriched with production volumes, sales orders, deliveries, and factory issues. Three models—MLP, GNN, and GCN—were trained for 50 epochs with a 7:2:1 train/val/test split using Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.001. The GNN implementation uses fully connected layers with an identity adjacency matrix, focusing on self-loops rather than inter-node message passing. Temporal windows of unspecified size were used to extract historical features, which were then reshaped into expanded node features (164 × window_size). Data preprocessing included deduplication, z-score normalization, and removal of low-quality nodes with high zero-value ratios.

## Key Results
- GNN model with identity adjacency matrix achieved lower MSE and MAE than MLP and GCN models
- Across 30 product categories, GNN showed significant performance improvements, with some products showing MSE reductions from 60+ to near zero
- GCN results showed near-zero MSE/MAE across most products, raising concerns about potential overfitting or data leakage
- The study demonstrates GNNs' potential for enhancing predictive accuracy in supply chain operations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GNNs may capture supply chain dependencies through graph-structured representation learning, but this paper's implementation tests a restricted variant.
- Mechanism: Node features are transformed via learned weights and aggregated through adjacency-defined neighborhoods. In this study, the GNN uses an identity adjacency matrix (self-loops only), limiting information flow to individual nodes rather than inter-node message passing.
- Core assumption: Node-level temporal features contain sufficient signal for demand forecasting without explicit cross-node relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The GNN model, using fully connected layers and an identity adjacency matrix, demonstrated superior performance"
  - [section 5.4.1] "The GNN model uses an identity matrix as the adjacency matrix, assuming no explicit connections between nodes and focusing solely on self-loops"
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus evidence for this specific identity-matrix approach; related work (SupplyGraph paper) assumes heterogeneous graph structures
- Break condition: If cross-node dependencies (shared facilities, material flows) are critical for forecasting, the identity matrix assumption would degrade performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Temporal windowing enables the model to capture sequential demand patterns across time.
- Mechanism: Historical observations within a fixed window_size are reshaped into expanded node features (164 × window_size), allowing the network to learn time-dependent patterns through fully connected layers.
- Core assumption: Demand patterns exhibit temporal autocorrelation that windowed features can capture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "utilizes data from files such as Sales Order.csv and Production.csv to model demand dynamics...sliding window methods are employed to extract relevant historical features"
  - [section 5.4.1] "By incorporating a temporal window of size window_size, the input data is expanded to 164 × window_size nodes"
  - [corpus] MCDFN paper (2405.15598) similarly emphasizes temporal pattern capture for demand forecasting
- Break condition: If demand is driven by external shocks rather than historical patterns, windowing provides limited benefit.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Non-linear transformations through stacked layers extract higher-order representations from node features.
- Mechanism: Features pass through fully connected layers with ReLU activations, each applying linear transformations followed by non-linearities to model complex relationships.
- Core assumption: Demand relationships are sufficiently non-linear to benefit from deep transformations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.4.1] "fully connected layers, each applying a linear transformation followed by ReLU activation...facilitates the extraction of complex, higher-order representations"
  - [section 4.1] MLP description establishes foundation for non-linear representation learning
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence; related GNN supply chain papers focus on graph structure rather than layer depth effects
- Break condition: If the true demand function is approximately linear or requires domain-specific inductive biases, generic non-linear layers may overfit or underfit.

**Important Caveat**: The results tables show GCN achieving near-zero MSE/MAE across most products, while GNN and MLP show substantially higher errors. This contradicts the abstract's claim of GNN superiority. These near-perfect GCN scores may indicate overfitting, data leakage, or evaluation issues—treat all performance claims as conditional pending verification.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Message Passing in GNNs**
  - Why needed here: The paper's "GNN" uses identity adjacency (no message passing), but understanding standard GNN mechanics is essential to recognize this limitation and extend the architecture.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a standard GCN aggregates neighbor features differently from the identity-matrix approach described in this paper?

- Concept: **Time-Series Representation for Forecasting**
  - Why needed here: Demand forecasting requires understanding how sliding windows convert sequential data into supervised learning inputs.
  - Quick check question: Given 221 time points and a window_size of 7, how many training samples can be constructed (assuming single-step ahead prediction)?

- Concept: **Supply Chain Graph Structure**
  - Why needed here: The SupplyGraph dataset contains 41 products, 684 edges, production plants, and storage locations—understanding these entity types is necessary for meaningful feature engineering.
  - Quick check question: What types of relationships would you encode as edges if you were to replace the identity matrix with a meaningful adjacency structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Raw Data (Sales Order.csv, Production.csv)
       ↓
  Preprocessing (deduplication, z-score normalization, low-quality node removal)
       ↓
  Temporal Windowing → Feature tensor [batch, 164 × window_size]
       ↓
  Adjacency Matrix (I = identity in this implementation)
       ↓
  GNN Layer: A @ X → flattened → Fully Connected layers + ReLU
       ↓
  Output: Demand forecast per node

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing quality (missing values, normalization) directly affects model stability
  2. Window size selection determines temporal context captured
  3. Adjacency matrix design (currently identity) controls information flow scope

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Identity adjacency: Computationally efficient, node-isolated; sacrifices relational inductive bias
  - Learned/domain-specific adjacency: Captures inter-node dependencies; requires additional data and validation
  - Window size: Larger windows capture more history but increase input dimensionality and risk overfitting

- Failure signatures:
  - Near-zero MSE on test set (as seen with GCN results): Likely overfitting or data leakage—verify train/test split integrity
  - High variance across product categories: Suggests node-specific patterns require separate models or features
  - GNN underperforming MLP: May indicate adjacency matrix is not providing useful signal (as with identity matrix)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Reproduce the MLP/GNN/GCN results with the reported hyperparameters (50 epochs, lr=0.001, 7:2:1 split); verify if GCN near-zero errors are reproducible or artifacts
  2. **Adjacency ablation**: Replace identity matrix with supply-chain-derived adjacency (e.g., shared production facilities, material dependencies) and compare forecasting performance
  3. **Window size sensitivity**: Test window_size ∈ {3, 7, 14, 30} to quantify temporal context impact on prediction accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does incorporating the actual supply chain topology via domain-specific adjacency matrices improve forecasting accuracy compared to the identity matrix used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "Future work could focus on enhancing the model by incorporating domain-specific or learned adjacency matrices to capture explicit inter-node relationships."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation utilizes an identity adjacency matrix, which assumes no explicit inter-node connections and relies solely on self-loops, potentially ignoring critical network dependencies.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating the model's performance when the identity matrix is replaced by the dataset's defined relational edges.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can extending the framework to dynamic graphs, where nodes and edges evolve over time, enhance predictive performance for complex supply chains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest "Extending the approach to dynamic graphs, where nodes and edges evolve over time, could further improve the model's applicability to real-world scenarios."
- Why unresolved: The current model processes features within temporal windows but operates on a fixed graph structure, which may not capture evolving logistical relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing a temporal graph architecture (e.g., Evolving GNN) and measuring performance on datasets with changing network topologies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the simplified GNN architecture perform against state-of-the-art graph or time-series models beyond the MLP and GCN baselines?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion calls for "Benchmarking the model against state-of-the-art approaches on more complex graph datasets to further validate its performance."
- Why unresolved: The study limited its comparison to Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), leaving a gap in understanding relative to more advanced architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Reporting performance metrics (MSE, MAE) of the proposed model relative to advanced baselines like Graph Attention Networks (GATs) or Temporal GNNs.

## Limitations
- The GNN implementation uses an identity adjacency matrix, fundamentally limiting it to node-isolated learning rather than capturing inter-node dependencies
- GCN results showing near-zero MSE across most products raise serious concerns about potential overfitting, data leakage, or evaluation issues
- Critical hyperparameters including window size, model architecture details, and the exact 164-node derivation from 41 products are not specified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The general approach of using temporal windows and fully connected layers for demand forecasting is well-established
- **Medium confidence**: The identity adjacency matrix implementation and its performance relative to MLP, though the superior results claimed in the abstract contradict the reported tables
- **Low confidence**: All specific performance claims, particularly the near-zero MSE values for GCN, pending verification of data preprocessing and evaluation procedures

## Next Checks
1. **Data split verification**: Confirm that train/val/test splits do not share temporal windows and that target normalization is properly applied to prevent leakage
2. **Adjacency structure ablation**: Replace the identity matrix with supply-chain-derived adjacency (shared facilities, material flows) to test if relational information improves forecasting
3. **Window size sensitivity analysis**: Systematically test window_size ∈ {3, 7, 14, 30} to quantify the impact of temporal context on prediction accuracy
