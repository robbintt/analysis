## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first systematic investigation of temporal bias in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs). The authors identify a pervasive problem where LALMs consistently misplace event timestamps along the time axis, often predicting times that are consistently earlier or later than ground truth. Through controlled experiments across three dimensions—audio length, event duration, and event position—the study reveals that temporal bias increases dramatically with audio length, varies across event types, and follows a U-shaped curve with position, with boundary events most error-prone.

The research introduces the Temporal Bias Index (TBI) as a novel metric for quantifying temporal reasoning failures in LALMs. Interpretability analysis reveals that early decoder layers develop structural bias toward sequence boundaries while later layers focus on semantic content, suggesting temporal bias arises from competition between these signals. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in LALMs' temporal reasoning capabilities and call for more temporally robust architectures.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct controlled experiments on LALMs across three key dimensions: audio length (5s to 120s), event duration (short vs. long), and event position within audio clips. They quantify temporal bias using two metrics: the Temporal Bias Index (TBI) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The study employs systematic manipulation of input conditions to isolate how different factors affect temporal prediction accuracy. Interpretability analysis examines decoder layer behavior to understand the emergence of temporal bias, focusing on the development of boundary versus semantic signal processing across layers.

## Key Results
- Temporal bias increases dramatically with audio length, reaching over 20 seconds in 120-second clips
- Temporal bias follows a U-shaped curve with event position, with boundary events showing highest error rates
- Early decoder layers exhibit structural bias toward sequence boundaries while later layers focus on semantic content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Temporal bias emerges from the architectural design of LALMs where attention mechanisms must simultaneously track temporal position and semantic content. The decoder layers develop a hierarchical processing pattern where early layers prioritize structural information about sequence boundaries, while later layers focus on semantic understanding. This creates a fundamental tension: the model must balance positional awareness with content comprehension, and when these signals conflict, temporal predictions tend to drift systematically. The competition between boundary and semantic signals explains why bias varies with position (boundary events being most affected) and why longer sequences exacerbate the problem (more opportunities for drift to accumulate).

## Foundational Learning

**Temporal reasoning in audio models**: Understanding how models map audio content to specific time points is crucial for applications like audio search and summarization. Quick check: Can the model accurately localize events when tested on progressively longer audio segments?

**Attention mechanism dynamics**: LALMs use attention to weigh different time steps, but this can create systematic biases when positional and semantic information conflict. Quick check: Does attention weight distribution change predictably across decoder layers?

**Sequence boundary effects**: Models often develop biases toward sequence edges due to how positional embeddings interact with attention patterns. Quick check: Are prediction errors consistently larger for events occurring at audio clip boundaries?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Audio input -> Encoder (feature extraction) -> Decoder layers (attention-based processing) -> Temporal prediction output

**Critical path**: The attention mechanism in decoder layers forms the critical path for temporal reasoning, where positional embeddings interact with semantic content representations to produce timestamp predictions.

**Design tradeoffs**: The architecture balances between positional awareness (maintaining accurate time mapping) and semantic comprehension (understanding audio content). This tradeoff creates the fundamental tension leading to temporal bias.

**Failure signatures**: Temporal bias manifests as systematic over- or under-prediction of event times, with errors increasing for longer sequences and boundary events. The bias follows predictable patterns based on event type and position.

**First experiments**:
1. Measure MAE across varying audio lengths to establish baseline temporal bias
2. Analyze decoder layer activation patterns for boundary versus middle-positioned events
3. Compare TBI scores across different event types to identify bias variation patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

The study's controlled experiments focus on synthetic and relatively clean audio data, which may not capture the complexity of natural conversations, overlapping speech, or noisy environments where LALMs typically operate. The Temporal Bias Index (TBI) metric, while novel, lacks established benchmarks from other studies, making it difficult to contextualize whether observed bias levels represent severe or moderate temporal reasoning failures. The architectural interpretation analysis shows promising patterns in decoder layer behavior but cannot definitively prove causation between layer-specific processing and temporal bias emergence.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Temporal bias systematically increases with audio length, reaching significant levels (over 20 seconds) in 120-second clips.
- **Medium Confidence**: Temporal bias follows a U-shaped curve with event position, with boundary events showing highest error rates.
- **Medium Confidence**: Early decoder layers exhibit structural bias toward sequence boundaries while later layers focus on semantic content.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct temporal bias experiments on real-world conversational datasets with overlapping speech and background noise to assess whether synthetic test results transfer to practical deployment scenarios.

2. Implement targeted architectural modifications to isolate and mitigate boundary vs. semantic signal competition, then measure whether temporal bias reduction correlates with changes in decoder layer activation patterns.

3. Develop and validate alternative temporal reasoning architectures that incorporate explicit time-encoding mechanisms, then compare their temporal bias profiles against standard LALMs using the TBI metric across diverse audio domains.
