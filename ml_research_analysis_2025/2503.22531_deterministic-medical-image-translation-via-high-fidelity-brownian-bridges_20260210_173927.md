# Deterministic Medical Image Translation via High-fidelity Brownian Bridges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.22531
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22531
- Reference count: 34
- Achieves PSNR 29.9 and SSIM 0.94 on BraTS 2018 T1-W to T2-W translation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HiFi-BBrg, a deterministic medical image translation framework that combines conditional Brownian bridge diffusion models with conditional GANs. The method addresses the non-deterministic nature of existing diffusion models while maintaining high image quality and fidelity to ground truth. Experiments demonstrate superior performance across multiple medical image translation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on both modality translation and multi-image super-resolution tasks.

## Method Summary
HiFi-BBrg employs a two-stage architecture: a generation mapping using conditional Brownian bridge diffusion to transfer between image domains, and a reconstruction mapping using cGAN to ensure fidelity. The method trains two complementary mappings - one for generation and one for reconstruction - while integrating fidelity loss and adversarial training throughout the diffusion process. This achieves deterministic outputs with a single sampling step while maintaining high quality. The training loss combines diffusion loss, fidelity loss, and adversarial loss, optimized using Adam across 1000 epochs.

## Key Results
- BraTS 2018 (T1-W to T2-W): LPIPS 0.0401, PSNR 29.9, SSIM 0.94
- Prostate MRI multi-image super-resolution: PSNR 31.2, SSIM 0.88 (4.5 PSNR improvement over specialized methods)
- Single-step deterministic sampling while maintaining high perceptual quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework combines the generative power of diffusion models with the fidelity guarantees of GANs. The conditional Brownian bridge provides a structured noise path that ensures deterministic generation, while the cGAN reconstruction mapping enforces alignment with ground truth. The integration of fidelity loss throughout the diffusion process maintains image quality without sacrificing determinism.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conditional Brownian bridge diffusion**: A noise schedule that conditions on input images to create deterministic paths between domains. Needed for controlled, predictable image translation. Quick check: Verify Xt follows the bridge formula with correct conditioning on X0 and XT.
- **Conditional GAN architecture**: Generator-discriminator setup that enforces image fidelity through adversarial training. Needed to ensure translated images match ground truth characteristics. Quick check: Monitor discriminator loss for training stability.
- **Multi-task loss optimization**: Balancing diffusion loss, fidelity loss, and adversarial loss during training. Needed to achieve both deterministic generation and high image quality. Quick check: Verify gradient magnitudes are balanced across all loss components.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input A -> Conditional Brownian Bridge (ϵθ) -> Domain B -> Reconstruction GAN (G,D) -> Output B
- **Critical path**: The forward pass through ϵθ with fidelity loss integration is critical for deterministic generation.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Single-step sampling vs. multi-step generation - single-step chosen for determinism but may limit diversity.
- **Failure signatures**: Training instability in cGAN component manifests as mode collapse or exploding gradients in discriminator loss.
- **First experiments**:
  1. Train with fidelity loss λ=0 to isolate diffusion model performance
  2. Train with single-stage GAN only to benchmark against deterministic baseline
  3. Vary λ values to find optimal balance between determinism and image quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Can HiFi-BBrg handle unpaired training data?** The paper notes future plans to extend to unpaired data by coupling two HiFi-BBrg modules, but current methodology requires paired datasets for fidelity loss calculation.
- **Does 2D slice generation maintain volumetric consistency?** The method processes 256×256 2D slices independently without addressing 3D spatial coherence or volumetric metrics.
- **Does improved fidelity translate to better clinical performance?** The paper focuses on image quality metrics but doesn't evaluate downstream clinical task performance like segmentation or classification accuracy.

## Limitations
- Network architectures are incompletely specified (exact UNet configurations unknown)
- Multi-image super-resolution task formulation is underspecified
- Training details like batch size are omitted, requiring assumptions
- 2D processing may not preserve volumetric consistency in 3D medical data

## Confidence
- **Performance metrics**: Medium-High - methodology is sound but exact reproduction requires addressing architectural unknowns
- **Deterministic sampling claim**: Medium-High - theoretically justified but would benefit from variance analysis across multiple runs
- **Clinical applicability**: Low - no downstream task evaluation provided to validate clinical utility

## Next Checks
1. Implement and ablate the fidelity loss component to verify its contribution to deterministic outputs while maintaining quality
2. Conduct ablation studies varying λ values across the three datasets to confirm optimal weighting choices
3. Test the single-step deterministic sampling at inference by measuring output variance across multiple runs
