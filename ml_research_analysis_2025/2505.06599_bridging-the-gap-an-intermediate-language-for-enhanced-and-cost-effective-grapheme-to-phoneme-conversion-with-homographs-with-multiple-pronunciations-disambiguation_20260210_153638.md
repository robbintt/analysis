# Bridging the Gap: An Intermediate Language for Enhanced and Cost-Effective Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion with Homographs with Multiple Pronunciations Disambiguation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.06599
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06599
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Introduces intermediate language framework achieving BLEU 94.6 and PER 0.0196 for Persian G2P conversion

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an intermediate language framework designed to enhance Persian grapheme-to-phoneme conversion by addressing the challenges of homographs with multiple pronunciations and Ezafe detection. The approach combines large language model (LLM) prompting techniques with a sequence-to-sequence machine transliteration architecture, using custom tokenization strategies and the EncoderDecoder model. The framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving a BLEU score of 94.6 and PER of 0.0196. The system effectively handles both formal and informal Persian text while providing robust homograph disambiguation capabilities, offering a cost-effective solution for Persian text-to-speech systems with potential generalizability to other languages with complex phonological structures.

## Method Summary
The framework introduces an intermediate language representation that bridges Persian orthography and its phonetic transcription. The system employs LLM prompting techniques combined with a sequence-to-sequence machine transliteration architecture. A custom tokenization strategy is used to process Persian text, while the EncoderDecoder model handles the conversion from intermediate representation to final phonetic output. The approach specifically targets homograph disambiguation and Ezafe detection, two critical challenges in Persian G2P conversion. The method processes both formal and informal Persian text, maintaining high accuracy across different text styles and contexts.

## Key Results
- Achieves BLEU score of 94.6 for Persian grapheme-to-phoneme conversion
- Demonstrates PER (Phoneme Error Rate) of 0.0196
- Shows superior performance over existing Persian G2P methods
- Effectively handles both formal and informal Persian text variants

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its intermediate language representation that decouples orthographic complexity from phonetic transcription. By using LLM prompting techniques, the system can leverage contextual understanding to disambiguate homographs with multiple pronunciations. The sequence-to-sequence architecture allows for learning complex mapping patterns between Persian orthography and phonetics. The custom tokenization strategy optimizes the representation of Persian linguistic features, while the EncoderDecoder model provides the necessary capacity to handle the non-linear transformations required for accurate phonetic conversion.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Persian Ezafe Construction**: Understanding the Ezafe marker system is critical for accurate phonetic transcription. Quick check: Can the system correctly identify and transcribe Ezafe markers in various syntactic positions?

2. **Homograph Disambiguation**: Persian contains numerous words with identical spelling but different pronunciations based on context. Quick check: Does the system maintain accuracy when processing homographs in isolation versus context?

3. **Sequence-to-Sequence Transliteration**: The architecture must learn complex mapping patterns between orthographic and phonetic representations. Quick check: Can the model handle unseen word patterns through learned generalization?

4. **Custom Tokenization for Persian**: Persian requires specific tokenization strategies due to its morphological complexity. Quick check: Does the tokenization preserve morphological boundaries critical for pronunciation?

5. **Intermediate Language Representation**: This abstraction layer simplifies the conversion process by separating orthographic and phonetic challenges. Quick check: Is the intermediate representation reversible and complete for all Persian phonetic features?

6. **LLM Contextual Understanding**: Leveraging large language models for contextual disambiguation improves accuracy. Quick check: Does context-aware processing significantly improve homograph disambiguation rates?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Persian Text -> Tokenizer -> Intermediate Language Encoder -> Context Processor -> Phonetic Decoder -> Final Pronunciation

**Critical Path**: Persian input → Custom tokenization → Intermediate representation encoding → LLM-based context processing → Sequence-to-sequence decoding → Phonetic output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades model complexity for accuracy by using LLM prompting alongside sequence-to-sequence models, which increases computational requirements but significantly improves homograph disambiguation accuracy. The custom tokenization strategy requires domain-specific knowledge but enables more precise phonetic conversion.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs with highly informal Persian text containing significant orthographic variations, dialectal pronunciations not represented in training data, and complex Ezafe constructions in ambiguous syntactic contexts. The system may struggle with proper nouns and loanwords with non-standard Persian pronunciations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test homograph disambiguation accuracy with and without contextual LLM prompting
2. Evaluate tokenization strategy robustness across different Persian text variants
3. Benchmark performance against existing G2P systems on standardized Persian test sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Narrow focus on Persian limits assessment of broader applicability
- Does not address performance with highly informal or dialectal Persian text
- Generalizability claims to Chinese and Arabic lack empirical validation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core technical claims regarding Persian G2P performance (BLEU 94.6, PER 0.0196)
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability to other languages like Chinese and Arabic (theoretical only)
- **Medium confidence**: Cost-effectiveness claims (implementation costs not quantified)

## Next Checks
1. Implement and evaluate the framework on Chinese and Arabic test sets to empirically validate cross-linguistic generalizability claims
2. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis comparing total implementation costs (including data preparation, training, and deployment) against existing G2P solutions
3. Test framework robustness using Persian social media corpora containing significant orthographic variation and non-standard language use
