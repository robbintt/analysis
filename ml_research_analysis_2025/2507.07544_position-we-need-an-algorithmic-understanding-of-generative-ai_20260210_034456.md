# Position: We Need An Algorithmic Understanding of Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07544
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: The paper introduces AlgEval framework for analyzing algorithmic primitives in LLMs, demonstrating through graph navigation that Llama models implement policy-dependent strategies rather than classical search algorithms

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that understanding the algorithmic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is essential for improving their reliability and controllability, complementing the current scaling paradigm. The authors propose AlgEval, a systematic framework for identifying and evaluating algorithmic primitives and their composition in LLMs. Through a case study on graph navigation tasks using Llama-3.1 models, they demonstrate that these models do not implement classical search algorithms like breadth-first search or depth-first search, but instead exhibit a policy-dependent strategy with incremental attention to goal paths and progressive separation of node representations across layers.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce AlgEval, a framework for algorithmic evaluation of LLMs that systematically identifies algorithmic primitives and analyzes their composition. The approach involves generating task-specific data (graph navigation problems), using attention analysis and representation similarity to probe model behavior, and comparing results against known algorithmic implementations. They test this framework on Llama-3.1-8B and 70B models, analyzing how these models navigate graphs of varying sizes and connectivity patterns. The methodology combines empirical testing with theoretical analysis to determine whether models implement classical algorithms or alternative strategies.

## Key Results
- Llama models do not implement classical search algorithms (BFS/DFS) for graph navigation tasks
- Models show policy-dependent strategies with incremental attention to paths leading to goals
- Node representations progressively separate across layers, suggesting learned representations rather than algorithmic execution
- Graph size and connectivity influence navigation strategy, with larger graphs showing more complex behavior patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper proposes that LLMs may implement algorithms through distributed representations and learned policies rather than explicit algorithmic primitives. The mechanism involves attention mechanisms that selectively focus on relevant path segments and layer-wise representation transformations that progressively encode spatial relationships. This approach allows models to handle complex navigation tasks without explicitly implementing classical search algorithms, instead developing data-driven strategies that optimize for task completion.

## Foundational Learning

### Algorithmic Primitives
**Why needed:** Understanding basic computational building blocks helps identify what algorithms LLMs can implement and how they compose them
**Quick check:** Can identify common primitives like search, sorting, or optimization in model behavior

### Attention Mechanisms
**Why needed:** Attention is the primary mechanism through which LLMs process sequential information and relationships
**Quick check:** Can analyze attention patterns to determine information flow and decision-making processes

### Representation Learning
**Why needed:** LLMs encode information in distributed representations that evolve across layers
**Quick check:** Can track representation similarity and transformations to understand information processing

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Layer -> Embedding Layer -> Transformer Blocks (N layers) -> Output Layer
Where each Transformer Block contains Multi-Head Attention -> Feed-Forward Network -> Layer Normalization

### Critical Path
The critical path for algorithmic tasks involves:
Attention Computation -> Information Integration -> Representation Update -> Decision Output
This path must efficiently process relational information and maintain state across steps.

### Design Tradeoffs
The framework balances between model interpretability (through attention analysis) and task complexity (graph navigation requires memory and planning). The tradeoff involves computational cost of detailed analysis versus depth of understanding gained about algorithmic implementation.

### Failure Signatures
Failure manifests as inability to find optimal paths, getting stuck in local minima, or showing inconsistent behavior across similar tasks. The paper identifies that models may appear to "guess" rather than systematically search, particularly in larger graphs.

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test graph navigation with varying goal distances to measure strategy consistency
2. Compare attention patterns between successful and failed navigation attempts
3. Analyze representation similarity across layers for different graph topologies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges several open questions: how to systematically identify algorithmic primitives in LLMs, whether different prompting strategies might elicit algorithmic behavior, and how the framework generalizes to other algorithmic domains beyond graph navigation. The authors note that algorithmic primitives are not easily identifiable and require further theoretical development.

## Limitations
- Limited to two Llama model variants (8B and 70B parameters) with no comparison to other architectures
- Single domain focus (graph navigation) without testing on sorting, dynamic programming, or other algorithmic tasks
- No baseline comparisons with traditional algorithmic implementations or different prompting strategies
- Generalization to other problem domains and model scales remains uncertain

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Algorithmic understanding should complement scaling approaches | High |
| Llama models do not implement classical search algorithms | Medium |
| AlgEval framework generalizes across domains and architectures | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional algorithmic tasks (sorting, dynamic programming, constraint satisfaction) to evaluate cross-domain applicability and identify consistent patterns in algorithmic primitive identification.
2. Apply the framework to different model architectures (Mistral, GPT series, open-source alternatives) to determine whether the absence of classical algorithms is model-specific or a general characteristic of LLMs.
3. Conduct ablation studies on layer removal or attention head manipulation to determine which components are critical for the observed policy-dependent navigation strategy versus classical algorithmic behavior.
