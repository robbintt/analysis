# Facets of Disparate Impact: Evaluating Legally Consistent Bias in Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.05471
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05471
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Introduces Objective Fairness Index (OFI) to detect algorithmic bias by comparing marginal benefits across groups, showing superiority over Disparate Impact (DI) in stability and legal consistency

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Objective Fairness Index (OFI), a novel metric for evaluating bias in machine learning models that aligns with legal standards and objective testing principles. OFI addresses limitations in existing metrics like disparate impact (DI) by incorporating contextual nuances of objective testing, measuring the difference between marginal benefits across groups. The authors demonstrate OFI's superiority over DI through theoretical analysis and empirical case studies, including the COMPAS recidivism prediction system and Folktable's Adult Employment dataset. In COMPAS, OFI confirms algorithmic bias against certain races even when assuming correct ground labels, while in Folktable's dataset, OFI reveals discrepancies with DI in Naïve Bayes predictions, particularly regarding Pacific Islanders. The metric provides a more legally consistent and reliable measure of bias, enabling better differentiation between algorithmic discrimination and systemic disparities.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates bias using the Objective Fairness Index (OFI), which compares marginal benefits between groups by calculating the difference between positive prediction rates and base rates of positive labels. The method uses binary confusion matrices from COMPAS recidivism predictions and Folktables employment data (Georgia, 2014-2017, 393,236 observations). Models include Random Forest and Naïve Bayes classifiers. OFI is computed as the difference between groups' marginal benefits (FP - FN / n), with a threshold of [-0.3, 0.3] for detecting bias. The authors compare OFI against traditional Disparate Impact (DI) metrics and validate findings through case studies and theoretical analysis.

## Key Results
- OFI demonstrates superior stability over DI in small-sample scenarios, with bounded behavior [-2, 2] versus DI's undefined or extreme values
- In COMPAS analysis, OFI confirms algorithmic bias against certain races even when assuming correct ground labels, while DI shows different patterns
- Folktables employment dataset reveals that OFI detects bias discrepancies not captured by DI, particularly showing negative/neutral bias against Pacific Islanders where DI showed positive bias
- OFI successfully distinguishes between algorithmic discrimination and systemic disparities by comparing marginal benefits rather than outcome ratios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Counterfactual Calibration via Marginal Benefit
- **Claim:** OFI detects algorithmic discrimination by comparing a group's actual positive prediction rate against their "expected" qualification rate (ground truth), rather than just comparing prediction rates between groups.
- **Mechanism:** Calculates "Marginal Benefit" (B) for each group as the difference between positive prediction rate (ŷ/n) and base rate of positive labels (P/n). Flags bias when one group receives more positive predictions than their qualifications warrant compared to another group.
- **Core assumption:** Ground truth labels represent objective measures of qualification or "expected benefit."
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 2] Defines Marginal Benefit B = b - E[b] and OFI as B_i - B_j; [Page 3] "OFI can sidestep the need to prove incorrect ground labels."
- **Break condition:** If historical data used for E[b] (labels) does not reflect true merit due to systemic exclusion, OFI assumes the test is "objective" when it may not be.

### Mechanism 2: Stability via Additive Differences
- **Claim:** OFI claims superior robustness over DI in small-sample scenarios by relying on additive differences rather than multiplicative ratios.
- **Mechanism:** DI uses ratios (ŷ_i / ŷ_j) which can become undefined or swing wildly with single-instance changes; OFI uses subtraction (B_i - B_j) maintaining bounded behavior [-2, 2] and consistent directionality even with small samples.
- **Core assumption:** Bias is better characterized as a deviation in accuracy than a ratio of outcomes.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 3] "Adding this single correct prediction changes DI's score from 1 to 2.71... However, OFI adjusts from 0.22 to 0.23."
- **Break condition:** If benefit is not linear (e.g., cost of False Positive significantly higher than False Negative), simple arithmetic difference FP - FN may not capture true utility disparity.

### Mechanism 3: Disentangling Algorithmic vs. Systemic Bias
- **Claim:** Using OFI with DI allows engineers to distinguish between bias introduced by algorithm and bias present in underlying population.
- **Mechanism:** If OFI ≈ 0 (marginal benefits equal) but DI ≠ 1 (outcome rates differ), disparity stems from input data distribution (systemic) rather than model's decision logic. If OFI ≠ 0, model is actively distorting relationship between qualification and outcome.
- **Core assumption:** Model is legally "fair" if it reflects underlying qualification rates accurately, even if those rates are socially undesirable.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 3] "With OFI, we can identify if an algorithm is at fault (OFI ≠ 0) or if a systematic disparity exists (OFI ≈ 0 and DI ≠ 1)."
- **Break condition:** Logic fails if "systemic disparity" is exactly what legal framework seeks to correct (anti-classification vs. anti-subordination principles).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Confusion Matrix Decomposition**
  - **Why needed here:** OFI is derived entirely from confusion matrix cells (TP, FP, FN, TN), specifically relying on difference between False Positive and False Negative counts normalized by total population.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a group of 10 people, if 2 are qualified but model predicts 5 are qualified, what are minimum possible FP and FN values?

- **Concept: Objective Testing (Legal Context)**
  - **Why needed here:** Paper grounds validity in "business necessity" defense (Griggs v. Duke Power), where test is legal if it accurately predicts performance even if it excludes protected group disproportionately.
  - **Quick check question:** According to paper's legal argument, is model discriminatory if it accurately predicts lower qualifications for Group A vs. Group B?

- **Concept: Marginal Benefit (B)**
  - **Why needed here:** Unit of analysis for OFI, representing net "surplus" or "deficit" of benefits (positive predictions) relative to what was deserved (labels).
  - **Quick check question:** If group has Marginal Benefit of B = -0.1, are they receiving more False Positives or more False Negatives relative to their size?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Binary Confusion Matrices for Group i and Group j -> Extract FP_i, FN_i, n_i and FP_j, FN_j, n_j -> Calculate B_i = (FP_i - FN_i)/n_i and B_j = (FP_j - FN_j)/n_j -> Output OFI = B_i - B_j

- **Critical path:** Definition of "Positive Class" is critical architectural dependency. In COMPAS study [Page 8], authors flipped label so "Not a Recidivist" was benefit. If positive class is not "benefit" (e.g., predicting "Default" in credit), sign of OFI metric inverts.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Metric Stability vs. Label Reliance:** OFI is mathematically stable (bounded [-2,2]) but philosophically dependent on label accuracy. If labels are proxies (e.g., "arrests" for "crime"), OFI inherits that proxy bias, potentially more rigidly than DI.
  - **Thresholds:** Paper suggests theoretical threshold of 0.3 [Page 3, Section 2.4], derived from standard deviation approximations.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **The "Meritocratic" Trap:** If OFI ≈ 0 but DI is low, system reports "No Algorithmic Bias," potentially masking severe societal inequity. This is "false negative" for social justice but "true negative" for algorithmic fidelity.
  - **Small Data Volatility:** While better than DI, OFI still suffers in small n. Variance of B converges slowly.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Robustness Check (Table 1 Replication):** Implement "Scenario α" test. Construct dataset where adding single data point flips DI from 1.0 to 2.71 and verify OFI moves only slightly (0.22 to 0.23).
  2. **Folktables Replication (Naïve Bayes):** Train Naïve Bayes classifier on Folktables employment data. Calculate OFI and DI for "Pacific Islanders" vs. "White." Verify DI shows positive bias while OFI shows negative/neutral bias.
  3. **Threshold Analysis:** Generate random confusion matrices for varying n (10, 100, 1000). Plot distribution of OFI values to empirically verify standard deviation threshold bounds mentioned in Section D.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can OFI be mathematically formalized for non-binary tasks, specifically multi-class classification, regression, and recommender systems?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4 states "For future work, we envision OFI in more complex scenarios, including multi-class classification problems, regression tasks, and recommender systems."
- **Why unresolved:** Current definition relies strictly on binary confusion matrices involving distinct False Positives and False Negatives, which do not map directly to continuous regression values or multi-class probabilities.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Generalized formulation of "benefit" and "expected benefit" operating on continuous error distributions or multi-class probability vectors, with empirical validation on regression dataset or recommender system.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can OFI be integrated as differentiable constraint or loss component within algorithmic debiasing techniques?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4 identifies "exploration of OFI's role in development of debiasing techniques" as "promising avenue" for future research.
- **Why unresolved:** Paper presents OFI as post-hoc evaluation metric derived from static confusion matrices, not demonstrating how to optimize for this metric during model training.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Modified training algorithm (e.g., neural network with custom regularizer) that minimizes OFI across groups during gradient descent, showing convergence to lower-bias state.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can OFI be adapted to incorporate complex legal nuances such as "good faith," "proportional responses," and "reasonable accommodations" required by laws like ADA or UK Equality Act?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4 lists these legal concepts as "inherent limitations" to applying binary OFI, noting "We hope to explore solutions for these in more complex scenarios where they are addressable."
- **Why unresolved:** Current OFI formulation assumes binary benefit structure that cannot capture contextual legal defenses or non-binary outcomes.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Expanded theoretical framework accepting contextual weights or parameters representing legal exceptions, successfully differentiating between "discriminatory" failures and "legally accommodated" deviations.

## Limitations
- **Label quality assumption:** OFI assumes ground truth labels represent objective qualifications rather than potentially biased measurements, which may not hold in real-world data
- **Limited validation scope:** Paper only validates OFI on two datasets (COMPAS and Folktables), lacking broader cross-domain testing
- **Statistical threshold uncertainty:** Unclear methodology for calculating dataset-specific significance thresholds beyond theoretical uniform distribution bounds

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Computational validity of OFI as more stable metric than DI for comparing group outcomes
- **Medium confidence:** Core mechanism of distinguishing algorithmic vs. systemic bias, though practical legal applicability remains uncertain
- **Medium confidence:** Theoretical framework for legal consistency, though may not align with anti-subordination principles in practice

## Next Checks
1. **Label Quality Sensitivity Test**: Systematically inject varying degrees of label bias into synthetic datasets and measure how OFI and DI respond to demonstrate metric's vulnerability to proxy bias
2. **Legal Framework Compatibility Audit**: Conduct interviews with legal experts to assess whether OFI's interpretation of "business necessity" and objective testing aligns with current disparate impact doctrine and its practical application
3. **Cross-Dataset Generalization Study**: Apply OFI to at least three additional real-world datasets spanning different domains (e.g., credit scoring, hiring, healthcare) to evaluate performance across diverse contexts and identify potential failure modes
