# Prompting the Market? A Large-Scale Meta-Analysis of GenAI in Finance NLP (2022-2025)

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.09544
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09544
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** MetaGraph methodology extracts structured knowledge graphs from scientific literature, revealing three key phases in financial NLP research from 2022-2025: early LLM adoption, critical reflection on limitations, and integration of peripheral techniques into modular systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MetaGraph, a methodology for extracting structured knowledge graphs from scientific literature using large language models. The approach involves defining an ontology for financial NLP, applying LLM-based extraction to 681 papers from 2022-2025, and analyzing trends through graph queries. The study reveals three distinct phases in financial NLP research: initial LLM adoption with task innovation, critical reflection on limitations, and integration of peripheral techniques into modular systems. Financial QA emerged as the leading focus area, with datasets diversifying through synthetic generation and model-centric approaches evolving into system-level solutions.

## Method Summary
The methodology extracts structured entities from 681 Financial NLP papers using LLM-based extraction with separate prompts per entity type (tasks, datasets, models, limitations). Gemini 2.5 Flash with Chain-of-Thought prompting extracts entities which are then resolved using text embeddings and a 0.93 cosine similarity threshold. The extracted knowledge graph is queried to reveal temporal patterns and research trends. Validation against a gold set of 12 papers showed "almost perfect performance" for key entities. The approach uses a manually defined ontology and includes relevance scoring through PageRank, productivity, and citation metrics.

## Key Results
- Three distinct research phases identified: early LLM adoption, critical reflection on limitations, and modular system integration
- Financial QA emerged as the dominant research focus, replacing traditional sentiment analysis
- Dataset landscape fragmented as synthetic generation rose, with declining reuse of shared benchmarks
- Industry and academia show divergent adoption speeds, with industry leading in Financial QA and dataset creation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Separate prompts per entity type with chain-of-thought reasoning improve extraction precision over monolithic approaches
- Mechanism: The extraction pipeline uses distinct prompts for motivations, limitations, tasks, datasets, and models. Each prompt requires step-by-step reasoning before output, with explicit abstention options to reduce hallucination rates
- Core assumption: Decomposing extraction into focused subtasks reduces cognitive load on the LLM and limits error propagation across entity types
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "crafting separate prompts for each information type (e.g., motivations, limitations, tasks) to improve extraction precision"
  - [section] "using CoT prompting, where models are required to explain their answers"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; neighbors focus on prompting for financial tasks, not extraction methodology
- Break condition: If entity types are highly interdependent (e.g., tasks and datasets must be extracted jointly), separate prompts may miss relational constraints

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Embedding-based entity resolution with a high cosine threshold consolidates name variants while preserving distinct entities
- Mechanism: Text embeddings cluster semantically similar mentions (e.g., "Finqa" vs. "FinQA"). Pairs above a 0.93 similarity threshold merge, reducing fragmentation in the knowledge graph
- Core assumption: Naming variations are the primary source of entity duplication, and semantic similarity aligns with referential equivalence in this domain
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Term inconsistencies such as name variants (e.g., Finqa and FinQA), were addressed by clustering over text embeddings"
  - [section] "merging semantically equivalent mentions based on a cosine similarity threshold of ≥ 0.93 (tuned empirically)"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on entity resolution thresholds
- Break condition: If entities share similar names but differ semantically (e.g., "FinQA" dataset vs. "FinQA" model), the threshold may cause false merges

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Querying the aggregated knowledge graph reveals temporal patterns that manual surveys miss
- Mechanism: Papers are grouped into time partitions with equal counts. Graph queries aggregate entity frequencies and co-occurrences per period, exposing phase transitions (e.g., model-centric → system-level)
- Core assumption: Research trends can be approximated by counting entity mentions across time-binned papers, weighted by relevance scores
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MetaGraph reveals three key phases: early LLM adoption and task/dataset innovation; critical reflection on LLM limitations; and growing integration of peripheral techniques into modular systems"
  - [section] "We observed a clear trend that follows the expansion of data sources... documents from which retrieval occurs are becoming increasingly longer"
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers confirm financial QA and prompting trends but do not validate the graph-based discovery mechanism itself
- Break condition: If paper sampling is biased (e.g., arXiv overrepresents certain subfields), aggregate counts may not reflect true domain shifts

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Ontology Design
  - Why needed here: The ontology defines extractable entity types and relationships; its expressiveness determines analytical power
  - Quick check question: Can you list three entity types and two relationship types relevant to analyzing NLP research trends?

- Concept: Entity Resolution via Embedding Similarity
  - Why needed here: Inconsistent naming across papers fragments the graph; clustering consolidates variants
  - Quick check question: Why might a 0.93 cosine threshold work for financial dataset names but fail for author name disambiguation?

- Concept: Human-in-the-Loop Validation for LLM Extraction
  - Why needed here: LLMs hallucinate; iterative audits and prompt refinement reduce systematic errors
  - Quick check question: What is one signal that would trigger a prompt revision during extraction audits?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Ontology definition → Corpus acquisition (ACL/arXiv with filters) → LLM-based extraction (Gemini 2.5 Flash, separate prompts per entity) → Entity resolution (embeddings + threshold) → Taxonomy induction (zero-shot categorization) → Relevance scoring (PageRank, productivity, citations) → Graph queries for trend analysis

- Critical path: Ontology design locks in extractable insights; errors here propagate to all downstream queries. Validate entity types against a sample of papers before scaling extraction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Manual ontology: Higher structure and interpretability vs. rigidity and potential blind spots
  - Separate prompts per entity: Higher precision vs. missed cross-entity constraints
  - High similarity threshold (0.93): Fewer false merges vs. more manual cleanup of remaining variants

- Failure signatures:
  - Low extraction recall: Prompts may be too restrictive; check abstention rates
  - Fragmented entity clusters: Threshold too high or embedding model weak for domain terminology
  - Contradictory trend signals: Paper sampling bias or relevance scoring overweighting outliers

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run extraction on 20 papers with full human review; measure precision/recall per entity type
  2. Vary the entity resolution threshold (0.90–0.98) and measure merge accuracy on known variants
  3. Compare trend signals from graph queries vs. manual annotation on a held-out subset to validate alignment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does the manual definition of the ontology constrain the detection of novel or emergent research concepts in MetaGraph?
  - Basis in paper: [Explicit] Section 6 (Limitations) states that the manually defined ontology introduces "inductive bias" which may "limit flexibility and overlook alternative or emergent conceptualizations"
  - Why unresolved: The paper relies on a fixed, human-defined structure for its 2022–2025 analysis; without ablation studies using dynamic or bottom-up extraction methods, the extent of potential "blind spots" remains unknown
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study applying unsupervised topic modeling alongside the MetaGraph ontology to identify significant research clusters or concepts missed by the manual schema

- **Open Question 2:** To what extent is the fragmentation of the dataset landscape inhibiting reproducibility and consistent benchmarking in Financial QA?
  - Basis in paper: [Inferred] Section 4 and Table 2b show declining dataset usage frequencies ("fragmentation of the dataset landscape") as synthetic generation rises, implying a risk to standardization
  - Why unresolved: While the paper tracks the decline in shared datasets (e.g., FPB, FinQA), it does not quantify the resulting impact on cross-paper performance comparability or community convergence
  - What evidence would resolve it: Metrics tracking the "reuse rate" of specific benchmarks in subsequent papers and a correlation analysis between dataset fragmentation and performance variance across similar tasks

- **Open Question 3:** How will the divergence in adoption speeds between industry and academia affect the relevance of academic benchmarks for real-world financial practice?
  - Basis in paper: [Explicit] Section 4.3 ("One Revolution, Two Speeds") notes the gap between industry and academia remains an "open debate" as the focus shifts to proprietary, system-level solutions
  - Why unresolved: Industry dominates Financial QA and new dataset creation using closed-source models, while academia lags due to structural constraints; it is unclear if public benchmarks can stay representative of state-of-the-art practice
  - What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal analysis correlating academic benchmark leaderboards with independent efficacy metrics from real-world financial deployments or industry-held test sets

## Limitations

- The methodology's reliance on LLM extraction without published gold standards for validation beyond 12 papers introduces unknown error rates in trend identification
- The fixed 0.93 cosine threshold for entity resolution may not generalize across domains with different naming conventions or semantic ambiguities
- Temporal analysis assumes equal distribution of papers across phases without addressing potential subfield-specific publication lags

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Structured knowledge graph construction methodology and entity type definitions
- **Medium confidence:** Phase identification and trend conclusions, pending validation on independent datasets
- **Low confidence:** Cross-domain generalizability of the 0.93 similarity threshold and extraction prompt templates

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the extraction pipeline on 50 randomly selected papers from 2020-2021 to test temporal pattern detection outside the main study period
2. Apply the entity resolution threshold to a non-financial domain (e.g., biomedical NLP) and measure merge accuracy against human-annotated ground truth
3. Implement an ablation study removing the chain-of-thought requirement from prompts to quantify its contribution to precision gains
