# A Hierarchical Hybrid AI Approach: Integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning and Scripted Agents in Combat Simulations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00249
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00249
- Authors: Scotty Black; Christian Darken
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Hybrid RL + scripted agents achieved mean score of 489.998 vs 0.904 for scripted agents and -603.371 for RL agents (p < 0.001)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a hierarchical hybrid AI approach that combines deep reinforcement learning (RL) for strategic decision-making with scripted agents for tactical execution in hex-based combat simulations. The method addresses scalability and adaptability challenges by using RL managers to select objective areas while scripted subordinates handle unit movement and combat. Experiments in a hex-based combat environment demonstrated the hybrid approach significantly outperformed both standalone RL and scripted agents, with mean scores of 489.998 versus 0.904 for scripted agents and -603.371 for RL agents across 100,000 evaluation games.

## Method Summary
The approach uses deep Q-networks (DQN) for strategic decision-making and behavior trees for tactical execution. The RL manager agent operates on a compressed 17×7×7 observation space and selects from 49 discrete objective areas (super hexagons), while scripted subordinate agents handle movement and combat within their assigned objective areas. The temporal abstraction is event-driven—the RL manager only acts when all assigned units converge on the objective area, implementing the "options" framework from Sutton et al. (1999). The system uses a 10×10 hex-based gameboard with 6-9 units per faction, 1-2 urban hexes, and 40 phases per game.

## Key Results
- Hybrid approach achieved mean score of 489.998 versus 0.904 for scripted agents and -603.371 for RL agents
- Statistical significance confirmed (p < 0.001) across 100,000 evaluation games
- Outperformed both standalone RL and scripted agents in 4 out of 5 scenario seeds tested
- Demonstrated effectiveness of hierarchical decomposition for reducing RL sample complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Hierarchical decomposition dramatically reduces RL sample complexity by compressing both observation and action spaces.
- **Mechanism**: The RL Manager Agent operates on a coarse 17×7×7 abstracted observation and selects from only 49 discrete objective areas. Scripted agents handle the high-frequency tactical loop, freeing RL from per-timestep decisions.
- **Core assumption**: Strategic decisions can be made effectively with spatially abstracted information; fine-grained tactical details are not required for "where and when" choices.
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract states "utilize scripted agents for routine, tactical-level decisions and RL agents for higher-level, strategic decision-making," and methodology section describes modifying feature extractors and abstracting observations.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Event-driven temporal abstraction creates natural credit assignment windows that stabilize learning.
- **Mechanism**: The RL Manager only acts when all assigned units converge on the objective area, implementing Sutton et al.'s (1999) "options" framework where decisions span multiple time steps.
- **Core assumption**: Units can reliably reach assigned objectives before game termination, and delayed feedback does not prevent timely strategic adaptation.
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions "RL agents for higher-level, strategic decision-making" and integration section describes event-driven temporal abstraction mirroring the options framework.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Information culling for scripted subordinates improves tactical reliability while enabling implicit multi-manager coordination.
- **Mechanism**: Each scripted subordinate receives only its objective area observation, reducing decision space to local tactical choices. Multiple RL managers coordinate implicitly through a 25-point penalty for overlapping objectives.
- **Core assumption**: Local tactical decisions do not require global context, and objective area boundaries are sufficient for effective coordination.
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions synergizing scripted agents' reliability with RL's adaptive capabilities, and integration section describes restricting information to objective area scope.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**
  - **Why needed here**: The RL manager uses DQN with specific hyperparameters (γ=0.93, ε-decay, target network). Understanding value estimation and exploration is essential for debugging training.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does a discount factor of 0.93 favor medium-term rewards over very long-term outcomes in a 40-phase game?

- **Concept: Behavior Trees / Rule-Based Agents**
  - **Why needed here**: Scripted subordinates use a behavior tree with offensive/defensive postures and movement scoring. You will need to modify or debug this logic.
  - **Quick check question**: Trace what happens when a scripted unit has no enemy within attack range—how does it select a movement destination?

- **Concept: Options Framework (Temporal Abstraction)**
  - **Why needed here**: The manager's event-driven decisions are grounded in Sutton et al.'s options framework. Understanding this helps explain why rewards arrive only at convergence points.
  - **Quick check question**: Why might event-driven decisions improve credit assignment compared to per-timestep action selection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Atlatl Environment -> RL Manager Agent -> Scripted Subordinate Agents -> Objective Area System
- **Critical path**: Environment initialization → Random scenario generation → Manager assignment → Manager decision → Subordinate execution → Reward computation
- **Design tradeoffs**: 7×7 abstraction grid (coarser = faster training, may lose nuance); Objective area size (larger = more flexibility, less precise direction); Training budget (10M steps, learning curves not plateaued)
- **Failure signatures**: Persistent negative scores (check reward shaping); Managers assign identical objectives (penalty may be insufficient); Units oscillate near boundaries (check transition logic); Training stalls early (verify exploration decay)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce scripted vs. scripted baseline to validate scoring; 2) Assign random objective areas to ablate RL manager; 3) Scale gameboard to 12×12 or 15×15 to test abstraction generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Coarse 7×7 observation abstraction may fail when fine-grained tactical details critically influence strategic outcomes
- Event-driven temporal abstraction assumes units reliably converge on objectives before game termination
- Information culling mechanism could cause coordination failures if local tactical decisions have unintended global consequences
- Framework is highly specialized to hex-based combat with fixed unit counts and specific objective structures

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The hierarchical decomposition mechanism and its theoretical grounding in reducing sample complexity and stabilizing learning
- **Medium confidence**: The specific implementation details of observation abstraction and event-driven temporal abstraction
- **Medium confidence**: The statistical significance of performance improvements (p < 0.001) given the large sample size
- **Low confidence**: The generalization of the approach to different scenario types, board sizes, or domains without retraining

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation of observation abstraction**: Test the RL manager with full (non-abstracted) observations to quantify exactly how much performance gain comes from the compressed representation versus the hierarchical structure itself.

2. **Robustness to scenario termination timing**: Design scenarios where games terminate before units converge on objectives to test whether the event-driven temporal abstraction breaks down when convergence cannot be guaranteed.

3. **Scalability to larger board sizes**: Evaluate the 7×7 abstraction on 15×15 or 20×20 boards to determine whether the coarse representation remains effective as spatial complexity increases, or whether it requires retraining with different abstraction parameters.
