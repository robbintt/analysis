# Optimal Transportation and Alignment Between Gaussian Measures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03579
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03579
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Closed-form solutions for Gaussian optimal transport and IGW alignment with applications to neural network representation comparison

## Executive Summary
This work develops comprehensive closed-form solutions for Gaussian optimal transport (OT) and inner product Gromov-Wasserstein (IGW) alignment under quadratic costs. The authors address fundamental computational challenges in comparing and transforming heterogeneous datasets by providing analytic expressions that reduce complex optimization problems to tractable forms. Their contributions span both bimarginal and multimarginal settings, with applications to comparing neural network representations and clustering text embeddings.

The theoretical framework establishes new connections between Gaussian measures and optimal transport theory, demonstrating that when distributions are Gaussian, otherwise intractable problems become solvable in closed form. This enables efficient computation of distances and alignments that capture distributional differences beyond simple mean or covariance comparisons.

## Method Summary
The authors develop closed-form solutions for IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians, reducing the problem to quadratic optimization over unitary operators with tight analytic bounds. For centered Gaussians, they provide fully explicit formulas. They extend these results to IGW barycenters and univariate Gaussian distances. For multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs, they present a reduction to semidefinite programming and introduce a Burer-Monteiro algorithm that exploits rank-deficiency to reduce variables from O(d²p²) to O(d²p). The approach combines optimal transport theory with semidefinite programming and low-rank optimization techniques.

## Key Results
- Closed-form IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians reduces to quadratic optimization over unitary operators with tight analytic bounds
- IGW distance effectively compares neural network representations as alternative to CKA, showing strong negative correlation in practice
- Burer-Monteiro algorithm for multimarginal OT is significantly faster and more stable than interior point methods, especially for large p

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Gaussian assumption enables analytic tractability by allowing moment-based characterizations. Quadratic costs align naturally with Gaussian properties, making the Wasserstein distance computable via closed-form expressions. The IGW framework compares distributions through inner products rather than absolute values, making it suitable for relative comparisons. Low-rank structure in multimarginal problems enables efficient semidefinite relaxation.

## Foundational Learning

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Gaussian measures -> IGW formulation -> Unitary optimization -> Analytic solution
Critical path: Define Gaussian measures → Formulate IGW objective → Apply unitary optimization → Compute analytic solution
Design tradeoffs: Gaussianity assumption enables tractability but limits applicability vs. generality of numerical methods
Failure signatures: Poor alignment quality when unitary optimization converges to suboptimal solutions
First experiments:
1. Compute IGW distance between simple Gaussian distributions with known covariance structure
2. Compare IGW alignment results against standard Wasserstein distance on synthetic data
3. Validate Burer-Monteiro algorithm convergence on small-scale multimarginal OT problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Strong Gaussianity assumption restricts applicability to distributions that may not satisfy these requirements in practice
- Burer-Monteiro low-rank approximation may not hold for all problem instances, potentially affecting solution quality
- Practical tightness of analytic bounds requires further empirical validation across diverse problem parameters

## Confidence

**Closed-form IGW alignment formulas**: Medium - Theoretical derivations appear sound but practical performance depends heavily on unitary optimization quality
**Burer-Monteiro algorithm efficiency**: High - The rank-reduction approach is well-established in optimization literature
**IGW as CKA alternative**: Low - Correlation claims are based on limited experiments without statistical significance testing

## Next Checks

1. Benchmark IGW alignment against non-Gaussian baselines on real-world datasets where distributional assumptions may not hold
2. Systematically evaluate Burer-Monteiro solution quality across varying problem sizes and rank parameters
3. Conduct statistical tests comparing IGW distance correlation with CKA across multiple neural network architectures and datasets
