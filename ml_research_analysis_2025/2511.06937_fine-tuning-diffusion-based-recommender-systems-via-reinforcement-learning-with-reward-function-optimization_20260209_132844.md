# Fine-Tuning Diffusion-Based Recommender Systems via Reinforcement Learning with Reward Function Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.06937
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06937
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves up to 36.3% improvement on sequential recommendation tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of fine-tuning diffusion-based recommender systems, which are computationally expensive and prone to overfitting. The authors propose ReFiT, a novel framework that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion models. ReFiT formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function to directly reflect recommendation quality. This approach leverages high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, avoiding noisy feedback common in naive reward designs. Comprehensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that ReFiT achieves substantial performance gains while maintaining linear computational complexity and generalizing well across multiple recommendation scenarios.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes ReFiT, a framework that fine-tunes diffusion-based recommender systems using Reinforcement Learning. The key innovation is formulating the denoising trajectory as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and incorporating a collaborative signal-aware reward function. This reward function directly reflects recommendation quality by leveraging high-order connectivity, allowing for fine-grained optimization while avoiding the noisy feedback typical of naive reward designs. The approach aims to address the computational expense and overfitting issues associated with traditional fine-tuning methods for diffusion-based recommenders.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 36.3% improvement on sequential recommendation tasks
- Maintains linear computational complexity
- Demonstrates generalization across multiple recommendation scenarios
- Outperforms baseline methods on diverse real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by reformulating the diffusion-based recommender's denoising process as an MDP, where the agent learns to optimize the recommendation trajectory through interaction with a reward function that captures collaborative signals. The key mechanism is the collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly measures recommendation quality through high-order connectivity, rather than relying on indirect or noisy feedback signals. This allows the RL agent to make fine-grained adjustments to the denoising trajectory that specifically improve recommendation performance.

## Foundational Learning

**Markov Decision Process (MDP):** A mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. Why needed: To formalize the denoising trajectory optimization problem as a sequential decision process. Quick check: Verify that states, actions, and rewards are properly defined in the MDP formulation.

**Diffusion Models:** Generative models that learn to reverse a gradual noising process to generate data. Why needed: The target system being fine-tuned for recommendation tasks. Quick check: Confirm understanding of how denoising works in the context of recommendation.

**Collaborative Filtering:** A technique that makes predictions about user interests by collecting preferences from many users. Why needed: The reward function leverages collaborative signals to evaluate recommendation quality. Quick check: Ensure understanding of how high-order connectivity relates to collaborative filtering.

**Reinforcement Learning:** An area of machine learning concerned with how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Why needed: To optimize the denoising trajectory based on the reward signal. Quick check: Verify that the RL agent is properly trained to maximize the recommendation-oriented reward.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Diffusion model denoising process -> MDP formulation -> RL agent -> Reward function (collaborative signal-aware) -> Recommendation output

**Critical Path:** The core workflow involves taking noisy user-item interaction sequences, processing them through the diffusion model's denoising trajectory guided by the RL agent, which uses the collaborative signal-aware reward function to evaluate and optimize recommendations at each step.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades off the computational overhead of RL fine-tuning against the benefits of improved recommendation quality and reduced overfitting. The use of collaborative signals in the reward function provides more direct feedback but may introduce complexity in reward computation.

**Failure Signatures:** Potential failures include poor convergence of the RL agent if the reward signal is too sparse, suboptimal recommendations if the MDP formulation doesn't capture relevant aspects of the recommendation process, or computational inefficiency if the RL fine-tuning becomes too expensive relative to the gains.

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify the MDP formulation correctly models the denoising trajectory by testing on a simple synthetic dataset
2. Validate the reward function's effectiveness by comparing recommendation quality with and without the collaborative signal component
3. Test RL agent convergence and stability on a small-scale real-world dataset before scaling up

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can Large Language Models (LLMs) be integrated into the ReFiT framework to construct a more robust reward function that adaptively generates feedback based on semantic user preferences?

**Open Question 2:** How can the ReFiT framework be adapted for diffusion models that operate on latent embeddings (e.g., HDRM) rather than direct interaction sequences?

**Open Question 3:** Is the reliance on cosine similarity to identify "similar users" for the reward function robust against data sparsity compared to graph-based similarity metrics?

## Limitations

- The framework's performance gains are primarily demonstrated on sequential recommendation tasks, with less evidence for other recommendation scenarios
- No explicit computational complexity analysis is provided to verify the claimed linear complexity
- The reward function may struggle in cold-start scenarios where collaborative signals are weak or absent

## Confidence

**High:** Performance claims for sequential recommendation tasks (36.3% improvement)
**Medium:** Generalizability across multiple recommendation scenarios (limited cross-dataset validation)
**Medium:** Computational complexity claims (no explicit analysis provided)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of the collaborative signal-aware reward function versus standard RL reward designs, including analysis of performance on cold-start and sparse-data scenarios.
2. Perform detailed computational complexity analysis comparing ReFiT's training and inference times with standard diffusion-based recommenders across varying dataset sizes and model dimensions.
3. Test ReFiT's performance on datasets from domains outside the original evaluation (e.g., music, news, or social media recommendations) to validate the claimed generalization across multiple recommendation scenarios.
