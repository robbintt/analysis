# An Operational Deep Learning System for Satellite-Based High-Resolution Global Nowcasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13050
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13050
- Reference count: 24
- Global MetNet significantly outperforms traditional NWP models like HRES and HRRR, achieving higher skill scores across all precipitation rates and lead times

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Global MetNet, a deep learning system for high-resolution global precipitation nowcasting. The model uses geostationary satellite imagery and NASA's GPM CORRA dataset to predict rainfall for the next 12 hours at 0.05° spatial and 15-minute temporal resolution. Global MetNet significantly outperforms traditional NWP models like HRES and HRRR, achieving higher skill scores across all precipitation rates and lead times. Notably, it reduces the accuracy gap between Global North and South, delivering better forecasts in data-sparse tropical regions than even high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US. The system generates forecasts in under a minute, making it suitable for real-time deployment and already operational on Google Search.

## Method Summary
Global MetNet is an encoder-decoder architecture trained to predict precipitation up to 12 hours ahead at 0.05° spatial resolution. The model ingests geostationary satellite mosaics (17 channels from 7 satellites), NWP analysis/forecasts (HRES atmospheric and surface variables), ground radar (where available), and auxiliary datasets like IMERG Early. Inputs are concatenated along channels and processed through a space-to-depth operation before passing through a 4-stage residual encoder (256→384 channels) with lead-time conditioning via FiLM layers. The decoder produces probabilistic categorical outputs over 30 precipitation rate bins, with CSI-optimized thresholds calibrated on held-out data for operational deployment.

## Key Results
- Global MetNet achieves 0.08-0.11 higher CSI than HRES and 0.03-0.08 higher than HRRR across all precipitation rates and lead times
- The model reduces the accuracy gap between Global North and South, performing better in tropical regions than NWP models achieve in the US
- Sub-minute inference latency enables real-time deployment, with the system already operational on Google Search

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-modal data fusion compensates for sparse ground radar in tropical regions.
- Mechanism: Geostationary satellite mosaics (17 channels from 7 satellites at ~1km nominal resolution) provide real-time cloud-top observations. These are combined with NWP forecasts (HRES atmospheric/surface variables) and GPM CORRA training targets. The model learns to map satellite-derived cloud signatures to surface precipitation rates via supervised learning against CORRA's combined radar-radiometer retrievals.
- Core assumption: Satellite-observed cloud properties and NWP atmospheric states contain sufficient information to predict surface precipitation without local ground radar.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It primarily leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's (GPM) CORRA dataset and geostationary satellite data, along with global NWP data"
  - [section 3.1.3]: Lists 7 geostationary satellites merged into 18 mosaics at 30-minute intervals
  - [corpus]: TUPANN (arxiv:2511.05471) similarly uses satellite-only inputs, achieving FMR=0.475, supporting the feasibility of satellite-based nowcasting
- Break condition: If satellite cloud-top observations decouple from surface precipitation (e.g., virga in dry regions, shallow warm rain without strong cloud signatures), skill will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Lead-time conditioning enables single model to predict 0-12 hour forecasts.
- Mechanism: Lead time (0-12 hours, 15-min intervals) is encoded as a 32-dimensional embedding via FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation). This embedding is applied as both additive and multiplicative factors before each activation function throughout the encoder, allowing the network's internal computations to adapt based on forecast horizon.
- Core assumption: Temporal dynamics of precipitation evolution can be captured through conditioning rather than explicit recurrent or autoregressive structures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.2]: "the embedding is applied both as an additive and multiplicative factor (Perez et al., 2018) to the model inputs and to hidden representations before each activation function"
  - [section 3.2.1]: "Instead of using a recurrent layer like an LSTM to process the time sequence of inputs, we concatenate the features from different input timesteps along the channel dimension"
  - [corpus]: Weak/no direct corpus evidence for FiLM-style conditioning in nowcasting; assumption based on paper's architectural description
- Break condition: If precipitation dynamics require explicit temporal state tracking beyond what static conditioning provides, longer lead times may exhibit degraded coherence.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Probabilistic categorical outputs with post-hoc threshold calibration optimize operational utility.
- Mechanism: The model outputs a full categorical Softmax distribution over 30 discretized precipitation rate bins at each location and lead time. After training, probability thresholds for each bin/lead-time combination are calibrated on a held-out dataset (May 2022-May 2023) to maximize CSI. This decouples training (log-likelihood) from deployment (CSI-optimized decisions).
- Core assumption: The calibrated thresholds generalize from the held-out period to operational conditions; CSI is the appropriate metric for operational utility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant improvements across key metrics like the critical success index"
  - [section 3.2.4]: "These thresholds are found by maximizing the CSI score on a held-out evaluation dataset"
  - [corpus]: RainPro-8 (arxiv:2505.10271) similarly targets probabilistic precipitation forecasting, suggesting this is an established approach
- Break condition: If precipitation climatology shifts (e.g., due to climate change) or extreme events fall outside training distribution, calibrated thresholds may become suboptimal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Critical Success Index (CSI)**
  - Why needed here: CSI is the primary evaluation metric. It measures hits / (hits + misses + false alarms), penalizing both missed events and false alarms without double-counting correct negatives.
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts rain everywhere all the time, would it have high CSI? (Answer: No—high false alarms would reduce CSI despite high recall.)

- Concept: **Space-to-Depth Operation**
  - Why needed here: Used to reduce spatial resolution while preserving information by stacking spatial blocks into additional channels. Applied to 0.05° inputs before feeding to the network.
  - Quick check question: Given a 4×4 feature map, what are the dimensions after space-to-depth with block size 2? (Answer: 2×2 with 4× original channels.)

- Concept: **FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)**
  - Why needed here: The mechanism by which lead time conditioning is applied throughout the network via learned affine transformations (γ·x + β).
  - Quick check question: Why use both additive and multiplicative modulation rather than just one? (Answer: Multiplicative scales feature magnitude; additive shifts baseline—both provide complementary expressivity.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Geostationary mosaics (17ch × 3 timesteps) + HRES (103ch) + ground radar (1ch × 6 timesteps) + IMERG Early (1ch × 6 timesteps) + elevation/lat/lon → space-to-depth → 4 stages of 8 residual blocks (256→384 channels) with FiLM lead-time conditioning → decoder upsampling → Softmax over 30 bins → CSI-optimized threshold calibration → deterministic forecast output

- Critical path: Satellite mosaic ingestion → space-to-depth → residual encoder with lead-time FiLM → decoder upsampling → Softmax over 30 bins → threshold application → deterministic forecast output. Latency: <1 minute.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Wet bias at high precipitation rates**: Model overpredicts intense rainfall; justified for safety but reduces precision. Can tune thresholds differently if bias minimization is prioritized.
  - **Space-to-depth vs. downsampling**: Preserves information but increases memory/compute. Required to fit global 0.05° grid into memory.
  - **No explicit temporal modeling**: Concatenating timesteps along channels is simpler than LSTM/Transformer but may limit temporal coherence at longer lead times.
  - **CORRA as training target**: Sparse (2.5-day revisit) but globally consistent. Limits training data for extreme events.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Over-smoothed spatial structures**: Heavy precipitation may appear diffusely spread rather than sharply localized. Case studies show this in tropical cyclone rain bands.
  - **Degraded skill at extreme rates (>25 mm/hr)**: Sparse training data leads to noisy evaluation; model may overpredict.
  - **No improvement from radar inputs in radar-sparse regions**: Expected behavior; radar input only helps where available.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablate geostationary satellite input** on a held-out tropical region (e.g., West Africa during monsoon). Expect CSI drop of 0.03-0.05 at short lead times per ablation studies. This validates satellite importance.
  2. **Vary lead-time conditioning strategy**: Compare FiLM conditioning vs. no conditioning vs. lead time as input channel. Measure CSI degradation at longer lead times to test mechanism.
  3. **Calibrate thresholds for different operational objectives**: Compare CSI-optimized vs. frequency-bias-optimized thresholds. Expect bias reduction with minimal CSI loss per paper's claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can the "wet bias" (overprediction) and the lack of realistic spatial structures in intense precipitation events be reduced without compromising the model's high recall?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion acknowledges the model tends to "over-predict intense rainfall" and lacks "realistic looking spatial structures," identifying this as an area for refinement.
- **Why unresolved:** The current model optimizes probability thresholds for Critical Success Index (CSI), which inherently favors overprediction to avoid missing events, resulting in diffuse spatial structures for heavy rain.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A model version that achieves a Frequency Bias closer to 1.0 at high precipitation rates (>25 mm/hr) while maintaining or improving CSI and Fractions Skill Score (FSS) at fine scales.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent does incorporating lightning activity data improve the nowcasting skill for deep convective systems?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state an aim to "enhance the model by incorporating additional observational data sources, such as lightning activity" in future work.
- **Why unresolved:** The current input modalities (satellite, NWP, radar) capture atmospheric state and moisture, but lightning provides specific proxy data on convective intensity that is currently unutilized in this architecture.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies demonstrating a positive delta in CSI for deep convective events (such as the West Africa case study) when lightning data is added as an input channel.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the 2.5-day revisit rate of the GPM CORRA training target impose a fundamental limit on the model's ability to generalize extreme precipitation events?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper notes that CORRA is "sparse" and "limits the amount of extreme precipitation data available for training," while results in Figure 2 show visible noise at the highest precipitation rates.
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the performance noise at high rates is solely an evaluation artifact or if the model is data-limited regarding extreme events due to the training target's sparsity.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparison showing significantly higher skill for extremes in regions with dense ground-radar training data versus those trained solely on sparse satellite overpasses.

## Limitations
- The model's reliance on satellite cloud-top observations assumes sufficient correlation between cloud properties and surface precipitation, which may break down in dry climates or with shallow warm rain
- CORRA's 2.5-day revisit cycle limits training data for extreme events and creates temporal discontinuities in training
- Performance at precipitation rates >25 mm/hr shows noisier evaluation due to sparse training samples

## Confidence
- **Global skill improvement over NWP (High):** Extensive evaluation across all precipitation rates and lead times shows consistent CSI gains (0.05-0.08) against HRES and HRRR, with statistically significant differences.
- **Reducing Global North-South accuracy gap (Medium):** While demonstrated in comparisons, this claim depends heavily on the chosen evaluation regions and may vary with climate patterns.
- **Sub-minute inference latency (High):** Architecture and implementation details support this claim, though actual deployment may vary with infrastructure.
- **Safety-critical wet bias (High):** This is an intentional design choice with clear calibration procedures, though its optimality depends on specific operational requirements.

## Next Checks
1. **Regional skill breakdown validation:** Conduct systematic CSI evaluation by Köppen climate zones to quantify where satellite-based predictions excel or degrade, particularly in arid vs. tropical regions.
2. **Temporal generalization test:** Evaluate model performance during extreme precipitation events outside the training distribution (e.g., record-breaking rainfall) to assess robustness to climate variability.
3. **Radar-augmented vs. satellite-only comparison:** Implement Global MetNet variants with and without radar inputs in different regions to quantify the marginal value of ground radar in areas where it becomes available.
