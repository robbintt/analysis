- InsightGUIDE is an AI-powered tool that guides critical reading of scientific literature, designed to assist rather than replace the reader.

## Executive Summary
InsightGUIDE is an AI-powered tool designed to assist rather than replace the reader when critically engaging with scientific literature. It operationalizes expert reading methodologies through a structured system prompt, generating concise, actionable insights alongside the original PDF. The system uses OCR for text extraction and an LLM guided by curated prompts to produce structured analysis. A preliminary qualitative comparison showed InsightGUIDE outputs are more structured and actionable than generic LLM summaries, with explicit section-by-section analysis, identification of key contributions, critical questions, and non-linear navigation tips. The tool addresses the problem of passive consumption in current LLM summarization tools by keeping the source document central to the reading process. The complete system is open-sourced for community use and evaluation.

## Method Summary
The method involves a two-stage pipeline: first, OCR (Mistral) extracts text from the PDF and converts it to Markdown; second, a structured system prompt guides an LLM (DeepSeek-R1) to produce section-by-section analysis, critical questions, and navigation tips. The backend API (Python/FastAPI) orchestrates these steps, while the frontend (Next.js/React) displays a dual-pane interface with the PDF on one side and AI-generated insights on the other. The approach encodes expert reading heuristics (such as those from Keshav and Ng) into the prompt, shifting the LLM from summarization to critical guidance. The system is modular, allowing for different OCR or LLM models.

## Key Results
- InsightGUIDE outputs are more structured and actionable than generic LLM summaries.
- The system produces explicit section-by-section analysis, identifies key contributions, and highlights critical questions.
- Non-linear navigation tips and cross-references to figures/tables are included.
- A preliminary qualitative comparison shows improved critical engagement over passive consumption models.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Encoding expert reading heuristics into a structured system prompt produces more actionable analysis than generic summarization.
- Mechanism: The prompt operationalizes three expert strategies—sectional deconstruction, critical questioning, and non-linear navigation—forcing the LLM to adopt an analytical stance rather than a summarization stance. This transforms output from continuous prose into a structured "map" with explicit signals (e.g., priority icons, methodological limitations).
- Core assumption: The underlying LLM possesses sufficient reasoning capability to follow complex, multi-component instructions when they are explicitly structured; the bottleneck is interaction paradigm, not model capacity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It operationalizes expert reading methodologies through a structured system prompt, generating concise, actionable insights alongside the original PDF."
  - [section IV]: "Our system prompt operationalizes this theory through three key components... forcing the LLM to move beyond summarization and act as a structured, critical guide."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence—neighbor papers (PaperHelper, AISAC) focus on RAG and multi-agent systems rather than prompt-driven methodology encoding. Comparative validation remains limited to this paper's preliminary evaluation.
- Break condition: If the LLM fails to consistently follow multi-part instructions, or if the prompt's expert heuristics mismatch the document type (e.g., theoretical papers vs. empirical studies), output quality degrades. Paper acknowledges the static prompt may not suit all document types.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A dual-pane interface with PDF alongside generated insights maintains source centrality and encourages active cross-referencing.
- Mechanism: By visually anchoring the original document and allowing either pane to expand, the interface reduces the likelihood that users passively consume AI output. It creates friction against treating the summary as a replacement for reading.
- Core assumption: Users will leverage both panes; interface design alone is sufficient to shift reading behavior without explicit behavioral nudges or training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "...designed to assist rather than replace the reader... keeping the source document central to the reading process."
  - [section III-B]: "This design keeps the source document as the primary focus, encouraging active cross-referencing and preventing the AI-generated content from replacing the act of reading."
  - [corpus]: No corpus validation; neighbor papers do not evaluate interface paradigms for reading assistance.
- Break condition: If users maximize the insights pane and ignore the PDF, the mechanism fails. No user study data yet confirms behavioral impact.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Separating OCR from analysis in a two-stage pipeline allows modular substitution of both text extraction and reasoning components.
- Mechanism: Mistral OCR converts PDF to Markdown; the backend then sends extracted text plus system prompt to an OpenAI-compatible LLM. This decoupling enables swapping OCR providers or models without re-architecting.
- Core assumption: OCR quality is sufficiently high that extraction errors do not cascade into critical analysis failures; Markdown preservation maintains structural signals needed for section-aware prompting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-A]: "The backend then executes a two-stage AI process: first, it uses an OCR service to extract the paper's text, and second, it uses an LLM guided by our system prompt to generate the analytical insights."
  - [section III-C]: "While the system currently uses DeepSeek-R1, its modular design allows for any compatible model, including other proprietary or locally-hosted alternatives."
  - [corpus]: Weak—neighbor systems (e.g., AISAC, SpectraQuery) use RAG with vector stores rather than OCR-first pipelines for scientific documents.
- Break condition: If OCR fails on scanned documents, complex equations, or figures with embedded text, downstream analysis inherits errors. Paper notes: "Errors or inaccuracies in the text extraction or the model's generation will propagate to the final output."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-pass expert reading strategies (Keshav's three-pass approach, Andrew Ng's lecture methodology)
  - Why needed here: The system prompt directly encodes these strategies—skim for structure first, then dive into methodology. Understanding this helps engineers appreciate why the prompt is structured section-by-section rather than as a single summary request.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why an expert reader skims the abstract and conclusion before reading methods, and how InsightGUIDE's prompt mimics this?

- Concept: Prompt engineering for structured JSON-style outputs
  - Why needed here: The backend expects structured analysis (JSON response) with specific fields (key contributions, critical questions, navigation tips). The prompt must constrain the LLM to produce parseable output.
  - Quick check question: What would happen if the LLM returned unstructured prose instead of the expected JSON schema?

- Concept: Asynchronous API design for long-running external calls
  - Why needed here: The backend uses FastAPI specifically for async handling of OCR and LLM calls, which can take 10+ seconds. Blocking calls would degrade user experience.
  - Quick check question: Why is async essential when orchestrating multiple external AI services in sequence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Frontend (Next.js/React SPA) -> Backend API (Python FastAPI) -> Mistral OCR API -> DeepSeek R1 (or compatible LLM)
- Critical path:
  1. User uploads PDF → Frontend POSTs to backend `/analyze` endpoint.
  2. Backend forwards PDF to Mistral OCR → receives Markdown.
  3. Backend concatenates Markdown with system prompt → sends to LLM API.
  4. LLM returns structured insights → backend wraps as JSON → frontend renders in left pane alongside PDF.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - OCR-first vs. RAG: Chose OCR for full-text extraction (preserves document structure) rather than chunked retrieval (better for multi-document QA but loses section context).
  - Static vs. adaptive prompts: Current prompt is one-size-fits-all; paper acknowledges this may not suit literature reviews or theoretical papers.
  - Single-model vs. ensemble: Uses one LLM for simplicity; no fallback or cross-validation against a second model.
- Failure signatures:
  - Empty or malformed JSON from LLM → frontend cannot render insights; backend should validate schema before responding.
  - OCR returns garbled text (especially equations/figures) → LLM generates plausible but ungrounded analysis.
  - Long documents exceed context window → truncated input leads to incomplete analysis (no explicit handling mentioned).
  - Rate limiting from Mistral or DeepSeek APIs → unhandled async errors; backend should implement retries with exponential backoff.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the system on 5 papers from different domains (empirical, theoretical, survey) and categorize where the static prompt produces weak or irrelevant outputs.
  2. Swap DeepSeek-R1 for a smaller local model (e.g., Llama 3.2) and compare output structure quality to quantify model dependency.
  3. Introduce a schema validation layer that rejects malformed LLM responses and triggers a retry with simplified prompt—measure reduction in frontend rendering failures.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Does the use of InsightGUIDE quantifiably improve reading comprehension and critical analysis depth compared to generic summarizers?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the need to "move beyond our preliminary case study and conduct a large-scale user study" to measure impact on comprehension.
  - Why unresolved: The current evaluation is a single-case qualitative comparison focusing on output structure rather than user performance metrics.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Controlled user trials measuring retention, understanding, and reading time across different research domains.

- How does the static, "opinionated" prompt perform when applied to non-empirical scientific documents?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges the current "one-size-fits-all" prompt may not be optimal for "literature reviews, theoretical papers, or survey articles."
  - Why unresolved: The system operationalizes heuristics for empirical research (e.g., distinct Methods/Results analysis), which may not map to theoretical argumentation.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A qualitative analysis of system outputs when processing theoretical papers versus empirical studies.

- Does the structured prompt architecture effectively mitigate factual hallucinations better than generic prompting?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that while prompts mitigate risks, errors in OCR and LLM reasoning "will propagate," and the case study did not rigorously evaluate factual faithfulness.
  - Why unresolved: The evaluation focused on the presence of structural elements (e.g., critical questions) rather than the accuracy of the extracted content.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An error analysis comparing the factual consistency of InsightGUIDE's insights against a ground-truth extraction.

## Limitations
- The static, expert-encoded prompt may not generalize well across all scientific disciplines or paper types—particularly theoretical or literature-review papers.
- OCR quality directly impacts downstream analysis, yet the system lacks explicit error handling for extraction failures, especially with complex equations or figures.
- The qualitative comparison against generic LLM summaries is preliminary and lacks quantitative metrics or larger sample sizes.

## Confidence
- **High**: The dual-pane interface design effectively maintains source document centrality and the modular architecture enables component substitution.
- **Medium**: The mechanism of encoding expert reading heuristics into structured prompts produces more actionable analysis than generic summarization, based on limited qualitative comparison.
- **Low**: Generalization across paper types and OCR reliability under adverse conditions remain unproven.

## Next Checks
1. Test the system on 10 papers spanning diverse scientific domains (empirical, theoretical, survey) to identify prompt limitations and document-type-specific failures.
2. Implement and evaluate schema validation with LLM response retries when malformed JSON is detected, measuring reduction in frontend rendering failures.
3. Conduct a user study comparing reading comprehension and critical engagement between InsightGUIDE and generic LLM summarization tools using standardized assessment metrics.
