# Autoregressivity in the Latent Space of a GP-VAE Language Model: An Empirical Ablation Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24102
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24102
- Authors: Yves Ruffenach

- Primary result: Latent autoregression in GP-VAE language models produces more structured latent dynamics and greater long-horizon stability compared to non-autoregressive variants

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic ablation study comparing different autoregressive strategies in language modeling, specifically examining how latent space autoregression affects model behavior. The study evaluates three architectures: a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, a non-autoregressive ablation with independent latent variables, and a standard autoregressive Transformer baseline. Results demonstrate that latent autoregression leads to latent trajectories more compatible with the Gaussian process prior and exhibits greater long-horizon stability. The findings highlight latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling.

## Method Summary
The study employs a Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoder (GP-VAE) framework where the encoder maps sequences of tokens to latent variables, and the decoder reconstructs the original sequence from these latents. The autoregressive variant conditions each latent variable on previous latents in the sequence, while the non-autoregressive ablation treats latents as independent random variables. Both models are trained on medium-scale corpora with relatively short context lengths. The Gaussian process prior regularizes the latent space dynamics, encouraging smooth trajectories that respect temporal dependencies. The comparative analysis focuses on latent trajectory coherence, long-range stability, and the interaction between latent and token-level autoregressive modeling.

## Key Results
- Latent autoregression produces structured latent trajectories that remain coherent over extended generations
- Removing autoregression in the latent space results in degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior
- Within the tested regime, effective sequential modeling capacity is primarily governed by latent dynamics rather than decoder architecture operating in token space

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Latent autoregression works by imposing temporal dependencies in the latent space that regularize the model's representation of sequential information. The Gaussian process prior provides a principled framework for encouraging smooth, continuous trajectories in latent space that respect the underlying temporal structure of language. By conditioning each latent variable on previous latents, the model learns to encode long-range dependencies that would be difficult to capture through token-level autoregression alone. This creates a hierarchical autoregressive structure where the latent dynamics handle coarse-grained temporal organization while the decoder manages fine-grained token-level predictions.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
   - Why needed: Provides the basic framework for learning compressed latent representations of sequential data
   - Quick check: Can you explain the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and its role in training?

2. **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**
   - Why needed: Supplies a probabilistic prior over latent trajectories that encourages smoothness and temporal coherence
   - Quick check: Can you describe how the GP kernel function influences latent space geometry?

3. **Autoregressive Modeling**
   - Why needed: Enables modeling of sequential dependencies by conditioning predictions on previous outputs
   - Quick check: Can you contrast causal vs. non-causal autoregressive structures?

4. **Latent Variable Models**
   - Why needed: Allows separation of high-level sequential structure from low-level token predictions
   - Quick check: Can you explain the trade-off between latent capacity and decoder capacity?

5. **Sequential Regularization**
   - Why needed: Prevents latent collapse and ensures meaningful temporal organization in the latent space
   - Quick check: Can you identify what happens when latent autoregression is removed?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Encoder -> Latent Space (with/without autoregression) -> GP Prior -> Decoder

**Critical Path:**
Input tokens → Encoder → Latent variables → GP Regularization → Decoder → Output tokens

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Latent autoregression vs. computational overhead
- GP kernel complexity vs. training stability
- Latent dimensionality vs. representational capacity
- Balance between latent and token-level autoregressive modeling

**Failure Signatures:**
- Latent collapse when autoregression is removed
- Unstable long-range generations without temporal regularization
- Degraded performance when latent capacity is mismatched with task complexity

**First Experiments:**
1. Train the non-autoregressive ablation and compare latent trajectory smoothness to the autoregressive variant
2. Generate long sequences and measure stability metrics across different time horizons
3. Vary the GP kernel bandwidth and observe effects on latent space organization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental scope limited to one corpus and relatively short context lengths
- Focus on GP-VAE framework without exploring alternative latent autoregressive structures
- Quantitative metrics for structural benefits of latent autoregression remain limited
- Interaction between latent dynamics and decoder capacity not fully characterized

## Confidence
- Medium for core finding that latent autoregression improves long-range coherence within tested regime
- Low for broader claims about architectural complementarity and optimal capacity allocation

## Next Checks
1. Test the GP-VAE autoregressive model on multiple corpora with varying sequence lengths and domain characteristics to assess generalizability
2. Conduct controlled experiments varying the latent space dimensionality and GP kernel parameters to identify optimal configurations for different task types
3. Compare performance against non-GP latent autoregressive architectures to determine whether observed benefits stem specifically from GP prior or from autoregression more broadly
