# Limits of Emergent Reasoning of Large Language Models in Agentic Frameworks for Deterministic Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15974
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15974
- Reference count: 40
- Large language models exhibit performance collapse at lower complexity levels when given environment interfaces for deterministic games

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether providing large language models (LLMs) with interactive environment interfaces for deterministic games like Tower of Hanoi can overcome performance collapse in reasoning tasks. The authors developed an agentic framework where models can make moves, observe resulting states, and reprompt themselves step-by-step. Surprisingly, they found that environment access does not delay or prevent performance collapse - in fact, it occurs at lower complexity levels than in baseline one-shot generation. Policy analysis revealed that LLM behavior increasingly diverges from both optimal and random policies as problem complexity increases, indicating deterministic pattern execution rather than genuine reasoning. The models frequently exhibit looping behavior, repeatedly visiting the same states without learning from past mistakes. These findings suggest that apparent reasoning capabilities in LLMs are largely due to high-probability mode following rather than emergent reasoning, reinforcing that scaling alone is insufficient for developing general-purpose reasoning abilities.

## Method Summary
The authors developed an interactive agentic framework for LLMs to solve deterministic games like Tower of Hanoi and Tic-Tac-Toe. The framework provides environment interfaces where models can make moves, observe resulting states, and reprompt themselves iteratively. The researchers compared this step-by-step generation approach against baseline one-shot generation methods. They analyzed model performance across increasing complexity levels, examining policy adherence to optimal and random strategies. The study employed comprehensive policy analysis to track how LLM behavior diverges from expected patterns as problems become more complex, with particular attention to looping behavior and state visitation patterns.

## Key Results
- Environment access causes performance collapse at lower complexity levels than baseline one-shot generation
- LLM behavior increasingly diverges from both optimal and random policies as problem complexity increases
- Models exhibit deterministic pattern execution rather than genuine reasoning, frequently showing looping behavior without learning from mistakes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **Tower of Hanoi mechanics**: Why needed - to understand the deterministic game used for testing; Quick check - can identify valid moves and goal states
- **LLM performance collapse**: Why needed - central phenomenon being investigated; Quick check - observe accuracy degradation at specific complexity thresholds
- **Policy analysis methods**: Why needed - to compare LLM behavior against optimal/random strategies; Quick check - can differentiate between optimal, random, and LLM-generated policies
- **Mode following in LLMs**: Why needed - to understand why apparent reasoning emerges; Quick check - identify high-probability token sequences that mimic reasoning
- **Deterministic pattern execution**: Why needed - key finding about LLM limitations; Quick check - detect repeated state visitation without learning
- **Agentic framework design**: Why needed - to understand how environment access was implemented; Quick check - can trace move selection, state observation, and reprompting flow

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Input -> Agent Framework -> LLM Model -> Environment Interface -> State Feedback -> Reprompt Cycle

**Critical Path**: Problem statement → LLM reasoning step → Move execution → State observation → Self-reprompt → Repeat until solution or failure

**Design Tradeoffs**: Interactive step-by-step approach enables learning from state feedback but may expose limitations faster than one-shot generation; environment access provides more information but doesn't prevent performance collapse

**Failure Signatures**: Performance collapse at lower complexity with environment access; increasing divergence from optimal policies; deterministic looping behavior; state repetition without learning

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare performance across different deterministic games beyond Tower of Hanoi; 2) Test varying numbers of reasoning steps allowed before reprompting; 3) Analyze impact of different prompt engineering approaches on performance stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings may not generalize beyond Tower of Hanoi and Tic-Tac-Toe to all deterministic games
- Precise mechanisms driving earlier performance collapse with environment access require further investigation
- Alternative explanations such as optimization for specific reward structures cannot be fully excluded

## Confidence
- High confidence: Performance collapse occurs earlier with environment access; LLMs exhibit looping behavior without learning
- Medium confidence: LLM behavior increasingly diverges from optimal policies with complexity; emergent reasoning is largely illusory
- Low confidence: These findings generalize to all deterministic games; scaling alone is insufficient for reasoning (requires broader evidence)

## Next Checks
1. Test additional deterministic games beyond Tower of Hanoi and Tic-Tac-Toe to assess generalizability of the performance collapse phenomenon
2. Implement and compare against traditional search algorithms (like A* or minimax) to better contextualize LLM performance relative to established approaches
3. Conduct ablation studies removing different components of the agentic framework to isolate which elements contribute most to the earlier performance collapse
