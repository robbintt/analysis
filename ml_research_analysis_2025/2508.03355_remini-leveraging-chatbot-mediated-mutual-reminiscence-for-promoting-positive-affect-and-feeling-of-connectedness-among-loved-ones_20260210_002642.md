# Remini: Leveraging Chatbot-Mediated Mutual Reminiscence for Promoting Positive Affect and Feeling of Connectedness among Loved Ones

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03355
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Structured LLM-guided reminiscence increases positive affect and emotional connection in close partners

## Executive Summary
Remini is a chatbot system designed to facilitate mutual reminiscence between close partners through structured conversational guidance. The system employs the Social Functions of Autobiographical Memory (SFAM) framework and uses LLM-powered prompts to support reciprocal self-disclosure and co-constructed memory narratives. The system guides conversations through five phases: rapport building, memory narration, elaboration, reflection, and summary. Compared to a minimal-guidance baseline chatbot, Remini significantly enhanced positive affect, perceived emotional synchrony, partner responsiveness, conversation engagement, and the richness of memory details. Participants reported deeper emotional expression and stronger feelings of connection, demonstrating that structured conversational facilitation can deepen shared memories and psychosocial benefits.

## Method Summary
The study employed a within-subjects experimental design where pairs of close partners engaged in reminiscence sessions with two different chatbot conditions: Remini (with structured conversational guidance) and a minimal-guidance baseline. The Remini condition used LLM-generated prompts based on the SFAM framework to guide participants through five phases of conversation, while the baseline provided minimal prompting. Participants completed reminiscence sessions in both conditions, with order counterbalanced across pairs. The study measured positive affect using the PANAS scale, perceived emotional synchrony, partner responsiveness, conversation engagement, and the richness of memory details through both self-report measures and qualitative analysis of conversation transcripts.

## Key Results
- Remini significantly increased positive affect compared to the baseline condition
- Participants reported higher perceived emotional synchrony and partner responsiveness with Remini
- Memory narrations in Remini sessions contained significantly more detail and emotional depth

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Remini works by structuring reminiscence conversations to maximize the social benefits of shared memory recall. The five-phase conversational structure (rapport building, memory narration, elaboration, reflection, and summary) provides scaffolding that helps participants access and articulate memories more fully. The LLM-generated prompts based on the SFAM framework encourage reciprocal self-disclosure and co-construction of memory narratives, which research shows enhances emotional connection. The chatbot's role as a neutral facilitator allows it to ask probing questions and maintain conversational momentum without the interpersonal dynamics that might inhibit deeper sharing between partners.

## Foundational Learning
- Social Functions of Autobiographical Memory (SFAM) framework: Provides theoretical basis for how shared reminiscence builds connection; needed to design effective conversational prompts; quick check: verify prompts map to SFAM dimensions
- Reciprocal self-disclosure: Mutual sharing of personal information builds trust and intimacy; needed to understand why mutual reminiscence works; quick check: measure disclosure reciprocity in transcripts
- Co-construction of memory narratives: Partners collaboratively build shared understanding of memories; needed to design elaboration and reflection phases; quick check: analyze narrative overlap between partners
- Five-phase conversational structure: Provides scaffolding for progressively deeper reminiscence; needed to maintain engagement and depth; quick check: test completion rates and depth metrics across phases
- LLM-generated prompts: Enables dynamic, context-aware conversation guidance; needed to adapt to participant responses; quick check: evaluate prompt relevance through participant feedback
- Positive affect measurement: PANAS scale used to quantify emotional benefits; needed to assess impact on wellbeing; quick check: establish baseline affect levels before sessions

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Participants -> Chatbot Interface -> LLM Engine -> SFAM Prompt Generator -> Conversation Manager -> Feedback Loop
- Critical path: Participant input → LLM prompt generation → Conversational guidance → Memory narration/elaboration → Positive affect enhancement
- Design tradeoffs: Structured guidance vs. conversational naturalness; comprehensive measurement vs. participant burden; LLM complexity vs. system reliability
- Failure signatures: Poor prompt relevance leading to disengagement; insufficient emotional depth in generated memories; participants feeling constrained by structure
- First experiments: (1) Test LLM prompt quality with pilot participants; (2) Measure baseline reminiscence patterns without guidance; (3) Validate SFAM framework mapping to conversational prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of control for pre-existing relationship dynamics that might influence reminiscence quality
- No follow-up to assess durability of positive affect and connectedness gains
- Absence of objective behavioral coding to validate self-reported engagement measures

## Confidence
- Increased positive affect and perceived emotional synchrony: Medium confidence (within-study comparisons, no external validation)
- Enhanced memory detail and emotional expression: High confidence within experimental context, Low generalizability to other relationship types
- Essential nature of five-phase structure: Low confidence (no comparative analysis of alternative structures)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a 2-week follow-up study to assess persistence of positive affect and connectedness gains
2. Implement behavioral coding of conversation transcripts to validate self-reported engagement and emotional synchrony
3. Test the system with diverse relationship types (friends, family members, long-distance partners) to evaluate generalizability
