# Ensemble of Pre-Trained Models for Long-Tailed Trajectory Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.13914
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13914
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Ensemble of three transformer-based models improves trajectory prediction by ~10% over best individual model on NuScenes and Argoverse datasets

## Executive Summary
This work addresses trajectory prediction in urban environments through ensemble modeling of pre-trained deep learning models. The authors propose combining three state-of-the-art transformer-based models—Autobot, Wayformer, and MTR—using a simple confidence-weighted averaging approach without any retraining or fine-tuning. The ensemble demonstrates approximately 10% performance improvement over the best individual model, with particularly strong gains in long-tail scenarios. The results validate that combining diverse models can leverage their complementary strengths while mitigating individual weaknesses, offering a practical path to improved prediction accuracy in autonomous driving applications.

## Method Summary
The authors investigate ensemble modeling for the complex multidimensional regression problem of trajectory prediction in urban environments. Their approach combines three pre-trained transformer-based models—Autobot, Wayformer, and MTR—using a simple confidence-weighted averaging method. This design choice avoids costly retraining or fine-tuning while still achieving significant performance gains. The ensemble is evaluated on two standard benchmark datasets: NuScenes and Argoverse. By leveraging the complementary strengths of different architectures, the ensemble approach demonstrates consistent improvements across the dataset distribution, with particular effectiveness in long-tail scenarios where individual models struggle.

## Key Results
- Ensemble approach improves performance by approximately 10% over the best individual prediction model
- Improvements are particularly notable in long-tail metrics, addressing challenging rare scenarios
- Performance gains hold consistently across the dataset distribution, not just in specific segments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ensemble approach works by combining the complementary strengths of three different transformer-based models. Each model has unique architectural biases and training histories that make it excel at different aspects of the trajectory prediction task. By using a confidence-weighted averaging method, the ensemble can leverage the high-confidence predictions from each model while reducing the impact of individual model errors. This diversity in model architectures helps address the complex, multimodal nature of trajectory prediction, where multiple valid future paths may exist for a given scenario. The approach is particularly effective for long-tail scenarios where rare or unusual situations challenge single-model approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input sensors -> Feature extractors (Autobot, Wayformer, MTR) -> Individual trajectory predictions -> Confidence scores -> Weighted average -> Final ensemble prediction

### Critical Path
Sensor data → Feature extraction by each model → Individual predictions → Confidence estimation → Weighted averaging → Output trajectory

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Pros:** No retraining needed, leverages existing models, improves robustness, particularly effective for long-tail scenarios
- **Cons:** Increased computational complexity, requires careful confidence estimation, may not generalize beyond transformer architectures

### Failure Signatures
- Underperformance when all individual models fail on similar scenarios
- Computational overhead may impact real-time applications
- Confidence estimation errors can propagate through the ensemble
- Potential for overfitting to the specific characteristics of the benchmark datasets

### First Experiments
1. Compare ensemble performance with and without confidence weighting to validate its importance
2. Test ensemble with different combinations of the three models to identify the most effective subset
3. Evaluate performance on out-of-distribution scenarios to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are specific to urban environments and may not generalize to other driving scenarios
- The study focuses on transformer-based models without comparison to ensembles of non-transformer architectures
- Computational efficiency and real-time feasibility of the ensemble approach are not fully characterized
- Analysis emphasizes long-tail metrics without comprehensive characterization across all data segments

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Performance improvements of ~10% over individual models are well-supported by quantitative results
- **Medium confidence:** Generalizability to other domains or traffic scenarios is uncertain, as the study is limited to urban environments with specific datasets
- **Medium confidence:** Claim of effectiveness "across the dataset distribution" needs more thorough validation beyond long-tail metrics
- **Low confidence:** Assumption that transformer-based models are optimal for this ensemble approach lacks comparative validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the ensemble method on additional datasets representing diverse urban and non-urban scenarios to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine which model combinations contribute most to performance gains and whether simpler models could achieve similar results
3. Evaluate computational efficiency trade-offs, including inference time and memory requirements, to ensure the ensemble approach is practical for real-time autonomous driving applications
