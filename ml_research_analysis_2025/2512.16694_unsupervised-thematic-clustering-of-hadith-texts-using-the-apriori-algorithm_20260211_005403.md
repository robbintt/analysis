# Unsupervised Thematic Clustering Of hadith Texts Using The Apriori Algorithm

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16694
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16694
- Reference count: 28
- Indonesian hadith texts from Sahih Bukhari were automatically clustered into three main themes (worship, revelation, transmission) using the Apriori algorithm without manual annotation

## Executive Summary
This study applied the Apriori algorithm to automatically cluster and identify thematic patterns in Indonesian hadith texts from Sahih Bukhari. After preprocessing steps including case folding, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming, the Apriori algorithm extracted association rules between frequently co-occurring words. Results revealed three main themes: worship (e.g., "rakaat"–"shalat" with 90% confidence), revelation (e.g., "ayat"–"turun" with high lift), and hadith transmission (e.g., "hadits"–"cerita"). The method demonstrated high thematic alignment with classical hadith structures without requiring manual annotation, supporting scalable, data-driven thematic analysis. This approach offers a foundation for digital Islamic knowledge systems, thematic annotation, and intelligent hadith search tools, contributing to SDG 4 (Quality Education) through technology-enhanced Islamic learning.

## Method Summary
The study used Apriori association rule mining on Indonesian hadith texts from Sahih Bukhari. The pipeline included preprocessing (case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming) followed by transformation to binary transaction format. Apriori algorithm was applied with minimum support threshold of 0.02 to identify frequent itemsets, then association rules were generated with confidence and lift metrics. Results were validated through domain expert interpretation against classical hadith taxonomy. The approach aimed to discover thematic clusters without requiring manual annotation or labeled data.

## Key Results
- Three main thematic clusters identified: worship (prayer-related terms), revelation (Qur'anic revelation terms), and hadith transmission (narration-related terms)
- High-confidence rules extracted (e.g., "rakaat" → "shalat" with 90% confidence, lift > 6)
- Method successfully aligned with classical hadith structures without manual annotation
- Demonstrated potential for scalable, data-driven thematic analysis of Islamic texts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Frequent word co-occurrence patterns extracted via Apriori reveal latent thematic structures in unlabeled hadith texts.
- Mechanism: The algorithm treats each hadith as a transaction basket; it iteratively generates candidate itemsets (word combinations), prunes those below minimum support, and computes confidence/lift to quantify association strength. High-lift pairs (e.g., lift > 6) indicate non-random semantic relationships that map to scholarly themes.
- Core assumption: Words that systematically co-occur within the same document reflect meaningful conceptual relationships rather than syntactic coincidence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data."
  - [section III.C]: "Apriori is an algorithm used to discover association patterns from transactional data... to identify frequent itemsets, which are groups of words that often appear together within the same hadith."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence—related papers focus on LLM-based hadith processing (e.g., Rezwan, Mubeen AI) rather than association rule mining validation.
- Break condition: If co-occurrence is driven primarily by grammatical structure or formulaic narration rather than thematic content, rules become spurious.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A staged preprocessing pipeline converts narrative Indonesian hadith into normalized, stem-level tokens suitable for transaction-based mining.
- Mechanism: Sequential transformations—case folding → punctuation removal → tokenization → stopword removal (NLTK + custom religious terms) → stemming—reduce morphological variation. One-hot encoding then maps each hadith to a binary word-presence vector.
- Core assumption: Normalizing morphological variants (e.g., "beriman," "keimanan" → "iman") preserves semantic content while enabling accurate frequency counting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming."
  - [section III.B.6]: "The final result of this stage is a representation of each hadith in the form of a clean and consistent list of root words, ready to be used for word-association analysis. This representation is referred to as a transaction."
  - [corpus]: Not explicitly addressed in neighboring papers.
- Break condition: If stemming over-aggressively conflates distinct concepts or stopword removal eliminates domain-critical terms, thematic signals are attenuated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Metric thresholds (support, confidence, lift) filter statistically significant associations, enabling objective validation against domain knowledge.
- Mechanism: Support filters rare patterns; confidence measures P(consequent | antecedent); lift > 1 indicates positive association beyond random expectation. Rules passing thresholds are then interpreted for thematic alignment with classical hadith scholarship (e.g., worship, revelation, transmission).
- Core assumption: High lift and confidence values correlate with theologically meaningful relationships that hadith scholars would recognize.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV.A.1, Table II]: "rakaat → shalat" (confidence 0.90, lift 6.43); "ayat → turun" (lift 6.95)—both align with known themes of worship and revelation.
  - [section III.D]: "A lift value greater than 1 indicates a positive association."
  - [corpus]: Limited—related work on "Probabilistic and reinforced mining of association rules" proposes extensions but does not validate this specific application.
- Break condition: If domain experts reject high-lift rules as semantically invalid, the metric thresholds may not capture scholarly relevance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Association Rule Mining (Apriori)**
  - Why needed here: Core unsupervised technique for discovering {antecedent} → {consequent} patterns without labeled data; requires understanding support/confidence/lift trade-offs.
  - Quick check question: Why does "rakaat → shalat" (lift 6.43) provide stronger evidence of thematic association than "cerita → kepada" (lift 3.65)?

- Concept: **Indonesian Text Preprocessing (Stemming & Stopwords)**
  - Why needed here: Indonesian morphology involves complex affixation (ber-, ke-, -an); stemming and stopword removal must balance noise reduction against semantic preservation.
  - Quick check question: Why would removing "rasulullah" as a custom stopword be appropriate for thematic clustering, and what risk does it introduce?

- Concept: **Validation in Unsupervised Learning**
  - Why needed here: No ground-truth labels exist; validation combines internal metrics with domain-expert interpretation.
  - Quick check question: How would you detect whether a high-confidence rule is theologically meaningful vs. statistically spurious?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Ingestion: Excel (.xlsx) with ~6,000 Indonesian hadith entries (columns: No, BAB, Hadist, Len)
  - Preprocessing Pipeline: Case folding → punctuation removal → tokenization → stopword removal (NLTK + custom) → stemming
  - Transaction Formatter: One-hot binary matrix (hadith × unique stems)
  - Apriori Engine: Frequent itemset generation (min_support = 0.02) → candidate pruning
  - Rule Generator: antecedent → consequent extraction with confidence/lift thresholds
  - Thematic Interpreter: Human-in-the-loop validation against classical hadith taxonomy

- Critical path: Preprocessing quality → binary transaction format → support threshold selection → expert validation. The paper shows that aggressive stopword removal or poor stemming directly degrades rule quality.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Lower min_support → more rules but higher noise and computational cost
  - Aggressive stemming → smaller vocabulary but risk of concept conflation
  - Custom stopwords → improved signal but requires domain expertise to curate

- Failure signatures:
  - High-confidence rules with lift ≈ 1 (random co-occurrence, not thematic)
  - Rules that hadith scholars consistently reject as semantically invalid
  - Very few rules passing thresholds (preprocessing too aggressive or support too high)
  - Computational bottleneck on large corpora (Apriori's exponential candidate generation)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline reproduction**: Run Apriori on the provided Bukhari dataset with min_support=0.02, min_lift=0.6; verify top rules match Table II (e.g., "rakaat → shalat" at 90% confidence).
  2. **Threshold sensitivity**: Vary min_support (0.01, 0.02, 0.05) and min_lift (0.5, 0.6, 1.0); document changes in rule count and thematic coherence.
  3. **Cross-corpus test**: Apply the same pipeline to a different Indonesian hadith collection (e.g., Sahih Muslim, if available); assess whether worship/revelation/transmission themes emerge with similar metric profiles.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Does integrating semantic vector representations (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) with the Apriori algorithm improve the capture of syntactic and pragmatic contexts compared to the current bag-of-words approach?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states future work includes "integration with semantic representations based on word embeddings... enabling the exploration of meaning to encompass more complex syntactic, pragmatic, and historical contexts."
  - Why unresolved: The current Apriori implementation ignores word order and grammar (syntactic structure), limiting the depth of semantic understanding to co-occurrence frequencies.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing that a hybrid BERT-Apriori model identifies thematic relationships with higher precision or recall than the standalone Apriori method.

- **Open Question 2**: To what extent can the generated association rules be utilized to construct a structured hadith knowledge graph that maps entities conceptually and hierarchically?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The discussion suggests "Utilization of a knowledge graph to connect hadith entities conceptually and hierarchically" as a primary avenue for future development.
  - Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the extraction of pair-wise association rules, it does not implement a broader network structure or ontology to link these rules into a navigable knowledge graph.
  - What evidence would resolve it: The successful deployment of a graph-based system where nodes (words/concepts) are linked by the association rules derived in this study, allowing for multi-hop semantic queries.

- **Open Question 3**: Can a computational validation method be developed to automatically filter spurious associations, reducing the current reliance on manual expert intervention?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The limitations section notes the "Possibility of Spurious Associations" where high metric scores may still yield "conceptually irrelevant" results, necessitating "expert validation to ensure the quality of the meaning."
  - Why unresolved: The current study relies on a combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative human judgment to validate themes, which may not scale efficiently for massive corpora.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An automated filtering mechanism or algorithm that successfully distinguishes theologically relevant rules (e.g., "rakaat"–"shalat") from random high-confidence co-occurrences without human input.

## Limitations

- Apriori algorithm's reliance on word co-occurrence patterns may miss nuanced semantic relationships requiring contextual understanding
- Preprocessing pipeline effectiveness depends heavily on quality of Indonesian stemmer and custom stopword list (not fully specified)
- Validation relies primarily on domain expert interpretation rather than quantitative measures of thematic alignment

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The basic mechanism of using Apriori for association rule mining from text data (support/confidence/lift framework) is well-established and technically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The thematic interpretation of high-lift rules as representing worship, revelation, and hadith transmission themes appears reasonable but lacks quantitative validation against classical scholarly taxonomies
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of results to other Islamic text corpora or languages remains unproven, as the study focuses solely on Indonesian Sahih Bukhari

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Corpus Validation**: Apply the same pipeline to a different Indonesian hadith collection (e.g., Sahih Muslim) to assess whether worship/revelation/transmission themes emerge with similar metric profiles and thematic coherence

2. **Expert Validation Protocol**: Conduct structured interviews with 3-5 Islamic scholars to systematically evaluate whether the top 20 association rules align with their understanding of thematic relationships in hadith literature

3. **Statistical Significance Testing**: Implement permutation testing to determine whether observed lift values significantly exceed what would be expected from random word co-occurrences in the corpus
