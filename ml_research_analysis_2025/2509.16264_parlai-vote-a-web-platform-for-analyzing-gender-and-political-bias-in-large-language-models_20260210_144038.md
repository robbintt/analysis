# ParlAI Vote: A Web Platform for Analyzing Gender and Political Bias in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.16264
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16264
- **Reference count**: 26
- **Primary result**: ParlAI Vote is a web platform that visualizes the EuroParlVote benchmark to enable interactive exploration of European Parliament debates, speeches, and roll-call votes while testing LLMs for vote prediction and bias analysis.

## Executive Summary
ParlAI Vote is a web platform that visualizes the EuroParlVote benchmark to enable interactive exploration of European Parliament debates, speeches, and roll-call votes while testing LLMs for vote prediction and bias analysis. It integrates demographic data and allows users to compare model predictions with ground truth, inspect model reasoning, and run counterfactual scenarios to reveal gender and political biases. The system exposes systematic errors, such as over-reliance on linguistic stereotypes and topic-based assumptions, and shows that proprietary models outperform open-weight models in fairness. This unified interface supports reproducible research, public engagement, and transparent auditing of LLM behavior in politically sensitive contexts.

## Method Summary
The platform implements zero-shot or few-shot inference for MEP gender classification and vote prediction (For/Against/Abstain) using the EuroParlVote benchmark dataset containing 969 roll-call votes. It employs multiple LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, Llama-3.2, Mistral) with standardized settings (temperature=0.3, max tokens=512) to predict votes from speech text and metadata. The system evaluates accuracy stratified by demographic groups and includes counterfactual testing by modifying speaker attributes. Performance is assessed through accuracy metrics and qualitative inspection of model reasoning traces to identify stereotypical cues and systematic errors.

## Key Results
- LLMs systematically misclassify speaker gender based on linguistic stereotypes, mapping "assertive" or "technical" language to male and "emotional" language to female
- Topic-gender associations cause errors where economic/geopolitical topics are associated with male speakers and human rights topics with female speakers
- Proprietary models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5) outperform open-weight models (Llama-3.2, Mistral) on fairness metrics, particularly for female MEP predictions
- Models frequently misinterpret ideological criticism from right-wing groups as support for proposals, leading to systematic vote prediction errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Linguistic Gender Stereotypes
- Claim: LLMs encode and propagate linguistic gender stereotypes that cause systematic misclassification of speaker gender.
- Mechanism: Models map linguistic cues (tone, sentiment, style) to gender labels—"assertive," "direct," "technical" → male; "emotional," "empathetic," "personal" → female. When a female MEP uses "male-coded" language, the model misclassifies her as male with high confidence.
- Core assumption: Stereotypical associations in pre-training data persist through model deployment and override factual gender signals.
- Evidence anchors: Terms such as assertive, direct, structured, confrontational, or technical lead the model to confidently assign a male prediction... These patterns echo well-documented linguistic stereotypes.

### Mechanism 2: Topic-Gender Associations
- Claim: Topic-gender associations create systematic errors where policy domain signals override speaker identity.
- Mechanism: Models infer gender from topic keywords—economic/geopolitical/migration → male; human rights/women's rights → female. A female MEP discussing economics is misclassified as male; a male MEP on human rights may be misclassified as female.
- Core assumption: Models learned spurious correlations between topic expertise and gender during pre-training.
- Evidence anchors: Topic keywords that the model associates with male- or female-coded assumptions... economic (Male, 176 total), women's rights (Female, 33 total).

### Mechanism 3: Keyword-Matching Heuristics
- Claim: Vote prediction failures stem from keyword-matching heuristics and misinterpreting ideological criticism.
- Mechanism: Models treat keywords as direct vote signals ("sovereignty" → against, "climate" → for) and interpret criticism as reform-support, failing when right-wing groups use criticism to reject proposals. Default to "for" when uncertain.
- Core assumption: Models lack contextual understanding of rhetorical strategies across political ideologies.
- Evidence anchors: Three recurring error categories... keyword mistakes most common category... models often interpret ideological criticism as reform-oriented support.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Roll-call vote prediction as supervised classification**
  - Why needed here: The core task maps speech+context → {For, Against, Abstain}. Understanding this framing is essential for interpreting error analysis.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why accuracy alone is insufficient for fairness evaluation across demographic groups?

- Concept: **Counterfactual fairness testing**
  - Why needed here: The platform's "Demographic Impact Explorer" modifies attributes to test sensitivity. Users need to understand what constitutes a valid counterfactual.
  - Quick check question: If you change a speaker's gender label while keeping speech identical, what should you conclude if predictions change?

- Concept: **Intersectional bias in NLP systems**
  - Why needed here: Errors cluster at intersections (e.g., female MEPs in right-wing groups). Understanding compound disadvantage is critical for interpreting visualizations.
  - Quick check question: Why might accuracy for "female MEPs" aggregate hide worse performance for "female MEPs from specific countries"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data layer (EuroParlVote benchmark) → LLM inference layer (multiple models) → Web frontend (search/filter interface) → AI Prediction modules → Reasoning viewer → Visualization engine
- Critical path: User lands on homepage → filters debates → selects vote → views vote breakdown by demographic → runs AI prediction → compares ground truth vs. prediction → inspects model reasoning → modifies demographics in counterfactual mode → observes prediction changes
- Design tradeoffs: Pre-computed vs. real-time inference (freshness vs. latency); Proprietary vs. open models included (reproducibility vs. accuracy); Binary gender classification (completeness vs. data availability)
- Failure signatures: High-confidence errors (confidence ≥4/5 but wrong); Demographic accuracy gaps (>10% difference); Political group variance (Far-left worse than far-right)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Select a female MEP speaking on economic policy; run gender prediction with/without demographic context; measure if adding context corrects misclassification
  2. Choose an ECR/ID group member; compare vote prediction accuracy across GPT-4o vs. Llama-3.2; categorize errors by keyword-matching vs. criticism-misinterpretation
  3. Run counterfactual test: same speech, different political group labels; quantify how much predictions shift and in which direction (toward centrist default)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can fine-tuning methods be developed that mitigate gender bias in vote prediction without degrading performance for female speakers?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that attempts to mitigate disparities through LoRA fine-tuning were unsuccessful and often worsened performance for female MEPs.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that standard adaptation techniques like LoRA fail to correct the imbalance, but does not propose an alternative training regime that succeeds.
- What evidence would resolve it: A successful application of a debiasing algorithm that equalizes prediction accuracy across male and female demographics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the observed correlation between linguistic stereotypes (e.g., "assertive" equals male) and model errors generalize to multilingual or non-European legislative contexts?
- Basis in paper: The error analysis relies on English linguistic cues (e.g., "direct," "emotional") and European Parliament data, leaving cross-cultural validity unexplored.
- Why unresolved: The platform and benchmark focus exclusively on the European Parliament, and linguistic gender markers vary significantly by language and culture.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication of the bias analysis using the platform's methodology on legislative datasets from non-Western or multilingual contexts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can models be improved to distinguish between ideological criticism and reform-oriented support to reduce political bias?
- Basis in paper: The authors identify that models frequently misinterpret right-leaning criticism (e.g., calling a proposal "bureaucratic") as support for the proposal.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this heuristic as a major source of error for conservative groups but does not test methods to help models discern rhetorical intent.
- What evidence would resolve it: A prompting strategy or model variant that successfully reduces the "misinterpreting criticism" error rate for ECR and ID groups.

## Limitations
- The binary gender classification framework inherently limits analysis of non-binary gender identities and may miss nuanced forms of gender bias
- The platform's effectiveness relies on the quality and representativeness of the EuroParlVote benchmark, which may not capture full diversity of parliamentary discourse
- Reported performance differences between proprietary and open-weight models could be influenced by factors beyond model architecture, such as fine-tuning data or prompt engineering

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The systematic identification of linguistic gender stereotypes and topic-based gender associations is well-supported by the qualitative error analysis and reasoning inspection features
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that proprietary models outperform open-weight models on fairness metrics is supported but could benefit from more rigorous statistical testing
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that LoRA fine-tuning "often worsened performance for female MEPs" lacks specific quantitative details about the fine-tuning process

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the platform's bias detection capabilities on parliamentary datasets from other regions (e.g., US Congress, UK Parliament) to assess generalizability beyond the European context
2. **Statistical significance testing**: Perform rigorous statistical tests (e.g., chi-square, t-tests) on the accuracy gaps between demographic groups to determine if observed differences are statistically significant
3. **Temporal bias analysis**: Analyze whether bias patterns change over time by segmenting the EuroParlVote data chronologically, which could reveal whether models adapt to evolving political discourse patterns
