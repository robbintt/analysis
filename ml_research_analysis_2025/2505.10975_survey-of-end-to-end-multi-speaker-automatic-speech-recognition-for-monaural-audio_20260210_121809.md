## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews end-to-end multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR) for monaural audio, analyzing architectural paradigms (SIMO vs SISO), multi-modal extensions, long-form processing strategies, and performance across benchmarks. End-to-end approaches directly map mixed audio to speaker-attributed transcriptions, overcoming limitations of cascade methods that propagate errors and fail with overlapping speech. The review categorizes recent advances into SIMO (separate outputs per speaker) and SISO (single unified output), noting SIMO's modularity but SISO's flexibility with variable speaker counts and multi-task learning.

## Method Summary
The survey analyzes end-to-end multi-speaker ASR through two primary architectural paradigms: SIMO (Separate Input, Multiple Outputs) and SISO (Separate Input, Single Output). SIMO uses parallel branches with Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) to match outputs to references, while SISO serializes multi-speaker transcripts into one stream with special tokens (`<sc>`) for speaker changes. Both paradigms increasingly leverage pre-trained foundation models, with SISO offering direct fine-tuning while SIMO requires separation modules. Multi-modal extensions incorporate visual cues and textual context via LLMs, improving robustness in noisy or overlapping scenarios. Long-form processing requires segmentation and hypothesis stitching to maintain speaker consistency.

## Key Results
- No consistent superiority between SIMO and SISO paradigms across benchmarks
- Best results achieved through large-scale pre-training (e.g., 900k hours) and speaker-attributed approaches
- Multi-modal extensions with visual and textual context improve performance in challenging scenarios
- Performance evaluated using cpWER (concatenated minimum permutation WER) and SA-WER (Speaker-Attributed WER)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
End-to-end multi-speaker ASR directly maps mixed audio to speaker-attributed transcriptions, eliminating error propagation from cascade systems. The SISO approach leverages transformer-based architectures to model cross-speaker dependencies through serialized outputs, while SIMO maintains modularity through parallel processing streams. Foundation models provide strong initialization, and multi-modal inputs offer complementary context for disambiguation.

## Foundational Learning
**Permutation Invariant Training (PIT)**: Needed to handle speaker order ambiguity in multi-output systems; Quick check: Verify PIT accuracy >90% during training
**Serialized Output Training (SOT)**: Needed to encode multiple speakers in single sequence; Quick check: Confirm `<sc>` token recall >80%
**Cross-Modal Fusion**: Needed to integrate visual/textual context; Quick check: Validate attention weights sum to 1 across modalities
**Foundation Model Adaptation**: Needed for efficient transfer learning; Quick check: Monitor adaptation loss convergence
**Long-form Processing**: Needed for continuous speech; Quick check: Verify speaker consistency across segment boundaries
**Speaker Attribution**: Needed to assign transcriptions to correct speakers; Quick check: Validate diarization error rate <10%

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Mixed Audio -> Encoder -> (SISO: Decoder + `<sc>` tokens) OR (SIMO: Parallel Decoders + PIT) -> Speaker-Attributed Transcriptions
**Critical Path**: Audio preprocessing → Foundation model initialization → Joint training with CTC/Attention loss → cpWER evaluation with permutation search
**Design Tradeoffs**: SISO offers simplicity and flexibility but struggles with overlapping speech; SIMO provides separation precision but requires complex alignment
**Failure Signatures**: SISO - missing `<sc>` tokens; SIMO - PIT loss oscillation; Both - poor handling of extreme overlaps
**First Experiments**: 1) Train SISO baseline on LibriMix with SOT; 2) Implement SIMO with PIT on same data; 3) Compare cpWER with different pre-training strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How can SIMO and SISO architectures be effectively hybridized to combine the separation precision of SIMO with the comprehensive, context-rich modeling of SISO?
2. How can the one-token-per-frame constraint of CTC be relaxed to handle overlapping speech while preserving its alignment capabilities?
3. Can foundation-adapted SIMO models effectively leverage cross-speaker context, and how can foundation-adapted SISO models benefit from multi-task learning?
4. What standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols are required to fairly compare SISO and SIMO paradigms given current inconsistencies in reporting?

## Limitations
- No implementation details for optimal hyperparameters of large-scale pre-trained models
- Limited real-world validation beyond simulated datasets
- No comprehensive analysis of error types specific to each architectural paradigm
- Computational requirements not systematically compared across hardware configurations

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Fundamental architectural differences between SISO and SIMO are well-established; cpWER metric is widely adopted; benefits of pre-trained foundation models are empirically validated
**Medium Confidence**: No clear superiority between SISO and SIMO paradigms; long-form processing strategies show promise; integration with LLMs is theoretically sound but practically immature
**Low Confidence**: Performance projections for extreme conditions; long-term scalability to unlimited speakers; effectiveness of proposed hybrid approaches

## Next Checks
1. Implement controlled SISO vs SIMO benchmark on identical hardware with same pre-training initialization, measuring cpWER, latency, memory, and robustness
2. Validate top-performing models on diverse real-world datasets including non-native speech, varying audio quality, and naturalistic overlapping patterns
3. Systematically evaluate model performance and resource requirements as speaker count increases from 2 to 6+ speakers, documenting breakdown points
