# GENESIS: A Generative Model of Episodic-Semantic Interaction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15828
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15828
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: GENESIS formalizes memory as dual generative systems (Cortical-VAE for semantic learning, Hippocampal-VAE for episodic encoding) that reproduce key behavioral phenomena through rate-distortion trade-offs

## Executive Summary
GENESIS introduces a computational model formalizing memory as the interaction between two limited-capacity generative systems: a Cortical-VAE supporting semantic learning and a Hippocampal-VAE supporting episodic encoding and retrieval within a retrieval-augmented generation architecture. The model successfully reproduces key behavioral findings including generalization in semantic memory, recognition, serial recall effects, gist-based distortions in episodic memory, and constructive episodic simulation. It demonstrates how capacity constraints shape the fidelity and memorability of experiences, how semantic processing introduces systematic distortions in episodic recall, and how episodic replay can recombine previous experiences.

## Method Summary
GENESIS uses two β-VAEs trained with rate-distortion theory: a Cortical-VAE that compresses images into semantic embeddings and a Hippocampal-VAE that compresses these embeddings into keys for episodic storage. Memories are stored as key-value pairs in a RAG system, where retrieval depends on similarity between query and stored keys. The model uses colored MNIST digits (10 classes × 5 colors) as input, with the Cortical-VAE producing latent embeddings that are further compressed by the Hippocampal-VAE. Temporal embeddings decay over time to implement recency effects, while the weighting parameter φ controls the balance between temporal and semantic retrieval. Training involves rate-distortion curves to calibrate capacity constraints and validate the theoretical framework.

## Key Results
- Successfully reproduces rate-distortion curves showing reconstruction degradation with capacity constraints
- Demonstrates recognition memory decline with list length due to key collisions
- Shows serial recall effects with both recency/primacy and semantic intrusion patterns
- Validates gist-based distortions emerging from semantic generalization
- Demonstrates constructive episodic simulation through latent factor recombination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Rate-Distortion Trade-off in Dual VAEs
The model suggests that semantic generalization and episodic specificity emerge from a resource allocation problem, formalized via rate-distortion theory, where limited encoding capacity forces compression that either abstracts semantic regularities or preserves episodic detail. Two distinct β-VAEs implement capacity limits. The Cortical-VAE compresses perceptual inputs into latent embeddings; low capacity (high compression) forces the model to retain statistical regularities (semantics) at the cost of specific details. The Hippocampal-VAE further compresses these embeddings into keys for storage; low capacity here reduces the distinctiveness of memory traces, impairing retrieval discriminability.

### Mechanism 2: Content-Context Separation via RAG and Temporal Embeddings
Separating item content (values) from temporal context (keys) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture enables the simulation of complex recall dynamics, such as serial order effects and semantic intrusions. The model stores memories as key-value pairs. Keys are composites of compressed item embeddings (semantic content) and temporal embeddings (context). Values are the full cortical embeddings. Retrieval is a query-key matching process. By weighting the temporal component (φ) in the key, the model biases retrieval toward temporal neighbors (serial recall) or semantic associates (intrusions).

### Mechanism 3: Generative Recombination via Disentangled Representations
Generative replay allows the model to simulate future or novel scenarios by recombining latent factors of past events, provided the Cortical-VAE has disentangled these factors effectively. The Cortical-VAE is a conditional β-VAE that learns independent embeddings for separate features (e.g., e_S for digit shape, e_C for color). During "constructive simulation," the model retrieves z (specific instance details) from one memory and e_C (semantic class) from another, concatenating them to decode a novel image (e.g., a "7-red" never seen before).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) & β-VAE**
  - Why needed here: This is the fundamental building block of GENESIS. You cannot understand the "rate-distortion" trade-off or the "generative replay" without understanding how an encoder compresses data into a latent distribution (z) and a decoder reconstructs it.
  - Quick check question: If I increase β in a β-VAE, do I get higher reconstruction fidelity or better disentanglement/regularization?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: GENESIS treats Episodic Memory explicitly as a RAG system (Key-Value pairs). The mechanism of "query-key matching" is the functional definition of memory retrieval here.
  - Quick check question: In a standard RAG, if my query is "Red Apple" and my database contains "Green Apple" and "Red Car," which is retrieved if I weight semantic features higher than color features?

- **Concept: Rate-Distortion Theory**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames cognitive limitations not as a bug but as an optimal compression strategy defined by this theory. It explains why we lose detail (distortion) to save space (rate).
  - Quick check question: On a rate-distortion curve, if you have extremely limited "bits" (low capacity), does the representation look more like a specific noisy image or a blurry prototype?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input (Image) → Cortical-VAE (Encoder) → Item Embedding (z, e_semantic).
  Item Embedding → (Branch 1) Cortical-VAE (Decoder) (Semantic Reconstruction).
  Item Embedding → (Branch 2) Hippocampal-VAE (Encoder) → Compressed Key (+ Temporal Embedding).
  Key-Value Store (RAG): Stores (Key, Item Embedding) pairs.
  Retrieval: Query → Similarity Match → Retrieved Value → Cortical-VAE (Decoder).

- **Critical path:**
  The interaction between the Hippocampal-VAE and the RAG is the critical path for episodic tasks. The model fails if the Hippocampal-VAE compresses too aggressively (keys become indistinguishable) or if the temporal embedding schedule is static (keys don't reflect time drift).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Capacity Allocation: High Cortical capacity preserves detail but reduces generalization; High Hippocampal capacity improves retrieval distinctiveness but requires more storage/compute.
  - φ (Temporal vs. Semantic): High φ prioritizes serial order (recency/primacy); Low φ prioritizes semantic association (intrusions).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Gist-based distortion: Input images reconstruct as "average" or "blurry" versions of their class (e.g., every "3" looks identical). Fix: Increase Cortical capacity (nats).
  - Semantic Intrusion: When asked to recall a specific list item, the model returns a semantically related item from a different list. Fix: Increase weighting φ for temporal embeddings.
  - Retrieval Collapse: Recognition accuracy drops to chance with list lengths >50. Fix: Increase Hippocampal capacity to prevent key collisions.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Calibrate Rate-Distortion: Train the Cortical-VAE on Colored MNIST with varying capacity (C ∈ {0, 1, 2, 4, 8} nats). Plot reconstruction loss vs. capacity to confirm the theoretical curve.
  2. Temporal Drift Verification: Implement the temporal embedding generation. Visualize the cosine similarity matrix of keys over time to ensure recency effects (diagonal dominance decay).
  3. Leave-One-Out Generalization: Train Cortical-VAE with a specific pair (e.g., "5-Red") removed. Test if recombining latent z from a "5-Blue" with embedding e_Red generates a valid "5-Red".

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does bidirectional co-training of the Cortical and Hippocampal VAEs via generative replay replicate the gradual semantization of episodic traces?
- Basis in paper: The authors note the Cortical-VAE was pre-trained for simplicity and propose a "bidirectional training loop" for future work.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation isolates semantic learning from online episodic influence to maintain simplicity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulations demonstrating semantic representations evolving dynamically through replay-driven consolidation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does compressing episodic values (rather than just keys) produce the chimeric distortions seen in dreaming or hallucinations?
- Basis in paper: The paper identifies examining distortions from value compression and links to "dreaming and hallucination" as an important research avenue.
- Why unresolved: The current model assumes values are uncompressed to ensure conceptual clarity in reconstruction tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Reconstructions from compressed values showing systematic chimeric blending of features consistent with hallucinatory phenomena.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can specific capacity limitations within GENESIS mechanistically explain the memory deficits observed in semantic dementia and Alzheimer's disease?
- Basis in paper: The authors state future versions should test whether these clinical deficits can be explained in terms of capacity limitations.
- Why unresolved: The model currently reproduces healthy behavioral phenomena but has not been validated against clinical pathology profiles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Model fits showing that reduced capacity parameters in specific components map onto patient-specific symptom severities.

## Limitations

- Implementation details for FiLM conditioning and temporal embedding schedules are underspecified
- Claims about behavioral reproduction rest on simulations with colored MNIST rather than human behavioral validation
- Constructive simulation claims lack quantitative validation of recombination fidelity
- Disentanglement quality required for constructive simulation is assumed rather than empirically verified

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The rate-distortion framework for explaining memory fidelity vs. capacity (Section 2.2, 4.1) is well-supported by the theoretical framework and empirical curves.

**Medium Confidence:** The serial recall effects and semantic intrusions (Section 4.4) depend on the temporal embedding implementation details that are not fully specified.

**Low Confidence:** The constructive episodic simulation claims (Section 2.6) lack quantitative validation - the paper mentions "novel episodic recombination" but doesn't provide systematic evaluation of recombination fidelity or diversity.

## Next Checks

1. **Disentanglement Validation:** Apply standard disentanglement metrics (MIG, SAP, or FactorVAE) to the Cortical-VAE latent space to verify that semantic features are truly factorized and can be recombined meaningfully.

2. **Human Behavioral Benchmark:** Compare model predictions against human behavioral data on serial recall tasks, particularly the trade-off between recency effects and semantic intrusions as φ varies.

3. **Generalization Beyond Colored MNIST:** Test the LOO generalization capability on more complex datasets or with more feature dimensions to assess whether the disentanglement and recombination mechanism scales beyond the simple colored digit case.
