# Enabling Granular Subgroup Level Model Evaluations by Generating Synthetic Medical Time Series

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.19728
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19728
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces TRTS gap by >70% (ΔTRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC) while enabling 50% error reduction in 32 subgroup-level evaluations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of reliably evaluating predictive models in critical care using synthetic ICU time-series data. While synthetic data can protect privacy and overcome data scarcity, most prior work focuses on training utility rather than faithful evaluation. The authors propose Enhanced TimeAutoDiff, which augments a latent diffusion model with MMD and consistency regularization to improve evaluation utility. They systematically benchmark four generators (HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff, TimeDiff, Enhanced TimeAutoDiff) on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets across mortality and length-of-stay tasks. Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces the train-on-real/test-on-synthetic (TRTS) gap by over 70%, achieving ΔTRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC, while preserving training utility (ΔTSTR ≈ 0.01). Critically, for 32 intersectional demographic subgroups, synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50% relative to small real test sets and outperform them in 72–84% of subgroups. This demonstrates that enhanced synthetic data generation enables trustworthy, granular model evaluation without exposing sensitive EHR data.

## Method Summary
The authors propose Enhanced TimeAutoDiff, which augments a latent diffusion model with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Consistency Regularization to improve evaluation utility. The method generates synthetic ICU time-series data conditioned on demographics and clinical outcomes. They systematically benchmark four generators (HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff, TimeDiff, Enhanced TimeAutoDiff) on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets. The evaluation focuses on mortality and length-of-stay prediction tasks, measuring both population-level performance gaps (TRTS/TSTR) and subgroup-level estimation accuracy across 32 intersectional demographic groups.

## Key Results
- Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces TRTS gap by over 70% to ≤0.014 AUROC while maintaining training utility (ΔTSTR ≈ 0.01)
- Synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50% relative to small real test sets
- Synthetic data outperforms small real test sets in 72–84% of 32 intersectional demographic subgroups
- MMD and consistency regularization are critical for reducing TRTS gap and improving subgroup evaluation fidelity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by aligning the synthetic data distribution more closely with real data through additional regularization terms. MMD minimizes distributional differences in the latent space, while consistency regularization ensures the generator produces stable outputs across perturbed inputs. This alignment is crucial because traditional synthetic data generation focuses on training utility, not evaluation fidelity. By improving distribution alignment, Enhanced TimeAutoDiff enables more accurate assessment of model performance on underrepresented subgroups without requiring large real test sets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD):** A kernel-based measure of distribution distance used to align synthetic and real data distributions. Why needed: Ensures synthetic data matches real data distribution for reliable evaluation. Quick check: Verify MMD loss decreases during training.
- **Consistency Regularization:** Forces the generator to produce similar outputs for similar inputs, improving stability. Why needed: Prevents synthetic data from being overly sensitive to minor input variations. Quick check: Monitor output variance across perturbed inputs.
- **Latent Diffusion Models:** Generate data by iteratively denoising latent representations. Why needed: Enables high-quality synthetic time-series generation with good training utility. Quick check: Verify reconstruction quality on holdout set.
- **Classifier-Free Guidance:** Enables conditional generation by interpolating between unconditional and conditional model weights. Why needed: Allows generating synthetic data for specific demographic subgroups. Quick check: Verify conditional samples match target demographics.
- **Intersectional Demographics:** Considers multiple demographic factors simultaneously (e.g., age × sex × ethnicity). Why needed: Captures nuanced differences in model performance across population subgroups. Quick check: Ensure all 32 subgroups have sufficient samples.
- **TRTS/TSTR Gaps:** Metrics measuring distribution shift between real and synthetic data. Why needed: Quantifies evaluation utility of synthetic data. Quick check: Monitor gap reduction during training.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** MIMIC-III/eICU data -> Preprocessing (24h windows, 8 features) -> Generator (VAE + Latent Diffusion + MMD + Consistency) -> Synthetic Data -> Downstream GRU -> Performance Metrics

**Critical Path:** Real data preprocessing → Enhanced TimeAutoDiff generation → Conditional subgroup sampling → GRU training on synthetic/real data → Performance evaluation (AUROC, TRTS/TSTR gaps)

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational complexity (additional MMD and consistency losses) for improved evaluation fidelity. This is worthwhile because evaluation accuracy is paramount for clinical deployment decisions.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- High TRTS gap (>0.05) indicates distribution misalignment
- Poor subgroup performance suggests conditional generation issues
- Large ΔTSTR (>0.05) indicates synthetic data doesn't capture training patterns

**First Experiments:**
1. Train baseline TimeAutoDiff on MIMIC-III and measure TRTS gap
2. Add MMD regularization only and measure gap reduction
3. Add consistency regularization to MMD-enhanced model and measure final gap

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Omitted architecture hyperparameters (latent dimensions, hidden layers, diffusion steps) require inference from reference paper
- Optimal regularization weights for MMD and consistency losses not fully specified
- Computational overhead of additional regularization terms may limit scalability

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** TRTS gap measurements and overall evaluation utility claims
- **Medium confidence:** Subgroup-level performance improvements (methodology clear but specific configurations partially unspecified)
- **Medium confidence:** MMD and consistency regularization contributions (specific weight combinations not fully reported)

## Next Checks
1. Verify the exact hyperparameter configuration (latent dimensions, hidden sizes, diffusion steps) matches TimeAutoDiff [4] to ensure architectural consistency
2. Confirm the specific regularization weight combination (λ values) used for the "best-enhanced setting" through code inspection or direct clarification
3. Reproduce the subgroup analysis pipeline to validate the 72-84% synthetic superiority claim on a held-out demographic stratification
