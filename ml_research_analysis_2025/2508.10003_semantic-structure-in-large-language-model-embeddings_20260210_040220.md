# Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.10003
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Semantic features in LLM embeddings are highly correlated, reducing to a 3-dimensional structure mirroring human semantic ratings.

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that semantic features in LLM embedding matrices are highly correlated, forming a low-dimensional structure that closely mirrors human semantic ratings. By projecting word vectors onto feature directions defined by antonym pairs, the authors show that these projections correlate strongly with human survey responses. Principal components analysis reveals that the 28 semantic features effectively reduce to a 3-dimensional subspace resembling the Evaluation, Potency, and Activity dimensions from psychological research. The study also shows that interventions on one semantic feature cause off-target effects on other features that are proportional to their cosine similarity, indicating that feature alignment in embeddings reflects meaningful semantic relations rather than random superposition.

## Method Summary
The authors extracted 28 semantic feature directions from LLM embedding matrices by averaging normalized difference vectors from 10 antonym pairs per feature. They validated these directions by correlating token projections with human semantic ratings from a large survey (N=1,750). PCA was applied to the 28×301 projection matrix to identify latent dimensions. Interventions were performed by adding scaled feature vectors to token embeddings and measuring off-target effects on other features through next-token probability changes.

## Key Results
- Token projections onto feature directions correlate with human survey ratings (r = 0.3–0.7 across features)
- PCA reveals 28 features reduce to 3 principal components explaining 40–55% of variance
- Component loadings resemble Evaluation, Potency, and Activity dimensions from psychological research
- Off-target effects from feature steering scale linearly with cosine similarity between feature vectors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Semantic feature directions are extracted by averaging normalized difference vectors from multiple antonym pairs. For each semantic scale, the normalized vector difference between 10 antonym pairs is computed and averaged, yielding a direction that captures the semantic axis. Token projections onto this direction correlate with human survey ratings.

### Mechanism 2
The 28 semantic feature projections reduce to a low-dimensional subspace (~3 components) that mirrors human semantic structure. PCA on token projections shows the first 3 components explain 40–55% of variance, with loadings resembling Evaluation (good-bad), Potency (sensory/energy), and Activity (active-passive) dimensions.

### Mechanism 3
Interventions on one semantic feature direction cause off-target effects on other features proportional to their cosine similarity. Steering a token along feature vector d_f changes next-token probabilities for other semantic features, with effect magnitude scaling linearly with cosine similarity between target and off-target feature vectors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Distributed representations / word embeddings**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper assumes tokens occupy positions in a continuous vector space where directions encode semantic properties
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the vector difference between "king" and "queen" might capture a meaningful semantic direction?

- **Concept: Cosine similarity and vector projections**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper measures semantic association via cosine similarity between token vectors and feature directions
  - **Quick check question:** Given two unit vectors with cosine similarity 0.5, what fraction of their variance is shared?

- **Concept: Principal Components Analysis (PCA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The central finding—that 28 features reduce to ~3 latent dimensions—relies on interpreting PCA loadings and variance explained
  - **Quick check question:** If 28 features were perfectly orthogonal, what fraction of variance would each principal component explain?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input embedding matrix (token → vector) → Feature direction d_f → Token projection → Intervention → Measurement prompt
- **Critical path:** 1) Select antonym pairs for each of 28 semantic scales 2) Extract feature directions via Eq. (1) 3) Validate: correlate token projections with human survey ratings 4) Analyze structure: PCA on projection matrix 5) Intervene: steer tokens along feature directions; measure off-target effects
- **Design tradeoffs:** Whitening vs. raw embeddings (reduces off-target effects but degrades human alignment ~20%), intervention magnitude (±0.35×||w_i||), antonym selection (10 pairs per feature for robustness)
- **Failure signatures:** Low correlation (< 0.2) between projections and human ratings, uniform variance across PCA components (~3.6% each), off-target effects unrelated to cosine similarity
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Replicate projection-to-human-rating correlation for subset of features 2) Run PCA on projection matrix; confirm 3 components explain >30% variance 3) Perform single steering intervention; measure next-token probability changes on correlated vs. orthogonal features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How are the geometric relations between semantic features transformed as representations propagate through the model's transformer layers? This remains unresolved because the study focused on static embedding matrices rather than intermediate activations.
- **Open Question 2:** How do preceding context tokens dynamically reconfigure the relations between semantic features in the activation space? The current analysis uses isolated word vectors, leaving context-dependence unexplored.
- **Open Question 3:** Can predictable off-target effects of feature steering be mathematically compensated for to isolate specific concept modifications? While linearity is established, corrective intervention methods are not proposed.

## Limitations
- The feature extraction method assumes antonym pairs are geometrically aligned in embedding space, but this alignment is not empirically verified for all 28 features
- Human validation relies on a specific subset of 301 words that may not be representative of general language use
- The study does not establish causality between embedding projections and psychological constructs

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Meaningful semantic structure in LLM embeddings correlates with human judgments; off-target effects scale linearly with cosine similarity
- **Medium confidence:** Identification of 28 semantic feature directions from antonym pairs; 28 features reduce to ~3 principal components
- **Low confidence:** Precise mapping to Evaluation-Potency-Activity dimensions; broader claim of "psychologically grounded" structure

## Next Checks
1. Apply the same feature extraction and validation pipeline to a different set of 300 words to verify correlation robustness
2. Compute variance in normalized difference vectors for antonym pairs; if variance exceeds threshold, feature direction may not capture coherent semantic axis
3. Repeat steering experiments with multiple perturbation magnitudes to verify linear relationship between cosine similarity and off-target effects holds across scales
