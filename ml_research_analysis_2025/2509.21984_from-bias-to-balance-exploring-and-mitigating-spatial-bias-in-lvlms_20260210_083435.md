# From Bias to Balance: Exploring and Mitigating Spatial Bias in LVLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21984
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21984
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Spatial bias in LVLMs originates from unbalanced position embedding design and can be mitigated via Balanced Position Assignment without retraining

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates spatial bias in large vision-language models (LVLMs), revealing that they produce inconsistent predictions when identical visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through controlled probing experiments, the study demonstrates that this bias originates not from the vision encoder but from the unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component, specifically due to position embedding strategies like RoPE disrupting global information flow during cross-modal interaction. To address this, the authors propose Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens, promoting balanced integration of visual information. Extensive experiments show that BaPA enhances spatial robustness without requiring retraining and further boosts performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct controlled probing experiments using a 3×3 grid layout to test LVLM predictions on identical visual content placed at different spatial positions. They systematically isolate the source of spatial bias through ablation studies, demonstrating that the vision encoder produces consistent outputs while the position embedding strategy (particularly RoPE) introduces bias during cross-modal interaction. The proposed Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA) mechanism assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens, preventing position-dependent variations in cross-attention weights. This is implemented as a lightweight modification that can be applied without retraining. The authors also introduce an Adaptive Global Context Injection (AGCI) module that allows flexible injection of global visual information across transformer layers.

## Key Results
- Spatial bias causes LVLM predictions to vary significantly based on visual content location within an image
- Position embeddings (particularly RoPE) are the primary source of spatial bias, not vision encoders
- BaPA effectively eliminates spatial bias while maintaining or improving performance on multimodal benchmarks
- AGCI combined with BaPA provides additional performance gains through enhanced global context integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Spatial bias in LVLMs stems from how position embeddings interact with cross-modal attention. Traditional position embedding strategies like RoPE create position-dependent variations in attention weights, causing identical visual content at different locations to be processed differently. When position embeddings vary across spatial locations, they modulate the cross-attention mechanism in ways that introduce systematic bias. BaPA eliminates this by assigning uniform position embeddings to all image tokens, ensuring consistent processing regardless of spatial location. The AGCI module further enhances this by providing explicit global context injection that can be adaptively weighted across layers, allowing the model to maintain spatial awareness where needed while preventing position-dependent bias in core processing.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-modal attention**: The mechanism by which visual and language tokens interact in LVLMs, crucial for understanding how position embeddings affect bias
- **Position encoding schemes**: Different methods (RoPE, ALiBi, learned) for incorporating positional information, central to understanding bias sources
- **Vision encoder vs. language model contributions**: Understanding which components drive spatial bias is essential for targeted mitigation
- **Global context injection**: The concept of providing overall scene information to overcome local processing limitations
- **Spatial robustness**: The ability of models to maintain consistent performance regardless of visual content placement
- **Probing tasks**: Controlled experiments designed to isolate specific model behaviors, fundamental to this study's methodology

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Vision Encoder -> Cross-Modal Attention -> Language Model -> Position Embeddings -> Prediction

**Critical Path**: Visual features → Cross-attention with position embeddings → Language model processing → Output prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**: Spatial robustness vs. spatial sensitivity - BaPA sacrifices fine-grained spatial distinctions to achieve consistency, which may affect tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent predictions for identical visual content at different positions; higher variance in outputs when position embeddings vary; position-dependent attention patterns

**First Experiments to Run**:
1. Replicate the 3×3 grid probing task with controlled identical visual content at different positions
2. Apply BaPA to a baseline LVLM and measure spatial bias reduction and performance changes
3. Test AGCI with varying λ values to find optimal global context injection strength

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does spatial bias persist or fundamentally change in ultra-large LVLMs exceeding 70B parameters?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly list the exclusion of very large models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B) due to computational constraints as a limitation.
- Why unresolved: It remains unclear if the identified bias and the effectiveness of AGCI scale linearly or if emergent abilities in larger models mitigate the issue naturally.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the probing task and AGCI mitigation on models with parameter counts significantly larger than 72B.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does spatial bias manifest in fine-grained or irregular spatial layouts?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge that the probing experiments rely primarily on a 3×3 grid, which may not fully capture irregular spatial variations.
- Why unresolved: Real-world visual content is rarely aligned in perfect grids; bias might behave differently under continuous or irregular spatial perturbations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results from probe datasets featuring non-grid alignments or continuous pixel-wise spatial shifts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the global context injection strength (λ) be dynamically determined rather than manually tuned?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.5 shows λ impacts accuracy and variance non-monotonically depending on the model, yet it is set as a static hyperparameter.
- Why unresolved: A fixed λ may be sub-optimal across diverse visual inputs or layers; an adaptive mechanism is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mechanism that adjusts injection strength based on semantic similarity variance or layer depth, showing improved stability over fixed values.

## Limitations
- Focus on RoPE and its variants may not generalize to all position embedding schemes
- Correlation-based evidence for position embeddings as bias source, not definitively causal proof
- BaPA's uniform position assignment may affect performance on tasks requiring spatial reasoning
- Limited evaluation to models below 72B parameters, excluding potential emergent behaviors in larger models

## Confidence

**Major Claims Confidence Assessment:**

- Spatial bias exists and affects LVLM predictions: **High**
- Spatial bias originates from position embedding design rather than vision encoder: **Medium**
- BaPA effectively mitigates spatial bias without retraining: **High**
- BaPA improves performance across multimodal benchmarks: **Medium**

## Next Checks

1. Test BaPA's effectiveness across a broader range of LVLM architectures with different position embedding schemes (ALiBi, learned positional embeddings, etc.)
2. Evaluate whether BaPA affects performance on tasks that require spatial reasoning (visual grounding, spatial relationship understanding)
3. Conduct ablation studies removing BaPA's effects on vision encoder outputs to further isolate the source of spatial bias
