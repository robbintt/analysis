# An Analysis of Optimizer Choice on Energy Efficiency and Performance in Neural Network Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13516
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13516
- Reference count: 10
- Optimizer efficiency varies significantly across datasets and model complexity

## Executive Summary
This paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study of 360 controlled experiments across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) to investigate how optimizer choice affects energy efficiency in neural network training. Using CodeCarbon for precise energy tracking on Apple M1 Pro hardware, the study evaluates eight popular optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adadelta, Adamax, NAdam) with 15 random seeds each. Key metrics measured include training duration, peak memory usage, CO2 emissions, and final model performance. Results reveal substantial trade-offs between training speed, accuracy, and environmental impact that vary across datasets and model complexity. AdamW and NAdam emerge as consistently efficient choices, while SGD demonstrates superior performance on complex datasets despite higher emissions. The findings provide actionable insights for practitioners seeking to balance performance and sustainability in machine learning workflows.

## Method Summary
The study employs a controlled experimental design with 360 total experiments across three benchmark datasets: MNIST (60k samples, 28×28 grayscale), CIFAR-10 (50k samples, 32×32 RGB, 10 classes), and CIFAR-100 (50k samples, 32×32 RGB, 100 classes). Eight optimizers are evaluated: SGD, Adam, AdamW, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adadelta, Adamax, and NAdam, each with 15 random seeds per configuration. The CNN architectures used have 421k parameters for MNIST and approximately 3.2M parameters for CIFAR datasets, with batch normalization and dropout layers. Training uses an 80/20 train/validation split, early stopping with patience=5 (max 50 epochs), and CodeCarbon 3.0.4 for energy tracking. The experiments run on Apple M1 Pro hardware with PyTorch 2.0.1 and MPS backend.

## Key Results
- AdamW and NAdam consistently demonstrate superior energy efficiency across all datasets
- SGD achieves highest accuracy on complex datasets despite higher emissions and longer training times
- Optimizer performance rankings shift substantially across different dataset complexities
- Training duration, accuracy, and CO2 emissions show significant trade-offs requiring careful optimizer selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's controlled experimental design with standardized hyperparameters and 15 random seeds per configuration eliminates confounding variables, enabling fair optimizer comparison. By measuring both performance metrics (accuracy) and environmental impact (CO2 emissions, energy consumption) simultaneously, the research reveals genuine trade-offs rather than isolated efficiency gains. The use of CodeCarbon for precise hardware-level energy tracking provides empirical rather than theoretical efficiency measurements, while the selection of diverse datasets (from simple MNIST to complex CIFAR-100) ensures findings generalize across different problem complexities.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Energy tracking in ML training**: Understanding hardware-specific power consumption is crucial for environmental impact assessment; quick check: verify CodeCarbon integration with target hardware
2. **Optimizer hyperparameters**: Learning rate, momentum, and weight decay significantly affect both convergence speed and energy efficiency; quick check: confirm hyperparameter values match across all optimizer experiments
3. **Random seed importance**: Multiple seeds are essential for reliable optimizer comparison to account for stochastic variability; quick check: verify 15 seeds per configuration are implemented
4. **Early stopping mechanisms**: Patience-based stopping prevents unnecessary computation while ensuring convergence; quick check: confirm patience=5 and max 50 epochs settings
5. **Hardware-specific optimization**: MPS backend and Apple Silicon introduce platform-specific performance characteristics; quick check: verify PyTorch 2.0.1 with MPS backend is properly configured
6. **Trade-off analysis**: Performance-accuracy-emission relationships require balanced evaluation rather than single-metric optimization; quick check: ensure all metrics (accuracy, duration, emissions) are tracked for each experiment

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Loading -> CNN Model -> Optimizer Selection -> Training Loop -> CodeCarbon Tracking -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The training loop with optimizer updates and CodeCarbon energy monitoring forms the critical path, where each optimizer configuration runs through complete training cycles with early stopping.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes controlled comparison over absolute performance, using standardized hyperparameters across optimizers rather than per-optimizer tuning. This enables fair efficiency comparison but may not capture optimal performance for each optimizer.

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent results across seeds suggest implementation errors or insufficient random seed coverage. Optimizer-specific failures (divergence, plateauing) indicate hyperparameter sensitivity or architecture incompatibility.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify basic CNN architecture training on MNIST with SGD to confirm foundational implementation
2. Test CodeCarbon energy tracking on a single optimizer configuration to validate environmental monitoring
3. Run a small-scale comparison (3 optimizers, 3 seeds each) to confirm experimental framework functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Hardware specificity to Apple M1 Pro with MPS backend limits generalizability to other platforms
- Limited scope to image classification tasks and relatively small model sizes (≤3.2M parameters)
- Real-world deployment scenarios may introduce additional variables not captured in controlled setting
- Unknown exact CNN architecture details, data augmentation pipeline, and weight initialization scheme

## Confidence
- **High**: Controlled experimental design with 15 random seeds per configuration
- **Medium-High**: Robust evidence for optimizer efficiency rankings within image classification scope
- **Medium**: Findings may shift with different model architectures or optimization goals

## Next Checks
1. Verify CNN architecture specifications (kernel sizes, dropout rates, fully connected layer dimensions) match original implementation
2. Test CodeCarbon energy tracking functionality on target hardware, confirming power consumption metrics are being accurately captured
3. Replicate the SGD vs AdamW performance trade-off on a held-out subset of data to confirm the identified efficiency-accuracy relationship holds under different data splits
