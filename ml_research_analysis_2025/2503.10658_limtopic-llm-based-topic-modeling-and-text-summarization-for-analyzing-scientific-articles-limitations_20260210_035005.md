# LimTopic: LLM-based Topic Modeling and Text Summarization for Analyzing Scientific Articles limitations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.10658
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10658
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** BERTopic with GPT-4 achieves coherence score of 0.617 and silhouette score of 0.588 for topic modeling of research limitations

## Executive Summary
LimTopic introduces an LLM-based pipeline for extracting and analyzing limitations sections from scientific articles. The method combines BERTopic for initial topic modeling with GPT-4 for generating descriptive titles and summaries. Applied to ACL 2023 research papers, the system processed 3,396 limitations sections to produce 35 meaningful topics with concise summaries. The approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional methods, offering researchers and reviewers structured insights into research limitations across computational linguistics literature.

## Method Summary
The LimTopic pipeline operates through a multi-stage process: First, it extracts limitations sections from PDF articles using PyMuPDF and SciBERT for sentence segmentation. The extracted text undergoes preprocessing including stopword removal and lemmatization. BERTopic performs dimensionality reduction with UMAP and clustering with HDBSCAN to identify topic clusters. GPT-4 then generates descriptive titles and summaries for each topic. For text summarization, GPT-4 produces abstractive summaries that are evaluated against human-generated summaries and compared with other LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3. The system outputs structured topic representations with coherence and silhouette scores measuring cluster quality.

## Key Results
- BERTopic with GPT-4 achieved coherence score of 0.617 and silhouette score of 0.588, outperforming traditional approaches
- The system identified 35 meaningful topics from 3,396 limitations sections across ACL 2023 papers
- GPT-4 demonstrated superior summarization performance compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3 when evaluated against human-generated summaries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LimTopic leverages LLMs' ability to understand context and generate coherent descriptions for complex scientific text. BERTopic provides robust initial clustering through its combination of UMAP dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN clustering, which effectively handles the high-dimensional nature of text data. GPT-4's advanced language understanding enables it to generate precise, descriptive titles and summaries that capture the essence of each topic cluster. This hybrid approach combines the statistical strengths of traditional topic modeling with the semantic understanding of modern LLMs, resulting in more interpretable and actionable insights from limitations sections.

## Foundational Learning
- **BERTopic fundamentals**: Why needed - provides initial topic clustering without manual labeling; Quick check - verify UMAP and HDBSCAN parameters produce stable clusters
- **LLM prompt engineering**: Why needed - ensures consistent, high-quality topic titles and summaries; Quick check - test prompts on sample limitations text for coherence
- **Coherence and silhouette metrics**: Why needed - quantitatively evaluate topic quality and cluster separation; Quick check - compare scores across different topic numbers (10, 25, 50)
- **Text preprocessing for scientific articles**: Why needed - handles domain-specific terminology and structure; Quick check - validate preprocessing preserves technical terms while removing noise
- **SciBERT for domain-specific text extraction**: Why needed - accurately identifies limitations sections in computational linguistics papers; Quick check - measure extraction accuracy on a subset of manually labeled papers

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** PDF extraction -> Text preprocessing -> BERTopic clustering -> GPT-4 topic labeling -> Summary generation

**Critical path:** PDF extraction and text preprocessing -> BERTopic clustering -> GPT-4 labeling and summarization

**Design tradeoffs:** The method trades computational efficiency for accuracy by using GPT-4 API calls, which may limit scalability but ensures high-quality outputs. The predetermined number of 35 topics balances comprehensiveness with interpretability but may miss domain-specific nuances.

**Failure signatures:** Poor topic coherence may indicate inadequate preprocessing or suboptimal BERTopic parameters. Inaccurate limitations extraction suggests SciBERT model limitations for certain paper structures. Generic or irrelevant GPT-4 outputs may result from poorly engineered prompts or insufficient context.

**First experiments:** 1) Test BERTopic clustering with different numbers of topics (10, 25, 50) on a subset of papers; 2) Evaluate GPT-4 prompt variations on sample limitations text; 3) Compare coherence scores across different preprocessing configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to ACL 2023 papers, representing a single conference and computational linguistics domain
- Moderate coherence (0.617) and silhouette (0.588) scores suggest room for improvement
- Reliance on human-generated summaries as ground truth may introduce subjective bias
- API dependencies and computational costs of GPT-4 may hinder large-scale deployment
- Predetermined topic number (35) may not capture all nuances across different research domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: BERTopic with GPT-4 outperforms traditional topic modeling approaches for this dataset
- **Medium confidence**: The method effectively summarizes limitations sections into meaningful topics
- **Medium confidence**: GPT-4 demonstrates superior summarization performance compared to other tested LLMs

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the pipeline across multiple conferences and disciplines (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, Nature journals) to test generalizability
2. Conduct a blind peer review where human experts assess topic quality and summary accuracy without knowing the generation method
3. Implement cost-benefit analysis comparing API-based LLMs versus open-source alternatives for large-scale deployment
