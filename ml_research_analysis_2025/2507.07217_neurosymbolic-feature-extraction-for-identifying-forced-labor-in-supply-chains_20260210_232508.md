# Neurosymbolic Feature Extraction for Identifying Forced Labor in Supply Chains

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07217
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07217
- Reference count: 28
- Key outcome: Neurosymbolic approach combines manual and automated feature extraction from news articles using question trees and SAT-based analysis to identify forced labor patterns without large labeled datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of identifying forced labor in supply chains where traditional machine learning fails due to sparse, unreliable data. The authors propose a neurosymbolic approach that combines structured question trees for LLM querying with SAT-based Boolean formula enumeration. Manual extraction involved 125 incidents from over 340 articles, while automated extraction used GPT-4 to assess relevance. The method enables interpretable detection of forced labor patterns by extracting 25 specific features and analyzing their logical relationships, validated on synthetic data.

## Method Summary
The method integrates neurosymbolic AI techniques to extract and analyze forced labor indicators from supply chain news articles. A question tree framework structures LLM queries to quantify article relevance, while a SAT solver enumerates Boolean formulas to identify logical patterns among extracted features. The approach handles sparse data by replacing statistical generalization with explicit logical inference, validated through both manual labeling of 125 incidents and automated extraction from ProQuest articles.

## Key Results
- Question tree approach enables systematic LLM querying of unstructured news articles for forced labor relevance
- SAT-based Boolean formula enumeration identifies interpretable causal patterns without requiring large labeled datasets
- Proposed method addresses sparse data challenge in illicit supply chain detection through neurosymbolic integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Structured question trees enable LLMs to systematically quantify article relevance to forced labor
- **Mechanism:** Directed Acyclic Graph where nodes represent specific questions, with relevance score calculated as normalized sum of node scores
- **Core assumption:** LLM can accurately answer binary questions about complex supply chain text without hallucinating context
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions question tree approach; Section 2.2 details DAG structure and scoring mechanism
- **Break condition:** Fails if LLM produces inconsistent answers for semantically similar questions

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** SAT-based Boolean formula enumeration identifies interpretable causal patterns from sparse feature sets
- **Mechanism:** Features Booleanized and analyzed via SAT solver to find logical formulas satisfied by forced labor instances
- **Core assumption:** Indicators adhere to discrete logical structures rather than continuous distributions
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions SAT-based enumeration; Section 2.3 details validation on synthetic data
- **Break condition:** Yields unusable results if feature set is too sparse to satisfy complex formulas

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Neurosymbolic integration handles sparse data by replacing statistical generalization with logical inference
- **Mechanism:** LLM extracts structured features while symbolic logic finds relationships, decoupling data scarcity from pattern detection
- **Core assumption:** LLM feature extraction error rate is lower than end-to-end classifier trained on sparse data
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract contrasts ML requirements with sparse data reality; Section 1 proposes neurosymbolic solution
- **Break condition:** Fails if LLM fails to extract specific 25 features defined in Table 1

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) Solving**
  - **Why needed here:** Used to enumerate possible logical combinations of risk factors; understanding CNF and solver search is critical
  - **Quick check question:** If SAT solver returns "Unsatisfiable" for a forced labor pattern formula, does that mean the incident didn't happen, or the logical model is flawed?

- **Concept: Prompt Chaining / Question Decomposition**
  - **Why needed here:** Core innovation is question tree as form of prompt chaining where output determines next prompt
  - **Quick check question:** In question tree DAG, if Node A fails, how does system ensure Node B (child of A) is not evaluated?

- **Concept: Supply Chain Risk Indicators (The 25 Features)**
  - **Why needed here:** Mechanism relies on domain-specific features like "High Risk Sourcing Country" or "Firm provided housing"
  - **Quick check question:** Why might "Firm provided housing" be Boolean indicator for forced labor, and how handle housing described as "generous benefit"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** ProQuest/LexisNexis API queries -> GPT-4 Question Tree Framework (Text -> Structured Features) -> 125 Incidents Knowledge Base -> SAT Solver / Boolean Enumeration Engine -> Interpretable Boolean Formulas

- **Critical path:** Question Tree Framework (Section 2.2) - if LLM misclassifies article relevance at root node, entire pipeline fails for that data point

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Interpretability vs. Complexity: Uses Boolean logic (highly interpretable) but risks oversimplifying complex abuses
  - Precision vs. Recall: "cut-off threshold" trades off missing subtle cases against processing irrelevant noise

- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Empty Feature Vectors": LLM extracts text but fails to map to 25 specific features
  - "Trivial Formulas": SAT solver returns tautologies or contradictions
  - "Semantic Drift": Automated method classifies "prison labor" differently than manual method

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Tree Ablation Study: Compare Question Tree vs. single "zero-shot" prompt against manual ground truth
  2. Threshold Sensitivity Analysis: Vary relevance score cut-off to plot ROC curve
  3. Feature Validation: Run Boolean enumeration on 125 manually extracted incidents to test if synthetic patterns hold

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can SAT-based Boolean formula enumeration effectively identify meaningful relationships between features in real-world data, similar to synthetic datasets?
  - **Basis:** Section 3 states interest in seeing if relationships from synthetic data are present in real data
  - **Why unresolved:** Method validated only on synthetic data; real dataset lacks non-instances required for algorithm
  - **What evidence would resolve:** Apply enumeration to 125 real incidents once non-instances generated, compare formulas to synthetic results

- **Open Question 2:** How can temporal logic (MLTL) be applied to detect illicit patterns like unusual delays between recruitment and work commencement?
  - **Basis:** Section 3 proposes expanding feature set to include temporal features and applying MLTL
  - **Why unresolved:** Current implementation uses purely Boolean formulas; temporal logic integration remains proposed future direction
  - **What evidence would resolve:** Functional implementation of SAT enumerator adapted for MLTL formulas applied to timestamped data

- **Open Question 3:** What is most effective method for generating "non-instances" of forced labor to serve as negative training data?
  - **Basis:** Section 2.3 highlights limitation that current dataset contains only instances, but algorithm requires non-instances
  - **Why unresolved:** Paper suggests using LLM to classify discarded articles but hasn't validated this approach
  - **What evidence would resolve:** Comparative study of methods (LLM filtering vs. random sampling) to create verified negative examples

## Limitations

- LLM accuracy in answering structured questions about complex supply chain text is critical but unproven
- SAT-based analysis validated only on synthetic data, transferability to real-world data uncertain
- Paper lacks quantitative results comparing automated extraction to manual ground truth

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Logical framework for neurosymbolic integration is sound and addresses documented problem of sparse data in illicit supply chains
- **Medium Confidence:** Question tree framework is reasonable but effectiveness depends on specific prompts not detailed in paper
- **Low Confidence:** Core claim that approach enables interpretable detection without large labeled datasets lacks empirical validation on real data

## Next Checks

1. **Manual vs. Automated Extraction Comparison:** Apply Question Tree framework to held-out articles and calculate precision, recall, F1-score for each of 25 features against manual ground truth

2. **Formula Validation on Real Data:** Run SAT-based Boolean enumeration on 125 manually labeled incidents, report which formulas are satisfiable and their frequency

3. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary relevance score cut-off (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 0.7) and plot trade-off between articles processed and estimated precision
