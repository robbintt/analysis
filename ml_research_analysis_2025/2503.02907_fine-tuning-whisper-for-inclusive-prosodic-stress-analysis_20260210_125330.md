- Near-human accuracy (90.2-88.7%) for prosodic stress recognition across three stress types

## Executive Summary
This study fine-tuned OpenAI's Whisper large-v2 ASR model to recognize phrasal, lexical, and contrastive stress in speech using a dataset of 66 native English speakers including neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals across genders. The all-stress fine-tuned model achieved near-human accuracy (90.2-88.7% across stress types) compared to human coders (91.9-91.6%), significantly outperforming single-stress models and RFCs. Additionally, Whisper successfully classified speakers by gender and neurotype from brief speech samples with near-perfect precision and moderate recall, correctly identifying 55.4% of cases. The bidirectional transfer effects between lexical and contrastive stress revealed shared acoustic patterns, while phrasal stress required multi-stress training due to its duration-based nature. These results demonstrate Whisper's potential for prosody-aware ASR that can adapt to diverse linguistic productions and contribute to more inclusive speech recognition technologies.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tuned Whisper large-v2 using 66 native English speakers (18 NT-M, 18 NT-F, 12 ASD-M, 18 ASD-F) who produced 16 minimal pairs for each of three stress types. Transcriptions were capitalized to mark stress positions (e.g., "BLACK cow" vs. "black COW"). A control model was first trained on one participant's data across all stress types to establish task-specific token formatting. Subsequently, fine-tuning was performed for single-stress and all-stress combinations using default hyperparameters for 5 epochs. Classification of speaker attributes (gender and neurotype) was implemented by adding a classification head to Whisper-C that outputs NT-M, NT-F, ASD-M, ASD-F, or UK classes. Five-fold cross-validation evaluated both stress recognition accuracy against human coders and classification precision/recall.

## Key Results
- All-stress model achieved near-human accuracy (90.2-88.7%) compared to human coders (91.9-91.6%)
- Single-stress models showed negative transfer (phrasal→contrastive: -7.7%; contrastive→phrasal: -11.4%)
- Speaker classification: 55.4% correct identification with near-perfect precision across NT-M, NT-F, ASD-M, ASD-F classes
- UK rejection class captured 42.6% of cases, maintaining high precision at the cost of recall

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Joint training on multiple stress types enables learning shared acoustic patterns that improve generalization over single-stress models. Lexical and contrastive stress share acoustic features (pitch, intensity contours), producing bidirectional transfer when trained together. Phrasal stress relies predominantly on duration, which conflicts with intensity-based stress patterns when trained in isolation—but multi-stress training resolves this by learning non-conflicting representations.

### Mechanism 2
Whisper's pre-trained encoder captures latent prosodic information extractable via lightweight fine-tuning with minimal labeled data. The control model (trained on one participant's data across stress types) provides task-specific token formatting knowledge, enabling subsequent stress-specific fine-tuning to leverage Whisper's existing acoustic representations. Capitalization in transcriptions (e.g., "BLACK cow" vs. "black COW") creates learnable token-level stress markers.

### Mechanism 3
Fine-tuned Whisper can classify speaker attributes (gender, neurotype) from short speech samples via acoustic biomarkers encoded in prosodic patterns. Whisper-C adds a classification head that maps encoder outputs to speaker attribute classes. An "unknown" class captures ambiguous inputs, maintaining high precision at the cost of recall. Brief samples (~1.7s) suffice because prosodic stress patterns encode speaker-specific acoustic signatures.

## Foundational Learning

- **Prosodic stress types and their acoustic correlates**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that phrasal stress (duration-based) differs from lexical/contrastive stress (intensity/pitch-based) explains why single-stress models fail to transfer and why multi-stress training succeeds.
  - Quick check question: If you observe degraded transfer from a duration-based stress model to an intensity-based stress task, what does this suggest about their acoustic feature overlap?

- **Fine-tuning vs. feature extraction transfer learning**
  - Why needed here: This study uses full fine-tuning (5 epochs, default hyperparameters) rather than frozen encoder features, allowing the model to adapt its acoustic representations to stress-specific patterns.
  - Quick check question: Why might freezing Whisper's encoder and only training a classification head fail for prosodic stress tasks?

- **Precision-recall tradeoff with rejection classes**
  - Why needed here: The "unknown" class mechanism achieves near-perfect precision by sacrificing recall, which is critical for applications where false positives are costly (e.g., clinical screening).
  - Quick check question: If you need to maximize sensitivity for ASD detection in a screening tool, how would you modify the classification threshold or rejection class strategy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio waveform → Whisper large-v2 encoder → Transformer decoder → Stress-annotated transcription → [Whisper-C variant] → Classification head → {NT-M, NT-F, ASD-M, ASD-F, UK}

- Critical path:
  1. Format transcriptions with capitalization for stress markers (e.g., "BLACK cow" vs. "black COW")
  2. Train control model on single participant to establish token-stress mapping
  3. Fine-tune on target stress types (joint training recommended)
  4. For classification: add classification head, map encoder outputs to speaker attribute classes

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single-stress vs. multi-stress training: Single-stress enables interpretability but shows negative transfer; multi-stress achieves near-human accuracy but obscures which features drive each stress type.
  - Precision vs. recall: UK rejection class yields near-perfect precision but misses ~43% of cases; removing UK would increase recall but introduce false positives.
  - Data requirements: 5-fold cross-validation with 66 speakers suggests moderate data efficiency, but class imbalance (ASD-M: 12 vs. 18 others) directly reduced performance for that class.

- Failure signatures:
  - Negative transfer between stress types (e.g., contrastive→phrasal: -11.4%) indicates conflicting acoustic patterns learned in isolation.
  - Low recall for minority classes (ASD-M at 26.0%) signals insufficient representation in training data.
  - High UK rate (>40%) suggests model uncertainty may be too conservative for deployment requiring comprehensive coverage.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation on control model initialization**: Compare stress recognition accuracy with vs. without control model pre-training to quantify the contribution of task-formatting knowledge.
  2. **Stress type pair-wise transfer matrix**: Train on each stress type individually and test on all others to map transfer relationships and identify which pairs share vs. conflict in acoustic patterns.
  3. **Classification threshold sweep**: Vary the confidence threshold for UK class assignment to generate precision-recall curves, determining optimal operating point for specific deployment contexts (e.g., clinical screening vs. demographic analysis).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can multi-stress training paradigms improve prosodic feature recognition in languages beyond English?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state their work "supports transcription of lesser-studied languages and dialects" but only tested on native English speakers from the mid-Atlantic U.S.
- Why unresolved: The study was limited to English, and prosodic patterns vary significantly across languages. Cross-linguistic transfer of fine-tuned prosodic models remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicate the multi-stress fine-tuning approach on datasets from typologically diverse languages (tonal, stress-timed, syllable-timed) and compare transfer patterns.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does class imbalance in neurodivergent populations affect model generalization at scale?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note: "We partly attribute the low precision and recall for ASD-M to there being 33.3% less data than other classes. This coincidental class imbalance is dramatically amplified in large-scale datasets used to train ASR models."
- Why unresolved: The ASD-M class underperformed (26.0% recall vs. 55.1-65.5% for other classes), but whether this stems from sample size or genuine acoustic distinctiveness remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments with balanced datasets across neurodivergent subgroups, plus analysis of whether acoustic features differ qualitatively between underrepresented and well-represented classes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What acoustic mechanisms explain the conflict between phrasal and contrastive stress patterns during single-stress training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Phrasal and contrastive stress models learn slightly conflicting acoustic patterns in isolation, worsening their transfer accuracy significantly, but in the all-stress model, new non-conflicting patterns are learned."
- Why unresolved: The paper documents the conflict but does not identify which specific acoustic features (pitch, duration, intensity) cause interference between these stress types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies isolating individual acoustic features during fine-tuning, combined with attention visualization to identify which model components process stress-specific information.

## Limitations

- Dataset accessibility: The 66-speaker corpus is not publicly available, preventing independent validation of results
- Clinical population scope: Limited to ASD speakers without validation on other neurodivergent conditions (dysarthria, aphasia, apraxia)
- Hyperparameter ambiguity: "Default hyperparameters" not specified, creating reproducibility challenges

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Near-human stress recognition accuracy (90.2-88.7% vs human 91.9-91.6%) and bidirectional transfer effects between lexical/contrastive stress
- **Medium confidence**: Whisper's ability to classify gender and neurotype from brief samples (55.4% correct) with precision-recall tradeoff well-documented
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to clinical populations beyond the studied ASD sample without empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset acquisition and reproduction**: Obtain the Knutsen and Stromswold corpus or create a comparable dataset with consistent stress annotation protocols to verify the 90%+ accuracy claims across all three stress types.

2. **Control model ablation study**: Train stress recognition models with and without the single-participant control model initialization to quantify the contribution of task-formatting knowledge to the observed performance gains.

3. **Clinical population expansion**: Test the stress recognition and classification models on speakers with diverse neurodivergent conditions (dysarthria, aphasia, apraxia) to validate claims of inclusivity beyond the ASD sample studied.
